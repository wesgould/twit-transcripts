[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   the latest hires and fires at Apple.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   And there's going to be a big one this week.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Joining us now to talk about the latest Apple news in studio
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   for the last time, because he's about to leave for Africa,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Ash Willing.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Ash Willing, yeah, we're going to see how this goes.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I'm supposed to fly out on Friday, I'm connecting through Frankfort.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Alex Lindsay of the PixelCore.tv for the podcast,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   PixelCore.com, for the great guild of multimedia artists,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   stay tuned to have a deal.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   That deal is still on for PixelCore.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Yes, it is.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   MBW. Okay.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   And it's $50 off.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   We're shooting, so--
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Or don't stay tuned, just keep listening.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Can I say?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Go ahead, do it.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   We're shooting with Marty Rosenberg next week.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Marty Rosenberg is the visual effects DP for stuff like Terminator 4.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Terminator 4, yeah, and Pirates of the Caribbean.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And so he's got tons of experience,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   so he's doing a small film, his own film.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And so you're going to kind of see what a big,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   somewhat of a ton of experience on big films does with,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   and they don't have a lot of money.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Need a.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And they figure it out.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And so we're going to be actually streaming-- for the members,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   we're going to be streaming stuff live from the set.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Marty may actually be available for some Q&A.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   We're going to be shooting tons of behind the scenes.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   And so there's going to be a lot of that stuff that we're kind of
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   opportunistically grabbing onto, whether it's our own productions
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   or other people's productions.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   So anyway, it's a good time to sign up.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Everything really starts going May 1st.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And as I said, it's normally $99.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   $50 off with MBW.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   That's for a year.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   It's for a year.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   It used to be $50 a month.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   That's what you do.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   A lot of people just wanted to find a more affordable way.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   They wanted to stay in contact.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And so we restructured it and figured out how to do something
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   that we could actually make work.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   That was more affordable.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And it's a great way to get kind of introduced to visual effects
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   in production.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   We're going to-- everything from podcasting to visual effects,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   to photography, to Photoshop.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And if you do any one of those things, we think you get your value.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Oh, I think that's true.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Good stuff.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   So with this Mr. Merlin Man from 43folders.com and the star
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   of the great You Look Nice Today podcast, how well, Muylan?
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Hardly the star.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   My gosh, I'm definitely lowest on the tour.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.500]   Hi, guys.
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.000]   I missed you.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   It's very nice to see you all.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   So good to have you back.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And a good day to come back.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Because boy, do we have some interesting stories to talk about today.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And actually, no one better to talk about it.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I think than Mr. Andy Anatko, journalist extraordinaire,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   and a man who has done quite a bit of legwork on this latest
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   furah.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   All I can say is that I have not managed to get kicked out of the industry
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   yet, although I try on a weekly basis.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   So let's start with this loss/stolen next generation iPhone.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And I guess the place to start is actually not Gizmodo, but in gadget
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   who had some blurry photos.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   That's where it began.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   It began there.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   It's basically this all started.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   No, first this all started when it looks very, very solid that the
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   an engineer at Apple lost an iPhone and don't know how he got it.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Don't know whether he was supposed to have it.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   That's immaterial.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   He was in a German Kaiser house bar, just like you would have seen in
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Hogan's Heroes as the boys were trying to escape.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   And just left it behind.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Somebody found it.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Let's put that word in quotes.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Now you're telling Gizmodo's story though.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Well, is it credible?
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Well, they're providing a lot of, they're really sticking their
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   necks up pretty far if they're claiming that this thing was, if
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   this thing was actually stolen and they're claiming that it wasn't.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Okay.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   There is fairly credible.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   They give a lot of detail.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   But the flip side of that is that they're giving no details about
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   the person who found this device.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   They are also giving slightly contradictory stories about how
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   they came to find out who actually originally owned the device
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   and their attempts to return it.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   But maybe we're getting ahead of things.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   That's why I wanted to start with the Gengadget which is there was
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   some pictures, some blurry pictures.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   So, well, some very good, very casual but very good pictures.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   The sort of thing where if you had your camera phone and you had
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   plenty of time to hold something in your hand and take a picture of it,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   a series of pictures of this phone from multiple angles that
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   appeared on Engadget.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Engadget was presented these photos not as evidence that they had
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   access to an actual pre-production, unannounced iPhone, but only
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   that, "Hey, look at these cool pictures we came across of a phone
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   that was found inside a bar in the San Francisco Bay area."
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   They themselves, again, were a little bit skeptical about it.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   They followed it up.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   This was April 17th just to give you this timeline.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   This was Saturday night.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Shortly thereafter, I guess one of their own people noticed that
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   they took another look at a photo of a prototype iPad that they posted
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   the day before the iPad was officially announced.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   So, again, it was a typical blurry, like, "We're going to get killed if
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   anyone sees me do this quick when we get a camera phone picture of this
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   bolted down iPad."
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Great.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Put it back in your pocket because it's very blurry.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   It's a very low quality picture.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   But someone noticed that in the upper corner of this blurry photo,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   there is a blurry object that looks a lot like that exact same iPhone.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   In the few hours between the first pictures and that second post,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   a lot of people had made the comment that, "Gee, I think this looks a lot like
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   an Asian knockoff iPhone."
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   You too.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Because you had one, right?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Well, I didn't have one exactly like this.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I'd seen -- there are a couple of different people had been posting pictures
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   of, "Hey, my dad works in Japan and he has a phone exactly like this,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   and here's a picture of it from a couple of different sides."
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   I posted something late at night after looking at it thinking that --
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   chiefly because this was a good opportunity to talk about knockoffs.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   It really did look like a knockoff phone.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   It looked like not a counterfeit.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I have a counterfeit iPhone that looks exactly like an iPhone 3GS,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   including the Apple logo on the back and the boilerplate on the back.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   As a matter of fact, if you put mine, I posted a photo on my blog that night.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   If you put mine right next to an iPhone 3GS, you would not know from the back which one was which.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   That, as a way of describing, well, you know, this supposed prototype iPhone,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   you pickle it to the back of it and does have the Apple logo,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   it does have all the FCC information on the back of it.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   That, as a way of illustrating that, that doesn't necessarily mean anything.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   It just means that it's a pretty good knockoff and nothing else.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   So that's where it sort of stood, where you could either believe that it was a prototype
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   or manufacturing sample or an engineering sample that somehow got off the ranch,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   or you could just not believe it, and that's kind of where it stood.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Then on Monday, oddly enough, Gizmodo had nothing to say about this.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   And usually, Gizmodo and Engadget are really in high competition with each other.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   If one of them breaks us to get something that the other one does not,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   the first thing that other competing site wants to do was have some sort of a comment about it.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   I think it's fairly important to underscore because that's really what prompts this whole thing
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   is is rush to be the first, rush to beat the other guy, right?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Yeah, and that's a feature of some of these sites because there is still a need for people
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   to get breaking news out there.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   The worry is that if you define your journalism by the fact that you got it up before anybody else,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   that kind of encourages you to cut corners or gives you the temptation, at least to cut corners.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Well, on Monday, Gizmodo came out with a full-blown hands-on.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   We have this, we have that sample iPhone in our hands right now.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   There are pictures of us with it.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   We have taken the part.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   It was the same one too.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   It was very clearly the same one.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   It was the exact same one taken apart.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   It had been remote disabled just like you can via mobile me.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   No one could get started, but they took it apart and identified all the parts inside as apple parts.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   That's where it went.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Now, the interesting thing though is that it has since come to light, I've been talking to a bunch of people.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   I also talked to the owner of Gizmodo, and he confirmed this, that whoever found this device offered it both to
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Engadget and Gizmodo.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   The editor-in-chief of Engadget talked to the Wall Street Journal today and said that
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   we were offered it, we were offered a price for it, we talked to our lawyers, and our lawyers said,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   "No way, don't come anywhere near this."
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   It is illegal in California to buy known stolen merchandise, right?
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Well, not only stolen merchandise, but lost merchandise.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Even then, even if it fell off the back of a truck.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Essentially, if it's not been established, the person who's selling this to you has the right to sell it to you,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   has title to this property.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   John Gruber, in his current most recent blog post, quotes California's lost property statute.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   One who finds, this is from the statutes, one who finds lost property under circumstances which give him knowledge
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   or means of inquiry as to the true owner, and who appropriates such property to his own use
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   or to the use of another person not untitled thereto without first making reasonable
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   and just efforts to find the owner and to restore the property to him is guilty of theft.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Yeah, and this is where Gizmodo had fully started to feel some of the heat after they posted that first piece.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Because later on on Monday, they posted two different follow-up pieces.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   One, because I posted a follow-up to my Saturday night post asking the question that, "Okay, where the hell did they get this from?"
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Because that's a very, very fishy story that, "Oh, well, this is, Apple security is legendary, of course,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   especially on announced products."
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   It seems beyond understanding that someone would have simply oops found this in a bar,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   that someone had it and someone actually lost it in a bar.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And so their claim later on, they buttressed this later on.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I'm betting to stave off inquiries by folks like me that, "Gee, is it possible that someone stole this off the Apple campus?"
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Gave you this story about finding it just to give themselves a small amount of cover
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   and you just simply believe what they wanted to believe.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   So they came out with this, another follow-up saying that, "Well, now we know exactly the Apple engineer who lost the phone,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   which was interesting in that it told us almost nothing of real value.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   It merely amplified the story that they told saying, "Well, here is the name of the person who lost it.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Here's photos of the person who lost it. We just took photos off the internet."
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Photos from the phone.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Right, no, no, no, no, not off the phone.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Off their Facebook profile.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   What they revealed, and this was something that I could not get Gizmodo's owner to talk about last night,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   is they made the statement that the person who found the phone had access to the working version of this
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   before was wiped long enough to notice that there was a Facebook app on there
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   and that the Facebook app was tied to this specific person.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Then Gizmodo gets their hands on it about a week ago, has had it for about a week.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Gizmodo told me last night that they couldn't find out who owned this phone until Monday afternoon.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   So they're not willing to talk about when they got the information about where this Facebook profile came from
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   because they're saying that that's how they found out who originally left that phone behind.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Again, they had not only pictures of the guy, but they also had all the Facebook status updates that he was making
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   from the phone, from the bar, saying, "Oh, wow, this is really tasty German beer."
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   That sort of stuff.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   So they really need to explain, if the original finder of this phone had this information,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   did the finder not give this information to Gizmodo?
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Did the Gizmodo have it, but they realized that once they know who this belongs to
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   and how to get it back to them, that sort of limits the freedom to take it apart and do what they want with it.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   There's a lot of questions they haven't answered yet.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   The last piece of the puzzle, the last piece they dropped after telling the story about how the phone got found
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   was that after they found the guy, they sent him an email, they called him.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   This was by the way, a month ago, March 18th that they claimed he lost this.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   They claimed they lost it on his birthday.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   On his birthday, yeah.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   They claimed that they've only had it for about a week or so.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   So the timeline's a little bit fuzzy, but they're not saying they've had it since the 18th.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   But the big deal is that they called the guy, actually printed a transcript of this short conversation with him
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   in which he says he sounds suitably nervous and mortified.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   He says, "Yeah, I forwarded the information that you just sent to the right guys, and hopefully they'll be in touch soon."
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   And then quickly after that, Apple sent them an email and a paper letter, I believe, saying that,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   "Hi, we understand that you have possession of Apple property.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   We would very much like that back.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   How do we arrange the handover of the device?"
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   And in the midst of this piece that they published, they said that, "Well, number one, this is our first absolutely solid confirmation
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   that this is indeed an Apple iPhone because we found all kinds of Apple stuff inside it,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   but Apple now is now claiming that this is their phone.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   They want it back and we're happily giving it back to them."
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   And then they also quote something peculiar.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   After the transcript of the conversation with a lawyer, they say, "And we're glad that we've done everything that we legally had to do
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   and that our hands are completely legally clean and we legally didn't do anything illegally."
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   And quoted something that their lawyer, the gizmodos lawyers had advised them.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   The section of the passage that apparently they wanted us to focus on was the bit in which they say that
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   they have to give it back to the rightful owner as soon as that person identifies themselves.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   But there's an earlier passage that they're quoting that says that their lawyer told them that,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   "Under a California law, the title to loss property does not transfer to the finder for some years after that thing has been found."
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   So it seems as though they're saying in front of millions of readers that they knew damn well under advice of attorney
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   that the person who sold them this iPhone did not have the right to sell it to them.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   And though whether it was stolen from the Apple campus, which I don't think it was,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   or whether it was legitimately lost, which is what I think happened,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   they simply knew going into this that they did not have the right to take this apart.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   They did not have the right to do anything other than send this right back to Apple,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   send this right back to the person that they knew lost it, or bring in law enforcement to say,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   "Hey, guess what? This guy just offered a sell us Hinky property for $5,000, which is the amount of money that gizmodo paid for the principal."
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Five thousand dollars.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Five thousand dollars. I asked them, I also asked them, did the finder name a price or did you offer it?
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   He said he didn't really, he didn't really know, but the direct quote is that if he didn't,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   if he didn't, if he didn't offer to sell it, we offered to buy it.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   So their intentions were always clear.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   He said the owner of Gawker is very much on record.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Nick Denton, you're talking about? Yeah.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   He's very much on record as saying that he believes in checkbook journalism,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   which is sometimes naughty, sometimes okay if you do it correctly.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   But he just basically believes that if information is for sale, he's got the checkbook open,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   he's willing to buy it.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Oh, newspapers routinely buy photos, for instance.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   But there's something about buying somebody else's property that's a little fishy.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Well, it's a complicated issue.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   The best example in defense of gizmodo paying money for this information was the Expenses scandal in the UK last year,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   where the Daily Telegraph paid some very, very substantial six-figure sum for hard drive containing
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   like a full terabyte of expense reports from basically every government official and MP.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   I'm sure as many people have pointed out that British law is very different in this regard.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Well, but there's, I consider there to be two different issues.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   There's what's legal and then there's what's right moral.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Sometimes when you'd want to do what's best for your readers, you have to say,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   I would prefer not to give this guy $5,000 for this device, but we have an obligation to our readers to,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   if we have access to this information and we believe that it's information that they could benefit from having,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   we will run this by our lawyers, but our inclination is going to be to do what's right for our readers.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   I'm not sure if I totally believe that.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   I think that their motivation was getting lots and lots and lots and lots of page clicks,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   but that's something that only Gawker couldn't explain.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   And that's the key to the backstory is that there is a very competitive field of gadget blog stuff.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   All right, we're going to take a break. That's the setup.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   There are several things to talk about.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Of greatest interest to our audience is the phone itself and Andy, you have some thoughts about that.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   I know some of you do as well and we're going to find out probably in June.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   So this isn't like urgent material.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   But secondly, the journalistic issues, the legal issues and boy, what a fufera this is.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   We are.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   It's really, I have to say, if nothing else, it's fascinating and fun to talk about.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   But we will talk more about that in just a second. Before we do that, I do want to mention a product that is brand new
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   from one of our sponsors.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   And I think you need to know about it's called Go to Training.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   And so no, I don't have a lower third to describe it.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   So you just have to those of you watching at home, imagine that below me, there is a link to go to training.com.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   That's where you could try this for free.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   You know the folks at Citrix do go to meeting, go to my PC.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   They do the great remote access for enterprise called Citrix.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   They really are, you know, go to assist, go to meetings and newest brand new.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   It's for training.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   I'm sorry, go to training.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Go to training.com.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   200 people could participate live.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   You could present any document or application just as you would with Go to Meeting.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   But you can also present the session yourself or include experts from other places in the world.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   There are feedback mechanisms from your attendees, including a polling feature, integrated chat, so that it can really be two-way integration.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   You can upload an entire library of materials should you choose ahead of time.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   This saves you a lot of money in terms of materials.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Integrated testing, which you've got to have if you're going to do training and reporting systems as well.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   You can give attendees evaluation forms for the session, view results.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   If you record the session, you can then make it on demand for later viewing.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   I mean, this is a fantastic e-learning tool.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   Of course it is.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   It's from the folks at Citrix.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Screen sharing, presenter control can be passed from one computer to another.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   There's voice over IP.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   There's chat.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   There's session recording.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   All the stuff you need to do training.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Now here's the chance to try it for free.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Up to 200 people, by the way.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   There's also a 20% discount if you purchase a 12-month plan.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   But I think the best thing to do is go to go to training.com.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   If you are an IT manager, you might want to bring up go to training at your next staff meeting.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   If you are a trainee and you've put yourself through some of these abysmal other solutions,
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   you might want to go to your trainer and say, "Hmm, you want to look at go to training?"
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   And if you are stuck in Europe, that's a good point.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   This is going to be great for Citrix, isn't it?
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Holy cow, I didn't even think of that.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   If you can't travel, go to training.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Does it travel for you?
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Go to training.com.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   We thank Citrix so much.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   They are such big supporters of this show.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   And we thank them for their support and encourage you to give them a try.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   If it's something that meets your needs, go to training.com.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   I don't know where we should begin.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   I don't know where the phone is.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.560]   I think that that's all of the storm and drong aside.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:21.280]   I think we can agree now, thanks to this letter from Apple, that that was a prototype of some
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.280]   kind.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.000]   You made a point, Andy, that it is not very polished.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   It doesn't look like it's screws on it.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   It's square.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.800]   There's something that I missed, or rather I missed, and I missed read from one of the
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.800]   earliest descriptions of how it was found.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:42.640]   A lot of people, one of the reasons why I didn't think it was necessarily an Apple product,
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.360]   I thought it might be a knockoff on Saturday night, was that it's not a very Apple looking
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.360]   thing.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:52.360]   It's a very flat slab of electronics with rounded edges and exposed, and a couple of screws
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.360]   you can actually get at.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.720]   You said it's the kind of thing you make if you want to make a cheap knockoff.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.360]   I was, yeah, I used that piece as a way to explain what knockoffs look like and why I
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.520]   thought this was knockoff.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.000]   You start to, the question that people answer when they design a knockoff is, how can I
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.320]   take this original and make it cheaper, build it more cheaply than this?
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.000]   And one of the things you do is cut down on the tooling.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.200]   But one detail from the story, how it was found.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.200]   Go ahead, Jason.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.360]   The video is going to play in the background.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:27.840]   One story about how it was found was that it was actually encased in a stock iPhone 3GS
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.920]   shell, so that when it was on the bar, it didn't look like this weird flat rounded off
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.680]   sandwich of electronics.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:39.720]   So my theory is, one possible theory is that this is by no means the final design, the
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.240]   consumer design of the phone.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.320]   It was designed to be flat, a little bit narrower and a little bit thinner so that it could fit
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:50.880]   into this special iPhone 3GS shell and be used in the open without attracting attention.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.880]   It's a testing prototype.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:57.280]   I mean, this guy, the engineer is the broadband engineer, a baseband engineer.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.480]   So he does the phone radio test.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:05.560]   So the bottom line is I don't think that we should make any assumptions that this is what
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.920]   the next iPhone is going to look like in any way.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.400]   It's possible that this is what it's going to look like, but it's possible that this
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.120]   was just, let's build a cheap case just so it can be carried around.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.880]   Also let's make it slightly smaller than an iPhone 3GS to make sure that we could hide
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.560]   it inside a standard iPhone 3GS shell and camouflage it effectively.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:28.080]   It would also explain why the volume buttons, for instance, instead of being a rocker switch,
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.280]   they're two very, very large circles, right?
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.160]   That would be exactly what you would do if you were going to be having little plastic
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:41.800]   like pusher switches on the outside that simply had to push in a little tab, simply
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.160]   made contact with a mechanical button side.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.000]   I'm not saying that's exactly what happened.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.640]   I'm saying that that's something that was definitely occurring to me as I'm looking at
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.640]   this.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.640]   That's sad.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.640]   I think it looks really cool.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.640]   Really?
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.640]   You'd want this?
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.640]   I like it.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.640]   I don't like it.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.640]   I like it.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.800]   Merlin, what do you think?
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.800]   Which part?
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.800]   I know.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.800]   I picked any part.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.800]   I picked any part.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   Well, so what you're talking about right now?
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.800]   Let's talk about the phone.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.680]   I mean, one thing that frustrates me a little bit about the current iPhone, I've got these
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.680]   like a lot of nerds.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:22.840]   I've got these edimotics with a pretty good microphone and a little in-ear buds and I
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.840]   love them to death.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.400]   There's times where it's windy and you've got to grab the phone, you're walking around.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.280]   For whatever reason, you've got to do that thing where you stick it under your chin a
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.280]   little bit.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.280]   I do that all the time.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.280]   I don't know.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:41.080]   Sometimes when I handle my, especially the 3GS, it feels a little bit hard to kind of
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.080]   hold.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.080]   Slippery.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.360]   I'm not necessarily saying this would make a huge difference, but in addition to agreeing
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.200]   with the people who say it does look very Deeter Rams in terms of the design, which
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.160]   is a huge influence on Apple's design.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.320]   If you go look at, you know, there's plots, photos out of stuff Deeter Rams was making.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.320]   Is he Bauhaus?
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.320]   Is this Bauhaus?
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.320]   He's the guy who designed, he worked at Braun, I believe.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.320]   Of Braun, it is.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.680]   It looks like a Braun Shaver, you're right.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.080]   He's in that Gary Puss with movie.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.080]   Objectify.
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.080]   Objectify.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.680]   Anyway, he's, you know, he's probably, I think I'm not sure if he did the calculator
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.680]   that Apple ripped off.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.800]   But anyway, he's a fantastic designer.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.960]   And looking at that, I have to say, like that looks more, for lack of a better word,
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.960]   industrial.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.440]   It looks more like an appliance that I would feel good putting under my chin while I'm
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:31.920]   wearing a jacket and it bite right into that chin and really give you a good, a giant chin
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:32.920]   among.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.920]   But yeah, I don't know.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.920]   I mean, I don't follow the, what's his name, Yoni?
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.320]   I was, I don't follow that stuff that carefully.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.320]   Yoni.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.320]   I can say that his name, Yoni.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.320]   Johnny.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.320]   I think you can say Johnny.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.320]   I thought, oh, you say Johnny.
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.320]   Does he say Yoni?
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.320]   I don't know.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.320]   Andy, what do you say?
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.320]   I think it's Johnny.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:55.320]   It looks like he's, you know, or I've never had, I've never had the pleasure.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.320]   He's British.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.320]   He seems like he's punch a guy.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.320]   Do you say if you call him Yoni?
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.320]   Yeah, that's no good.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.320]   That's not like a yoga.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.320]   Yoga when you ask.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.320]   It does.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.320]   It's like lingum.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.320]   Lingum.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.320]   Yeah, lingum vibes.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.320]   It's just too Yoni.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.320]   It's like a tantric.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.160]   But it, but it does look more holdable.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.800]   I mean, you know, I just, there's a part of me that like, God, you can't really dignify
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.640]   Nick, Nick, Nick, but, but if you, it gives him the appearance of dignity to even talk
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.920]   about this where in law, they call it, you know, fruit of the poison tree.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:28.000]   I, I'm reluctant to even talk about anything except what a tool he is and the way he's handled
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   this.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.440]   But I know he likes that, you know, he's like, he doesn't mind.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.640]   He got the, he got the place to kid at the playground.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.680]   He starts out in boogers for a nickel, but pretty soon he just likes the attention so
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.240]   much he doesn't for free.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.680]   But he's a good man.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.960]   And I could see it going either way.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.960]   I agree.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.880]   The course is unlike Washington.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.560]   The curviness is starting to look just the tiniest bit dated.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.800]   And I think I'm, I'm, I don't have an opinion why we're another.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:55.800]   I have no way of knowing.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:00.240]   But as I look at that, I could see that very much becoming the design for other stuff,
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.800]   not least because if anybody's ever had to pack a car, knows why you use boxes instead
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.800]   of barrels.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.800]   Square edges fit more stuff.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.600]   You fit better into the Chinese containers.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.440]   Well, and also I, I think that it looks closer to the iPad.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.440]   That's true.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:18.320]   I mean, if you look at the two of them next to each other, the, the, the current iPhone
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.640]   and the iPad are two different worlds.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.680]   This one definitely looks like it's part of the iPad world and less part of the, you
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.480]   know, the old, the old iPhone look.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.600]   So I think Apple got wise some time ago to the Detroit notion that the best way to get
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.280]   people to buy new gear is to make the old gear look out of date.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.280]   Right.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:40.040]   So they started it with, I think, OS 10 where they, they just.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.040]   I think the I'm.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.440]   I'm actually a good example.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.720]   Or for that matter, CX is FX is like pretty soon that thing that used to be so cool.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.360]   Cause it remember the original manual for the Mac.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:53.400]   They would show it like in somebody's handlebars on their bike or it's, you know, I remember
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.400]   here.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.080]   Oh, it's the first computer that will fit under the seat in front of you on a plane.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.200]   But no, I think that's a very big part of what they do.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:04.400]   They know people buy on that design and, you know, for the folks who do, I, I don't
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.400]   know.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.120]   I mean, the description, I guess I'm going to say almost everything I know came from
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:12.400]   Gruber and especially Andy, but I agree that that looks a lot more substantial.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.920]   In some ways, the thing is, I mean, for the, for the great distance that Gizmodo stuck,
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.160]   stuck out their necks, they've really came through with practically nothing because
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:26.240]   they're because they're, well, because they have a case, all they do, they have, they have
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.120]   pictures of a case that may or may not have any relevance to an actual final shipping
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.120]   product.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.720]   So I don't want to, I'm not even going to talk about whether that's a good design or
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.720]   not.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:40.240]   It disassembly of this phone revealed a lot of things that everyone pretty much assume
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.880]   we're going to be on the new on the next life of anyway.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.120]   What do we, what's in there?
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.040]   So they, so they found a front facing camera.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:53.840]   Oh, they found a rear facing camera that was higher with a better camera and also had
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.200]   an assisted LED illuminator on it.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.200]   Good.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.000]   A larger, a larger battery.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   Good.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.560]   Although perhaps the larger battery isn't so much to, wouldn't perhaps isn't there to
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:08.920]   extend airtime so much as to power a much higher definition screen.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:12.040]   It had been dumped remotely.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.520]   So all that would happen when was charged up is that you get the standard please connect
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.520]   to iTunes screen.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:20.280]   But Gizmodo was reporting that that screen was much, much, much higher resolution.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.280]   Am I right?
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:25.400]   I don't know, probably not Am I, I, I, I, I, I, I, you're not even going to conduct
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.160]   your love that CNO lead screen.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:31.080]   But they didn't, but there was nothing, it wasn't the bombshell that anybody would
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.080]   have hoped for.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:36.520]   It was the things that you had expected to find in the, in the phone that we all know
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:40.480]   is going to be released sometime in one of the J-months, they did find on this prototype.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:45.680]   That's not, it's not like that's not without value, but really that's of such low value
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.680]   that-
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.680]   Yeah, this is, this is, this is the value.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.680]   They got a lot of play.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.680]   It doesn't matter.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.680]   It doesn't matter whether it is.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.680]   Any value at all.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.680]   I'm talking about value to readers.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.680]   Right.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.280]   What's your raisin, what's your raisin d'etra as a gadget blog?
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.080]   If that's the kind of thing you want to do, if that's your, if that's going to be your
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.440]   mission in life to have a gadget blog, like what's the most valuable thing you do?
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:06.880]   Well, if you do it really, really well, you help people understand how to make a smart
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:07.880]   buying decision.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.240]   And if you're really, really good at it, and you're Joel Johnson, who's exquisitely good
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:15.440]   at this, he's really good at something I just could care less about, which is like, blah,
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.280]   blah, something, something, new junk.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:21.040]   And he does it really, really well, because he shows you in a clay, shorty, like, way,
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.480]   I don't know why I've been talking so much about Clay, but this, like, here's where the
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.720]   future is going with this stuff.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.720]   And he's great at that.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.720]   Okay.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:27.720]   So what do we have?
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.720]   Who does Joel Johnson write for?
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.720]   For his motto.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.720]   Okay.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.520]   So I'm going to go ahead and do this, because he couldn't meet his quota.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.680]   But I'm going to stand by my two, which is like Nick Denton wanted to build traffic
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.600]   for a gadget blog by buying a stolen phone that doesn't work.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.600]   That is the story.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.560]   He has a stolen phone that doesn't work.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.800]   And that is what the attention.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.040]   So is that really the business you want to be in?
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.760]   Is this what you want to do for a living?
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.160]   Because like right now that's a valuag story.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.840]   That's a crappy valuag, valuag story.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.360]   Except, except he's Gawker.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.600]   He's the CEO of Gawker that he runs Gatlin Valley way.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.600]   Well, also maybe.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.600]   Yeah, he is.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.920]   But I think, but even if, even if, just because Nick wants to set a standard that's low enough
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.240]   for him to fit under, doesn't mean it's something that I want to acknowledge as being okay.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:06.120]   And I think part of the reason the web is starting to suck so hard is because we go,
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.120]   "Oh, it's Nick Denton."
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.120]   Right.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.480]   Well, you know, the guy's using a lot of his money and power to do a lot of really,
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:14.720]   really crappy and sad stuff that makes all of us look like we live in a bad neighborhood.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.800]   And I think it's not fancy to stand up and say, "That's not cool."
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.880]   Well, it's, he spent, I mean, my problem.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.560]   I mean, of course I was fascinated by the photos and looked at them and everything else.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:28.740]   And then it sunk in very quickly that Gizmodo spent $5,000 and took a kid who's $27,000
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:33.140]   and was $26,000, who may or may not have accidentally left something in a bar at his
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.460]   birthday party.
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.460]   And they destroyed his career.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.460]   Why do they publish his names?
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.460]   Because I don't know if they do all of that.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:39.460]   That's a good question.
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:40.460]   Well, it doesn't matter.
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:41.460]   Apple would know who it is.
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.460]   I mean, I can tell you why.
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:43.460]   I mean, I can tell you why.
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:47.580]   First of all, it gives them more of exactly what, it's what they've done on at least a
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:51.200]   couple of occasions that I'm aware of, which is that something comes up that sounds really
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.360]   fishy.
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:56.620]   They trickle little details to keep the interest up and to get a string of posts.
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.620]   It happened on a weekend.
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:58.620]   You had to find a way.
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:00.100]   There's no traffic on a Saturday.
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.100]   Not compared to a Monday.
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.780]   Everybody knows Monday is the biggest traffic day and it goes downhill again until the next
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:04.780]   Monday.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:05.780]   Everybody knows that.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.140]   So they had to make a big Monday story.
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:12.300]   And by, I'll tell you exactly who I blame in the last instance for this, which is Gizmodo's
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:16.500]   readers, the people who eat this stuff with a giant spoon, because that's exactly who
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:22.300]   they're serving by doing this kind of personal attack story against this guy and holding him
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:27.220]   out to ridicule in this really, and I mean, so much of what they said here is so condescending.
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:31.540]   This Jason Chin guy writing this letter about giving Apple advice on how they should treat
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:35.620]   this guy as he acknowledges that this was a stolen phone they bought.
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:39.380]   Well, the thing is that is that as I don't know, and I don't know whether they really
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:43.100]   thought about this, I mean, I can only imagine that they didn't care.
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:46.300]   But I mean, I don't know what you have to sign when you work at Apple, but I can tell
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:50.660]   you that what you have to sign when I worked at Lucasfilm, it was aggressive.
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:54.580]   I mean, it wasn't just that I'd lose my job if something fell out about Star Wars.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:59.660]   It was like they will take legal action on what they think that they lost as a result
[00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:00.660]   of the leak.
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:01.660]   You have liability.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:07.540]   I mean, that was the, you know, and the thing is is that, you know, that that kind of, you
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.700]   know, it's, you know, that's what you do when you work at somewhere with that secret.
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.540]   I mean, that's in commercial secret.
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:14.460]   You get government secret and he's like, you'll disappear.
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:22.340]   So, so the, but the, the point is is that Apple is really, you know, I can only imagine
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.940]   what he signed and I don't know whether Apple's going to go down that path.
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.180]   But the point is, is that it is a, it is a big deal.
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:31.220]   And the fact that they paid money and they, and they create an environment that has people,
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:34.980]   that if they didn't steal this one, people will try to steal the next one, you know,
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.020]   and then the thing is, is they're creating an environment of this and I, and I do think
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:42.100]   it's seriously uncool, you know, to, to go down this path.
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.220]   And I, and I, you know, I hope Apple goes after him.
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:48.340]   I hope that, you know, if it's criminal, I hope that they press charges.
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.900]   I hope Apple, I mean, the thing is, is that if it turns out to be illegal, I think Apple
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:56.220]   can do a lot of damage and at least can keep, they'll keep Gizmodo's lawyers busy for a
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:57.220]   long time.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.500]   And he'll keep their readers hanging on the edge.
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.500]   Yeah.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.820]   This is how a tabloid works.
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:05.340]   Nick comes from Britain and he comes from a tabloid background and I don't know what anybody
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.540]   ever did to him to make him the way he is.
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:11.460]   But he seems perfectly satisfied that as long as his name gets spelled right, he's winning.
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:15.300]   So I mean, we're, we're serving his own sad interests by talking about this because it's
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.380]   an important thing we need to talk about.
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:22.060]   But there's a whole tone to Gawker and gocker prime, gocker.com, which I think is a, is a
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:26.220]   wholly improved better property than almost all the other ones put together.
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:30.060]   They do a certain kind of snarkiness better than almost anybody, but there's a kind of
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:38.260]   reflexive, ironic distance that is very well received by their readership that is becoming
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:41.460]   endemic to the way we think about any serious issue on the web.
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:45.740]   And you get treated like some kind of fancy jerk because you want to talk seriously about
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.420]   how adults should behave.
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.660]   And I think at a certain point, you know, we need to stop excusing that and acting like
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.980]   this is a 12 year old boy.
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.500]   This is a grown man who hires people to harm other people.
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:34:02.220]   To me, to me, the only full stop, no justification, no possible defense act that they did was
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:06.820]   being so explicit and so specific about outing this engineer.
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:11.620]   It's enough to, I could understand their desire to be defensive and say there are a lot of
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:14.980]   people who seem to be thinking that we knew this was stolen property or that we knew that
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:18.740]   someone stole this off the Apple campus or even that we bankrolled the theft of this
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:19.740]   device.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:23.540]   We need to establish that the story that we gave, that this was lost carelessly inside
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:27.460]   a bar and then whoever found it brought it to us, we need to underscore that by furnishing
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.620]   the guy who actually lost it.
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:33.100]   You can do that without saying here is his picture, here is Facebook status.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.460]   Here's a link to his Flickr page.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:39.260]   By all means, dog pile on this guy because, you know, that's because isn't dog piling
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.260]   fun.
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.300]   I mean, I just, the guy, it matters to their readers though, Andy.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:49.580]   I mean, I see them knowing their readers so well that they can feed them exactly the spoonful
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:54.540]   of dog crap that they're willing to eat every day, 12 times or however often they.
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.980]   I'm not, I'm not, I don't want to conjecture about what the readers like.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:57.980]   Do you understand what I mean?
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:01.860]   No, I mean, I don't think you feel like I'm saying that I could name any cable channel
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:05.340]   that has lots of programming that I really, really like and I think is really, really
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:06.380]   well done.
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:10.020]   That doesn't mean that I approve of everything they do and every piece that they do.
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:15.820]   So I wouldn't, I personally don't want to lump all of Gawker's audience into one.
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:21.060]   When I dog pile of people who would love to see that picture and didn't go, oh, that
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.300]   was a bad thing for Gawker to have done when they saw that updated post.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.580]   Didn't we all have that reaction?
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:27.580]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:32.740]   I think I mean, the thing is, is that they, they repeatedly had opportunities to do the
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:36.140]   right thing and they repeatedly decided not to.
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:39.540]   I mean, this isn't like they made one little like, oops, you know, oh, you know, we didn't
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.540]   think about that.
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:41.900]   We didn't think all that all the way out.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:45.100]   It over and over and over again, they had an opportunity to do the right thing and they
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.140]   and repeatedly did, they did the wrong thing.
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:48.140]   Yeah.
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:52.620]   Well, see, the thing is though, the right thing to do can be something that you can choose
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.660]   for yourself and defend that choice.
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:36:00.220]   The, where the BS comes in is when they get really, really coy and really, really cute
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:03.860]   about saying, giving one version of the story and then when that's not playing quite so
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:07.620]   well, or when you, when you need to goose things up a little bit, get presenting another
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:13.700]   side of the side, another perspective on the story because this person that quote, found
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:17.900]   and quote this iPhone and of course tried really, really hard to return it to the gut
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:22.940]   to find some guy at the bar that belonged to, but like on Don Quixote, he just, you know,
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:23.940]   try to do the right thing.
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:27.860]   But, gosh darn it, he just failed in that quest.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:33.140]   You know, it's, they, they really need to, that a lot of secrets are with that person,
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.300]   because he's the guy who found it.
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:38.620]   He's the guy who, in Silicon Valley, it's not, it's not real, it's not ridiculous to
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:42.740]   think that someone, someone said, hey, this is a, this is not a real, this is not an iPhone
[00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.060]   anybody has seen before.
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.060]   This is a very real iPhone.
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.420]   It's not even a knock off.
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:48.420]   This is very, very valuable.
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:50.420]   I just got beer money for the next five years.
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.140]   Well, what the thing is, is that they're with it.
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:56.340]   So, I mean, so you really have to evaluate what that guy was out for, what their knowledge
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.500]   was and what the proper relationship was going to be.
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:00.500]   So, right.
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.500]   I'm with you.
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.500]   I have to say I'm with you Merlin.
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:07.940]   It's a shameful thing and it's something that maybe we should, as a, as a group, censure
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:13.060]   and call attention to because maybe if we stand up, it won't happen as much.
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.060]   I mean, it's just really, it's just-
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.460]   Well, I mean, there's all kinds of angles to this that are interesting.
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:20.580]   If we, if we get past the idea that my, my hang up on this is that I'm reluctant to talk
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:22.860]   about it just because it's exactly why he did what he did.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.300]   Yeah, we have to though, don't we?
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.860]   It's, it's use an old term.
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:26.860]   It's a publicity stunt.
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:27.860]   Right.
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.860]   Here's, here's the thing.
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:32.460]   And to Andy's point, you know, if you're, if you are a journalist, and I mean, even you
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:36.460]   are using this in the same sentence as a journalist to me is just, you know, it's asinine.
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:38.740]   You look at something like what, what kind of work John Gruber does.
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:39.740]   That's journalism.
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.900]   That's a guy who goes out and gets his facts straight.
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.980]   And if you were a journalist, you would, you know, go watch all the President's men.
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:49.780]   Every day they went to press with what everything-
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:50.780]   They agonized.
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.860]   Well, with whatever they could prove that day.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.860]   Right.
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:54.860]   Okay.
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:55.860]   But here's what they didn't do.
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:59.260]   They didn't find out everything that they knew for the next six months and one day and
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.460]   then trickle it in order to keep subscriptions up.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.300]   Right.
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.300]   And so, you know, it's really crappy.
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.300]   Right.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.860]   And to Andy's point, I mean, I stand by what I said, which is they understand their audience
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:11.380]   well enough to know that none of most of these folks, I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.380]   I'm sorry if I'm impugning people, you know, move on.
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:18.740]   You know, if, if, if you really had a problem with this, you wouldn't be sitting there building
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:20.660]   these, these 800 comment threads.
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:24.300]   Sure some people are against it, but it's triple pages for every comment.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.500]   Well, you know, so if you, if you do trickle this though, here's all I'm going to say.
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.780]   You may know exactly how this ends.
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.580]   It's just you're not going to tell anybody because you don't have a reason to.
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:36.220]   And it benefits you to trickle this and to go, Oh, you know, tune in next week to find
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.940]   out if Tonto makes it off the cliff.
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:42.220]   Well, and the other thing is is when, when that English, I can't think of the English
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:46.100]   guy who makes fun of bloggers and everything, you know, the, the journalist.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:51.940]   Charlie, no, no, Andrew Keen, Andrew Keen, when Andrew Keen talks about why this isn't
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:55.220]   really journalism, what he's talking about is what we're looking at right here.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.220]   Yeah.
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:00.820]   You know, this is why he, he, you know, says that this isn't, this isn't really journalism,
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:02.100]   you know, it's not any better.
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:06.220]   You know, it's, and, and we have the opportunity to be journalism journalist and we have the
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:07.380]   opportunity to do that.
[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:12.780]   And Gizmodo undermines that when they do stuff like this, you know, one more thing.
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:18.020]   I'll just throw this in that John Gruber points out in his blog.
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:22.820]   The jokey tone of Brian Lam's post reporting the letter from Apple and the focus on the
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:26.900]   quote, see, we're giving it back angle distracts from the most interesting aspect.
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.940]   John is very good at picking these little subtleties up.
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:36.100]   Some quotes his own response to Sewell, the Apple counsel, wherein he writes, quote, happy
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:40.380]   to have you pick this thing up was burning a hole in our pockets.
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:46.660]   Just so you know, we didn't know this was stolen when we bought it.
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:47.660]   Right.
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.860]   Stolen, not lost his words stolen.
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:55.660]   And he in his, in the blog post, I don't know if it's Jenner or lamb is saying, you
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:01.940]   know, this whole, I don't know if it's fabricated story about the bar, but he said stolen.
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:07.020]   Well, the thing is, is that how, how could you find a, I mean, this is the thing that,
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:12.940]   that a judge is going to look at is, how could you find something that you know is secret
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:15.980]   and assume that it wasn't?
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.420]   I would assume stolen.
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:24.660]   And the minute you offer $5,000 or pay $5,000 for it, you, you, as you said, the smell of
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.380]   self is in the air.
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:27.380]   All right.
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.980]   Well, you know, I mean, I can't, I just say just one tiny thing about it.
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:32.700]   I don't want to sound like I'm just trying to piss from the high ground about this.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:36.140]   Everybody's fine to make any decision that they want in life and live with it.
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:40.500]   But to Andy's point, yes, first of all, I think when you, when you do things that when
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:45.980]   constantly placed next to each other are not congruous, I mean, and, and when you are in
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:49.740]   a position of power, I mean, I'm making a case that's really far more flimsy from a
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:53.620]   logical and legal standpoint, which is just that they're not doing the right thing.
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:57.340]   And that, and that as somebody who cares a lot about what, you know, is going to happen
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:01.140]   on the web over the next 10 years, I mean, that's a hit for everybody.
[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:04.020]   It's, you know, I, you know, I think there, I think there is a case to be made for saying
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.300]   this would not have been as much of a story if this was an Android phone that wasn't
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:08.300]   released.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:12.380]   I think it feels like a big, it's a story of the little guy getting back because Apple
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:14.220]   is so secretive and boy, didn't we show them?
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:17.980]   I mean, personally, you know, whatever, I get that, that's, I get that angle.
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:21.940]   I'm taking a much more, I think subtle and hard to prove case, which is just, I think
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:25.900]   it sucks when people act like jerks and then try and make a bunch of money off it.
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:26.900]   I think it's lame.
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:31.420]   And I think if we don't call it out as lame, we, we kind of tacitly say that like, it's
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:37.140]   okay for him to set that example for personal publishers everywhere.
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:40.020]   And I got to say there, there would have been, you know, for the person who found it, all
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.820]   I got to say, if you're listening to this is there would have been some serious good
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:46.820]   Apple karma if you would just, if you had brought that back to Cupertino, probably what
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.100]   I got in the talk to Steve.
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.580]   And this is, this isn't the Pentagon papers.
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:54.740]   This isn't some revelation that changes the world that it came out that ends the war.
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:55.740]   This is just a phone.
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.420]   It's going to be out in a couple of months anyway.
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.420]   Right.
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:41:59.420]   At best.
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.780]   But if it was your wallet with your kids pictures in it and somebody went out there and talked
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:06.340]   about how stupid you were to like leave it in a bar, it'd be boned.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:09.780]   Well, I have to feel, we have not said the name of the guy.
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:12.540]   Of course, Apple would know who it is, whether it's this guy or not.
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:13.540]   I don't know.
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.660]   I'm not going to mention the guy's name.
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:18.620]   And I think we should just, I feel for him.
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:19.620]   I really do.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:24.620]   Uh, whether whatever your consequences are and who knows if he even is real.
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.100]   We don't even know.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:33.620]   I just got a, I just got an image of the YouTube video that someone's probably going to make
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:39.180]   of just the, that, that picture of the engineer, like from his Facebook with a beer, black,
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.060]   Mandarin black and white, slow pull in.
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:45.260]   And then Earl Woods's voice over the question is, did you learn anything?
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:49.900]   I tried to think about what you did.
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:50.900]   Okay.
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:53.900]   Somebody's going to make that YouTube video before this show is over, I think.
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:57.980]   I was thinking more of a rest of development and that's why you don't leave your phone
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:58.980]   in a bar.
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:04.980]   I mean, if this happened in 1988, this would be a Pauli Shor movie.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.980]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:06.980]   Yeah.
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:10.140]   And I did, somebody pointed out that I did tweet his name and I did when that article
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:13.700]   broke, I said, here's the guy you don't want to be.
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:17.500]   I shouldn't have tweeted his name and I apologize, although linking back to the article is pretty
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.260]   much the same thing.
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:24.220]   So at the time, I was just like stunned and it was only later I realized, boy, I don't,
[00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:27.820]   I don't, I feel bad about this guy.
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:31.580]   One more thing that's worth bringing up on this, then we'll move on to other important
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:32.860]   stories.
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:37.180]   I was surprised the number of people on Twitter and elsewhere who said, oh, this is an apple
[00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:39.180]   publicity stunt.
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:41.060]   Any credibility to that at all?
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.300]   I don't think so.
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.740]   I think they need the publicity.
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:45.740]   They need the buzz.
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:46.740]   Exactly.
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:47.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.140]   I mean, also the apples big thing, and there are lots of stories that I can't tell about
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:57.300]   this, but they just, they are so obsessed about maintaining control over publicity and maintaining
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:03.100]   control over the story before it's released into the general public.
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:06.260]   Once things ship into consumers' hands, they realize it's out of their hands.
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:11.140]   But before that day approaches, they want to make sure that they absolutely control
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:14.340]   everything they're going to, they're going to try to maintain control over every part
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.180]   of the story they possibly can.
[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:21.820]   So the idea of them simply putting a phone like this out in the field and being okay
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:24.980]   with knowing that this is likely going to fall into the hands of somebody who's going
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:27.860]   to take it apart and do all kinds of speculation about it.
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:28.860]   Yeah.
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:33.140]   And not only that, but review it based on the, based on the shape of the USB connector as
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:37.180]   graphically represented on that screen, we took, we took the prototype iPhone out into
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:40.580]   the bright sun next to the Google Nexus one and we found that the colors are much more
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:43.300]   sharper on the Nexus one than on this one.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.500]   Apple seems to have its first loser on its hands.
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.500]   Right.
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.500]   You wouldn't do that.
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:50.820]   And also, Andy, back me up on this, but I mean, in my experience, I've got a few friends
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:52.140]   that work at Apple.
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:57.300]   And while I wouldn't describe them as raving paranoia, I will say that it's not even a
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.300]   question.
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:01.700]   I mean, the one way in which that place is Orwellian without any question is there's,
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.420]   there's not even any need to say, go be careful.
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:09.620]   A, they have stuff in place at every turn that would boggle your mind in terms of they've
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:12.780]   got some area 51 areas that you don't even know are there.
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:15.980]   But also, I mean, I'm curious to see if you guys agree based on what you know.
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:19.140]   I mean, nobody there knows anything that they don't need to know that day.
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:20.140]   And they're not even interested.
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:21.140]   The thing is what's fascinating.
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.140]   What's fascinating.
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.140]   The culture.
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:24.140]   Because you want plausible deniability.
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.140]   Right.
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.860]   Does get out because there are canary traps as, as, as Andy has pointed out.
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:31.060]   And they will find out who leaked what and, and you don't know, I guess what I'm getting
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:32.060]   at is this.
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:37.980]   You don't have to say that at Apple and be knowing that they have a public image for
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:38.980]   that.
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:42.380]   I'd say the thing that they would be least likely to do is try and minimize that sense
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:47.980]   of self censoring fear by leaking something that gave them absolutely nothing but a feeling
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:48.980]   of powerlessness.
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:49.980]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:50.980]   Okay.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:51.980]   We're going to move on.
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:52.980]   There's other stuff.
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:53.980]   Cool phone.
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:54.980]   Cool phone.
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:55.980]   Yeah.
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:56.980]   Other stuff.
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:01.420]   And, and, and I think everybody agrees that we will find out what the, what the actual next
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:02.820]   generation iPhone is.
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:04.500]   As you said, Andy, in the Jay months.
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:05.500]   And then we'll buy it.
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:06.500]   And then we'll buy it.
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:10.100]   I have been reminded that January is a month that starts with Jay.
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:13.460]   Although backpedal and say that January is the time when they sneak preview stuff that's
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:16.900]   going to be shooting, shipping in July and June.
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:21.220]   So it's, it's been, has it not been June every year for three years?
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:22.220]   Is it not?
[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.220]   I think it has.
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.220]   Yeah.
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:25.220]   I would be surprised if it's not June again.
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.220]   Yeah.
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:33.180]   I think it's going to be to kind of back that up iPhone four beta two just came out today.
[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:37.900]   So they're, I think they're moving in a fairly rapid clip, right?
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.260]   Toward release.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:47.260]   Apple just posted a new version of the OS four firmware for the iPhone and iPod touch.
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:55.940]   And according to app advice, the apple iPhone apps.com, former Apple iPhone apps.com until
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:57.700]   the lawyers got ahold of it.
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:01.340]   App advice.com says the most interesting update I can see for now is an extended time
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:05.860]   limit for app multitasking and beta one, a closed app could ask for five extra minutes
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.940]   to complete its task.
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:15.460]   Now you can ask for 10 minutes before you get frozen.
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:17.900]   All right, taking a break coming back.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:23.100]   We're going to talk about there are that we do have a date now for the iPad two dates
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:25.620]   for the iPad three G. I'll give you those in a second.
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:29.380]   But before we do that, I do want to mention the robo.
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:35.220]   That sounds like a drum roll when I say the robo, the new Drobo FS, the Drobo elite, the
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:38.300]   Drobo S, the original Drobo.
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:41.380]   We've got deals on them all at the big Drobo store.
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:46.140]   Just go to Drobo.com slash Mac break.
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:55.300]   D R O B O dot com slash Mac break for 75 to $500 off the new Drobo record.
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.220]   What's the Drobo record?
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:03.060]   I was actually the first person in the world to buy with my own money, the Drobo S.
[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:04.460]   The brand new one.
[00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:05.460]   Not the brand new one.
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:06.460]   The one that.
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:07.460]   Oh, you got the Drobo S with five base.
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:08.940]   Yeah, with the five days.
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:10.340]   I literally bought it that morning.
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:12.220]   I needed it.
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.140]   I needed something to deliver.
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:17.700]   We actually deliver content to our one of our clients in a Drobo.
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.260]   Like it's a lot of content.
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:21.140]   And so we just that's a good idea.
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:22.140]   Well, they asked me.
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:24.180]   Do they send you the enclosure back and keep the hard drives?
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:25.740]   No, no, they keep the they keep the problem.
[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:26.740]   That's part of the.
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:30.100]   It's a good it's a big project.
[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:31.340]   So it's a great idea.
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.340]   You know, they love it.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:35.100]   Well, what happened was we did it the first year I did it the Drobo and then the second
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:40.220]   year I that was like they asked they said, so we're going to get another Drobo one when
[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:45.460]   you know, I was like, yes, yes, we're going to get free Drobo's for all of Alex Lindsey's
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:46.460]   clients.
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:52.020]   But I hope Alex, you're going to Drobo dot com slash make break when you pick them up.
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:54.540]   Because you're going to need that rebate if you keep this out of a break.
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:55.540]   So what is Drobo?
[00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:56.540]   Explain what Drobo is.
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:01.980]   It is a well, in its simplest form, it is a hard drive enclosure starting with the original
[00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:05.300]   Drobo, which has four bays, four drives.
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:09.860]   And if you're familiar with rate, it's kind of like rate, but it's their own version.
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:10.860]   It's right.
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:11.860]   You don't have to think about.
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:12.860]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:13.860]   And it has some advantages over rate.
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:18.940]   For instance, it allows you to mix and match drive sizes with with rate five, you know, the
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:22.740]   lowest drive becomes the default size for all all four discs.
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:26.580]   In this case, it just adds them up does have full redundancy, which is very nice.
[00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:28.780]   So if you lose a drive, no problem.
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:32.940]   Put a new one in and you don't even do anything like I've had a drive go bad.
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:36.140]   Yeah, Drobo, you pop it out, you put a new drive in, you let it sit there for a little
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.900]   while, it kind of cooks and figures it out.
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:38.900]   But I'm still using the drive.
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:42.140]   You know, it's not even that you have to stop using the drive.
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:44.740]   And it's a and the and the drives are all different size.
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.700]   And you can and I have two of them sit in my house.
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:50.540]   We've got the elite at our office that we edit off of.
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:52.540]   And it is a they're they're great.
[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:53.540]   We love the Drobo.
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:55.540]   Yeah, I don't think we have to be a labor that point.
[00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:56.540]   You must all know it.
[00:49:56.540 --> 00:50:01.540]   The Drobo S is five base same idea as the four bay original higher performance as well
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:02.820]   as more space.
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:06.980]   The Drobo pro for small businesses and creative teams eight disc bays.
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:09.940]   The Drobo elite eight disc bays, but it's a sand.
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:14.980]   So it supports up to 16 computer connections and has dual gigabit ethernet ports using
[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:19.260]   I SCSI, which is well, if let me put it this way.
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.780]   If you need I SCSI, you already know what I SCSI is.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:26.700]   It is ethernet very high speed hard drive like local hard drive connections over ethernet.
[00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.300]   It's really incredible.
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.460]   Now here's the deal.

[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:41.300]   So the date is out.
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:51.580]   Consumer Reports is reporting just minutes ago that if you ordered an iPad 3G early enough,
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:55.060]   April 30th is the delivery date.
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:56.060]   April 30th.
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:52:01.060]   So I actually have a couple of orders in and in fact Apple did send me a note because
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:03.300]   of all the press reports that was going to be made.
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.900]   Well, I'll tell you about that too.
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:05.900]   Yeah, that was kind of interesting.
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:09.660]   I got a couple of notes from Apple the other day.
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:13.740]   So I think because of all the press reports that it was going to be May 7th, Apple's kind
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:17.780]   of forced Apple's hand to our valued Apple customer.
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:22.260]   Thank you for your recent order of the magical and revolutionary iPad 3G.
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:24.300]   Oh God, Jesus Christ.
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:27.580]   Every time they refer to as magical, I honestly God.
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:30.980]   It turns fishes into loaves.
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:31.980]   I don't know what it does.
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:35.500]   We'd also like to confirm that your order will be shipped in late April as communicated
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:36.500]   at the time you placed your order.
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:39.580]   You'll receive a confirmation notice when you order a shipped and now they are saying
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:43.460]   April 30th, which is about as late at April as you can get.
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:48.860]   If I remember correctly, I don't think you can get any later in April.
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:52.220]   May 7th, if you order today, however, I should warn you.
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:54.540]   This is the other note I got from Apple.
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:55.700]   Thank you for your recent Apple order.
[00:52:55.700 --> 00:53:00.180]   I ordered my fifth iPad to ensure that all customers are given equal opportunity to acquire
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:01.180]   this product.
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:03.180]   We have limited the amount available per customer.
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.860]   Therefore, this order has been canceled.
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:07.140]   You know, I think it's kind about this.
[00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:09.340]   Because it didn't talk about it being magical revolutionary.
[00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:10.340]   They didn't rub it in.
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:11.340]   That's true.
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:14.540]   Thank you for your magical and revolutionary order.
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.620]   We've magically canceled it.
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:19.380]   Puff, puff, sucks to be you.
[00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:22.540]   And this was like several days after I placed the order.
[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:24.020]   That was bombed.
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:26.460]   So there really is a shortage of these iPads.
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:30.660]   I would guess they've already announced they're going to put off the international ship date.
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:35.940]   Remember that initially they said this has to do with, you know, approval processes and
[00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:39.820]   3G network deals in overseas.
[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:43.180]   And now they're saying, man, we just don't have enough of them.
[00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:44.540]   We want to serve the American market.
[00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:50.300]   So my question is this a contrived shortage or is this all on Nintendo Wii or is this
[00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:51.660]   a real shortage?
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:54.660]   No, because the Wii was a serious problem.
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:59.740]   Left Nintendo without the ability to take money for what two or three months during
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:01.180]   the holiday season.
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:04.500]   This merely means that they're not able to keep up with the demand.
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:08.380]   I'm sure this going to ramp back up again by the end of the month.
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:09.380]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:11.540]   I mean, it may seventh isn't the end isn't the end of the world.
[00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:12.860]   If you could order one now.
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:15.820]   And I've been told by a number of people you can walk into an Apple store and get a Wi-Fi
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:16.820]   iPad.
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:17.820]   No problem.
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:18.820]   Yeah.
[00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:22.980]   I mean, I was during my weekend, even when iPad fever was kind of at its hottest, the first
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:24.140]   week was on sale.
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:28.380]   I remember I was in Boulder and inadvertently convincing about a dozen different people
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:29.620]   to go out and get iPads.
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:33.180]   And one of them was a friend of mine who bought one for herself and her husband and she just
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:36.580]   walked right in, paid her money and walked out too.
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:40.860]   So word in from Steve Jobs.
[00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:42.340]   Some buying advice actually.
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:43.340]   Another great email.
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:44.340]   I love Steve.
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:46.460]   These are like the best.
[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:47.460]   I love Steve.
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:48.460]   You got it.
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:49.460]   Keep doing this, dude.
[00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:50.460]   Yeah.
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:51.460]   This is brilliant.
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:52.460]   This is the mystique.
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:53.460]   Yeah.
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:54.580]   And now he's actually answering.
[00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:56.060]   If you email Steve, what is this?
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:57.980]   Is it s jobs at apple.com?
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:54:58.980]   Is that it?
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:00.180]   I believe that's it.
[00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:02.780]   Yeah, they're very famously New York.
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:05.700]   They did a profile of him in which they, or no, it was Bill Gates in which they said,
[00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:06.700]   Bill answers all his email.
[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:09.220]   That was the end of that.
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:11.780]   Steve answers some email apparently from his iPhone.
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:17.540]   According to tech crunch, Apple fan and customer Matthew Browning sent a message to Steve Jobs
[00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:20.620]   to express a philosophical issue he was starting to have with Apple and moral policing.
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:22.100]   This was about, we talked about this last week.
[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:23.340]   Talk about outing someone.
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:26.660]   I emailed Steve because I wanted to have porn on my.
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:29.620]   Well, he didn't say that exactly.
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:34.060]   You mentioned the Mark Fiore's comic software, the satire.
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:38.460]   Mark Fiore writes for this SF gate, the San Francisco Chronicle and does political satire.
[00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:45.580]   And initially, Apple turned down the app saying you can't mock public figures.
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:49.060]   So this guy Matthew Browning says, I'm all for keeping porn out of kids hands.
[00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:50.940]   Heck, I'm all for ensuring I don't have to see it unless I want to.
[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:52.940]   But that's what parental controls are for.
[00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:55.620]   Put these types of apps into categories and allow them to be blocked by their parents
[00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:57.660]   should they want to.
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:03.060]   The master of one liners and catchphrases allegedly wrote back the following.
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:07.180]   And you can actually, you know, he sent the information with a header and everything on
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:08.180]   here.
[00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:09.780]   So we're pretty sure it's Steve.
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:12.020]   Fiore's app will be in the store shortly.
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:13.020]   That was a mistake.
[00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:14.380]   It is, by the way.
[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:20.220]   However, we do believe we have a moral responsibility to keep porn off the iPhone.
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:24.380]   Folks who want porn can buy an Android phone.
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:26.780]   You see?
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.540]   So he's sharing the love.
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:33.060]   See, it's like the, it's like the, the American 34th street where Macy's send customers to
[00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:39.140]   gimbals, gimbals, so basically I, the, I, Apple saying, you know what perverts, creeps,
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:42.980]   losers, low lives, the money, the line is to the left.
[00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:45.500]   Please let will drive you to the, to the, to the, to the Google Android.
[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:48.980]   Do you think that's what he and Eric were discussing at that coffee shop, that famous
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:49.980]   coffee shop meeting?
[00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:51.980]   I'm going to send some folks to you and let me tell you.
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:52.980]   Oh, man.
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:55.780]   Can't you go to jail for downloading an app like that?
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:56.780]   That's a contest.
[00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:58.780]   That's where you're going to sell to them.
[00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:00.460]   It has funded CD-ROMs.
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:03.780]   It has funded many, many editing applications.
[00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:07.540]   It has funded cable TV and streaming software.
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:08.540]   And now you can have it.
[00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:10.780]   That's a completely appropriate response from Apple.
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:15.620]   If you want USB, if you want a camera, if you want this and that, just, you know, there's
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:16.620]   other stuff there.
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:17.620]   You have choices.
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:21.900]   That comes, it comes down to my, my general response to people who think that Apple wants
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:22.900]   control of everything.
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:26.180]   That is one control of their own products.
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:29.380]   And they're not saying that they don't want porn to be available anywhere.
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:33.020]   They're just saying that they don't think that's a great choice for themselves and,
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:35.340]   and stocking up their apps for their own devices.
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:36.340]   I can't knock it.
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:37.340]   I'm happy with it.
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:38.340]   I don't mind.
[00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:42.500]   As long as they, the only objection that I've ever had is consistency.
[00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:47.980]   And I think that Steve's admission that it was a mistake to block the satire goes a long
[00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:50.660]   way in my mind to saying, okay, good.
[00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:52.020]   So they, so there's some thinking here.
[00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:53.020]   They're not trying to block.
[00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:55.020]   They're not political speech.
[00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:57.300]   They're just trying to keep it, keep it clean.
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:01.300]   You know what's interesting about them is, it's so funny.
[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:04.660]   People pull this stuff out of their, oh, so they probably did that because of focus group
[00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:05.660]   testing.
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:08.900]   It's like, well, you know, I don't think they focus grouped anything since Steve came
[00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:09.900]   back.
[00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:11.860]   Focus group is like a Steve in a yellow me.
[00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:13.260]   You know, that's the focus group.
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:15.580]   And, but it is, I'll tell you one thing.
[00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:18.380]   And again, this is, I'm always referring to this talk that Gruber and I did itself
[00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:22.140]   a Southwest a couple of years ago, which I actually am pretty proud of.
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:25.220]   The one of the things we talked about was the sense of when you're writing, one way
[00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:29.700]   to have your writing get a lot more lively is to sort of imagine who's reading it.
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:33.300]   You know, everybody kind of tacitly assumes that you can are writing for an audience.
[00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:36.820]   But I think you're writing for people, you know, it's like, you know, really, rice is
[00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:38.380]   really made out of grains.
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:39.940]   It's not just, you know, like one rice.
[00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:41.220]   It's like a lot of grains.
[00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:46.460]   If you imagine the faces of the people that you're writing for, it becomes a lot more precise.
[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:47.540]   You say what you want to say.
[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:52.460]   And I, there's a part of me that thinks, um, I know a lot of people that do this and just
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:53.660]   don't talk about it.
[00:58:53.660 --> 00:59:00.980]   I bet you Steve runs through what would, what would these 11 people think of this?
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:03.500]   Or like, how would I get these 11 people to go?
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:04.500]   This is really cool.
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:08.500]   I'm not saying it governs his whole thinking, but it would not surprise me at all to go.
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:10.860]   Certainly probably Mossberg or somebody or whoever.
[00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:13.300]   There are the kind of like, you never asked me.
[00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:14.300]   You ever asked you Andy?
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:15.300]   Yeah.
[00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:18.500]   We're always pulling out these canards about things like our stupid mother and our dumb
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:22.980]   aunt and our crazy, you know, all these dumb, like really insulting things that we say based
[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:25.020]   on our own, like, you know, narcissism.
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:29.500]   But I would not be surprised at all if he had specific people he's met in mine and go,
[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:30.860]   like, will they pick this up?
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:33.100]   Like I was just on a podcast with my friend Dan Benjamin.
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:35.700]   His two year old is doing stuff with his iPad now.
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:39.100]   I mean, there's got to be a part of him that goes, it's handed this to my nephew.
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:43.300]   Like what would he do that would make all the grown ups in the room go, wow.
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:44.300]   That's pretty cool.
[00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:45.860]   Does that stand up to reason?
[00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:48.460]   Do you think I think he thinks about how people really use it?
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:49.460]   I really believe.
[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:50.860]   I think he thinks a lot about how people use it.
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:57.260]   I think that I, um, from what I've heard of him, I think that he also very much believes
[00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.860]   exactly in the way he sees it.
[00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:01.420]   You know, like that I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:03.620]   You know, he just reacts to what's there and I see.
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:05.380]   Oh, tour theory of hardware design.
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:06.380]   I don't.
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:10.540]   I mean, if that were, if that were completely true, I mean, first of all, like why have a
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:14.140]   company at all, like why have a marketing department if he's that arrogant?
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:17.740]   Well, on some level, he understands that he has the vision and then other people need
[01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:18.740]   to articulate it.
[01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.140]   They don't give it just a serial number.
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:21.140]   They give it a really cool.
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:22.140]   Who knows that?
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:23.140]   Yeah.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:24.140]   Yeah.
[01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:25.140]   And look, he worked with Yoni.
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.140]   Yeah, he works with Yoni and he, uh, the Lingam brothers.
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:32.060]   No, but I think John, I think that, you know, he finds trusted partners just like you
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:35.980]   or I would, but I think I'm a big fan of the Oh, tour theory of cinema.
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:39.140]   I think that one person can have an artistic vision.
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:42.060]   And boy, it sure feels like Apple is Steve Jobs artistic vision.
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.060]   Does it not?
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.060]   Yeah.
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:45.060]   Absolutely.
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:46.060]   You're absolutely dead.
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:47.060]   Right.
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.060]   And I totally agree with you.
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:49.580]   There's nothing Groober and I talk about all the time is how you enjoy somebody like,
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:51.500]   you know, boy, you look at somebody like Scorsese.
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.020]   There's all these kinds of people.
[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:56.340]   Some people think of these as paradoxes or irreconcilable things like Scorsese makes
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:57.740]   the movie that he wants to make.
[01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:02.620]   But at the same time, anybody who's worked with Scorsese will tell you he speaks to each
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.620]   actor differently.
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:04.620]   Right.
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:07.300]   He brings them exactly what they need to get what he wants out of it.
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:08.300]   And I think that's what this is.
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:09.300]   This is a good analogy.
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.740]   But you do it through charisma or fear.
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:15.220]   I mean, and not to or you I mean, God, there's these couple wonderful documentaries about
[01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:17.500]   Stanley Kubrick I saw in the last year.
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:20.380]   And you get the sense of like, people were kind of scared of him, but they also really
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:21.940]   wanted it craved.
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:24.820]   They wanted Stanley to like what they did.
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:28.180]   And when you became somebody that Stanley wanted to play chess with, like, you didn't
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:29.180]   want to lose that.
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:32.780]   And I think that's one thing that characterizes a good leader is that they don't have to go
[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:35.580]   out and stand over you and say, how are you doing with email?
[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:41.100]   Like, they're going to get in there and say, here's the rules.
[01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:43.020]   Here's what I expected of you.
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:48.540]   Go, you know, incidentally, Steve's email came from Apple mail, not from his iPad or
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:51.220]   his iPhone, according to the headers.
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:56.380]   So he does sit at a desk sometimes occasionally and use it and use a desktop.
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:59.380]   Maybe he was using one of those new Mac books.
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:02.020]   I bet he's got mail tags and mail act on installed.
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.020]   You think?
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:05.020]   Is he an inbox zero kind of guy?
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:06.020]   Oh, totally.
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.020]   I'll bet you.
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:09.220]   I mean, you know, people don't get about inbox zero.
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:11.100]   It's not about doing email fricking 14 hours a day.
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.380]   It's about your delete key, like a crazy person, partly.
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:15.380]   By the way, iPad is great for that.
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:17.340]   I have found that one of the best things.
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.940]   You know, I think it was, I couldn't, are there rules in iPad?
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:21.300]   Can you really set up the no?
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:22.300]   That's that.
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:23.300]   That's why I have a lot of them.
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:24.300]   So here's, well, here's what you do.
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:25.300]   Well, it means.
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:26.300]   You got me.
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:27.300]   You got me.
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.300]   You got me.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:32.940]   So, so I remember talking to somebody, I think it was Michael Pal at the FCC, but somebody
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:36.260]   was a big blackberry user saying, because if you don't want to answer all your email
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.140]   in the blackberries, he says, no, no, no, you don't understand the blackberries and
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:39.340]   email deletion tool.
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:42.140]   The blackberries for getting rid of the junk.
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:46.700]   And one thing that's really awesome about the iPad, I actually do respond to a lot of
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:47.700]   email in the iPad.
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:50.700]   However, the delete key is the number one key I use.
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:54.420]   It's a way of parsing through that mailbox and getting rid of a lot of stuff so that if
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:58.780]   you do sit down at a desktop at some point, you know, you're really ready to go.
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:04.580]   One, and two, use an iMac client or iMac provider because the iMac and the iPad, then
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:10.100]   if you, if you do have filters running on the iMac server, all those filters propagate.
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:13.740]   I've got, you know, if you look at my folders, I've got hundreds of folders.
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:16.580]   All of that's happening before I get the mail.
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:17.580]   I think that's my problem.
[01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:18.580]   Is that what your issue is?
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:19.580]   I have a pop.
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:23.580]   Yeah, yeah, look, see, look at all these folders, you know, that all of that.
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:26.220]   I have like all those rules are happening because that's my problem because right now
[01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:31.180]   I have a pop and it's all happening in mail and I have like 60 rules that that I don't
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:32.180]   think I could.
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:33.180]   Oh, no, no, you're going to get it out.
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:36.140]   I mean, I couldn't work or use Gmail or yeah, you some.
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:40.820]   Yeah, I would be remiss as the supposedly anal retent of inbox zero guy.
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:44.500]   If I didn't just bring up one data point, which is, I mean, I really do believe that
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:48.540]   to the extent possible, if you're going to do email, it pays to set aside the time that
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:49.540]   you're going to do it.
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:50.540]   I'm sorry.
[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.540]   I know I say this all the time, but I think it's a pattern.
[01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:56.300]   People don't adopt and they do it, they don't adopt it at their peril.
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:04:00.260]   So if you, to me, if you've got time to check email, you have to make time to do it well
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.620]   and process it once.
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:05.740]   And this is my beef with mail dot app on the phone or mail dot phone or whatever the
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:06.740]   hell it is.
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:10.620]   It's like, there's no way to really process email to make up a black area is a deleting
[01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:11.620]   thing.
[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:14.340]   That's like, do you, do you like go to your mailbox and just throughout the junk mail
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:16.060]   and then come back later for the good stuff?
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:17.060]   I can crazy.
[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:18.060]   No, I don't.
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:19.060]   I mean, you're right.
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:20.700]   You're saying touch it once.
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:25.580]   So yeah, I'm saying, well, I go to now, first of all, all the filters have happened already.
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:30.060]   So all the stuff that's got to be, look, I have a folder called douche bags.
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:31.820]   That's my sister does that.
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:34.940]   I can't hear my pick.
[01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:35.940]   I got to pick for you.
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:36.940]   I kid you not.
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:37.940]   I kid you not.
[01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:41.100]   That's a folder full of mail that she sets aside for when I'm in a bad mood.
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:43.620]   I want to read, but you can see all this filtering is already done.
[01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:47.100]   This is all folder filtering that's done on the server side.
[01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:51.140]   And then when, but so I go directly to my Leo box that's already pre filtered and I,
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:52.140]   you're right, Merle.
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:55.580]   I understand what you're saying is, well, you shouldn't look on a message only once.
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:59.940]   Handle a piece of paper only once, but I, I delete a lot of, I get a lot of bacon.
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:01.260]   So, you know, press releases and stuff.
[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:03.180]   I can delete that really quick.
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:06.100]   And I can, I can do a quick response as well on this as I can do on anything.
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:07.620]   You know what that reminds me of Leo?
[01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:09.900]   Did you ever use you Dora back in the day?
[01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:10.900]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:12.340]   So I mean, there are people today.
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:17.220]   I mean, there are these apps, you know, like what word perfect agenda, certainly, you Dora.
[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:19.620]   I mean, there are people who just don't want to let go.
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:24.380]   And actually there is now a Thunderbird based version of you Dora that's out.
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:26.860]   It's not the same as the old one, but you, what you're doing is what I used to do with
[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:31.740]   you Dora and I, it was mind boggling to me when I lost this, when I went to Outlook
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.940]   Express in 2000 or whatever.
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:35.660]   But, but I had it set up.
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:36.900]   Nobody did rules like you Dora.
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:38.460]   I don't know if you remember, you Dora had a good friend.
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:39.460]   Oh, yeah, it was great.
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:40.620]   That's where I cut my teeth on rules.
[01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:41.620]   You're absolutely right.
[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:46.860]   It was the first place where it would keep your, if you like threads, like my friend Dennis
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:50.500]   get part, all my Dennis get part two and from mail was in a window, right?
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:51.500]   Same for everybody.
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:55.180]   And so I come in in the morning, hit the button, go get a coffee because of course I
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:06:01.420]   was on, you know, but I come back to do, and I have like 35 windows.
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:05.580]   And each window basically was a to do, which was go deal with the email from this person
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:06.820]   and then close the window.
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:08.380]   That sounds kind of like what you're doing.
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:12.420]   You still have to go through those one at a time to decide if there's an action, right?
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:13.420]   Yeah.
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:15.740]   But, but you've got an organized in a way where you're working in kind of silence.
[01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:18.540]   And I don't look at, yeah, and I don't look at folders that are going to need more than
[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:21.820]   something I can do on an iPad on the iPad, but I can get a lot.
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:22.900]   Okay, I can't wait.
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:23.900]   I'm excited.
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:27.540]   And by the way, Gmail does is very nicely done on the iPad.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:31.660]   Google did a very good job of making iPad Gmail very usable.
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:35.100]   And, you know, the one thing that Merlin, I just want to underline what Merlin was talking
[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:38.180]   about because I think that the touch wants, I mean, I kind of naturally do that.
[01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:41.140]   I just delete stuff constantly and respond to everything really quickly.
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.740]   And one thing I tell everyone when they walk up to me is like, if you write me an email
[01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:47.180]   longer than six lines, the chances of me ever responding to you are almost nil.
[01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:49.220]   You see that, like I just don't read it.
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:52.460]   You know, I just go, oh, you know, and the thing is if I don't respond to it within six
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:54.940]   to 12 hours, I probably won't.
[01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:56.100]   You know, you know, and I know that.
[01:06:56.100 --> 01:07:00.580]   So what I do is I make sure I respond to it, or I don't, you know, but I'm not going to,
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:01.580]   you know, move on.
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:07.260]   But the, the, it's so important to stay because I, my, my, my, one of my family members who
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:13.180]   just got, you know, was like, um, overwhelmed that they were getting 30 emails a day.
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:17.620]   And I was like, if I get 30 emails a day, I was like, there's something wrong.
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:19.140]   Like, like, that's background noise.
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:20.180]   Like the servers down.
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:20.700]   Really?
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:21.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.940]   Now Apple will do its earnings.
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:25.420]   Uh, I think soon.
[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:25.860]   Yeah.
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:28.980]   Um, they're, um, I'm not sure when their quarterly results come out.
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:31.140]   We don't, we haven't heard them as a record time.
[01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:31.660]   Yeah.
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:34.140]   As usual, they wait till after we're done.
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:42.580]   However, um, the stock popped a little bit, the, this morning, 249 24, uh, because analysts
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:47.460]   expect that the second quarter earnings should be the highest ever for Apple.
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:48.380]   And I think that's probably true.
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:52.980]   Of course, a bit of a sell off almost immediately because IBM came back with a bad report, like
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:59.460]   IBM's somehow IBM's stock results or a profit results are going to impact Apple.
[01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:03.140]   So maybe a bargain right now, you could buy maybe, you know, score some Apple stock at
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:06.460]   a good deal if the results haven't come out yet consensus.
[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:09.900]   And this is what you want to pay attention to in terms of stock price is Apple report
[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:13.820]   earnings of $2.45 a share on a revenue of 12 billion.
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:17.300]   That would make it, uh, easily the second best second quarter in history.
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:21.540]   And of course, I don't even know if that includes, it does not include, uh, iPad sales.
[01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:22.540]   Yeah.
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:27.220]   So, uh, Apple's still on a roll and the, and the, and the, by the way, the tech market
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:28.420]   has done very well.
[01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:29.780]   Big, big, good results.
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:31.660]   Best quarter ever for a number of big tech companies.
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:33.860]   I think a lot of them were holding their breath and they couldn't hold it any longer.
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:35.260]   I mean, as far as per shot, I buy something.
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:40.060]   Well, let me ask about the, uh, we haven't talked about the, uh, the new, uh, uh, laptops
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:41.060]   yet.
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:42.420]   I had an odd, have we?
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:44.060]   No, that happened on Thursday, right?
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:46.060]   Uh, I thought we talked about them last week.
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.500]   And we talked about them last Tuesday.
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:48.500]   Yeah.
[01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:49.500]   Okay.
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.340]   I can confirm that I still don't have one.
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:52.980]   I don't feel the need to get one.
[01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:53.980]   I've got an iPad.
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:57.780]   Honestly, I think the iPad, I haven't used my laptop much at all into.
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:09:01.340]   I missed, I missed, I mean, I've missed all of the juicy iPad stuff.
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:05.180]   Everything I know is from Andy's, uh, what probably 95,000 words.
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:09.180]   He's written on this, but, but are you agreeing with Andy in terms of the Bluetooth keyboard
[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:10.580]   as you go to, I don't use it.
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:11.580]   Nope.
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:12.580]   I use it on screen keyboard.
[01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:13.580]   I have a Bluetooth keyboard.
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:14.580]   I thought I would use it.
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:15.820]   That's personal, totally personal.
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:17.780]   I've been, I've been just, I've been keen away on that.
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:18.780]   Feel no need for it.
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:20.380]   I find that keyboard screen is fine.
[01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:23.460]   I don't know if I could, if I could write, I don't know if I could write an article like
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:28.460]   Andy, uh, on a, on that, but I'm not a writer, but, but as far as the writing stuff, uh,
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:29.860]   I find that the touchscreen actually works.
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:31.460]   I find that the screen's almost too big.
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:35.140]   Do you notice the, the, the, the, the, you know, you can't do, you can't do this.
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:37.460]   Well, no, that's why, you know what I want?
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:40.900]   Seriously, I want to use, I want something that lets me use this as a keyboard because
[01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:44.540]   I am so fast now at vertical oriented typing.
[01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:47.660]   Um, I finally have let go and let God and I just let the.
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:48.660]   You have to do that.
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:49.660]   Yeah.
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:50.660]   Well, yeah, people don't get that.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:53.780]   I mean, the first time they do it and they sit there and plug away, but I'll tell you, man,
[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:56.900]   if I could have this as a Bluetooth keyboard for the iPad, I, there's got to be an app
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:57.900]   that'll wait.
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:58.900]   You mean your iPhone?
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:09:59.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:00.820]   Interesting.
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:02.100]   Oh no, cause I would prop that thing up.
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:04.660]   I'd sit back in my chair and I can type like a mother.
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:06.180]   That just shows how personal this is.
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:07.180]   Really?
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:09.100]   I mean, no, I don't want to type on a giant thing.
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:10.100]   The board with the hands.
[01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:15.260]   That's just a, that's a very American response saying, oh, my pants all the way over in the
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:20.620]   coffee to all the, I'll just, I'll just tell, can I get, can I just get key in from this?
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:22.460]   Oh, can I get a second phone?
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:23.460]   My thumbs hurt.
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:27.460]   It's like that, it's like that, uh, Scrabble application where you have to have an iPad
[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:32.060]   and two iPhones and then you put the Scrabble in between you and then the tiles are the
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:33.060]   Scrabble on your iPhone.
[01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:34.060]   Who you played?
[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:35.820]   No, cause I don't know anybody.
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:37.860]   Oh, Scrabble for iPad Leo.
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:39.860]   You only look foolish.
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:44.820]   No, that is, it is so freaking.
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:45.820]   I do words with friends.
[01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:47.580]   You think Scrabble is where it should go?
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:49.620]   My kids and I, my kids had never played Scrabble.
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:53.380]   And so when, when I was home, when I brought the iPad and, and so, and my, my, my son's
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:54.860]   Steven was playing it on his iPad.
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:58.140]   So he had, he has an iPad and so we had the iPad up and so he's playing with the big letters
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:04.100]   and then my, my, my, uh, Hannah and myself, uh, were playing on our iPhones and it is so
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:05.100]   much fun.
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:06.100]   And they were so into it.
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:07.100]   I was like, what do you want to do next?
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:08.100]   And I was like, well, let's play a little more Scrabble.
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:10.340]   And it was, you know, maybe I'm gonna have to buy it.
[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:11.340]   Oh my gosh.
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:13.180]   And of course everybody I know has an iPhone.
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:15.100]   So I mean, you could play it without the iPhone.
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:17.300]   Did you do the iPhone tile thing, the tile rack though?
[01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:18.300]   Yeah.
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.100]   So it's a free app that you download.
[01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:21.100]   It's the tile rack.
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:22.100]   And then it, and then it sinks out.
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:23.100]   It totally sinks up.
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:25.780]   I'm going to wait till they make an Android tile rack.
[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:30.380]   So it was, it was, it was really it's it.
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:34.980]   So, so what, what, how does that, how does that affect like gameplay and like, and scoring?
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:39.140]   Is there an official ruling that says that if the, if the Android player crashes, it's
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:40.140]   all slayed.
[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:44.540]   If the turn, you have to turn your tile racks over so that you can't see your own iPhone
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:45.540]   tile rack.
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:46.540]   It's frozen again.
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:47.540]   It's frozen.
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:48.540]   Hold on.
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:49.540]   Hold on.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.540]   Hang on.
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:51.540]   I just be starting.
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:52.540]   Hang on.
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:53.540]   Hang on.
[01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:54.540]   I just be like, I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:55.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:56.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:57.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:58.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:11:58.540 --> 01:11:59.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:00.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:01.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:02.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:03.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:04.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:06.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:07.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:08.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:09.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:16.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:19.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:20.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:21.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:22.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:23.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:24.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:25.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:26.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:27.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:28.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:29.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:30.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:31.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:32.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:33.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:38.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:45.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:48.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:49.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:50.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:51.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:52.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:53.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:54.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:55.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:56.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:57.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:58.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:59.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:00.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:01.540]   I'm just going to go ahead and do it.
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:03.540]   I'm going to lose a couple turns on the dictionary thing.
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:05.540]   Pretty soon I'm letting Quijibo get by.
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:06.540]   Yeah.
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:08.540]   I'm a little pissed now because they've changed the rules.
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:09.540]   That was for you Andy.
[01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:10.540]   That was for you.
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:11.540]   Quijibo.
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:16.540]   I'm more upset because the iPad version removes the most fun part of the game.
[01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:20.540]   When you get frustrated, you just have to flip it over and just send all the stuff out.
[01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:23.540]   You should at least use the motion sensors.
[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:25.540]   If you do that to the iPhone, do the iPad.
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:26.540]   Oh, it should just throw the tiles in the air.
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:29.540]   Wouldn't that be funny if you just everything...
[01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:31.540]   There is the break it over your knee.
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.540]   Yeah, you could do that.
[01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:33.540]   It's expensive.
[01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:34.540]   It's expensive.
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:37.540]   But that's what chess masters have been known to do.
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:40.540]   Sweep the pieces off, take the board, break it across your knee.
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:42.540]   That's the end of the game.
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:43.540]   Is that checkmate?
[01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:45.540]   I think that's irisign.
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:46.540]   That's what that is.
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:50.540]   I shouldn't go down this rabbit hole, but I will.
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:53.540]   How do you feel about the use of proper nouns in Scrabble?
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:54.540]   They've changed the rules.
[01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:57.540]   I think it's a dangerous path.
[01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:59.540]   You know that the thing is...
[01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:01.540]   You guys are funny so much.
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:02.540]   Oh, man.
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:03.540]   So much.
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.540]   I just said it before.
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:09.540]   It's like any other place, like any other podcast in a month, people are always hurting back.
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:10.540]   Oh, let's stay on top.
[01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:11.540]   No, no, no, no.
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:12.540]   God, love me.
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:13.540]   Not me.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:14.540]   I mean, where does it end though?
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:16.540]   Where does it end when you start adding proper nouns?
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:19.540]   What language?
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:22.540]   Think of the children.
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:24.540]   It's a slippery slope.
[01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:26.540]   I mean, that's all I'm saying.
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:29.540]   We're going from proper nouns to improper nouns to just improper words.
[01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:30.540]   All right.
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:34.540]   Unchecked aggression must be addressed immediately at the source.
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:37.540]   This is my last territorial demand.
[01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:40.540]   After INX, the Sudetenland, I will only use proper nouns.
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:41.540]   My point, exactly.
[01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:44.540]   So you're saying that Scrabble is the Neville Chamberlain of board games?
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:45.540]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:46.540]   I think it is.
[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:49.540]   I've made two Neville Chamberlain references in the last three days.
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:50.540]   I know.
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:52.540]   Your other Neville Chamberlain, by the way,
[01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:57.540]   has got to read in Kung Fu grip your review of the new Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.540]   Written from the perspective of what?
[01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:01.540]   Probably like a VP, right?
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:02.540]   VP marketing, a KFC.
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:09.540]   I think the name of the post is a new brown thing you'll totally eat.
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:14.540]   Because it's like a personal holocaust of poultry.
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:18.540]   It's like the single most disgusting dog poop looking thing I have ever seen.
[01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:20.540]   If you haven't eaten it, you must.
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:21.540]   That's a hate crime.
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:23.540]   And when is that yellow stuff?
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:25.540]   That's the Colonel's Secret Sauce.
[01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:26.540]   I describe it as an engagingly,
[01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:28.540]   pus-like cornstarch sauce.
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:30.540]   I think that was fairly accurate.
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:32.540]   That's not my original post.
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:34.540]   That's the guy over the hedge, the funny guy over the hedge.
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:35.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:36.540]   Let's go down to the original one.
[01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:38.540]   My start of it was I just took that photo of the KFC near my house,
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:41.540]   and I couldn't stop writing about it because it's just us.
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:42.540]   Fine.
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:43.540]   We're KFC.
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:47.540]   And it's become abundantly clear that you said bastards will eat literally anything.
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:50.540]   We can find, photograph, and poop into a little plastic coffin.
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:54.540]   Believe me, we know because for years now we've been testing you aggressively,
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:59.540]   time and again through a mind boggling series of product releases that call to mind
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:02.540]   Europe's inexorable slide into the Second World War.
[01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:04.540]   And there's your Neville Chamberlain reference.
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:05.540]   Your second for the day.
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:06.540]   It is so funny, folks.
[01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:10.540]   Read at Kung Fu Grip GRIPPE.com.
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:12.540]   You don't pronounce that gripe.
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:13.540]   It's grip, right?
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:17.540]   No, it's a terrible pun on GI Joe.
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:19.540]   GI Joe and the flu.
[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:20.540]   Kung Fu grip.
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:22.540]   And the 1918 flu pandemic.
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:23.540]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:25.540]   It took a lot of lives, and it was really funny.
[01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:26.540]   Yeah.
[01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:27.540]   18 million.
[01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:28.540]   It was money.
[01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.540]   Yeah, da da da da da.
[01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:31.540]   All right.
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:34.540]   Poor immigrants to pack like 40 50 to a pen of it building.
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:35.540]   Oh my God.
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:36.540]   I almost busted gut.
[01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:37.540]   The children.
[01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:38.540]   The children.
[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:39.540]   The children.
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:40.540]   Stop it.
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:41.540]   Stop it.
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:42.540]   Seriously.
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:43.540]   Princeton.
[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:45.540]   No iPads allowed.
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:47.540]   Israel and Princeton.
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:48.540]   For different reasons.
[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:50.540]   No, you couldn't have the iPad.
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:53.540]   You couldn't connect to their Wi-Fi network.
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:56.540]   So apparently, now a lot of people got this wrong.
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:59.540]   And so I want to correct this because I actually read the press release from the Princeton
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:00.540]   IT department.
[01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:02.540]   And it, you know, I hate to say it.
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:04.540]   It makes sense because this happened before with the iPhone, right?
[01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:07.540]   A bunch of universities said you can't have the iPhone because they're bad.
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:08.540]   They're mean.
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:09.540]   It's selfish.
[01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:10.540]   It's selfish.
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:11.540]   This isn't that.
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:12.540]   This is legitimate.
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:16.660]   The Princeton IT guys are kind of sticklers for the RFC.
[01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:23.260]   So the Wi-Fi, well actually DHCP, you get a time for the lease.
[01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:27.780]   You know, you get the IP number for a certain amount of time after the lease expires, whatever
[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:33.020]   it is in hours, 30 minutes, you got to ask for another one just in case.
[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.860]   The iPad lease expires.
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:37.060]   Well, I don't know.
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:38.060]   It's in the RFC.
[01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:39.220]   We don't need to ask why.
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:40.660]   It's in the RFC.
[01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:45.340]   So the iPad times up does not release the IP address, keeps it.
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:50.900]   However, Princeton's DHCP server, thinking that it's no longer needed, reassigns the
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:52.100]   IP address.
[01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:56.420]   So as an iPad user, you may have an unfortunate experience.
[01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:57.700]   It's not a security flaw.
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:58.700]   You just will get a message.
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:02.060]   Somebody else is using that IP address and you'll be knocked off the network.
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:07.260]   Princeton, to protect you against that unfortunate experience is banning iPads from the campus.
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:10.060]   And other people have said that the Cornell says it's fine.
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:11.660]   They haven't had any trouble at all.
[01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:13.900]   And it appears to be only some of them.
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:18.380]   That's been the thing that's been, according to Cornell, it was not all of them.
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:19.380]   It was.
[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:20.380]   And they mark a few.
[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:23.420]   And in fact, I don't know if they banned all or just those or I'm not sure exactly.
[01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:24.980]   It's not clear from that.
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:27.180]   But now why is Israel banning iPads?
[01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:30.060]   They're actually confiscating them at the door.
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:32.140]   They're taking them at the door.
[01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:33.220]   You can't.
[01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:39.740]   So here, Israel has banned Apple's iPad from entering the country from the US and has threatened
[01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:43.260]   to confiscate the newly released devices from passengers at airports.
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:49.500]   Apparently, because the iPad's Wi-Fi system is incompatible with Israel's wireless standards
[01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:51.900]   and it could damage the network.
[01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:52.900]   Wow.
[01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:58.580]   And apparently, a number of people said, yes, they took our iPad.
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:01.580]   They said, we will store it for you until you leave.
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:05.580]   We will charge you for the storage.
[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:07.220]   I wonder what they're doing that's so different.
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:10.980]   It seems like it's Wi-Fi.
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:15.500]   I heard it was because it had laid down with men and each of the cloven hoof.
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:16.500]   I think that's it.
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:17.500]   That's true.
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:18.500]   It's trafe.
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:19.500]   No, so here's the thing.
[01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:22.620]   I was afraid as I used with my-- I call them clients.
[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:25.580]   You got to be careful not to let the guy with the broom decide how many elephants get
[01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:26.780]   to be in the parade.
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:27.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:30.780]   And this is why you should hire me because I'm really funny.
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:33.140]   But I don't know how to do anything.
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:35.380]   What a great line though.
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:36.380]   That's a slide.
[01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:37.380]   That's a slide I think.
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:38.380]   Yeah.
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:39.380]   Beware I go.
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:40.780]   It is mind boggling to me.
[01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:43.100]   And this is, again, I have been on both sides of this equation.
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:47.380]   I have total respect in a low-hofer, you know, MIS and IT departments.
[01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:49.380]   I know they have a very hard job.
[01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:50.380]   Comma.
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:55.780]   Man, people are hamstrung inside of companies because they-- you know, like when you got
[01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:59.380]   a little kid, you got two little kids and you got one piece of cake left, one cuts and
[01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:00.380]   one picks?
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:01.380]   Yes.
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:02.620]   That's a great solution, by the way.
[01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:03.620]   It totally works.
[01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:04.620]   It's like--
[01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:06.180]   Have you ever done that, Alex?
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:08.180]   We're going to help Alex parent right now, Merlin.
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:09.180]   Yeah.
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.180]   Yeah.
[01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:11.180]   Go ahead, tell him.
[01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:12.180]   You probably had to do this a lot.
[01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:13.180]   Oh, I do it all the time.
[01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:14.180]   So here's the problem.
[01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:15.180]   You cut the cake and one gets--
[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:16.180]   [SINGING]
[01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:17.180]   Sammy got a bigger piece.
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:18.180]   So here's what you do.
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:19.660]   You give one kid the job to cut the cake.
[01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:21.380]   The other kid gets to choose which of the two pieces.
[01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:22.380]   Oh, that was common.
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:24.980]   Anytime you got two balls of anything when I was growing.
[01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:25.980]   Guaranteed, you're going to have to--
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:27.980]   One person does it and the other person has to pick it.
[01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:28.980]   Yeah.
[01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:29.980]   You knew they started.
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:30.980]   But it's a prisoner's dilemma.
[01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:31.980]   I know it's a little bit of a kicker.
[01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:39.980]   The company's decided who gets to be CEO.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:40.980]   You win.
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:41.980]   You know what that is?
[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:43.980]   That's thinking outside the box.
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:44.980]   Hey, it's Sammy.
[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:45.980]   So here's the problem.
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:48.980]   Now, IT departments, God love them so much respect and aloha.
[01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:54.980]   They get to pick the knife and the cake and which part and whether we're having cake again.
[01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:57.980]   Because their whole job is to make their own job easy, which is understandable.
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:04.460]   But the problem is they are the wizards and the czars and because most people don't
[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:08.500]   understand what they do fundamentally and are scared of them, that's why everybody's
[01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:09.500]   who's a window still.
[01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:10.500]   Let's be honest.
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:13.620]   I mean, and it's why to some extent.
[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:19.220]   I think you get these squirrely policies where in fairness there's the thing like Apple
[01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:20.220]   has this thing.
[01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:22.660]   Part of what some people say what's made Apple great is they never put in a feature
[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:25.900]   that they don't want to support forever, which I think is a smart way to think about
[01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:26.900]   any product at all.
[01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:27.900]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:29.820]   Yeah, but so so so here's the Microsoft had done that.
[01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:31.020]   It would have been a different world.
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:34.340]   So like like like maybe I don't know enough about this, but maybe if you're Israel IT
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:38.460]   guy, like you're basically having a bunch of people trying to shove a beta max tape
[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:42.180]   into your into your VHS and you're like, whoa, I know that seems simple to you, but you're
[01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:44.780]   going to screw up the the VHS player.
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:46.140]   Is that potentially what's happening here?
[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:48.140]   Are they going to like cause you said?
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:49.620]   Maybe no one can explain it.
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:50.620]   It's bizarre.
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:51.620]   Yeah.
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:52.620]   I mean, there's a government.
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:53.620]   Yeah, it's pretty funny.
[01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:57.340]   Unless it's some kind of something to do with the security could be sticky.
[01:21:57.340 --> 01:21:59.100]   No, they don't they don't mess around with that.
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:04.620]   Yeah, that's that it seems like it seems serious enough that they would take everybody's iPad
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:07.460]   that they seem to be concerned about.
[01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:11.380]   It seems like security would have to be the issue because I just have a hard time.
[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:13.380]   We know what they use for security there.
[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:14.380]   What?
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:15.380]   WPA.
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:18.180]   Hey, hey, W.P.
[01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:19.180]   Oi.
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:20.180]   I hate it.
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:21.180]   You should.
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:26.940]   What I want to know is when you leave Israel and you get your iPad back suddenly like an
[01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:30.620]   all of your games have you been like up three or four different levels since the week that
[01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:31.620]   you left with them?
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:32.620]   Mm hmm.
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:34.180]   That would be the answer to the security question.
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:35.180]   I think.
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:36.180]   Yeah.
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:37.180]   Who?
[01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:38.180]   Hey, my God fingers.
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:39.180]   I'm up 20 levels.
[01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:41.060]   I'm heading over here.
[01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:44.700]   We've noticed for some reason that everybody in the massage has gotten very good at plans
[01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:50.820]   versus zombies.
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:58.620]   So if you ever go to Target to buy Starbucks, use your iPhone because now 1000 to Starbucks
[01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:01.780]   inside Target stores.
[01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:06.180]   I haven't found so many freaking Starbucks now they're building them inside Target stores.
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:07.180]   Oh, they're inside Safeway.
[01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:08.180]   They're inside Target.
[01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:10.180]   They're just there.
[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:15.420]   There you could you have to have the Starbucks app version 1.2.1 and you can be able to use
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:16.420]   it yet.
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:17.420]   I haven't found a Starbucks that hasn't had.
[01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:18.420]   Were you able to use it?
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:19.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:20.420]   You used it.
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:21.420]   I'm out of you.
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:22.420]   Nate.
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:23.420]   That's cool.
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:24.420]   I walk around.
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:25.420]   I look for it.
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:30.340]   So Seattle and Silicon Valley, of course, you can you can use this.
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:31.340]   I'm ready.
[01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:32.340]   I'm ready for order.
[01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.340]   It's a Starbucks mobile card.
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:35.340]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:36.340]   So what you get, Alex?
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:37.580]   You get an Americano?
[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:38.580]   I do.
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:42.140]   I'm you know, I did when I started deciding I didn't want to be fat anymore.
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:43.140]   Right.
[01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:44.140]   What does Steve get?
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:45.140]   Remind me.
[01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:46.820]   We had coffee one time with Steve and what is it that he gets?
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:49.060]   He gets like a six shot at Espresso Leo.
[01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:50.060]   Yeah.
[01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:52.180]   It's a they call him a sexti latte.
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:53.180]   A six.
[01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:54.980]   He gets a six shot at Espresso.
[01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:55.980]   Six Steve Gibson.
[01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:56.980]   Yeah.
[01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:57.980]   Steve Jobs.
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:58.980]   Yeah, I was like, I was like, I can't.
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:00.980]   I think it's a quinti venti latte.
[01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:01.980]   That's a lot of.
[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:02.980]   I mean, that's all I got to say.
[01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:05.900]   That would make a certain part of my body extremely.
[01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:08.100]   I'm actually vibrating from whatever it was you brought today.
[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:10.140]   That's triple, that's a triple tall, triple tall latte.
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:12.020]   That's the way they should make them though.
[01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:14.140]   And my head is swelling.
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:16.940]   So this is not the Starbucks application that I have.
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:19.820]   This is the Starbucks card application.
[01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:25.060]   You can actually put on there and it's got a code and you tell the Starbucks barista
[01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:30.140]   to scan it and there are 1,018 participating stores and you can load it up.
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:32.420]   I like that.
[01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:33.420]   That's good marketing.
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:34.420]   Right.
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:37.100]   There's so many other countries where you can buy all kinds of stuff with your phone
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:38.780]   and we're still excited about it in the United States.
[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:41.980]   There's so many people here watching like in New Zealand or Australia or Japan going
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:42.980]   in Africa.
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:43.980]   Yeah.
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:44.980]   That's so nice.
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:46.860]   In Africa is an SMS as a way to do everything.
[01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:48.340]   Is that a cliche or is that true?
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:50.220]   No, you can do a lot with SMS in Africa.
[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:54.700]   There's a lot of people in what most of us would consider pretty remote kind of.
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:58.060]   It's a disused term, but second and third world kind of areas who are doing pretty
[01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:01.220]   serious like commerce with a frickin phone, right?
[01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:05.340]   Well, the thing is that SMS is actually less expensive there than voice than voice.
[01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:10.340]   And so and according to CNN, you can run Norway via iPad.
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:11.900]   I saw this.
[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:12.900]   This is just silly.
[01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:14.660]   No, this is more of the volcano business.
[01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:19.740]   Yeah, Jens Stoltenberg, who is apparently the prime minister of Norway was stranded by
[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:22.620]   the ash.
[01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:28.180]   And so they got a snagged in a picture of him at the executive lounge at JFK with his iPad,
[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:30.580]   apparently running the country.
[01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:31.700]   Just he's got a little check.
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:32.700]   He's got a little check marks.
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:33.700]   Yes.
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:34.700]   No, yes.
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:35.700]   He could have like a little run Norway app.
[01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:37.100]   I'd buy a run Norway app.
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:38.100]   Yeah.
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:41.100]   For those developers who are watching, you could run it by consensus.
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:44.460]   Like, okay, you know, maybe that's the future of governance.
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:47.460]   It's just give a thousand people an iPad app.
[01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:49.020]   Give everybody an iPad.
[01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:53.660]   And then or yes, a million, whatever, that says, okay, nuclear power.
[01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:54.660]   Yes or no.
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:55.660]   And then they just do it.
[01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:56.660]   Should coffee be free?
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:57.660]   Yes or no?
[01:25:57.660 --> 01:25:58.660]   By consensus.
[01:25:58.660 --> 01:25:59.660]   Exactly.
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:00.660]   That's that's democracy.
[01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:01.660]   Yeah.
[01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:03.660]   And then now Simon Cal could make some remarks about it.
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:05.060]   Yeah, he makes some remarks.
[01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:07.060]   And then we go for a break with the Coca-Cola.
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:08.060]   That's why we're.
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:09.060]   Heidi, Heidi Klum would come out.
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:12.060]   I think you've really not understood the spirit of the challenge of our government.
[01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:14.940]   Your bond was Paulie Maeve.
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:17.460]   You've been watching Project Runway again, dude.
[01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:19.460]   I want somebody.
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:21.740]   The only reason, not the only reason, I really like that show.
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:25.700]   But I love the part when Heidi is about to throw off one of the two people.
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:29.300]   And she'll go like, Jules, your dress was a personal Holocaust.
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:31.740]   Everything that you have done has been a failure.
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:35.020]   You didn't understand the spirit of the challenge and you're heavy.
[01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:38.940]   Lola, you know, and I wanted somebody to take all of those and put them together in the
[01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:39.940]   one giant match.
[01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:42.940]   So Heidi just sits there, you know, right before the off-fitter's day.
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:46.340]   And she just tells you what is wrong with you as a person.
[01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:47.340]   She doesn't hold back.
[01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:49.100]   No, apparently that's got to be pretty.
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:51.100]   That's got to be devastating if you're.
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:56.340]   Because you have the last face you will see is Tim Gunn.
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:27:00.540]   If there's an angel of death, I hope it's like Tim Gunn says, I'm so sorry to see you
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:03.300]   go, but you need to clean your workspace.
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:05.460]   We're going to miss you.
[01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:07.340]   Good haptic to go up.
[01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:08.900]   Because of course he sounds like Humpty Hum.
[01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:11.580]   We're going to have to ask you to go upstairs and clean out your space.
[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:13.100]   I'm missing something.
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:14.100]   I've never seen this show.
[01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:15.100]   I got to start watching this.
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:16.100]   Start with season two.
[01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:17.100]   Go straight to season two.
[01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:18.580]   Can you get it on DVD?
[01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:19.580]   Project Runway and DVD?
[01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:21.700]   Yeah, you can hardly not get it on DVD.
[01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:22.700]   It's everywhere.
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:24.140]   I think I got it on the Netflix streaming.
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:29.060]   Just turn on lifetime at any hour between midnight and about five minutes after midnight.
[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:30.060]   There's more than five.
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:31.060]   And never turn on the left time.
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:32.060]   I got to do more of that.
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:34.180]   Yeah, season's been kind of this season's been kind of weak.
[01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:35.460]   I would start with season two.
[01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:38.220]   I think all of these shows are kind of like watching a car crash in slow motion.
[01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:39.220]   I can't not watch Alex.
[01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:40.660]   Alex, don't be that guy.
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:41.660]   Have you watched Top Chef?
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:42.660]   Have you watched?
[01:27:42.660 --> 01:27:44.860]   No, the only one that I watch.
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:49.700]   The only one I watch is Hell's Kitchen because I just not Hell's Kitchen.
[01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:52.420]   The original one, the kitchen nightmares.
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:57.020]   I love watching Gordon Ramsay lay into restaurant owners.
[01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:59.820]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:00.820]   That's about it.
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:01.820]   Okay, it's our five.
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:04.180]   The show is over.
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:05.740]   I got 15 minutes to wrap this up.
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:10.580]   I'm not stopping this telethon until we raise $40 million, just $1 more than last year.
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:12.580]   Let's help these kids.
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:14.980]   I think last week we had did like an eight hour show.
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:15.980]   It was.
[01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:19.260]   It was really long and I was really trying to cut this one back, but it's failed once
[01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:20.260]   again.
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:23.420]   I swear to God, I'm going to have to buy like a box of like cliff energy bars just to make
[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:24.980]   sure that I've got the protein.
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:25.980]   Let's move fast here.
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:26.980]   Let's move fast.
[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:28.660]   We're going to do our picks of the week in just a second.
[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:32.300]   First though, before we do the lightning round, we're going to take a look at audible.com
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:33.860]   audible.com/macbreak.
[01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:39.180]   That's the place to go if you want to get a load of some beautiful, beautiful audio entertainment.
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:43.340]   I'm going to talk at 70,000 titles, the best books in the world.
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:44.980]   No one has time for reading anymore.
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:51.540]   I mean, our lives are busy, but audible makes it possible for me to read and get a lot of
[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:52.540]   reading done.
[01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:53.540]   I just love that.
[01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:56.500]   I think we need to start calling it absorb information.
[01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.180]   Yeah, because that's kind of what it's like.
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:00.620]   Especially because they use such great readers.
[01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:05.620]   You really can't.
[01:29:05.620 --> 01:29:11.220]   I'm thinking about this new Bill McKibben, which just came out for Earth Day.
[01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:16.860]   But let's ask Andy Enoco what he's reading these days because Andy's like the big audible
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:17.860]   reader.
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:22.420]   Well, you know, in big fan of movies, I just came across one that was published a couple
[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:27.340]   of years ago called Pictures at a Revolution, Five Movies and the Birth of New Hollywood
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:29.780]   by Mark Harris.
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:32.820]   First thing out the door, 17 hours, 25 minutes.
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:33.820]   Yeah.
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:35.580]   Area go value for money there.
[01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:39.700]   But it's such a great premise, such a great way to like take a look at the transition
[01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:41.980]   between old Hollywood and new Hollywood.
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:47.980]   What the author does is he takes this one year, 1965 and looks at tell stories about
[01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:52.220]   the makings of each of the five different nominated movies for Best Picture this year.
[01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:53.380]   Great.
[01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:55.700]   Because it was a very, very wide.
[01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:59.100]   It was such a wide swathe.
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:03.620]   Anytime you got in the heat of the night and Dr. Doolittle in the same list.
[01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:07.420]   So, yeah, I guess who's coming to dinner, the graduate and the heat of the night, Dr.
[01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:09.460]   Doolittle and Bonnie and Clyde.
[01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:11.300]   And you can hardly fix it.
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:14.980]   He makes a great case that each one sort of represents a different segment of Hollywood
[01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:15.980]   at that time.
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:16.980]   Yes.
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:19.940]   Guess who's coming to dinner, which would have been a really epic shaking movie had it
[01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:26.940]   been released in 1959, 1960, but was sort of at the back edge of the curve in 1967,
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:30.500]   the graduate, which is part of the sort of Neelistic, like we're going to have an ending
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:34.020]   that's not an ending and we're going to sort of shake up everything you're expecting
[01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:35.020]   about an anti-hero.
[01:30:35.020 --> 01:30:36.020]   Right.
[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:37.020]   Then he get where did the held it?
[01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:42.580]   Dr. Doolittle come out of horrible movies, you know, and just it would be over like old
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:48.540]   fashion movies about things that happened to the animals to the animal.
[01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:49.540]   This is Rex Harrison.
[01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:55.180]   It was if I couldn't talk to the animals, imagine it.
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:59.180]   My style of singing is really more like talking, but it is really very English, but I'm talking
[01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:00.180]   talking talking.
[01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:06.820]   So it's good for fans to film because it really was like one of those periods in which
[01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:08.540]   just the whole industry changed.
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:13.180]   What would work with audiences just change within this five, six, seven year period.
[01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:18.220]   But also it's got that really cool, really, really cool, just embarrassing stories.
[01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:22.860]   There's a quote that I've actually highlighted that rather it's from a review, but I remember
[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:26.780]   the section that it appeared in, where it formed the South Rex Harrison quote, "A
[01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:32.100]   poem full of Hollywood establishment types at a restaurant by," singing obscene lyrics
[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:35.460]   about his penis to the tune of "I've grown accustomed to her face."
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:36.460]   Oh, geez.
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:37.460]   Oh, geez.
[01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:38.820]   Oh, wait for it.
[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:43.060]   While his wife, Rachel Roberts, quote, "Who is not wearing underwear did handstands."
[01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:44.060]   Oh.
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:46.060]   There you go.
[01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:48.060]   Here's a Hollywood party for you.
[01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:49.460]   What's really like my job?
[01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:52.460]   You bet your ass.
[01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:54.260]   Robert Evans is in everything, isn't he?
[01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:55.260]   I think.
[01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:57.740]   He must have slept with at least eight of the people in any given page.
[01:31:57.740 --> 01:31:58.740]   Wow.
[01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:03.380]   You know, as you're doing the hour and 50 minute damn commute to work in the back of the day,
[01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:05.180]   that's all you really want.
[01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:09.180]   That makes you pull into your employee parking space, smile on your face that your co-workers
[01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:13.540]   will never understand, and that you can never repeat if you don't want to be sued for some
[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:14.540]   relief reference.
[01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:15.540]   It's true.
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:16.540]   What a great choice.
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:17.540]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:20.300]   I've been reading all the movie books you've recommended all along, and this was definitely
[01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:22.260]   on my next read list.
[01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:26.300]   Visit a revolution, five movies in the birth of the new Hollywood by Mark Harris, 17 and

[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:50.500]   Audible.com/Mac.
[01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:55.940]   Andy, do you have a pick of the week you want to launch us in?
[01:32:55.940 --> 01:33:01.580]   Yes, it's a hardware pick of the week because I just found out that this computer right
[01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:07.020]   here, the Dell Mini 10V has been discontinued by Dell.
[01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:10.540]   At least if you go to the Dell website, you can no longer order it.
[01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:16.900]   And this was this, the Dell Mini 10V is a very, very special kind of network because
[01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:23.260]   it is hands down the easiest and most successful Windows netbook that you can hack and toss.
[01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:28.740]   Once you perform a very, very simple and straightforward, very linear procedure, you
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:30.620]   can install a snow leopard on this.
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:35.060]   And basically every piece of hardware inside this notebook will work just fine.
[01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:38.380]   And it's the closest thing you will ever get to a Mac netbook.
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:42.060]   And the payoff is that you can buy these, although it seems to have disappeared from
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:43.060]   Dell's site.
[01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:47.540]   If you go to Amazon.com, you can still see multiple vendors that are selling this for
[01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:50.860]   $300, $250, $350.
[01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:56.900]   So if you have someone that needs to have a Mac book, but you really can't convince yourself
[01:33:56.900 --> 01:34:01.500]   to spend $1000 on it, or if you need something that is a little less pricey to travel with
[01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:06.500]   because you just need something better, a little bit more notebooky than an iPad, the
[01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:10.660]   10V, as long as you have a certain amount of technical know-how, is a very, very simple
[01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:15.420]   and very, very easy machine to convert into a running Mac.
[01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:16.860]   So it's off the priceless right now.
[01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:21.260]   It's not the only netbook that can be adapted to run Mac software, but it's the one where
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:25.660]   once you're done, essentially you have a fully functional Mac netbook.
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:28.980]   So a great price, great value built really, really well.
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:32.700]   If you ever thought about that, then this is the time to get in.
[01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:39.020]   One important note to make sure you know the difference between a Dell Mini 10 and a 10V.
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:40.200]   The V is for victory.
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:45.380]   The V is for very important that you get this one and not the Dell Mini 10 because the 10V
[01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:49.440]   can very, very quickly and very, very easily be hackintosh the Dell Mini 10.
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:51.740]   Nothing can basically do nothing.
[01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:52.740]   Don't get it.
[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:53.740]   It'll be very, very, very, very...
[01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:54.740]   That's good to know.
[01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:55.740]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:59.700]   Is there a site that you go to to learn about all, you know, all of the ways to do this and
[01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:00.700]   so forth?
[01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:05.300]   Yeah, there's a website just for the Dell Mini.
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:06.300]   I believe it's Mini.
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:12.140]   They're going to make me look for it.
[01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:13.780]   I'll tell you what, let you look.
[01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:15.660]   I'll come back and let me look.
[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:16.660]   I'm sorry.
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:18.820]   It's mydellmini.com.
[01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:23.140]   It's not run by Dell or anybody else, but it has really exhaustive instructions on how
[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:24.380]   to hackintosh it.
[01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:26.020]   Every time there's been...
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:33.100]   I hackintosh, my first one, which is a Dell Mini 9, and every time there was a system update,
[01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:38.340]   I would always sort of hold off, go to the go to mydellmini.com forums, find other people
[01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:43.220]   who'd already done it to find out what will I lose, what will blow up if I try to hack
[01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:48.100]   and upgrade the OS, because after you've hackintosh the thing, you can do system updates just through
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:50.820]   system updater, just like you want on a regular Mac.
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:54.500]   So it's great information, great support, and it'll hold your hand throughout the entire
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:55.500]   thing.
[01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:56.500]   Very cool.
[01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:59.660]   Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week, my friend.
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:02.900]   So I have an inexpensive one and an expensive one.
[01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:03.900]   I'll start with the inexpensive one.
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:04.900]   Part for the course.
[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:05.900]   Yes.
[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:08.180]   So I have to recommend...
[01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:09.180]   I just think...
[01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:10.180]   I don't think I recommended this before.
[01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:13.140]   I think I'm going to talk about it, but cat in the hat.
[01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:14.140]   For the iPad?
[01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:15.140]   Cat in the hat.
[01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:16.140]   Is that the one?
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:17.140]   Dr. Seuss, cat in the hat.
[01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:19.060]   Because I've been playing with the Alice in Wonderland.
[01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:23.780]   No, Alice in Wonderland is great, but cat in the hat is my son loves it.
[01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:24.780]   And here's the thing.
[01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:27.980]   You swipe it and it does zooms into the different parts of the pages.
[01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:29.660]   So it's the same classic cat in the hat.
[01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:31.020]   It will actually read it as well.
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:32.540]   So you can have it read out loud.
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:36.860]   Which I don't like as much because I feel like that's what I should be doing with him.
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:41.780]   So I read it, but he loves getting up there and swiping it with his finger.
[01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:43.260]   Figuring out how to change the...
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:44.580]   Go into the next thing.
[01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:48.540]   You can click on different items and it'll say milk, hat.
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:52.060]   So he can connect all those things with little words coming up.
[01:36:52.060 --> 01:36:53.660]   And he loves it.
[01:36:53.660 --> 01:37:01.900]   And I just think it's again going back to paper books seems pretty antiquated after that.
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:05.340]   So because I have a lot of the Doctor's News books that I've been reading to them.
[01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:07.180]   I'm just waiting for green eggs and ham.
[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:08.180]   I'm just waiting for green eggs and ham.
[01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:11.020]   I can't wait to read that one.
[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:13.420]   But anyway, so cat in the hat, it's $2.99.
[01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:16.740]   I'm hoping that we're going to see all the Doctor's News ones as a father.
[01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:19.060]   Because I think that it's great.
[01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:24.860]   Now on the more expensive round, this one is a little pricey, but you can download a demo.
[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:26.980]   And it's worth just checking out.
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:31.780]   So Autodesk has released an application called Smoke.
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:37.700]   Now for those of you Autodesk bought a company called Discrete and Discrete had this huge,
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:39.220]   very, very high end.
[01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:43.620]   And we're talking $1,500 an hour to have someone work on one of these things.
[01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:47.580]   A very, very high end called, you know, there's a flint in the flame and smoke was the smaller.
[01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:48.580]   Right, right.
[01:37:48.580 --> 01:37:49.580]   We use these like a tech TV.
[01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:50.580]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:53.380]   These guys usually you sit in there and they do all these effects and there's all this stuff
[01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:54.380]   going on.
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:55.860]   It's like super high end.
[01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:56.860]   Everything's in real time.
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:57.860]   Everything's...
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:37:59.780]   And they have done something pretty revolutionary.
[01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:02.180]   Most of these things have been mostly on Linux.
[01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:05.380]   And they've been on these big boxes that they make.
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:11.380]   And they're experimenting with the idea of porting some of these to the Mac.
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:13.300]   And so this is the first time this has been done.
[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:14.780]   And so Smoke is one of...
[01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:18.820]   It's the smallest of the bunch, but it's still a big system.
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:20.660]   So you can actually get it from Mac.
[01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:21.620]   Now you're going to want to Mac Pro.
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:22.620]   You can run it on your laptop.
[01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:24.780]   So you can totally run it on your laptop and play with it.
[01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:28.620]   You're not going to get the full performance unless you, you know, soup up your Mac Pro
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:30.500]   to, you know, with an Nvidia card and everything else.
[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:33.500]   You're not going to get the kind of performance you get with a hardware box.
[01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:34.500]   But you can play with it.
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:39.340]   And what you're looking at is it's a window into a whole different level of high end production.
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:44.340]   Even if you're using After Effects or Shake or something, the type of performance and
[01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:45.740]   type of things you see in commercials.
[01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:49.900]   It's worth downloading the demo and playing with it and going through some of the tutorials
[01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:51.620]   that they have online.
[01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:55.020]   Just as it is more fun than anything else, I know a lot of people who are listening are
[01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:56.020]   not going to buy it.
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:58.820]   Price is $15,000.
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:38:59.820]   Okay.
[01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:00.820]   Thanks Alex.
[01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:02.820]   Could you just say that up front?
[01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:05.220]   You know, but does that include hardware?
[01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:07.140]   No, no, that's just a software.
[01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:08.660]   So will it run on my Dell Mini 10V?
[01:39:08.660 --> 01:39:09.660]   Yeah.
[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:12.900]   But the thing is, is that what I will say though, is that is there's a demo.
[01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:14.020]   There's like a 30 day demo.
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:15.180]   You can download it and play with it.
[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:16.620]   It's just fun to play with.
[01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:18.820]   It is a very, very powerful application.
[01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:19.820]   It's fun to get a glimpse at.
[01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:24.180]   Now if you're working in a school or your student, the education, I don't know what the
[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:26.180]   educational price is, but it's extremely aggressive.
[01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:28.780]   I mean, we're talking hundreds of dollars.
[01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:29.780]   Oh, okay.
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:33.620]   So if you're, they are very aggressive about getting, you know, working with schools,
[01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:37.420]   working with, and I think, by the way, that's 25 Alex's or one, or one Scott born.
[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:38.420]   It is the most expensive.
[01:39:38.420 --> 01:39:39.420]   Yeah.
[01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:40.420]   No, I think it's two stock.
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:41.420]   Scott born is a 7,000.
[01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:45.340]   So the, but it is the most expensive thing.
[01:39:45.340 --> 01:39:46.340]   I think we pick, I don't know.
[01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:50.060]   I think Scott picked something that was like $60,000 one top, but this is, this is
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:51.300]   definitely the most expensive one.
[01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:55.620]   But as I said, I don't expect a lot of people to use it, like buy it immediately.
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:56.620]   I could.
[01:39:56.620 --> 01:40:00.780]   But, but, but I do think that that I wonder, I wonder what people know it was there and
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:03.700]   that it would be, you know, and, and they should go up and check it out and just download
[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:04.700]   the demo and play with it.
[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:05.700]   It's fun.
[01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:07.500]   It's just a little something that you're going to.
[01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:11.940]   And as Kineko points out in the chat room, there is a discount if you buy a hundred seats.
[01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:12.940]   Yeah.
[01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:15.340]   You get, you get like half off or something.
[01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:16.340]   Half off.
[01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:17.340]   So yeah.
[01:40:17.340 --> 01:40:19.540]   So any nine friends together who would much rather have this software than a car.
[01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:24.900]   And I got to show you this video from Art Axias who, who responded immediately to our
[01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:30.300]   call and has prepared, oh, what's happening on my, my book, is it frozen?
[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:31.300]   There it is.
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:35.700]   Has prepared this little video for us based on a Tiger Woods video.
[01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:37.700]   Tiger.
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:47.380]   I am more prone to be inquisitive to promote discussion.
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:51.260]   I want to find out what your thinking was.
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:52.260]   It's so sad.
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:55.140]   I want to find out what your feelings are.
[01:40:55.140 --> 01:40:56.140]   Oh boy.
[01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:59.540]   And did you learn anything?
[01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:00.540]   Yeah.
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:05.460]   Don't get celebrate my party in the birthday in the bar with my phone anymore.
[01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:09.460]   Merlin, man, your pick of the week.
[01:41:09.460 --> 01:41:10.940]   Oh, hi.
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:11.940]   Um, yeah.
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:12.940]   I, you know what?
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:16.460]   I've got one that's a, a Mackie and one that's not and I'm going to give you the Mackie one
[01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:17.460]   so I can talk about putting it on.
[01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:21.100]   I want you to give me though, though, the, the thing that you were talking about.
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:22.100]   Do you?
[01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:23.340]   Is that an email thing?
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:24.340]   Yeah.
[01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:25.340]   Yeah.
[01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:27.300]   I, I learned about this on a Nick Dettin site called Life Hacker.
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:30.540]   I was looking for something else and I discovered this on their site to give them credit.
[01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:31.540]   That's right.
[01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:34.340]   We should give credit to Nick for one good site.
[01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:36.540]   Um, I like Gina.
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:37.540]   Okay.
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:39.100]   A lot.
[01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:40.100]   I like Gina.
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:41.100]   Don't we all love Gina?
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:42.100]   It's so hard.
[01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:44.660]   There's not enough brackets in the world for me to separate Gina from my feelings about
[01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:45.660]   Gocker.
[01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:48.700]   Um, uh, so this is amazing.
[01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:50.460]   Uh, Gmail is great.
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:51.460]   I love Gmail.
[01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:57.020]   I, it's mind boggling to me when I go into companies and everybody there, um, is compelled
[01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:59.860]   to use outlook just because of, you know, there's a lot of good reasons.
[01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:02.860]   I mean, obviously there's the, you know, kind of exchange piece, you know, and there's
[01:42:02.860 --> 01:42:06.460]   a lot of companies that are sort of addicted to that culture of putting, you know, as an
[01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:09.100]   instance on other people's calendars, which makes my head hurt.
[01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:13.340]   But, you know, gosh, again, I just have to start with a meta recommendation for Gmail just
[01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:18.740]   because if you learn those keys, JK, bracket, bracket, I mean, go learn them just, I know
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:22.140]   you think you know it from reader, but no, go really, really, really learn them.
[01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:26.500]   Learn L for label and then select a label with, with no, uh, mouse mind blowing.
[01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:29.460]   Um, and one of the best things about Gmail obviously is the filtering.
[01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:32.820]   And there's a lot you can do with filters, but there are some things about filters where
[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:36.500]   let's be honest, it doesn't touch Microsoft Outlook in particular.
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:41.020]   Outlook is to my mind next to maybe Eudora again is just so great because Thunderbird
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:42.780]   is another great one.
[01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:44.940]   But you know, there's certain things I've always wished I could do.
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:48.700]   Long story short, there's now a service out there called, I believe it's pronounced Siffer,
[01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:51.740]   S-Y-P-H-I-R.
[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:56.220]   And you sign up using OAuth, I think this is one of the very first OAuth apps for Gmail.
[01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:57.220]   You go in and you sign up.
[01:42:57.220 --> 01:43:01.900]   So basically all it's doing is, you know, kind of, um, you know, using it to sign you
[01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:05.420]   in, but all the transactions as I understand it are happening, I guess, through Gmail,
[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:06.420]   whatever.
[01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:07.420]   I'm not a security expert.
[01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:12.100]   Point being you go in and this, let's, this exposes data, exposes stuff to filters
[01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:13.700]   that is not available right now in Gmail.
[01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:15.620]   And I'll tell you a couple.
[01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:18.100]   Uh, gosh, where do I begin?
[01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:19.980]   Does this need a reply?
[01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:24.100]   It uses what it, I think they call it Secret Sauce or Magic or something, but it basically
[01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:28.580]   looks at your email and to the best of its ability says, does this need a response, does
[01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:31.700]   this not need a response or does this maybe need a response?
[01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:32.860]   It's kind of neat.
[01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:35.780]   I'm guessing it looks for things like question marks and things like that, but whatever,
[01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:38.660]   it's so far, it's worked like surprisingly well.
[01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:39.660]   Wow.
[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:40.660]   So, I'm going to do this.
[01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:44.580]   If you are an inbox zero guy and you should be inbox zero.com, look it up.
[01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:48.220]   Um, you know that there's all kinds of things where you want extra control over when you
[01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:50.660]   see stuff and whether you see stuff.
[01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:55.420]   And most importantly, the thing I cannot say enough, when do you really need to be notified
[01:43:55.420 --> 01:43:56.420]   about stuff?
[01:43:56.420 --> 01:44:01.220]   Because right now it's a pretty blind instrument unless you just make stuff go to a folder and
[01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:02.660]   you just never see it.
[01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:04.940]   But what about stuff where you need a little more nuance than that?
[01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:09.460]   Well, let me give you a few things that this will, this will, uh, will filter on.
[01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:13.420]   How many recipients does this have attachments?
[01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:15.060]   And if so, how many?
[01:44:15.060 --> 01:44:18.140]   What time of day did it, um, arrive?
[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:26.020]   Um, so for example, I could say I take all messages that were to one recipient and let
[01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:31.620]   that one recipient equal any of these emails, which are me and those, for example, are the
[01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:33.540]   only ones I want you to send to my iPhone.
[01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:37.780]   There's a companion iPhone app for this that will give you notifications based on the amount
[01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:39.580]   of sensitivity that you're comfortable with.
[01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:40.580]   That's good.
[01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:41.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:42.580]   Oh, how about this?
[01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:45.300]   Uh, anything that went to more than more than five people and has an attachment, don't
[01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:47.700]   show me until after five p.m.
[01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:52.020]   Anything from Facebook, anything that has more than 10 recipients, send it straight
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:53.020]   to archive.
[01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:54.460]   You see what I'm going with this?
[01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:55.460]   I do.
[01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:56.860]   Pretty nuanced stuff in here.
[01:44:56.860 --> 01:45:00.220]   Now the one that they're going to add to this that I think Alex, people like Alex and
[01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:02.620]   I are going to love, oh, there's even one there.
[01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:03.620]   It's really cool.
[01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:07.220]   You can actually just say give a one, two or three star, you know, to this based on how
[01:45:07.220 --> 01:45:09.540]   important it looks.
[01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:16.060]   So another one that they're adding, supposedly adding soon is how long since it arrived.
[01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:20.980]   And boy, wouldn't you love if you had a commitment to this to say, if there's any email in my
[01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:26.140]   inbox that's been there for more than end days, archive it without me even having to
[01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:27.140]   look.
[01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:28.140]   Hmm.
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:29.140]   Is that irresponsible?
[01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:30.140]   That would be huge.
[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:31.140]   Huge.
[01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:32.140]   Huge.
[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:33.140]   Because I don't even want to have to look at it.
[01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:34.140]   I don't know.
[01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:36.260]   I could get to index zero and just without answering anything, just throw them out.
[01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:37.260]   It's a start.
[01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:40.100]   But you know what I used to for?
[01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:41.700]   Here's one I did yesterday that I love.
[01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:42.700]   So are you getting this?
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:46.540]   There's an app on your phone and you tell Siffer that only when these conditions are
[01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:48.100]   met do I want to be notified.
[01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:52.020]   And so for example, I go in and I have a bunch of people who are like current clients
[01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:56.500]   I'm working with all go into one bracket with pipes and anytime an email from them arrives
[01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:57.660]   it goes to my phone.
[01:45:57.660 --> 01:45:59.500]   My wife always goes straight to my phone.
[01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:00.900]   But this one, check it out.
[01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:02.380]   Siri, the much beloved Siri.
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:03.380]   Yeah, love Siri.
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:08.140]   So that if it's from Siri.com and includes reminder in the subject line, it sends it to
[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:09.140]   my phone.
[01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:10.140]   So what does that mean?
[01:46:10.140 --> 01:46:15.140]   I'm on the go and I say remind me to take my daughter out of the washer in five minutes.
[01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:18.140]   It's going to send that and then that notification will come to my phone.
[01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:23.740]   So I think this is super promising and it could certainly be abused, but it's a terrific
[01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:25.740]   way to add an extra bit of stuff.
[01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:27.660]   Go ahead and all you have to do really is go and log in.
[01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:28.660]   It's OAuth.
[01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:31.900]   I don't know much about OAuth, but it seems a little bit safer than the usual.
[01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:36.300]   The safer is free, but the smart push iPhone app is $3.
[01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:37.300]   Yeah.
[01:46:37.300 --> 01:46:40.220]   But even if you just use it for Gmail, I mean stuff like don't show me anything that's
[01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:42.780]   got an attachment and went to more than five people.
[01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:43.780]   Wow.
[01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:45.740]   I mean, okay.
[01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:46.740]   So anyway, I love it.
[01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:47.740]   I'm loving it.
[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:48.740]   I'm signing in right now.
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:50.700]   I'm going to get an account that looks really very useful.
[01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:53.700]   If you got to use Gmail to make it useful, obviously.
[01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:54.700]   What kind of?
[01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:55.700]   But think about what Gmail is.
[01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:56.700]   Gmail is more than a web app.
[01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:58.540]   It could come from anywhere.
[01:46:58.540 --> 01:47:00.900]   Well, Gmail is iMap is what it is.
[01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:05.220]   So this could be any if you're using Google Apps or any other way where all your emails
[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:07.580]   kind of being created in this one place.
[01:47:07.580 --> 01:47:11.140]   You can do all your all your Futsi proc mail type stuff right here on Gmail and then just
[01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:12.140]   walk away.
[01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:13.140]   Oh.
[01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:14.140]   Love it.
[01:47:14.140 --> 01:47:15.140]   S-Y-P-H-I-R.
[01:47:15.140 --> 01:47:16.140]   I'm not sure what their model is.
[01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:17.140]   It's pretty sight.
[01:47:17.140 --> 01:47:20.740]   It looks like they're using, I don't know what that face is, but it's nice.
[01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:21.740]   It is.
[01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:22.740]   It's very pretty.
[01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:23.740]   Okay.
[01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:24.740]   And then here's another one.
[01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:25.740]   One more super quick.
[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:26.740]   Okay.
[01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:27.740]   Sync, Sync, Man.
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:28.740]   Synchronize address book with Gmail.
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:32.540]   I have terrible, terrible luck getting Gmail contacts and address book to play well together.
[01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:33.820]   It's been totally crap.
[01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:35.460]   This one's really short and simple.
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:36.980]   It's a little thing you buy.
[01:47:36.980 --> 01:47:38.580]   It's $14.99.
[01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:44.260]   And you pick how you want synchronizing to happen between your address book and Gmail.
[01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:45.820]   Should Gmail always win?
[01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:48.380]   Should Gmail also include suggested contacts?
[01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:50.180]   Should it just do the delta between the two?
[01:47:50.180 --> 01:47:51.420]   Should a address book always win?
[01:47:51.420 --> 01:47:55.500]   I'll spoil the ending by saying I've gone straight to let Gmail always win because I
[01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:58.580]   don't have confidence anymore in the Mac apps.
[01:47:58.580 --> 01:48:04.700]   But it's fantastic and it's really good at dealing with duplicates so much better.
[01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:05.700]   Duplicates to me are huge.
[01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:10.060]   I get duplicates all the time, mainly because Google's really weird about how the company
[01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:11.700]   field works.
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:14.940]   But if you do a little bit of cleanup, even without a little bit of cleanup, Sync Man
[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:16.940]   works great and you can say do it every 15 minutes.
[01:48:16.940 --> 01:48:20.060]   So spell is where and where can I find it?
[01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:27.660]   It's watery.net which is w-a-t-e-r-e-e.net/syncman.
[01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:31.900]   And Sync Man, that's why NCMAN is one word.
[01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:34.740]   And what's nice is if you want to go in and kind of it'll do this all in the background
[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:36.620]   or you can say, hey, show me what just happened.
[01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:41.100]   If I just had a huge change in my address book, let me go to monitor the update.
[01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:45.500]   And it shows you basically in the same way that the changes app would, like left and
[01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:48.580]   right, which way or change is going to happen.
[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:52.180]   I got to be honest, guys, I'm moving more and more of my stuff over to Google stuff.
[01:48:52.180 --> 01:48:53.180]   Yeah, I already have.
[01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:59.780]   It might be at some point, but the dig that I will slip in here is that I don't see the
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:02.780]   care and the maintenance for the Apple products.
[01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:07.900]   Now, if you have Snow Leopard, address book does synchronize with Google.
[01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:08.900]   Not very well.
[01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:09.900]   But just not well.
[01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:10.900]   Okay.
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:11.900]   So this is a superior way to do it.
[01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:14.100]   It's the same opportunity that the Busy Mac guy's came up with.
[01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:15.540]   Busy Cal and Busy Sync.
[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:19.700]   So this is, I mean, I'm sure everybody involved would hate me saying this, but it's very
[01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:23.180]   analogous to what Busy Cal Busy Sync did for Google Calendar.
[01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:24.260]   And we broke Siffer.
[01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:27.180]   So let's hope we don't break watery as well.
[01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:28.180]   Oh, no, really?
[01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:29.980]   Well, powerful man, Leo.
[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:32.220]   A lot of people go to those sites when you're the power.
[01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:33.620]   People say, Merlin recommends it.
[01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:34.860]   I don't want to provoke you.
[01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:37.100]   That's working for me.
[01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:40.340]   Bug Clothes.
[01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:41.340]   Thank you, Merlin, man.
[01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:42.340]   Sorry, that was long.
[01:49:42.340 --> 01:49:43.340]   No, no, no, no.
[01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:49.580]   And we're running because we want to get to a special on the ash in just a bit.
[01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:52.580]   But before we do, I'm going to give you a quick pick.
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:50:00.020]   I had been looking for a news reader that would work with my Google reader, but would
[01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:03.700]   also allow me to, on the iPad, bookmark to delicious and instant paper and all that
[01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:04.700]   stuff.
[01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:05.700]   And I found one and I love it.
[01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:06.700]   It's called News Rack.
[01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:09.500]   And I just wanted to mention that because I had been looking and we've been using Net
[01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:15.660]   News Rock Wire and I love these guys and I had figured that they probably would, you
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:19.180]   know, update Net News Wire to use delicious and all that stuff because it does on the
[01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:20.180]   desktop.
[01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:22.340]   But this is OMZ software.
[01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:29.140]   It's a German company, OMZ-software.de or just search for News Rack.
[01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:33.700]   There's an iPhone as well as an iPad version of this and it has Twitter, delicious and
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:35.020]   instant paper support built in.
[01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:37.860]   And that's how I picked all the shows stories for this week.
[01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:38.860]   Nice.
[01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:39.860]   I like it.
[01:50:39.860 --> 01:50:41.700]   Have you tried Reader?
[01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:42.900]   Just plain old Reader?
[01:50:42.900 --> 01:50:43.900]   R-D-E-R?
[01:50:43.900 --> 01:50:44.900]   No.
[01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:45.900]   You like that one?
[01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:46.900]   I'll take a look.
[01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:48.380]   I know, I'm not trying to heist your pick.
[01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:49.380]   No, heist it.
[01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:50.380]   Heist away.
[01:50:50.380 --> 01:50:51.380]   He's really pretty.
[01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:57.220]   Well, I'm sure what I love about Reader is 2.0 of Reader is mind bilingly great.
[01:50:57.220 --> 01:50:58.860]   It's made some, it's added some polish.
[01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:00.420]   The reason I use it is precisely for the same idea.
[01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:02.420]   It's an iPhone, not an iPad though.
[01:51:02.420 --> 01:51:03.420]   That's a good question.
[01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:06.180]   No, I don't have an iPad version of it yet.
[01:51:06.180 --> 01:51:07.180]   That sucks.
[01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:13.500]   The reason I love it is in particular is the bookmarking on it is...
[01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:17.380]   See, that's key to me is how it's one thing to read this stuff and I've got a lot.
[01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:19.020]   There's so many great iPad apps that look pretty.
[01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:20.020]   Look at that.
[01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:21.660]   You've got Google Note, you've got Pinboard.
[01:51:21.660 --> 01:51:22.660]   Oh, sorry.
[01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:23.660]   Can you see that?
[01:51:23.660 --> 01:51:24.660]   I don't know if you're going to read it.
[01:51:24.660 --> 01:51:25.660]   Pinboard, email this.
[01:51:25.660 --> 01:51:26.660]   It's backwards.
[01:51:26.660 --> 01:51:27.660]   Does it have delicious?
[01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:28.660]   It had delicious.
[01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:29.660]   It's got delicious.
[01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:30.660]   It's got share this for my RSS.
[01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:31.660]   Copy links.
[01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:32.660]   Safari, mail link.
[01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:33.660]   So they do an iPad version.
[01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:37.140]   I am so there, but they unfortunately are iPhone only right now.
[01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:39.500]   And it does that tweet gesture thing.
[01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:41.180]   So you can left and right swipe.
[01:51:41.180 --> 01:51:42.380]   Oh, focus here.
[01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:45.780]   You can left and right swipe to market as well.
[01:51:45.780 --> 01:51:49.140]   The one problem I have, and this is a problem with Newsreck, I have so many feeds that
[01:51:49.140 --> 01:51:51.620]   it really kind of bogs and I've got to really cut my feeds.
[01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:52.780]   This thing is really good.
[01:51:52.780 --> 01:51:53.780]   Is it fast?
[01:51:53.780 --> 01:51:54.780]   Yeah.
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:57.580]   Go Google Reader 2 and you'll see there's been lots of reviews of it.
[01:51:57.580 --> 01:51:58.580]   But yours is great too.
[01:51:58.580 --> 01:51:59.580]   That Newsreck is gorgeous looking.
[01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:00.580]   It's very...
[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:03.380]   Well, it gets the job done.
[01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:04.580]   We could do iPad apps all day.
[01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:06.460]   I mean, there's so many great...
[01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:07.460]   We should do an iPad app.
[01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:09.020]   I mean, we should buy me an iPad.
[01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:10.020]   Huh?
[01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:11.220]   Somebody should buy me an iPad.
[01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:12.220]   Somebody should.
[01:52:12.220 --> 01:52:13.220]   Somebody should.
[01:52:13.220 --> 01:52:14.940]   I'll give it back.
[01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:15.940]   Buy Merlin and iPad.
[01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:18.940]   There's a fun application called Sky Grid.
[01:52:18.940 --> 01:52:20.580]   And I don't really know who these people are.
[01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:23.220]   And I can't use it because it doesn't do delicious.
[01:52:23.220 --> 01:52:26.540]   But it's very interesting because there's somehow some sort of algorithm.
[01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:28.460]   You don't give it your feeds or anything.
[01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:32.500]   There's some sort of algorithm to say what's hot right now.
[01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:37.660]   And they have sports entertainment, politics, science, tech, movies, TV.
[01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:40.060]   And it's just even clicking the celebrity category.
[01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:42.500]   You can see what people are talking about.
[01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:44.140]   And so it's kind of a cool...
[01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:46.340]   I think it's a free iPad app.
[01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:49.020]   I downloaded it and I didn't quite get it.
[01:52:49.020 --> 01:52:50.020]   It's just like...
[01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:51.020]   Cool.
[01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:53.660]   It's like tech main for the world.
[01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:55.620]   Yeah.
[01:52:55.620 --> 01:52:56.620]   It's simple.
[01:52:56.620 --> 01:52:58.220]   It doesn't do the main thing I need.
[01:52:58.220 --> 01:53:00.180]   You can email stuff out, but you can't...
[01:53:00.180 --> 01:53:03.340]   To me without delicious, it's kind of useless.
[01:53:03.340 --> 01:53:05.140]   Yeah, I'm there with you.
[01:53:05.140 --> 01:53:07.300]   There's a lot of good news apps.
[01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:11.900]   And Andy, I finally got Comicsology's comics and I bought all of the...
[01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:12.900]   Is that the one you like?
[01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:15.100]   I don't know which one you like best, Andy.
[01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:18.460]   I think the Comicsology and Iver are my two favorites.
[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:20.140]   What I'm waiting for is...
[01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:24.540]   A lot of people waiting for is a really, really well polished, just generic comic book file
[01:53:24.540 --> 01:53:26.780]   reader app for the iPad.
[01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:31.300]   And there are two or three different companies who are making versions of their iPhone editions
[01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:32.300]   for the iPad.
[01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:35.100]   None that have really just absolutely nailed it yet.
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:38.980]   I have to say though, this is the same engine I believe that Marvel is using.
[01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:42.180]   So it's the same thing, but it's a store that includes more.
[01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:46.100]   And I bought all the kick ass episodes and I gave it to my son and he couldn't put it
[01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:47.100]   down.
[01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:48.100]   It was really cute.
[01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:49.100]   He really...
[01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:50.100]   It's really well done.
[01:53:50.100 --> 01:53:54.020]   The fact remains that anytime anybody wants to see me demonstrate comic books on the iPad,
[01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:58.580]   I never go to the plain comic book readers, always go to the Comicsology app.
[01:53:58.580 --> 01:54:00.340]   Yeah, just really nicely done.
[01:54:00.340 --> 01:54:01.340]   All right, enough.
[01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:02.340]   We're out of time.
[01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:03.940]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:04.940]   Great discussion.
[01:54:04.940 --> 01:54:06.780]   Dammit for giving so much value to our listeners.
[01:54:06.780 --> 01:54:07.780]   Damn them.
[01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:10.220]   That's why I helped it.
[01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:11.220]   You guys are too good.
[01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:12.220]   Oh no other way.
[01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:15.060]   Andy Inaco, he writes for the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:54:15.060 --> 01:54:16.060]   Read him.
[01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:17.060]   He also has a great website.
[01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:18.060]   www.cwob.com.
[01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:19.860]   Thank you, Andrew.
