[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. The gang is back Andy Renee and Lori. We will talk about the
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.760]   Apple event. Of course, the new iPhones. Guess who has the new iPhones? Their reviews coming up in
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.120]   just a little bit of Adobe Max is on. Adobe has some pretty good announcements for iOS users.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:24.880]   And we'll talk about Apple TV. They're holding Charlie Brown hostage and Andy is hopping mad.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.440]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly. Mac Break Weekly comes to you from Twitch's

[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.520]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show we cover all the latest news from Apple and the
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.600]   full team is back in the saddle. Renee Richie back from his briefings after the Apple event
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.480]   last week from youtube.com/ I brought friends Leo. You even had phones. You know, I love the blue
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:20.160]   No, you had it right upside down. There you go. I love the blue of the iPhone 12 and the iPhone
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.120]   Mini, but you won't see that on the iPhone Pro's because it's a different kind of a
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.240]   little darker. You've got specific blue. You got after your own. You're the 12 Pro. Yeah,
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.120]   and that, yeah, so you can see that those are both supposedly blue, but it's a very different blue.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.840]   Yeah, very different blue. I can't coordinate what I have, but I can do things.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.600]   Lori Gill is back from she was on assignment with Amazon Prime Day. Oh my god, are you? Are you just
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.040]   like? I'm exhausted, but I brought friends too. Oh, wow. You have the same blue, but your fingernails
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.160]   are a hell of a lot more interesting than Renee's. I know they also glow in the dark.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.520]   All the other this morning, polka dot nails. I love them. And Annie and I go and I
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:10.080]   got nothing. No nails. Well, welcome to a blue. I got my blue phone like two months ago, but welcome.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:18.640]   For those of you who were feeling blue did not see the Apple event last week. We have a just a
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.900]   from a one minute cut down.
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.860]   - Today is the beginning of a new era for iPhone.
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.300]   Today, we're bringing 5G to iPhone.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.200]   5G, 5G, 5G, 5G.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.700]   - 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, or 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, pi, 5G?
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.100]   - That's 5G in touch by the way.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.600]   - 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:04:04.720]   - 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.920]   - 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.820]   Thank you for joining us. Stay safe and have a great day.
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.740]   - So thanks to Levyn Hare on YouTube for that 5G cut down.
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.020]   We actually did our own, I think Anthony Nielsen did one.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.220]   There was a lot of 5G in that announcement.
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.620]   And oddly enough, there's not a lot of 5G in your phone.
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.780]   Although Renee, you went down the street.
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.340]   - No, so I had only LTE and then two or three days ago,
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.820]   I was looking at the Rogers map and getting angry again
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.420]   and for like two blocks around my house
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.220]   and just across the river, there is now quote unquote 5G.
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.020]   I only say quote unquote because I'm still back on LTE sometimes.
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.820]   If I go back outside, it comes back on 5G.
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.820]   Sometimes it's all the time.
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.820]   - Is it millimeter wave?
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.820]   - I've got to say, there's a stop.
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.020]   - I've got a wide band you have outside your domain.
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.020]   - Millimeter wave is only really a US thing.
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.620]   It doesn't, everyone else has enough low band and mid band
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.820]   that they don't need to do the high band.
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.020]   - I have to apologize to everyone in the rest of the world then
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.620]   for, because thanks to the, I don't know,
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.220]   how much do you think Verizon gave Apple?
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.220]   - Yeah.
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.020]   - And why would Apple even need money to get their CEO on stage
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.020]   for a couple of minutes talking about Verizon 5G?
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.420]   And boy, I mean, I feel like what went on there?
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.820]   - Like the Android vendors, when he says now 5G starts,
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.820]   they're like, we were with you since day one.
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.820]   We helped you test and pilot this.
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.820]   We put it in our phones a year ago, you jerk.
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.420]   And now you're saying it starts today.
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.820]   - Well, we should point out that what started today,
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.420]   they did something started today.
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.820]   You wouldn't know in Canada, but Verizon rolled out
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.180]   their ultra wide band, they so called nationwide 5G,
[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.020]   which is the normal, slow, not so great 5G.
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.460]   - It's twice as fast for me.
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.340]   I get twice as fast.
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.180]   - That's good.
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.700]   - That's not what you're gonna get, I think,
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.980]   in most cases in the US.
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.740]   Sasha Segan and the PC Magazine folks tested in 21 cities
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.700]   and they said, in most cases 5G is maybe a little faster.
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.620]   Most cases, it's not, in fact, in some cases.
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.140]   - Low band should be the same.
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.740]   - Or a bit, like low band?
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.940]   - Low band getting mid band?
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:13.780]   - Is that what you've got?
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.860]   - I'm getting mid band, yeah.
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:15.820]   - I don't even, I think,
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.660]   - I think, N99.
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.740]   - Is mid band deployed in the United States even?
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.820]   - T-Mobile's new N41 is really good.
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.380]   That goes up to two gigabits.
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.660]   - Okay, yeah, so, T-Mobile has it in 121 cities
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.500]   or something like that.
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.140]   So, the point being mostly that the five,
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.140]   in fact, as Sheriff Ovid in the New York Times yesterday
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.300]   had a piece saying, there's a real risk
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.220]   that all this overhyping of 5G
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.620]   is gonna really hurt it in the long run.
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.340]   The people, when we finally do get 5G,
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.100]   they're gonna be, yeah, yeah, whatever.
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.420]   - It's a point, it is LTE.
[00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.860]   - It's another marketing, yeah.
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.820]   It's another marketing term.
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:59.140]   - In my opinion, the Gs, they're not even worth talking
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.340]   about from a consumer perspective
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.540]   because we as consumers don't need it,
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.340]   don't care until it's there,
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.460]   and then we have it and we're like, oh, now I have it.
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.180]   It's not really an issue.
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.060]   - Should you buy an iPhone to get 5G?
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.260]   - If that's the only reason you're buying an iPhone
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.700]   than the no, but if you're talking about buying
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.700]   the next iPhone that's got you set
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.620]   for the next five, six years, then yeah.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.100]   If you are ready to upgrade your iPhone,
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.220]   then a 5G iPhone is definitely worth it.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:35.220]   I would say even more so, if you bought an iPhone in 2020
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.500]   that wasn't 5G, you might be a little bit mad
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.620]   five years from now that your phone isn't on 5G
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.060]   once 5G does become more prominent.
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.700]   So it's future proofing.
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.260]   Like right now it isn't a big deal,
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.460]   but I don't think that that kind of thing
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.340]   is not a consumer friendly feature.
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.900]   It's meant to just work in the background.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.180]   It doesn't make your life any different.
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.540]   Like a camera with an extra telephoto lens,
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.420]   that makes your day to day life different.
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.580]   Your 4G to 5G, even a millimeter wave,
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.300]   most people aren't gonna notice or experience the difference.
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.580]   They're just gonna kind of wake up one day and think,
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.300]   huh, I down-erloaded that faster than I thought it would.
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.260]   It's not gonna be a real noticeable thing.
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.660]   So the fact that like it's being used in marketing
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.020]   for phones at all seems a little bit.
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.300]   I mean, I know why they're doing it,
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.180]   but at the same time it's like,
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.420]   it's gonna be there whether people buy the phones for it
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:35.260]   or not.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.580]   So it's not a consumer friendly feature.
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.060]   Here's Jeffrey Fowler in San Francisco,
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.620]   Alamo Square with five phones testing 5G.
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.700]   (laughing)
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.140]   He wants to be generous here and so badly.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.660]   And of course all the antennas are interfering
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.940]   with each other, so, oh well.
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.300]   Well, that's the other thing is,
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.820]   you may be getting 400 megabit 5G right now, Renee,
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.300]   but that may be because no one's competing with you
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.140]   for themselves.
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:00.980]   I'm alone on the tower, Lee.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:01.820]   Yeah.
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.140]   So all of this is kind of--
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.340]   - I think that's a good question. - Willing me is that.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.260]   - Willing me is that. - I really wanna know,
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.060]   is the iPhone, I wanna question the premise, Lori,
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.660]   if the iPhone I buy today will have all of the features
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.460]   of a 5G phone five years from now,
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.140]   or will there be other features that does not yet have?
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.700]   It's my guess that the Qualcomm chip they're using,
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.540]   may not have everything that you would want
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.580]   in a couple of years, is that?
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.920]   - Yeah, I mean, I think-- - It's fair in that.
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.760]   - Sure.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.500]   Go ahead, Renee, first, and then Lori.
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.120]   - Oh, I was just gonna say, like,
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.160]   a lot of people said that about Android as well,
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.560]   you know, get it now in your future proofed,
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.520]   and the early modems don't work great at all on current 5G,
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.960]   and the bands that are out now, you'll still be able to use,
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.840]   but a lot of spectrum hasn't even been auctioned yet,
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.760]   and it's hard to tell--
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.400]   - So that radio you get today-- - Who's gonna end up--
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.760]   - Which bands? - May not be
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.160]   the radio you want tomorrow, I guess.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.080]   - It won't be as good.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.800]   Like, it'll be generationally the X60 that's coming next,
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.360]   we know it's gonna be 5 nanometer,
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.080]   maybe Samsung 5 nanometer for whatever that's worth,
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.880]   but it'll be smaller, more power efficient,
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.000]   when after that it'll be smaller, more power efficient.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.160]   - I'm just 'cause I'm wondering, should you,
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.640]   so that's your premise, Lori, is your future proofing,
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.440]   but maybe you'd be better off waiting a year or two
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.200]   and getting that 5G phone in 2022.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.160]   - Right, I think just like I had said,
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.960]   if the only reason you would be getting a new iPhone this year
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.800]   is 5G, I'd say no, just wait, that's not,
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.360]   just 5G is not worth upgrading for,
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.760]   and again, that's the consumer friendly--
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.680]   - So why did Apple say 5G more than two dozen times?
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.920]   - Well, a lot more than two dozen.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.920]   We saw them that, it was--
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.920]   - A lot. - 5, 6, 7 dozen, yeah, it was a lot.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.120]   I think that might've had to do two things.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.520]   One, we spent the last year and a half hearing
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.880]   about Android phones that have 5G
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.960]   and tech pundits claiming that Apple is doomed
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.120]   because their phones didn't have 5G, so that's one.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.920]   But two, I really do think just like you said,
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.560]   some kind of really nice handshake took place
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.080]   between Apple and Verizon to get them
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.040]   to talk about 5G as much as they did.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.840]   I don't know what that was about,
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.680]   but that's what that I think had in part to do with it.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.600]   Like Verizon wants everyone to talk about 5G
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.760]   because Verizon is, you know,
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.440]   they're supporting the 5G network,
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.920]   so yeah, they want that marketing.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.680]   Apple doesn't need that marketing.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.680]   You're gonna buy a phone or you're not gonna buy a phone,
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.960]   whether it's 5G or not.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.680]   Hopefully nobody is going out
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.920]   and upgrading their phones specifically for 5G only
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.360]   'cause that's a bad idea.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.200]   So it's really only the carriers that, you know,
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.040]   they're the ones that benefit from us
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.680]   talking about the marketing of 5G.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.200]   - Andy, what could, what could Verizon
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:55.000]   have possibly offered Apple needs to get all of that attention?
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.080]   It seems very odd to me.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.520]   - I think the biggest, most obvious thing is,
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.000]   and that's not completely disagreeing with Lori,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.640]   but I think marketing is a big deal about this.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.040]   We're really in the loop.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.960]   We really are hot for 5G.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.440]   We're really hot for the new iPhone,
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.880]   but the thing is all those bus ads cost money.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.240]   All those kiosk ads cost money when you walk,
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.520]   or excuse me, in the before times when used to walk
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.320]   in the South Station and every single advertising services,
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.640]   all advertising, one Verizon product
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.880]   or one Samsung product, that costs money.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.920]   So I'm sure there's a lot to do with that.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.880]   I would also speculate that they got some concessions
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:35.760]   on how the Verizon network was going to be tuned
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.800]   to make sure that the iPhone would probably
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.160]   get delivered to the best 5G performance anywhere else.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.040]   That's just speculation, but yeah, there are a lot of things.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.600]   I think this is a lot like when all the buying and scraping
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.840]   that AT&T did to get the iPhone 1 first.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.560]   Remember that they made so many changes to their network
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.720]   and so many things that they would never have done
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.600]   for another carrier.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.120]   And this is why we talked about AT&T and Verizon
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.000]   as opposed to AT&T and whatever company bought,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.440]   excuse me, a Verizon and whatever company bought AT&T
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.280]   10 years ago.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.240]   - Isn't it ironic though that Verizon turned down
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.320]   the first iPhone, Verizon?
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.640]   - Yes.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.280]   - And now all of this,
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.120]   it's too radical.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.960]   All of a sudden it's,
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.400]   here's another thing Apple got.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.480]   Chris Rock, Verizon paid,
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.520]   I think it must be $10 million
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.160]   for this two minute Chris Rock ad,
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.480]   which is an Apple ad, but it's an Apple co-op with Verizon.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.360]   So that means Verizon puts some money
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.520]   and maybe their deal was, look,
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.520]   if you put Hans on stage,
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.880]   we'll get Chris Rock for this long ad.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.320]   - Maybe it's like if you pay for it,
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.400]   we'll let you use the iPhone in your ad.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.880]   - Oh, you think?
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.400]   Yeah, all right.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.920]   Somebody had to pay for those giraffes.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.760]   That was not cheap.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.600]   I'm just saying.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.320]   - That was all Alex Lindsay.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.640]   - Yeah.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.560]   It's actually a great ad, I'm sure you've seen it,
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.640]   but you haven't seen the whole thing
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.880]   because no one's gonna show a two minute ad
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.760]   on the NFL network,
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.640]   but it definitely had,
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.760]   you're right, it's marketing, isn't it, Andy?
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.360]   This is all about,
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.920]   and do you think Apple needs this, Mark?
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.760]   Do you think Verizon just said,
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.920]   look, we are gonna be so hand in hand with you,
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.240]   you're gonna get so many ads,
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.720]   we're gonna really push it.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.000]   Is that what happened?
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.920]   - I think so.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:25.560]   I'm not saying that Apple needs to inform people
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.920]   about the existence of the iPhone,
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.240]   but every single year,
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.600]   there are, I think there were very fewer iPhone fans
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.920]   and Samsung fans and Pixel fans
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:34.800]   than you think there are.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.040]   I think that there's a great deal of fluidity
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.480]   and what someone can walk out of store with.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.760]   The other thing is that,
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.160]   I think they're also trying to get,
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.320]   this is also an interesting year to get people
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:50.320]   who maybe are every two year, every three year iPhone buyers.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.200]   The people who really can't be swayed by new features,
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.640]   the people who will buy a brand new phone
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.200]   once their screen is so cracked
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.320]   that they can't use it anymore,
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:03.480]   or they'll, they need to have their hand forced to say that,
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.320]   this is the year that I'm going to take my perfectly good
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.760]   two year old, three year old phone,
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.960]   hand it down to one of my kids
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.960]   and buy a 5G phone that I don't necessarily need,
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.760]   but now that now I really want.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.120]   - Yeah.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.960]   Yeah, well they create and demand, right?
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.440]   And, but it bugs me a little bit
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.680]   because it really is a early days for 5G
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.000]   and millimeter wave especially,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.600]   which is Verizon's special secret sauce.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.080]   What Hans was saying when he says 5G is real
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.640]   to get, just got real today,
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.280]   is not the 5 millimeter band,
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.640]   but they were rolling out low band, 600 megahertz,
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.920]   same kind of T-Mobile's using across the country.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.960]   In a lot more markets.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.960]   And they did say more markets for millimeter wave,
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.320]   but if you look at the coverage map,
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.120]   I was looking at Philadelphia,
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.000]   you can get it if you're on race street
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.640]   between 10th and 12th.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.960]   (laughing)
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.200]   It is, but this is not even--
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.800]   - And you'll find John Gruber standing there.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.680]   - Yeah, yeah, it does where Gruber's good.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:02.280]   It's not even, so the trick with millimeter wave
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.640]   is it's outdoors only because it doesn't go through anything
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.960]   including raindrops.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.720]   It doesn't go through anything
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.320]   'cause it's so high frequency.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.640]   And it's within 800 feet of the tower.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.880]   Now, I don't know if you know where your tower is,
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.720]   but if you're outdoors with an 800 feet
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.720]   of a millimeter wave tower, good news.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.080]   Except that, and you notice this for a name, right?
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.760]   The iPhone's pretty aggressive about turning off 5G.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.480]   You may even be within that millimeter wave range
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.680]   and not be using 5G.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.480]   - So it's got a feature called smart data
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.320]   and you can turn it off if you don't wanna use it,
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:40.320]   but the idea is because of the complexities of 5G,
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.440]   Apple wants to sort of abstract that away.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.240]   And what it means is if you are downloading,
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.400]   if you're streaming music and the phone is off
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.680]   and your pocket or the screen is off in your pocket,
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.880]   you don't need to be on 5G
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.280]   because 5G is still low band and mid band
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.280]   or a bit of a battery hit,
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.600]   millimeter wave is a real battery hit.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.680]   So they'll just drop you down to LTE and let you stream.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.440]   If you turn up your phone,
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.120]   tap a button to download a movie,
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.040]   it thinks you're gonna wanna do that now, now, now.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.120]   So it'll hit you to the fastest connection you can,
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.040]   both so that you get instant gratification,
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.640]   but also so the radio can race to sleep
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.400]   and reduce the power draw.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.200]   So they're trying to do,
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.880]   and they'll also do that between bands of 5G as well,
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.080]   not just 5G and LTE.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.200]   And again, you can turn it off,
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.040]   but I'm leaving it on and happily leaving it on.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.240]   - Well, and I should point out
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.520]   that that's not just Verizon playing these tricks.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.680]   So is Apple, so is Verizon
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.000]   'cause they're using DSS dynamic spectrum sharing 5G.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.840]   - Yeah.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.720]   - Which switches back and forth.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.520]   It allows them, I guess this is what, AT&T,
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.640]   it's not really 5G,
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.080]   it allows them to say 5G on an LTE tower.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.320]   With an existing LTE radio,
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.920]   it's kinda like the 5GE that T-Mobile,
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.760]   I mean, sorry, AT&T was offering.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.320]   So I just, all in all,
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.320]   I feel like they're taking us for a ride.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.780]   - Well, either we shouldn't worry about it
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.080]   or they shouldn't market it.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.400]   I mean, one of those things should be true.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.000]   - I imagine it costs, well, we shouldn't worry about it,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.600]   but the problem is being shoved down our throat.
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.960]   I imagine it adds to the bill of materials for the phone.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.840]   - Yes, significantly. - Yes,
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:09.680]   significantly. - Yes,
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.160]   significantly. - The phone itself
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.760]   has a little window cut out on the side,
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.480]   which is not for any other 5G but millimeter wave.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.000]   So-- - That's the US only, yeah.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   - Yeah, so you don't have that on your phone,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.320]   but all of us Americans have a little plastic window.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.800]   - No, but Europe has the commission sticker
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.240]   in disease on the side of their phone, which is worse.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.800]   - Yeah, I'm thrilled that they didn't--
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.480]   - They didn't grave Verizon on the phone.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.160]   They didn't go that far, thank God.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.000]   All right, enough of me bitching.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.120]   I had to just get that out of my system.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.440]   But you guys both have them.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.760]   So I imagine you have something to say about it.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.720]   Can we take a break and then we come back?
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.720]   The embargo's off, right?
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.480]   Was the embargo off today?
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.120]   - Yeah, this morning at 6 a.m.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.160]   - You did a great in-depth video,
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.240]   which by the way, you cover a lot of these 5G issues.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.520]   And Lori, I'm more, we already has its review up.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.360]   Did you do that or not?
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.320]   - Not yet, no, I just got the phones today.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.160]   So I'll have my review up, but I think this week.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.560]   - Okay.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.720]   So the reviews are starting to come out.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.000]   There are some caveats, some things people should know.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.320]   You can't currently order the pro or the mini,
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.520]   I'm throwing the max of the mini.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.420]   You can only order the 12 of the pro.
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:30.560]   I ordered the pro from my mom and Michael ordered the pro
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.440]   just so we'd have one in house.
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.160]   But I think most of the people we know
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.560]   will hold out for the max and I'll let Andy explain why.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.480]   There is a good reason you're gonna want the,
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.800]   not for the screen size, not for 5G.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.400]   There's a good reason to get,
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.360]   not just for the third camera,
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.040]   but there's a good reason you're gonna want the max.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.000]   We'll talk about that in a little bit too.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.960]   Andy Nocko's here from WGBH Boston.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.040]   Great to have you, Andrew.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.800]   As always, it's Renee Richie back from the brief.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:07.520]   There probably no things he's not even allowed to say.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.160]   And Lori Gill from iamore.com.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.840]   I am really excited.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.560]   The embargo has been lifted on peak designs,
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.200]   new Kickstarter.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.480]   Have you seen this yet?
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.920]   PeakDesign.com/Twit.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.200]   I think they were waiting until the iPhone came out.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.720]   They're calling it the mobile by PeakDesign.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.480]   And while you can use it with a variety of phones,
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.120]   of course it's gonna support all the new iPhones.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.280]   It's an ecosystem.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.080]   I love this idea.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.840]   Now, first of all, I should mention,
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.880]   I'm already in the bag for PeakDesign.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.640]   I'm as bad as Apple and Verizon.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.960]   And they never gave me anything,
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.440]   but I bought their travel tripod.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.360]   I buy all their camera straps.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.160]   I buy all their bags.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.640]   I have bagged peak.
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:59.280]   And I love the attachment system they have with those little,
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.280]   I don't know what they call it,
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.360]   the little things that snap into the,
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.680]   there's quick release.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.400]   I am a huge PeakDesign fan.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.640]   So when they have, and they've done,
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.680]   did you know this?
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.120]   They did their first Kickstarter.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.960]   PeakDesign was founded by Peter
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.240]   because he was a photographer.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.560]   He got sick of carrying his DSLR and his gear.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.640]   In 2011, almost 10 years ago,
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.400]   they created the capture.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.920]   And that was their first Kickstarter.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.040]   They have now, this is their 10th Kickstarter.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.360]   And it's turned out to be a really good way for them
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.760]   to get early adopters, people like us,
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.640]   in on the new stuff.
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.960]   I am so excited about this mobile system.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.840]   So it's a case.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.720]   We'll work with a variety of phones,
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.960]   but see that on the back?
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.880]   There's a little square on the back.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.000]   It is a precision, get ready for this.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.960]   Precision machine piece of Zirconia Ceramic,
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.000]   which means it's super hard.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.520]   It is called SimLink.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.520]   It's magnetic, kind of like the iPhone's new MagSafe charger.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.200]   By the way, completely compatible with MagSafe.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.320]   There's an array of magnets,
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.680]   and it gives you a very quick, no-look connection.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.680]   It snaps right on, completely compatible
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.520]   with wireless charging of all kinds, including the MagSafe.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.480]   But when you're on a motorcycle or a mountain bike
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.080]   and you want it to really be locked in,
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.120]   there is an additional hard locking system.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.200]   So you can have the quick mount,
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.400]   but you can also have the hard lock.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.560]   They both come with that slim length
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.760]   that looks right there with beautiful cases.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.480]   See, this is the hard lock.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:41.480]   Four strong metal locks that really hold your device in,
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.080]   so it's not going anywhere.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.000]   And the accessories, once you get the case,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.240]   the everyday phone case, which has the slim link system
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.160]   built in,
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.200]   there are all sorts of things you can do.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.360]   I bought two of the low-profile wall mounts
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.120]   that peel and stick on the wall.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.920]   And now, like in my kitchen,
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.600]   we're always propping up the iPhone
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.000]   on whatever is handy on a book.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.840]   I can now put it right there and have it available to me.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.720]   They have a new car mounting system
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.200]   that's just fantastic.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.160]   They have a charging stand that there's the car mount.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.440]   It'll attach to almost anything.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.080]   And look how quick, you just boom.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.360]   You slap it in, it's always exactly right,
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.640]   and it can't fall out just with a magnet.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.760]   It's amazing.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.080]   They have a machine aluminum tripod
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.960]   with buttery smooth ball head.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:34.840]   I got that too,
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.480]   'cause that's great for photography,
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.320]   and I can't wait to be shooting video
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.000]   with a new iPhone 12 Pro Max.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.520]   There's a wallet with a built-in kickstand,
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.600]   so you don't have to lean it up
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.880]   against the coffee mug at breakfast anymore.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.760]   There's a kit of adapters.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.720]   I really like that work with the GoPro mounts
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.120]   or the ARCA style system.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.720]   Everything I have is ARCA style.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:01.360]   I have my tripods, my peak travel tripod.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.880]   All my tripods have ARCA on them, so that's great.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.840]   It means I'll be able to easily mount the phone
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.280]   anywhere I want.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.680]   And of course, it's gonna work seamlessly
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.160]   with all iPhone 12 models, but with all phones,
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.080]   it's really, really great.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.080]   Pete Design is proud to say
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.440]   that the world's most crowd-funded active company.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.240]   They have found the most loyal, stoked,
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.080]   and passionate customers like me
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.040]   through Kickstarter.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.760]   They're San Francisco-based, really nice guys.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.000]   Making, and gals, making an incredible product.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.080]   This is the new mobile by Peak Design.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.840]   You can go right now to Kickstarter, get started.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.680]   For 32 bucks, peakdesign.com/twit.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.560]   Buy the accessories you need
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.920]   or get all of them as I did, if you're a hardcore
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.480]   Peak Design guy.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.720]   Peak Design, P-E-A-K, like a mountain peak.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.720]   PeakDesign.com/twit to get right to the Kickstarter.
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.200]   I'm thrilled.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.680]   We've had, Ants also a big Peak Design guy.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.680]   We've got a great relationship with Peak Design
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.080]   for many, many, many, many years,
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.200]   but this is the first time they've ever done an advertisement.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.600]   And I'm really on our shows anyway,
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.600]   and I'm really glad to have them.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.600]   Thank you, Peak.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:20.040]   PeakDesign.com/twit.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.120]   This is exciting.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.160]   Oh, and by the way, good news.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.440]   Thank you, Virgil.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.760]   NASA is launching a 4G network on the moon.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.280]   So your iPhone is also ready for your moonwalk.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.120]   Yes.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:31.960]   Thank goodness.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:32.800]   Thank goodness.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.640]   (laughs)
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.320]   I'll start ladies first, Laurie.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.120]   You've only had it for a day.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.360]   No, I just got it about 20 minutes before joining me.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.200]   Maybe you don't want it to.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.160]   So I have any-- Give us the initial feeling.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.040]   I'll tell you, I haven't even turned them on yet.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.600]   That's how just out of the box they are.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.560]   But let me give you a quick hit
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.240]   on just my literal first impression.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.400]   So this won't count for the review
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.080]   because I will have had it for a few days
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.360]   and I'll have a little bit more experience.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.560]   But right out of the box, heavier than I expected,
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.520]   heavier than the iPhone 11 Pro.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:14.360]   Also a tiny, tiny bit taller than the iPhone 11 Pro.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:20.160]   It's, it sticks out just a tiny bit more.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.760]   A not even a quarter of an inch.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.600]   Okay.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.800]   So they're called the same size,
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.800]   but it's actually just a teeny.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.360]   I think it has to do with the design.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.760]   So the round, instead of having the rounded edges,
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.000]   they're flat and that probably just kind of,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.360]   you know, if you take something curve,
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.360]   you can flatten it out.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.080]   This is the iPhone 5 flat edge, right?
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.040]   I'm kind of excited that this is back.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.240]   I like this.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.480]   Does it feel good in your hand?
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.200]   It's not that slippery kind of bar of soap feeling anymore.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.920]   It feels so good in the hands.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.640]   So even with, I mean, just picking the two
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.080]   phone 11 Pro versus 12,
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.560]   I feel like I'm going to drop this.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.720]   Just like you said, the slippery soap feeling.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.440]   I don't feel that at all when I pick up the 12
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.440]   and the 12 Pro same way.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.240]   12 Pro slightly heavier than 12,
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.640]   but almost not noticeable.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:16.000]   The difference between the mini and the max is almost 50%,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.800]   like 50% heavier and 50% bigger.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.120]   I mean, the mini is really small.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.320]   Now you like a small phone, you don't haven't got the mini yet.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.920]   Oh, I can't wait for the mini.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.480]   I was just swooning when I saw that.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.960]   It's so cute.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.600]   Oh, it's actually smaller than the current SE, isn't it?
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.640]   Yes, it's smaller than the current SE.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:42.600]   And it's only a very small, very, very small amount larger
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.480]   than the original iPhone SE.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.840]   Based on somebody posted on Twitter,
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.800]   they did a sketch drawing of their estimate
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.680]   of the size differences between them.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:56.200]   And the original SE versus, so the four inch iPhone
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:00.240]   factor versus this current 12 mini,
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:04.200]   it's a little bit more than a, maybe a third of an inch
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.920]   thicker, a wider, and then a half an inch or so taller.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.120]   This is the image from MacRumors.com,
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.280]   where they put all of the iPhones kind of in a row.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.160]   And this is the mini, the beautiful blue one,
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.000]   and that's the SE, so he's a little bit bigger.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:21.880]   Little bit taller.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.880]   But what you don't see from that angle, though,
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.320]   is how it's almost just as narrow.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.840]   It's only a little tiny bit wider,
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.560]   which that is, for those of us who want a phone
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.800]   that we can hold in one hand, that's the key,
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.880]   is the phone that is really easy to hold in one hand.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.000]   And that's what the iPhone, the original SE,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.040]   the four inch form factor, that's why it was so great.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.240]   We can hold it in one hand.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.480]   And that's what we're looking at with this iPhone 12 mini.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.760]   - And you're not giving up anything.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.480]   I mean, the same guts as the iPhone 12,
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.320]   or the even the pro, you're getting one less camera lens
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.280]   in the pro, you're getting a little less RAM.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:02.800]   According, Apple doesn't, as you said, Renee,
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.520]   they don't talk about specs to their credit, I guess.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:07.360]   But people don't want to know.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.680]   - Well, this actually can't win, they don't talk about it.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.720]   They talk about the specs with their head.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.520]   - Yeah, 'cause Android phones, like this Samsung Edge,
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.840]   I think it's 12 gigabytes of RAM.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.480]   - It's hard to explain, because it's a native language,
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.680]   it's not interpreted, there's no garbage collection,
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.080]   it's written exactly to hardware, so there's no--
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:22.920]   - Yeah.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.280]   - Yeah, but it's hard to explain that.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.840]   - So the two less expensive ones have four gigs,
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.840]   according to Xcode, where the emulators will tell you,
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:35.480]   and the pros have six gigs of RAM, I think is what they said.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:39.240]   So Renee, how long have you had yours?
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.960]   - About a week.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.080]   - Okay, so you have a little bit better idea
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.840]   of things like battery life.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.320]   - Yeah, but I mean, I live in a tester lifestyle,
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.400]   so I'm not doing anything approaching
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.520]   what a normal human would do with them.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.160]   - Yeah, you never can really judge the battery life
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.120]   for the first few weeks anyway,
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.040]   because you're installing stuff and you're doing stuff.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.040]   - And it's a brand new battery,
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.200]   like it's got so many mitigations one way or another,
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.440]   you have to wait, that's why I usually do a battery review
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.080]   and my two weeks later, or three weeks later review.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.560]   - Andy's had enough to trust Apple's numbers,
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.440]   'cause they do, I don't think they lie
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.000]   like other companies do with their battery life numbers.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.640]   - Yeah, they're pretty trustworthy,
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.120]   but it's always a case of your mileage will vary.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:24.000]   I still don't know who watches video over Wi-Fi,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.640]   non-stop on a phone, out in a rough--
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.960]   - 15 hours versus 17 hours, like okay.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.880]   - Except the tester, 20 hours on the Mac.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.400]   - Yeah, it's most useful to think that's a relative thing
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.280]   between two models, you're deciding between,
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.840]   am I gonna, the Pro Max has larger batteries,
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.800]   what's that translate to?
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.320]   Okay, a little bit more life, not much more life.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.560]   - I worry though that one of the things
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.320]   that classically will make your experience different
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:51.200]   than anybody else is how distant the cell towers are,
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.600]   how much roaming you have to do, that kind of thing.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.320]   That can kill batteries, so it doesn't matter.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.520]   And I wonder if 5G is gonna complicate this as well.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.400]   Sounds like they're doing a lot to keep 5G
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:05.400]   from hitting battery life, but if you're near-ish
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:10.000]   a 5G tower, that may really change what your experience
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.240]   from the same exact location last time.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.280]   - And that happens with 4G anyway.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.600]   - Right.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.920]   - And with the smart adjustment for 5G versus LTE,
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.480]   I think that's exactly what Apple's trying to do there is,
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.680]   you know, your phone, you probably will experience
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.400]   a little bit of a battery drain if you happen
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:36.500]   to be close to a 5G tower, especially a 5 millimeter wave
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.320]   tower, or sorry, millimeter wave tower.
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.160]   But that's where Apple's got this little smart feature
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.080]   that's gonna try to make it so that you're not always
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.480]   pinging the 5G tower, you're pinging the 4G or the LTE
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.440]   tower when it's just for streaming music
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.280]   or something like that.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.040]   So maybe it won't have a significant effect.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.400]   You know, I think we're just gonna have to have use cases,
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.000]   but really it doesn't matter if Apple says something like,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.160]   you know, 17 hours of playback, because that's not what
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.000]   people do every day, just like Andy had said,
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.480]   it's really just a matter of, will my phone last all day?
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.280]   Will my phone last more than a day?
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.560]   That's what most people wanna know.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.360]   They wanna know that they don't have to throw it
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.280]   on the charger in the middle of the day.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:22.280]   The Verge gave Deeter Bone the 12 and Neelai Patel the 12 Pro.
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:27.240]   Both came back saying battery life was inferior
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.320]   to the iPhone 11s.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.080]   Is that been your experience, Renee?
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.280]   - Mine's been about the same, but I don't have to contend
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.200]   with millimeter wave, which my understanding is that's
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.320]   the biggest impact on battery life.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.600]   And especially if you're hunting for it, like if Neelai's
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.960]   in downtown New York and Deeter's in San Francisco
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.360]   trying to hunt down the elusive millimeter wave,
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.840]   I can see that making a big impact.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.440]   - Yeah.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.800]   All right Andy, this is the real one.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.280]   (laughing)
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.640]   This to me anyway, maybe to me and Andy,
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:59.680]   but this to me is the real nut of the matter.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.960]   It comes down to cameras, perfectly good cameras
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.320]   on the Mini and the 12.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.720]   The Pro has one more lens, it's a three lens system
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:12.520]   and Apple weirdly called, and I think Grubert called this out
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.120]   'cause ultra wide, wide and telephoto,
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:19.160]   when most people would say, well there's wide normal
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.000]   and telephoto, but the really big difference,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.800]   and I don't know if Apple mentioned it,
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:26.000]   but I don't know if it was clear to everybody,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.680]   the biggest difference is not between the Mini and the Pro,
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.840]   it's between the Pro and the Pro Max.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.600]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.240]   They made two very, very basic changes,
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.120]   improving the camera system on the 12 Pro number,
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.640]   first and foremost, it's got a wider aperture,
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.400]   so it lets in more light.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.520]   So all the tricks that every other camera phone uses
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:54.120]   to sort of get around the fact that it's not a very fast lens,
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.480]   a lot of that get becomes moot
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.680]   because it just simply will let in more light.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.840]   The second, actually three things.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:02.760]   The second thing is that it actually uses a larger sensor,
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.840]   so still 12 megapixels, but each pixel in that sensor
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:10.080]   is bigger, so the data it's taking in is much, much better.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.040]   - So that's the difference between the Max
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.000]   and the Pro and the Pro Max,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.760]   is the Max actually has,
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:19.920]   is the only one of the four that has the bigger sensor, right?
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.760]   - Correct, yeah.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.600]   - Okay.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.960]   - And the third thing is,
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.040]   and this is, I don't know, this is me
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.320]   like being excited about technology as opposed to
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.040]   being excited about things that Apple has actually said.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.800]   But another difference between the two is that
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.880]   we're asked the 12 Pro has the same sort of optical image
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.280]   stabilization as all the rest where,
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.840]   it corrects for your hand shaking by moving
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.200]   like the entire assembly.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.840]   The Pro Max has a sensor shift,
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.040]   so it's actually just moving the sensor,
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.720]   which is something that most of the Pro cameras,
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.640]   it's how they do image stabilization.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.680]   That's really, really cool because it's actually
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.800]   a little bit better way of doing image stabilization.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:06.120]   It also, and this is again, me speculating,
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.440]   but this is also a technique that a lot of the Pro cameras
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:13.720]   use to give you like a special like 50 megapixel
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.160]   landscape mode that if the camera is locked down,
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.320]   like on my Olympus OM-D-EM-1,
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.600]   micro four thirds camera,
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.280]   if it's on a tripod,
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.840]   you're gonna engage the special mode where it takes
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.560]   a little bit longer to take the picture,
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.040]   but what it's doing is, it takes the first picture,
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:31.880]   oh God.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.120]   - It's called, it's called Pixel Shift.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.960]   - Pixel Shift, well, basically, what,
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.800]   basically what, oh, there it is.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.720]   - I knew I had like post it, no, plenty here.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.920]   So what it does is, it'll actually,
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.960]   so it's, imagine that this is like one pixel,
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.600]   and then it'll, so it'll take one image,
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.440]   and then it'll like actually shift the sensor a little bit,
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.400]   so that now the pixels are like a little bit to the left,
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.160]   and so now it's capturing data that was between two pixels,
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.720]   they'll shift a little bit more upward,
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.080]   so now it's capturing data that was between on this,
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.680]   on the horizontal gaps too,
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.520]   and you wind up with a legitimate super high resolution
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.360]   picture.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.320]   Now I don't know that that's something that Apple
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.680]   is even thinking about, but.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.520]   - It has that capability, I mean,
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.360]   'cause it can do sensor shift, so.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.960]   - Yeah, it's a standard technique, it's well known,
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.640]   I'm sure that someone, like I said last week,
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.240]   if I were an engineer working in the camera department,
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.120]   and I had access to the magic iPhone,
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.000]   that I can program to do whatever I want,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.840]   I would be doing that for my own camera.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.080]   - Right, yeah.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:33.880]   - 47% larger sensor on the Max than the Pro.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.720]   So this is a difference between the Pro and the Pro Max,
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.640]   for ink porting.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.720]   - One point, we talked about this last week too,
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:44.720]   1.7 micrometer pixels.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:48.280]   That, so in effect, with a wider aperture,
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.680]   a larger sensor, you're gathering more light,
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.120]   so low light should get better,
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.960]   and with the optical image stabilization,
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.360]   it's estimated you should be able to handhold
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.280]   a two second exposure.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.480]   So you're gonna be able to do low light photography
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:07.000]   probably better than you could do with a DSLR,
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.320]   given the computational capabilities added on top of that.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.160]   - Yeah, I would guess.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.160]   - In terms, it remains to be seen,
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.120]   but I can't wait to see it,
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:19.480]   because this is something where, as an Android,
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:23.320]   I keep one foot in Android, one foot in iPhone.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.080]   This is the sort of thing that, God,
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:30.080]   if this really is as big a leap forward as it could be,
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:32.160]   this could get me to switch back,
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.080]   and not only switch back,
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.640]   but also buy the most expensive phone in the line,
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.840]   because computational photography is the thing
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.000]   that's leveling all boats at this point,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.720]   where even the current generation Google phones
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.360]   use a two or three year old sensor,
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.280]   because their philosophy is--
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.480]   - It ain't the glass.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.320]   It's the case.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.760]   - Well, yeah, the engineers are saying that,
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.440]   look, there hasn't been a huge advance
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.760]   in sensor technology.
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.680]   Pixels are still as good as they've ever been.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.040]   Now it's all about how well do you interpret that data
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.720]   and turn into a usable picture.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.880]   But, so it would be very, very rare to have a camera system
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.120]   that is actually, they've done so much work
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.480]   to give advantages to it,
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:13.320]   that it would be almost like having the $700 mid-range camera,
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.080]   but also having like a $600 pocket camera
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.120]   with you at all times.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.920]   That is very, very intriguing to me.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.120]   - I can't wait.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.480]   And actually, Google's kind of looks like
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.320]   they've kind of seeded this ground a little bit,
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.800]   because the Pixel 5,
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:31.080]   they took out the image processing chip.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.680]   I feel like they're kind of saying, yeah, fine.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.040]   Go ahead, Apple.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:38.880]   - I will say, wait for next year,
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.720]   because remember that last year,
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:45.240]   the last year of the month before they released the Pixel 4,
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.080]   of course, Austro-low,
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.480]   the head of the hardware department,
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.080]   basically put the whole team together and said,
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.080]   I'm very, very disappointed.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.720]   And then the Pixel 4 we're about to introduce,
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.680]   I can't believe the battery is so low,
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.280]   I can't believe this, that, the other.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.960]   So I think we all knew that the Pixel 5
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.000]   was going to be sort of a rebuilding year.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.120]   But nonetheless, nonetheless,
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.080]   nonetheless the Pixel 6,
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.360]   they will have a lot to answer to.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.240]   - They've also lost Mark Levoire,
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:13.040]   they're wizarding. - Exactly.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:13.880]   - He went to it.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:14.960]   - Yeah, it took away his,
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.400]   they took away his telephoto camera.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.480]   - Yeah.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:21.080]   So you've, you don't have the max Renee,
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.160]   but you have at least a chance to take some pictures.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.000]   - Yes.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.680]   - All the phones, all of them,
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:30.680]   even Lori's mini have night mode, have deep vision,
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.240]   or diffusion, I mean.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.080]   - Yeah.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:36.160]   - And like last year where deep fusion came out later,
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:39.280]   Apple Pro Raw, I think is going to come out later.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:42.960]   That's a, to me, a very interesting format.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.480]   Because when, you know, theoretically, when you shoot raw,
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.040]   you're not doing any processing at all,
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.720]   you're getting the sensor image.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.200]   And on these sensors, they're not great sensors,
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.880]   you're getting just the raw sensor data.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.520]   So what Apple's done is they're taking the raw sensor data
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.360]   and then layering in the deep fusion
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.680]   and other computational features
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.440]   so that you can work with all of that in a raw format.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:11.240]   That to me, combined with the hardware
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.800]   and the computational capabilities, you know,
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:17.000]   Apple did not leave out the image processing in this.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   They have so many,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.320]   - They chipped it up.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.320]   - They have so many transistors,
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:25.360]   11.8 billion transistors, six cores, four GPUs,
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:29.800]   and machine learning and an image processing core.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.640]   They have so much overhead in the hardware.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.440]   - And it seems to have a controller that lets it loop
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.480]   in real time.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.360]   I'm, that's the thing, like, a lot of reviews
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.360]   I'm seeing lately are like,
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.800]   oh, you don't need really big silicon,
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.640]   don't worry about it.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.000]   The phone scrolls fine.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.480]   I'm like, ah, you made scrolling the high bar.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.480]   But just being able to do all this stuff in real time
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.160]   and it loops through the image signal processor,
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.880]   dispatches to not just the neural engine,
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.680]   but the ML accelerators through the GPU
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.800]   and then back by the time that photo pops up
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.320]   in your thumbnail, which is instant,
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:04.440]   and you can see everything.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.920]   Like you could, on the viewfinder,
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.400]   you see the depth effect, you see the deep fusion,
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.120]   you just see all of, you see what you're gonna shoot.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.080]   And that to me is so,
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.880]   because a lot of times, like, oh, the ear doesn't look great.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.640]   I'll move a little bit and it fixes it.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.360]   I don't have to go and look and wait a few seconds
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.160]   and watch a process and then go back and redo it.
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.600]   And these cameras are a lot of fun,
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.320]   like especially in the lower light.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.240]   - Do you notice the speed difference?
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.360]   - Yes, the speed is really like,
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:35.120]   the higher computational modes were starting to take a second
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.160]   on the iPhone 11, which was remarkable
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.000]   because that chip was super fast.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.160]   But here is just like, you take the photo,
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.320]   it goes just whoomp and it's done by the time
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.120]   you physically press on it.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.200]   The only thing you notice is when you hit on an HDR video,
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.040]   it takes a second to ramp the display up to 1200 nits.
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.720]   But that's the only thing you notice about the...
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.080]   - Apple has taken some heat for not having
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.520]   90 hertz or 120 hertz refresh rates on its screen.
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.600]   I don't think that's, I mean, I have phones
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.480]   that theoretically have 120, my Pixel 4 has 90.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.400]   - I don't, if you still do it next year
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.920]   when they can do that in the panel.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.200]   - When you're scrolling through Reddit,
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.040]   if you do this or on a webpage,
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.600]   then you might notice a little difference.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:18.480]   - It's not that, it's because 120 divides
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.640]   into 24 frames per second so that we can watch
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.040]   our Hollywood movies and the frame rate
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.960]   that nature and Hollywood intended.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.960]   That's the real advantage of adaptive frame rate.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:26.960]   - I had no idea.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.880]   Okay, that's what you can do on a night.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.880]   - You want to be really high so that you don't
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.960]   watch it really low.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.080]   - Yeah, I had no idea.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.240]   That was what we were going for.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.640]   Do you miss it though on the phone?
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:42.560]   - I like it, but it's the, I mean, the simple answer
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.960]   is that Apple is using the OLED technology
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.720]   from the Galaxy S20, which is not adaptive.
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:52.200]   It's, you can manually switch the frame rate,
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.960]   but when you do that, Samsung chooses to lower
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.920]   the resolution and change the white point.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:57.760]   - That's right.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.640]   - And that, I think would make Apple's eyes bleed.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.920]   The panels in the Note 20 are adaptive.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.760]   They use LTPO.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.600]   Apparently if you put oxide in anything,
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.520]   it makes it adaptive because what they had to put
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:09.600]   into the iPad panels too, but Samsung can't make,
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.120]   physically cannot make enough for an iPhone order yet,
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.960]   but they should be able to by next year.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.280]   And that's important because if you just go to 120 Hertz,
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.280]   it will deplete your battery like you're on
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.040]   millimeter wave the whole time.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:24.120]   So what the iPad does and what Apple does is they alternate,
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.000]   they spike you to 120 when you're doing something
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.480]   that needs it and then they drop you down to 48,
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.600]   which is lower than 60 in that recoup some battery.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.400]   So it balances out the power draw
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.640]   and I think that's what they're waiting for for the iPhone.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.480]   - Okay.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:43.120]   By the way, the Pro-Rise is the Pro models only
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.800]   and that's coming later this year.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.560]   We should mention that 14.1 did come out today
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:53.560]   for iOS and iPadOS, which is the iPhone release.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.840]   Version and has some widget fixes and so forth.
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:57.680]   But that's-
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:58.840]   - Oh, we should add that the only reason
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.400]   some of the features are Pro only, I mean, well, they're Pro,
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:05.400]   but it's those extra two gigabytes of RAM.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.920]   It's one and a half times the amount of RAM,
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.400]   so it is easier to handle Pro-RAR.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:14.400]   It can also do 4K 60 for Dolby Vision instead of 4K 30
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.000]   because it's a RAM intensive application.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.760]   So it's those little things that that extra RAM enables.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:20.600]   - Okay.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.760]   You're Andy, what are you gonna do?
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.200]   You haven't you decided yet?
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.040]   You're still thinking?
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.760]   - Oh, I'm tempted.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.920]   I put in my usual request to Apple,
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.240]   so here's what I would love to get.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.920]   And I'm well, hands down, it's like,
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:38.000]   I don't really hold on to all the rest of them,
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.280]   just send me an iPhone 12 Pro Max as soon as you can.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:45.320]   What's gonna stink is that I don't have access
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.520]   to the public garden, I don't have access to this world,
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.760]   and I have access to the public library.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.520]   But I'm going to believe me.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.560]   I'm gonna put so many miles on my fitness watch
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.800]   taking pictures of this.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.400]   - That cow viewers is gonna get a lot of work out.
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:01.960]   - You know, the whole steams are coming out of retirement.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:06.880]   It's, those girls, whole steams this year.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.840]   I didn't even think about that.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.240]   - It is exciting.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:15.000]   I did buy a few months ago the Pixel 4A,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.040]   the $350 model because my--
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:17.880]   - It's a great phone.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:18.720]   - It's a great phone.
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.160]   - It is legitimately a great phone.
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.520]   I thought that for $350, I felt this was probably
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.720]   gonna buy like a $1,000 phone maybe next year,
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.600]   and this would be a good phone to have for a year
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.600]   until I find a 5G phone I like.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.960]   But I would have no qualms about it.
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:34.480]   If I really fell in love with the pictures
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.880]   that the iPhone 12 took, it would be hard for me to say,
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:40.400]   it would be hard for me to wait a year
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.960]   to wait for the next version of it,
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:47.120]   and or wait for some people to sell off their used ones.
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.600]   Because that's the sort of thing that really tickles me.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.120]   It's hard to get excited about phones these days
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.520]   because right now what used to get me excited
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.720]   about a $1,000 phone a few years ago now gets you excited
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.080]   because hey, wow, this is only costing me $650.
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.720]   And the things that get me really excited
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:07.040]   are folding screens because that's the latest,
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.240]   that's the newest thing in a phone I've seen
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:12.960]   that makes me think, wow, that means I could do,
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.320]   all these things I used to have frustrations
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.640]   in trying to find a good way to do this,
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.560]   or all the different holes that I had
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.600]   in my sort of computational portfolio.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:25.320]   This would fill a lot of holes in that scenario.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:28.800]   And I don't wanna spend $1,600 on a phone
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.280]   that's still doing much, much better,
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.680]   but still very much in development.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.160]   So it's good to be excited about something.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.760]   I've never thought I would find a camera system
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.760]   that would get me more excited about phones again,
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.040]   but looks like they've done it hardware-wise.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.640]   - Yeah, you can stick your 5G where the sun don't shine.
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:44.920]   Actually, I think that's where they stuck it.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.600]   But honestly, the camera,
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:52.600]   and Apple did not give it short shrift last week in the event,
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.920]   but I think the camera's very exciting.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.920]   The other thing I'm very curious about,
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.600]   and Renee, we're gonna again defer to you
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.640]   'cause you're the one who's had it the longest,
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.880]   is the video capabilities, particularly.
[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:08.880]   And does the Pro do the Dolby Vision 4K 60-frame HDR 10-bit?
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:13.560]   - Yeah, they all do 30,
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:17.200]   the regular does 30 on all the cameras.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.080]   The Pro does 30 on the selfie camera,
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.000]   60 on all the back cameras.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.200]   And it's really good.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.920]   I wanna say it's early days.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.080]   The one thing they did, which is really smart,
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:31.000]   like for example, Samsung has had HDR 10 plus
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.440]   recording for a while, but it was a labs feature.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:36.600]   It was buried, it was 1080p, and now it's 4K,
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.760]   and you have to manually change it to SDR
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:39.840]   if you wanna share it.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.320]   And Apple's doing this thing where if I send it to you
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:45.160]   and you have a phone, and all recent, even my Mac,
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.080]   my 6-inch MacBook Pro and Catalina,
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.440]   can play back the HDR files fine.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.360]   - That's what's really interesting.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:51.320]   - I said it's like an iPad 8.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:54.480]   - That was one of the updates today on 14.1
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.960]   was this to support Dolby Vision on the iPad
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.800]   and other devices, yeah.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:47:59.640]   - Yeah.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.800]   - 'Cause Dolby Vision without support doesn't look so hot.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.480]   - No, but what they're doing is they're recording
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:05.320]   both tone maps.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.840]   So again, this is where the silicon pays off.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.880]   In real time, they're doing the Dolby Vision dynamic metadata
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:15.000]   and tone mapping and an SDR tone map at the same time.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.200]   And then depending on what device or how you're sharing it,
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.920]   it'll pick which one to share.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:24.160]   - That's in MP5, Hike, H--
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.560]   - Yeah, it's in, yeah.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:27.640]   - HCI, I efficiency video, correct.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.160]   - It'll spit out an MOV file, but it's--
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.440]   - Inside it's AGC, yeah.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.280]   - Yeah.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.560]   - Did you drop it yet?
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.200]   How about that ceramic shield front?
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.200]   (laughing)
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.960]   - I did, so ceramic shield, again,
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.080]   like when you, it's a trade-off between brake protection
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:44.960]   and scratch protection.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.840]   So there's no difference in scratch protection,
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.800]   which is my personal nemesis.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.000]   I did drop it a couple times by accident,
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.800]   but not from very high and it was fine, as I expected.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.280]   - Ooh, that's a scary--
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.520]   - It's hard doing camera test, Lea.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:58.040]   You have like six cameras in your hands,
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.760]   you haven't juggled anything.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:04.040]   - Lori, did you get a magsafe adapter?
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:04.880]   - Yes.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:05.720]   - Do you have it?
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.040]   Can you show us?
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:07.880]   - Yeah, I can.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:08.720]   - I call it that.
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:09.560]   - I haven't even unboxed it yet.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:11.480]   So you guys are seeing me open and purr.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.160]   - It's an unboxing, yeah, that's the sound.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:15.240]   (laughing)
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:16.800]   - Jonathan Morrison made a song out of it.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.680]   It's on his video, he's got the whole thing
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.320]   looped into a song with lyrics now.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.160]   (laughing)
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.000]   - That's so great.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:22.920]   Of course he did.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:25.400]   - I'm mixed feelings about it.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:28.240]   I think Andy, you and I, last week,
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.080]   along with our guests, Doc Rock,
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:33.720]   and I forgot who else was with us,
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:36.680]   but we speculated the reason they're putting the magsafe
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.280]   on there is so that next,
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:40.640]   and not putting type C on there,
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.120]   is so that next year,
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.800]   they could just have eliminate all ports.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.880]   I think that's probably the case, right?
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:49.320]   - Yeah, I think they're definitely softening us.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.880]   And by the way, thank you,
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.080]   thank you, we had our third guest, Rosemary Orchard.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:53.920]   - Rosemary Orchard, thank you.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:54.760]   - I've never done podcasts,
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:55.760]   but then she was wonderful.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:56.880]   - She's so good.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.360]   - Oh my God, yeah.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.200]   - She's amazing.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:02.640]   - But yeah, you always get a little bit suspicious
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.760]   anytime, anytime, Apple, God,
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.080]   you're gonna take away another port, aren't you?
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.320]   Or you're gonna seal this up.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.160]   - It's next.
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:11.440]   - You're gonna skip over USB-C entirely
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.720]   and just make sure that we pick things harder.
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.400]   - Ooh, it's making the sound.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:18.600]   Look how wide the way I look at the A&M blue is.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:19.600]   Oh, that's so pretty.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:22.280]   - ASMR, ASMR, ASMR, ASMR, ASMR.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:24.920]   - Talk very quietly, shh, like.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:28.940]   (laughing)
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:30.280]   (whooshing)
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.360]   - It really is fun.
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:34.560]   - We'll make a sound though too.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:35.920]   I think if you have the sound on.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.760]   - How's--
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.560]   - I don't actually have these phones.
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:39.400]   - They're not even turned on.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.240]   - Yeah.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.280]   - I literally-- - So what is the sound it makes?
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:45.240]   I hear I'll do it.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.600]   - Suck it to the mic.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:49.840]   - Come on.
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:50.920]   - Is it a little bling?
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:52.240]   Is it a little bling?
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:55.280]   - I think you have to wait for it to reset.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:56.200]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:00.040]   - Yeah, that's the normal.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:01.760]   I hate that sound, by the way.
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:02.840]   It's sound like--
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.920]   - It's so satisfying knowing that that means
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:06.560]   you definitely are charging.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:08.040]   - I know, I like having a sound,
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:10.560]   but that particular sound sounds like it stubbed its toe.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:13.200]   It doesn't, it sounds like it got, you know,
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.800]   (humming)
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.640]   I hate that sound, but on the other hand,
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.200]   the alternative is the ring that goes on for hours.
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.040]   Ding!
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.040]   - Oh yeah.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.400]   - I don't know if there's a,
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.560]   I need a middle ground apple.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.560]   One that-- - They should have
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:27.400]   sick burn.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:28.240]   - Sick burn, play with it.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.080]   - Sick burn, play with it.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.080]   (laughing)
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.600]   - Dang. - Okay.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.160]   I'm about to solve this problem,
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:35.800]   and I hope apple is smart enough to steal this idea.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:36.920]   When you attach the connector,
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:37.760]   the sound it makes,
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:40.920]   the sound of like the lever on a toaster going down,
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:41.760]   (humming)
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.160]   and then when it's at 100%,
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:44.920]   is the sound of your toaster being done?
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.000]   (humming)
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:47.840]   - Something.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:49.120]   - It's a sound we all understand,
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.760]   the user interface has already burned
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.560]   into our programming, we're good.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:55.480]   - We already know, we already know what a toaster sounds like.
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:56.320]   And smells like.
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:57.320]   Mm-hmm.
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.480]   - So what do you think?
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.800]   I mean, is that, how strong is that magnet?
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:02.880]   Is it pretty, is it--
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.440]   - It's not as strong as I thought it was gonna be.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.040]   - It's like a wreck and bomb.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:09.320]   - 'Cause like, if you're just trying to like--
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.600]   - It's not like that.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:12.000]   - Oh, well, now it is doing it.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   So I guess, yeah.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:14.840]   - Would I feel--
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.080]   - It's not a fridge magnet though.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.560]   Would I feel comfortable--
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:19.400]   - Doing this?
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:20.920]   - Having my credit cards attached that way?
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.400]   Well, that, yeah, but hello.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:24.880]   - I don't like the wallet.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.440]   I'm not a fan, like, well, it's cute and all,
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.720]   but it doesn't hold on--
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:29.560]   - Oh, they say it's not cool.
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:31.480]   - Enough for me, and I realize if you made it hold on too much,
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.200]   then people wouldn't be able to pull it off.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.040]   So I think that they created their own problem.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:37.120]   It also might have raised their credit cards.
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:37.960]   - Yeah.
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:38.800]   - Well, they're apparently there's some--
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.640]   - And this here in the US, we saw the mag stripes.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.920]   - There's apparently a protector in there
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.680]   that stops it from erasing.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:46.520]   - Oh, Malek said--
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.360]   - Is that us?
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.160]   - I'm never gonna get to wear my old fashioned,
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:52.440]   you know, an old mechanical watch is magnets are death.
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:54.040]   Do you think that's Apple's secret way to get,
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.920]   oh, Malek, we're gonna Apple watch?
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.640]   (laughing)
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.120]   Well, I mean, he had to go talk about it, right?
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.560]   He went on Hodden Key and he gave them a big giant target.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.680]   - Yeah.
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:06.080]   - Yeah, we gotta get you in an Apple watch, oh.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:09.200]   All right, what else?
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.680]   - Is it worth the case?
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.880]   Let's see, this is one, an iPhone,
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.840]   this is not an iPhone 12 case.
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:16.640]   But I'm just gonna see.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:19.320]   - Okay, go through, the phone 12 ones are so sporty.
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:20.760]   - Are they nice?
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.040]   Ooh, now it's the one I got my own.
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.520]   - I got that one for my mom.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.880]   What's the deal with the paint?
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:27.800]   Why is, it's a clear case, but it's got paint.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:29.140]   - Is to show you where your magsafe is,
[00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:30.240]   no, okay.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.840]   And what's the bottom line?
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:34.560]   - It's not like, it's a magsafe, that's not paint.
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:35.400]   - Oh, it's magnet.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.240]   - Yeah.
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.760]   - You have the magnet in the NFC.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.200]   - Oh, see, that's why I got it for it,
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.360]   'cause I thought it should have a target on the back
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:42.200]   and make it easy for me.
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.560]   - And the NFC tells it what you're connecting,
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.880]   even the color of what you're connecting,
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.640]   so I can show you the problem of animation.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.120]   - What?
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:48.960]   - Wow.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.240]   - Yeah, so if it's a case, it'll give you a different animation,
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.400]   if it's a blue case, it'll show you a blue animation.
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:57.400]   - Apple said, and both Dieter and Neelai were not convinced
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.920]   that the magnetic cases were easier to remove.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:01.000]   Have you experienced that?
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:01.840]   - Yeah.
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.520]   - They never said that to me.
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:04.720]   Did they say that to you, Laura?
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:05.560]   - I think they said the event.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:10.160]   - Yes, so they did, so it's because they're magnetic
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:13.520]   on the back, so that there's not,
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.520]   that must mean that Renee hasn't used a case yet,
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.080]   'cause he doesn't like to use cases.
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:18.960]   So I haven't tried it yet, again,
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.720]   I'm opening the case right now just to find out.
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:23.200]   They're magnetic on the back,
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:27.040]   so the sides apparently just slip in better,
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:28.640]   so I'm giving it a try right now.
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:30.800]   - 'Cause yeah, it doesn't have to hold on so tight,
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:31.640]   it doesn't have to be so cool.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.360]   - Yeah, you know, it--
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:36.560]   - They said it's exactly the same.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.960]   - It just, it doesn't really feel--
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:40.640]   - Find a factor of the back-top texture, it's cases.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.000]   - Yeah, in real cases, no, I'm not my back-top gesture
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:43.840]   all the time.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:47.600]   - I really, so I have a very, I love this wallet case,
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:50.440]   but I can't wireless charge, I can't back-tap or anything.
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:53.560]   It's a big, thick leather wallet case,
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.960]   not an Apple wallet case, so I guess I'll probably--
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.400]   - It's European.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.400]   - Yeah, it's a European carry-all.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.040]   It's from Pat and Quill, it's beautiful,
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.640]   but it's not practical.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:05.040]   - It's gorgeous.
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:08.760]   - So, and there's more cases coming, right?
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.400]   We haven't seen all the cases yet.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:14.640]   - Yeah, anybody can use it, they made the spec public
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.400]   if you just wanna do the magnetic part,
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.240]   if you wanna talk to--
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.320]   - Do you have to pay them?
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.320]   - Yeah, I think it's the MMA.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.640]   - Does it have to be MMA?
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.680]   - Again, there's two layers,
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.960]   and you just wanna make an accessory
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:26.440]   that just uses the magnets, that's fine,
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:27.600]   anybody do that, they publish--
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:29.520]   - So that's not MFI, okay, good, okay.
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:32.080]   - No, if you wanna talk to the device through NFC,
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:34.120]   then you have to sign up for MFI.
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:36.920]   - Talk to the device, okay, fine, yeah, that's all right.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.320]   - That I find exciting, every time that Apple
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:41.000]   or any company does, is open,
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.920]   it understands that you can't possibly find all
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:45.480]   of the awesome in your own product,
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.400]   you have to allow outsiders to find the awesome
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.040]   that you're absolutely miserable to,
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.120]   so I'm keen to see what happens in six months' time
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:53.480]   of people, I wanna see the stuff that winds up
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:58.120]   in the next product keynote, preceded by Tim saying,
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.520]   "The third parties have come up with ideas
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:02.400]   we would never have dreamed of,
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:05.200]   including the most ridiculous, but beautiful
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:07.120]   and gorgeous thing you've ever seen in your life."
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:09.520]   - Lori Gill's guitar, it's got MagSafe on it,
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:11.280]   watch it, it plays their show.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:12.120]   - That would be so great.
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:13.440]   - The iPhone is right on the guitar.
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:16.640]   - I love that idea, I really do, right?
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:18.560]   And so the magnets are not strong enough
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:23.120]   to cause problems for people with issues, with magnets, right?
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.920]   There's no warning, don't carry--
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:27.360]   - And they're very, like the MagSafe is stronger
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:31.000]   than the wallet, so it's got a degree of magnitude.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.720]   - A degree of magnitude.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:33.880]   All right, let's take one more break
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:37.120]   and then I wanna talk about LiDAR.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:39.880]   And by the way, it's not all Apple today,
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:43.760]   Adobe Max is going on, Adobe has announced a bunch of stuff
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:47.000]   for iOS, Andy, you following that?
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   - Yeah, yeah, I'm particularly keen on illustrator
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.400]   for iPad. - Yeah, just came out, yeah.
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:52.240]   So we'll get to that.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.120]   - And Google has some news today.
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:55.160]   - And there's some-- - Alval.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:56.000]   - It's probably the big--
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.520]   - They have a reaction video for YouTube, let's say that.
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:02.440]   - There is the biggest news story of the day,
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:04.040]   which we don't haven't talked about
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:04.880]   'cause it's all about Google,
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:07.520]   but the Department of Justice has announced
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:11.040]   its prosecution of Google for antitrust.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.000]   - Apple users are massive Google users.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.960]   All our pretty boxes are given by their pretty bits.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:19.280]   - Yeah, in fact, one of the things that the DOJ mentioned
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:22.960]   is the money that Google pays people like Apple
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.200]   to use Google search as their default.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.920]   They consider that any competitive.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:28.200]   - They have the money.
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:30.120]   - They have the biggest question.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:31.840]   - I think they pay Apple 13 billion,
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.760]   but that's a good question is,
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:36.160]   is Google using its monopoly power
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:39.520]   to lock other search engines out?
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:40.360]   We certainly would love--
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:43.720]   - Our shop had 14 billion, this would not be an issue.
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:44.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:48.160]   Well, I mean, Apple was offering for sale
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.120]   and Google wanted it and they could afford it.
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:52.160]   So that's the end of that for me.
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:54.280]   - But that's why it's a trust issue, right?
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.840]   - It's a monopoly issue because they did have the money.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.400]   They can use their monopoly power
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.320]   to increase their monopoly power.
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.320]   - God, Facebook or Amazon could outbid them.
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:05.160]   I mean, that's possible.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:08.200]   They could change the search bar to an Amazon search bar.
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.320]   - And you'll talk about this and all about Android,
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:14.240]   but a lot of it is all about all the sweetheart,
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.400]   all the deals that Google has demanded
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:17.640]   of hardware manufacturers.
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:20.120]   - Yes. - If you want the treasure chest
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:22.120]   of Google apps and services,
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.560]   you're gonna give us these concessions
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.520]   and you're also not going to,
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:28.240]   you're not gonna make similar deals with pre-installed app.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:30.040]   It's a thing.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.720]   I'm sure tune into all the audio and right tonight here
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:33.720]   and tune into--
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:35.600]   - Twig tomorrow, we'll be talking about it.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.600]   And in fact, we kind of, we knew that this was coming,
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:41.400]   but we didn't know when it's been kind of pre-announced
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.240]   for weeks.
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:45.920]   But on Sunday, Corey Doctorow and Amy Webb,
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.960]   two very big thinkers and we spent the entire twit
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:53.280]   talking about how do you regulate big tech sensibly?
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.320]   What do you do? - Yeah.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:55.480]   - And you know, it's easy.
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:58.040]   If you look at the DOJ indictment,
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:00.240]   it's all completely right.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:03.280]   It's like, yes, yes, that's exactly what they do.
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:07.120]   Much more difficult is, well, what's the remedy?
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:10.680]   - Well, a lot of it, I'm just, I know you go to commercial,
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:15.080]   but a lot of the problem is that in the 500 page report
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:18.680]   that the special, special committee on digital antitrust
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.080]   filed a couple of weeks ago,
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.720]   a lot of their complaints are based on,
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:27.360]   it's almost literally, Google started off doing search
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:28.560]   a million years ago.
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:30.760]   They put a cajillion dollars into it
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:33.480]   and they've really developed it into something so good
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:37.160]   that nothing, a lot of their argument is simply that
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:41.160]   a startup company, if Andy and Outgo wanted
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.760]   to create his own search engine today,
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:44.840]   why it would take him 20, it would almost be impossible
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:47.400]   for him to create a search engine that would be as popular
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.800]   as Google search, like, well, duh,
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:51.160]   because of the other VISTA thoughts.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:53.360]   - It's not the issue, no, but I don't think,
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.840]   I think that's a little bit off.
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:56.800]   It's not the issue of whether you could.
[00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:01.160]   The issue is whether Google is using its position today
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.920]   to make sure that Andy doesn't get to.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:07.880]   That's the real issue, that's the anti-trust issue.
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.520]   - There's just a lot of arguments here.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:14.120]   I just hope it doesn't come down to the fact that Apple
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.560]   is so successful making iPhones means that the government
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:22.560]   should force Apple to allow other companies
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.120]   to make iPhones.
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:27.720]   It's like you can't, there is a lot of anti-competitive
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.360]   behavior happening, particularly with Google and Facebook,
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.960]   less so with Apple, but Apple is not out of the woods.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:37.120]   But I wanna make sure that whatever legislation,
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.760]   whatever action the government takes,
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.680]   it is to actually give more choice to users,
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.160]   as opposed to saying that, well, you know how great it was
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.320]   that you had Google Maps and Google search
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.120]   working so well together, and also with your Google Docs,
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.320]   well, now you have to enact permissions
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.440]   because now they had to be split up into five different companies.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.280]   So this is--
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.520]   - As I said, it's not hard to see the harms.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.360]   It's a lot harder to see what to do about it.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.440]   That's the real difficult thing.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.320]   And so we spent a lot of time talking about it on Sunday,
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.720]   so my brain is so--
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.280]   - Sometimes the monopoly is actually user positive.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.240]   We just have to acknowledge that.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:14.960]   - But if you want Andy's search engine to have a chance,
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.280]   we gotta figure out how we could do that.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.520]   It is, it's a big topic.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.440]   We'll spend a lot of time talking about it tomorrow.
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.240]   - Right now, it's a 1-900 number.
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:26.320]   You call me, you hold on the line, I'll Google it for you.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.320]   Pick up the best results.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.040]   Bit of a backlog, so you can be patient.
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:32.040]   - It's not a bad idea.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:35.440]   - Oh, it's like that Mark has probably April 1st video
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.720]   when he had the, before they announced Bixby,
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:41.320]   the Samsung speaker, which is ask Google every question.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.160]   - Yeah.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.360]   (laughing)
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:48.000]   - Our show today brought to you, and like as Andy said,
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.200]   all about Android tonight,
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.240]   that's what they're gonna talk about.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.960]   Twig tomorrow, that's what we're gonna talk about.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.720]   We've got actually a great panel again this Sunday.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.880]   I'm twig, I'm sure that's what we will be talking about.
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:02.280]   It's probably, you know, this is as big as when
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:07.280]   my ZOJ sued Microsoft in 1998.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:10.600]   That case took almost 10 years to come to a head,
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.800]   and it was all we talked about for those whole 10 years.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.040]   So guys, you got something to look forward to.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.680]   (laughing)
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:21.360]   Our show today brought to you by ITProTV.
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:24.880]   God knows, these days it's tough, you know,
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:27.480]   having a job, finding a job.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.280]   Maybe you've got your underemployed, unemployed.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.240]   Maybe you just don't have a job, you like a lot.
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.000]   And if you're watching our shows,
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.800]   then I know you love technology, you love IT.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.520]   Wouldn't it be fun to get a career in IT?
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:39.880]   The question is how?
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.120]   And the hardest thing is getting that first job,
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.160]   because you don't have, you know,
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.760]   the experience under your belt.
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.000]   That's why the certification system was created.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.600]   Tests you can take to show your knowledge.
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.840]   You can't just walk in and take those tests though.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.880]   You gotta study for them, you gotta be ready for them.
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:58.280]   And that's what ITProTV does.
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.000]   They actually started Don Pazette
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.040]   and Tim Broome, the creators.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.200]   They were IT certificate trainers
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.880]   who decided to make a TV channel basically
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:13.160]   out of a TV station out of it, and ITProTV was born.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.720]   If you're interested in an IT career,
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:17.600]   but you're not sure where to start,
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.720]   'cause IT is more than just one thing.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:23.440]   ITProTV is a great place to go, a one-stop shop
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.440]   for online IT education in every area of IT government.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:33.640]   Managed services, healthcare, education, finance,
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:37.160]   insurance, and on and on and on.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.240]   They make, the point of this really is
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.320]   that they make learning IT fun and entertaining,
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.640]   and they make it easy and accessible
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.160]   so you can retain the knowledge.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:50.600]   It's not just preparing for a test, it's learning.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.520]   In fact, that's why so many IT professionals
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:54.080]   continue their membership.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.320]   So many IT teams buy memberships.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.920]   It's a great way to keep your skills up to date.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:02.040]   5,800 hours of IT training.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:06.720]   They teach for 375 combined certifications.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.240]   That's a lot of them.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.560]   And if you're a manager,
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.960]   learning to develop the skills of your existing IT team,
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:13.640]   ITProTV is just as valuable.
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.520]   They have every vendor, every skill you need.
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:20.200]   They're the only official video training for CompTIA.
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.800]   Mike, they have Microsoft IT, Cisco training,
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:27.040]   Linux training, Apple training, security, the cloud.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:30.400]   And the team dashboard, the Pro Portal is fantastic.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.280]   You can see how your team's doing.
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.320]   You can actually demonstrate the return on investment.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:39.120]   Manage the seats on assign and unassigned team members.
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.080]   You can access monthly usage reports,
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.320]   see metrics like logins, viewing time, courses viewed,
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.120]   tracks completed and more.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.360]   It's a great way to manage your team.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:50.360]   You can even have subsets of users within your team,
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.920]   providing them with customized assignments,
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:56.520]   monitoring individual and group progress,
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.760]   usage, the whole thing.
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.080]   Assignments can be full courses,
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:02.200]   but you can even do individual episodes.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.360]   ITProTV really is a one-stop shop
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.720]   for everything we love about technology.
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.280]   They've got that great podcast,
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:10.120]   Technado with Don Pezzette.
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.120]   That's industry guests and IT news recaps
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.040]   for a deeper dive into the IT realm.
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.520]   This is October.
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.480]   This is Cyber Security Awareness Month.
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.000]   So they've celebrated.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.800]   We did a great event at the beginning of the month
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.200]   with ITProTV.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.800]   We called it Hangover.
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:29.920]   What enterprise technology is gonna look like after COVID.
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:30.960]   I recommend that,
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.360]   but they also have hundreds of hours
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:36.640]   of Cyber Security training for Cyber Security Awareness Month.
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:39.080]   If you wanna start a career in the industry,
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:40.000]   there's nowhere better.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.320]   ITProTV.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.840]   If you wanna expand the skills of your IT team,
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.120]   there's nowhere better.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.520]   ITProTV.
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:48.840]   It's exactly what you need.
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:52.800]   Go to ITPro.tv/MacBreak to learn more.
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.000]   There's Don.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.840]   Use the code MacBreak30 to get 30% off
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.640]   all the consumer subscriptions.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:01.920]   As long as you stay active, you'll get 30% off.
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.000]   That's an amazing deal.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.840]   They have practice exams.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:09.120]   They have HTML5 Labs.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.800]   You don't have to have Windows or even Windows
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.600]   or a Windows server to do it.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.280]   ITProTV.tv/MacBreak.
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:19.800]   Again, the code MacBreak30 for an additional 30% off
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.240]   the life of your active subscription.

[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.680]   We love these guys.
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.040]   ITProTV.
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:28.120]   Build or expand your IT career.
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:31.880]   And even better, enjoy the journey with ITPro.
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:32.760]   TV.
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.320]   Thank you.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:37.080]   Tim and Don in the entire ITProTV team.
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.760]   They're great, great bunch of people over there.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:43.520]   LiDAR.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.920]   Really good article, I thought.
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:49.200]   And I'm sure you've all read it.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.360]   You know, Ari's technical by Timothy B. Lee.
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:57.560]   He kind of broke down the progress we've made in LiDAR
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.880]   that made it possible to bring it to the iPhone.
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:02.280]   He says, you know, the Velodyne LiDAR
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:05.520]   that originally was on cars with all those moving parts
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.320]   and lasers used to cost $75,000.
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:13.720]   But Apple basically has brought it down to chip size
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:18.280]   using something called vertical cavity surface emitting lasers.
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:22.280]   VC cells from companies like Loomentum,
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:25.960]   that's what they use on the iPad.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.120]   One of the ways they save money is instead of having
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.400]   the light come out of the edge of the chip.
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.160]   It comes out at the top of the chip.
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:37.520]   So they're using these single photon avalanche diodes.
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.800]   So that is actually one of the ways
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.760]   you got the prices down because they can use the whole,
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:47.320]   you know, thing.
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.120]   What do you call it?
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.240]   Can I just make a request for single avalanche photon
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.280]   diodes for show title?
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.920]   I think it's a good name.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.400]   It's called Fads.
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.560]   Really good, really good article.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.640]   And one of the things, you know, you know,
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:03.440]   I got to point out, there's not a lot you can do
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.840]   with your LiDAR right now in your iPad.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:08.680]   I imagine there'll be some applications for the iPhone.
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.920]   But the thing that's most exciting to me is
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:13.400]   when Apple puts it on, you know,
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.800]   several hundred million devices,
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:19.120]   that just means it's going to get less expensive,
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.920]   more sophisticated, more widespread.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:26.240]   Already DJI has announced a LiDAR add-on for its drones.
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.240]   LiDAR is going to be everywhere eventually.
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.080]   Can I be honest, LiDAR?
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:32.600]   I mean, for normal people, just the photographic enhancements,
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:36.200]   like being able to do instant focus in low light
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.640]   and being able to do low light.
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.400]   Like a normal person doesn't understand
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.200]   why isn't my full-wide portrait mode working?
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.400]   What it says more light, it says no more light,
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:44.600]   or why isn't it focusing?
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:45.840]   I just want to take a picture of my friend
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:47.640]   in the restaurant for her birthday.
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.400]   And this just, you don't even have to think about it anymore.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:51.880]   You just have the button that focuses.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:53.960]   If you want to do portrait mode, you can do a portrait mode
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:58.120]   and it removes that extra level of celebrity dysfunction
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.040]   that we had to deal with as a technology for yourself.
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:03.680]   Even that, by itself, yeah, it's just a better focusing system.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.800]   Is it the same as what we had on the front of the iPhone 11,
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.720]   the true depth sensor?
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:12.360]   It is way less dense, but it projects way further out.
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:17.360]   Yeah, okay, so instead of 30,000 dots, it's 100 dots,
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:21.520]   but it can go now as far as, I think it was,
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.640]   was it 10 meters, 15 meters and go quite a way?
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.800]   Alex Lindsey is already making models of all of us
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:28.720]   that he can have a virtual Mac break in his living room.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.160]   So this is one more feature that makes the low light photography
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:35.200]   very compelling with the pros, right?
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:39.520]   Yeah, it's also very, very intriguing that Apple seems
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.680]   to be banking LIDAR part of basic feature set
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:45.480]   for its iOS devices, which makes you think that
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:49.120]   they're starting it off on the more expensive devices.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.920]   They will probably start rolling it out
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.640]   on the less expensive devices as the prices
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.040]   of these components come down.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.880]   And then when they start to have an ecosystem
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:59.160]   in which everybody who has an iOS device
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.880]   probably has a LIDAR sensor,
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:02.560]   that's when you're going to see activation
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:05.640]   of a lot of more interesting AR features.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:08.800]   Renee is absolutely right, it's gonna immediately affect
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:12.760]   how good a photo people can take in low light
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.440]   and pretty much any other situation.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:18.480]   But it also has some other features that we're hinted at
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:22.160]   in the event like they didn't do,
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.320]   they didn't go so far as to say,
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:28.320]   well here is me creating a 3D model of my youngest kid
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.480]   with the 3D sensing LIDAR,
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:32.280]   but they were also, but they were showing,
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:35.120]   hey, here I am as a product designer
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:40.120]   or as a interior designer, taking measurements of a room
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:42.280]   just with the LIDAR, they were really indicating
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.600]   that at least in an empty room, it could accurately
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:46.240]   sense the shape of a room and also the distance
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.280]   from wall to wall.
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.240]   And if that's not what they intended,
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:51.760]   then I think that someone should say,
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.880]   yeah, it seems like you promised something in the demo
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:56.160]   that you didn't actually intend.
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.720]   This is the sort of stuff that it's kind of,
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.200]   once they can only move forward with these sort of features,
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:04.200]   once it's in a preponderance of Apple devices.
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.360]   And once that happens, if they do have the ability
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:10.080]   to suddenly pull 3D data, not just to enhance your photos,
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.680]   but also to find more interesting ways of doing AR,
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:15.120]   more interesting ways of doing capture
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:18.320]   of physical objects you have in your vicinity,
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.480]   then that's gonna be another thing where
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:24.080]   your friend's phone can do this feature,
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.840]   your phone cannot, which makes you wonder,
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.920]   gee, I wonder if I should buy a phone like the one
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:29.000]   my friend says.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.080]   - Yeah.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:34.680]   Lori, do you ever use your LIDAR for like IKEA,
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:35.880]   shopping or anything?
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880]   I mean.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:40.280]   - I, this is the first time I have had a device with LIDAR,
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:42.120]   so I didn't get the iPad Pro with my heart.
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.120]   - Oh, you only get the new iPad, okay.
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:45.640]   - Right, so, but here's the thing though,
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:47.920]   I think that there's gonna be more use cases
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:52.800]   for artificial augmented reality
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.520]   with things like phones,
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.840]   then there are with things like tablets.
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:59.160]   - Yeah, holding a big old iPad is not that much fun
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.360]   for any like the time.
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:04.280]   - Yes, and it's still in its infancy phases
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.160]   that the infrastructure for augmented reality
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:12.920]   to become a consumer thing, it's just not there yet,
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:14.360]   but it's getting there.
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.440]   And putting phones, and it's just like what Andy was saying,
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:22.040]   putting phones with LIDAR in the hands of millions of people
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:26.800]   is only going to improve what we come up with to use it for.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:31.360]   So it's, you know, Apple's been saying for years now
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.480]   that they're bullish on augmented reality.
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:36.320]   We've been hearing this from their finance calls
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:40.640]   for years now, so they've been working towards something
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.920]   that's gonna be really big, and they really do believe
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:46.800]   that AR is something that will be a big thing
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:49.800]   in the future, they're setting the groundwork for that,
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.080]   which is really what you have to do for something like this,
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.120]   is that you have to build an infrastructure
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:59.120]   so that someday when there are consumer facing,
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:01.520]   you know, apps and other programs and things
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:02.760]   that take advantage of it,
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:07.160]   everybody already has the hardware to start using it.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.080]   So this is definitely-
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.560]   - It's that old chicken and egg,
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:13.080]   you gotta have one before you can have the other.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.720]   - Yeah, it's useless right now,
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:19.360]   but someday it will be really important for everyone,
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:22.760]   and it really does take people having it out in the wild
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:25.200]   to like understand what the potential could be,
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:28.440]   'cause you can just talk about how cool it would be
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.840]   to like put a chair in your living room,
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.000]   but nobody cares that much about that.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.280]   Nobody's gonna buy a $1,000 phone just for that.
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.800]   But if everybody already has this hardware
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:39.200]   and they're out in the real world,
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.200]   and they're like just sort of coming up with ideas
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:45.000]   for things that potentially it could be,
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.960]   then they bring that to their friend who has a startup.
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.760]   Suddenly you've got, you know, AR programs popping up
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.840]   all over the place that would take advantage of that.
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.600]   - There's a certain amount of faith on your part
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.600]   that such a thing exists, that there is some killer app.
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.600]   We just don't know what it is, but there is some-
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:01.440]   - It's a gloss, right.
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:04.480]   - Yeah, maybe it's glasses, yeah, but that's not the phone.
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:05.320]   It's the glasses.
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:06.160]   - No.
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.800]   - So somebody in the chat room though,
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:12.120]   they say when you combine LiDAR and the U1 chip,
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.760]   there are a number of opportunities for applications.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:15.600]   That's kind of interesting.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.760]   The U1 chip allows you to kind of do direction.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:20.560]   - Your Apple remote is in the sofa, questions LiDAR.
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:21.760]   And you'll see it, you'll hold up your phone,
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.960]   you'll see the sofa, you'll go transparent,
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.080]   you'll see your Apple remote underneath it,
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.400]   and you'll curse.
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.260]   - Yeah, I feel like, I kind of agree with you,
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:32.520]   and I that this is a technology that might be better suited
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:36.120]   to glasses than to anything.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.880]   But by putting in the phone,
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:39.600]   and it has one compelling use,
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.800]   which is better, low light focus,
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:45.320]   they are kind of jump-starting an industry.
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:49.420]   So maybe that's a good enough reason to do it.
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:52.640]   - Sure, it'll be a lot of fun games.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.440]   Right now, a lot of the stuff I wanted to try
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:55.720]   and test out is iPad only,
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:58.280]   like the apps in the app store just say iPad only,
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:14:59.360]   and I don't have to put them on the phone,
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.000]   but they haven't updated yet.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.320]   - It's just not that compelling.
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.800]   - I haven't, I have yet to see anything that I go,
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.800]   oh, we still have, I think we're still missing
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:09.560]   the killer app for this.
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:10.400]   - I guess yes.
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:11.240]   - Yes.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:14.120]   - But it's gonna take millions of people with phones,
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:14.960]   with LIDAR.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:15.800]   - Somebody does it.
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:16.880]   - So eventually come up with that.
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.680]   - I'm sure Alex Lindsey will love to do that.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.760]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.760]   - Oh, just said we're missing the killer app.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:24.040]   I think, Chief, because we're missing the killer hardware,
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.400]   that it's as soon as we get advice
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.800]   that is better than simply holding up a phone screen.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:30.720]   And augmented reality works great
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:33.040]   when you're using a navigation app
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.960]   and you're using your screen as a viewfinder.
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:38.280]   It's gonna really take off when it really is something
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.560]   that it gets to the point where it's not just,
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.760]   hey, and now let's take a look at the solar system
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:45.960]   in action, kids, put on your magic glasses
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.320]   and stare at this specially patterned table.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.920]   It's gonna become really, really incredible
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:53.800]   when it becomes, I've got these glasses on,
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.080]   they've got the special sensor in,
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:58.600]   and I've decided that this blank spot of wall over there
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.760]   always tell me like what my next appointment is.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:01.960]   So anytime I look at that wall,
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.840]   I want you to superimpose the details of my next appointment
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:07.000]   and put on that wall over there,
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.840]   a live view outside, 'cause I'm keeping an eye on my FedEx,
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:13.520]   stuff like that really allows you to manipulate
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.760]   what you're seeing around you,
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.800]   that people are finally gonna say that
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.920]   not only is this worth my putting on a pair of glasses
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:20.540]   that I don't actually optically need,
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:23.640]   but this is gonna be worth my $800, $900,000.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.800]   I mean, right now we do have people who are spending,
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:27.480]   we're saying this foldable phone
[01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:29.040]   that's only in the second generation,
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.040]   that's worth $1,500 or $2,000 or money.
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:32.920]   - $2,000 and it's not.
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:33.920]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.960]   Having spent it, I could tell you it's not.
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:40.200]   - Well, I thought in the middle you'll have a hot dog.
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:44.920]   - I know a couple people that use their galaxy folds
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:45.840]   and they really, really love it,
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:49.320]   but that's exactly the point that it's not gonna make sense
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:51.920]   for most people, it's gonna make sense for a few people
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:55.760]   and those are the people that bought a 128K Mac
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.760]   and said, "Wow, I really love that now I'm on page eight
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.400]   "of my paper, I have to switch disks
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.760]   "because it can't load more than nine pages in Mac, right,
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:04.840]   "at the same time."
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:07.120]   It's the difference between early adopters
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:09.880]   and the more intense people, the early believers
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:11.640]   and we're not even at the point
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.440]   where we can have good hardware for early believers yet,
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:15.280]   for AR.
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:17.600]   - I guess I'm turning into John C. de Vorak.
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.160]   Maybe that happens with age,
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:22.400]   but it's absolutely also the case
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:26.360]   that we've seen hard, but often hardware come along
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.280]   that promises something and just never, never to lose.
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.960]   - Or it goes away like really touch.
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:32.320]   I mean, that was great,
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.240]   like it was the next huge thing and then last year.
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:36.440]   - Bye bye and then they did replicate the functionality,
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.360]   but maybe that's what happens.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.880]   It has its shot if it becomes an ex-big thing, it's great.
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:43.160]   If not, it becomes a side feature to something else.
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:44.000]   - Right. - Try some,
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.480]   and then you have to go again. - Right, right.
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:47.920]   So I'm still skeptical.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:50.920]   I don't know, John was always able to express skepticism
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:52.880]   in a way that didn't, you know.
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:53.760]   - So are you doing like,
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:54.760]   I was, - I'm not buying.
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:59.000]   - Georgia's husband has the iPad Pro with the LIDAR
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.720]   and he uses it constantly, like he's measuring stuff with it.
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.200]   They were trying out carpets to find one for their floor
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:05.640]   with the IKEA app. - Okay.
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.400]   - And they just, she just kept calling going,
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.600]   okay, maybe iPad's not so terrible.
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.760]   - Okay, I guess.
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.760]   - Yeah. - I do agree with you that the,
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:17.000]   I'm very, very suspicious of any predictions that,
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.760]   oh, Apple is gonna have these,
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.880]   it was in the patent filing though.
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:23.240]   The frames looked exactly like a normal pair of glasses.
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:24.400]   - Exactly. - But it had,
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.920]   had 8K resolution and full captures like,
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:29.120]   yeah, that's, that's easy to draw,
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:32.040]   not easy to actually build so that it actually works.
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.520]   So that's, but I think it really is on my--
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:34.360]   - I'll show you that when I see it list. - I'll show you that.
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.200]   - I'll show you that when I see it list.
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:36.040]   - Yeah.
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:40.760]   Anything else, Laurie or Renee to say about the new iPhones,
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:43.160]   you both are holding them.
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.680]   The blue is pretty.
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:47.640]   Can you tell a difference between the aluminum, the,
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.560]   I love Apple, there's a little marketing.
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:53.400]   Aircraft grade aluminum versus surgical stainless steel.
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:57.040]   Any, anything you wanna say about that?
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:59.160]   - I thought we'd feel more like the iPhone 4,
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:02.840]   but because it's got the coating on it
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.800]   and the sides don't come up over the edge
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.000]   the way the iPhone 4 does.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   It ends up having a very different feel.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.280]   So it's still squarish.
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:12.160]   It's, it's, and it's not, there's no chamfered edge
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.120]   because I guess Johnny took that with him when he left.
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:14.960]   - Oh my God.
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.520]   - Yeah, which is too bad because it's kind of my favorite
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.840]   part of that design. - You missed your chamfered?
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.040]   - Really? - Yeah.
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.920]   I like that little, that tiny little angle
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.000]   along the side.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:23.840]   Yeah.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.320]   - I'm guessing, I don't know.
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:27.440]   You can tell me it looks like it'll be a little easier
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:30.200]   to turn on and off the do not disturb switch there though
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.960]   because the chamfering kind of blocks that switch.
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:34.800]   - Well, those were round.
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.880]   They used to have round buttons and I missed those
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:39.000]   but these are way easier to use.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.520]   Like the round ones looked so nice.
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.360]   - That's right.
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.200]   I remember that.
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.040]   Yeah, they were round.
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.920]   - But these are easier to use.
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:45.760]   - All right.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.120]   - I love how these square edges will make it fit better
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.840]   into cases and fit better into like accessory,
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:53.760]   accessory stuff like tripod stands and stuff like that.
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:54.760]   It's, I think that the--
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:56.440]   - They stand up again Andy.
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:57.800]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.800]   Maybe the old hack of like making like the phone vibrate
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.680]   to turn around and give you the panorama.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:04.800]   Maybe that Apple work once again.
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:09.920]   - According to Matthew Panzerino, consider the source.
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:11.080]   Oh him.
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.200]   No, we love Matthew.
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.600]   - No, just for a second.
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:16.080]   This genius has not only got the Apple beat,
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:19.920]   the Disney beat, the sneaker beat and the whiskey beat
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:23.080]   but now he started the pizza oven and steak oven beat
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:23.920]   at TechCrunch.
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:26.560]   - This may be more of a measure of TechCrunch's
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:29.920]   scant resources than his multiple abilities.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:30.920]   - No, he planned this.
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:31.760]   - Nity?
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.040]   - He's our Renaissance man.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:37.760]   He says the gold phone doesn't pick up fingerprints
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:40.600]   as well as the other colors.
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:41.440]   So--
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:42.960]   - I like that you said as well,
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.760]   as if that's like a bonus thing to pick up fingerprints.
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:46.920]   - Yeah, no, yes.
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:49.920]   If you want fingerprints, do not get gold.
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.920]   - For forensic purposes, it's wonderful.
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:53.920]   (laughing)
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.560]   - I'm just glad he couldn't do his Disney review
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:56.880]   like every year he does.
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.920]   - Oh yeah, that's right.
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.920]   He used to take it to Disney Land, didn't he?
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:02.000]   - Every year, yeah.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.520]   Do you have a 2020?
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:07.160]   - Do you want to see what the blue and the specific blue
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:08.720]   and midnight green look like?
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:09.920]   - Ooh.
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:12.160]   - Wow, they almost don't look different.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:13.160]   I'm trying to get a good angle so that you can see.
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.600]   - Well, they're both mad.
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:16.440]   So how many phones do you look off?
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.560]   You have any phones you have.
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.720]   So I'm trying to decide what color.
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:23.800]   I think I want to get the fingerprint-free gold.
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:24.640]   - You know that I really--
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.760]   - I haven't seen it with my own eyes,
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:29.320]   but what I really like about the gold
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:31.920]   is the shiny gold around the edge.
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:34.360]   It's really, really nice looking.
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.520]   - They did a really good job with that.
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:37.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:38.680]   - Yeah.
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:42.480]   So I would say go for it, especially like lack of fingerprints
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:45.840]   plus that beautiful shiny gold color that they've got there.
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:48.600]   - It's a PVD coating.
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:49.440]   - PVD, yeah.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:52.260]   - Power video display?
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:54.000]   - No, we all see a--
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.400]   - The display is a vibration.
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.440]   - It's vapor deposit.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:00.400]   - Vapor deposit, powder vapor deposit,
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.160]   or peripheral vascular disease.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.760]   You get to pick.
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:04.600]   (laughing)
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.600]   - I don't like so many letters to initialize a nickel in.
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:11.320]   - You get to choose your PVD.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:16.320]   He does say that the iPhone 12,
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:19.520]   compared to the iPhone 12 Pro,
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:22.500]   is like a Timex to a Rolex.
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:27.140]   But I don't like the color of the blue on the Pro,
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:29.900]   so I think I might end up with the gold.
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:31.220]   - Or the red.
[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:32.060]   - I wish they had a red.
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:33.380]   They don't have a red on the Pro.
[01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:34.660]   - Yeah, I would love a red too.
[01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:35.500]   - No, I love red.
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:37.100]   - Maybe next year.
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:39.660]   - I want product red.
[01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:40.500]   - Yeah, same.
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:43.460]   - I think they can't do it with these premium materials.
[01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:45.560]   - I don't know if you can PVD red.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.060]   I'm sure you can, but I don't know if you can do it
[01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:48.540]   at a iPhone scale.
[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:49.740]   - Right.
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.220]   You have to be done by hand.
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:56.620]   - All right, anything else before we move on to Adobe Max?
[01:22:56.620 --> 01:23:00.020]   Anything else you want to note about these new phones?
[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:03.740]   I think we've got a great job covering all the screens
[01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:05.100]   are bright.
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:06.380]   We've seen the OLEDs.
[01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:07.780]   - They're all right now.
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:09.620]   - Pro's brighter, okay.
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:12.100]   - For normal, so for typical, the Pro is 800 nits.
[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:14.220]   The regular is 625 nits,
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:16.980]   but they both had 1200 max nits for HDR.
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:19.100]   - Yeah, apparently you can really tell
[01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:20.420]   when the HDR turns on.
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:22.060]   - Yeah.
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:23.380]   - You got a tan.
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:26.220]   (laughing)
[01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:27.380]   - I'm excited.
[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:29.940]   I don't know who watches movies on phones,
[01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:31.820]   but those people will also be excited.
[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:33.060]   - If you hold them close enough, Leo,
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:34.620]   it's a 75 inch screen.
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:36.060]   You've got to hold their close enough.
[01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:38.860]   (laughing)
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:41.700]   - All right, Adobe Max happens every year.
[01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:43.260]   They announce a lot of things.
[01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:45.300]   Andy, you said you're excited about Illustrator.
[01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:46.820]   It's now available on the iPad.
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:48.220]   Are you an illustrator user?
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:53.460]   - I haven't been because I haven't had a synch dictus.
[01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:55.460]   I never know how to pronounce a synch-tique.
[01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:57.180]   - Oh, synch-tique, yeah.
[01:23:57.180 --> 01:23:59.620]   - Those are the touch tablets
[01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:01.620]   that a lot of people use for screens, rather.
[01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:02.700]   - Yeah.
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:06.780]   So now they've done Illustrator for iPad.
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:10.260]   Like Photoshop for iPad, this first release
[01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:13.420]   is not the full thing that you're sort of used to.
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:16.460]   I don't think it even does variable line widths,
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:19.580]   but in terms of creating outlines, creating shapes,
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:21.460]   working with things that you've already started
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:24.540]   in the cloud in Adobe Creative Suite,
[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:26.100]   it's nice to have that extra thing.
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:29.740]   It adds extra legitimacy to the idea
[01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:31.820]   of a $1,000 iPad Pro.
[01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:34.580]   I think that the competition is
[01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:38.540]   these $1,000, $1,500 Surface tablets
[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:40.860]   that can run like the full version,
[01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:42.620]   the full desktop versions of Photoshop,
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:45.100]   not as fast, not as well, at that price point.
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:46.740]   But if Apple can make the case that,
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:48.940]   look, this is why you're spending $1,000 on our product
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:52.220]   instead of $1,500 on the competing product,
[01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:53.540]   this is really gonna sell.
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:58.300]   I'm trying to get caught up with the neural filters
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:24:59.660]   they've added to Photoshop,
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:01.700]   which sound like the sort of thing
[01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:03.340]   that would scare a lot of people.
[01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:05.780]   They've added a new AI-powered filter.
[01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:09.540]   So if you're doing, I think we've all been in a situation
[01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:10.980]   where we have that one family member
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:13.460]   that even when they're really, really happy,
[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:14.620]   they're at the wedding,
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:17.060]   the birthday party, they still have this sort of
[01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:19.140]   (grumbles) expression.
[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:20.860]   So now there's like one of these neural filters
[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:22.500]   will actually like adjust expressions,
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.780]   like make this expression a little bit happier.
[01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:26.100]   - I like it.
[01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:28.500]   - And it's the sort of stuff that you know,
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:30.260]   there's gonna be a lot of think pieces about.
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:33.340]   And now in an era in which we have to question
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:36.420]   every single thing, Adobe is even making us falsify
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:38.700]   our emotions and shouldn't that be?
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:41.940]   - Nine and five Mac posted this tweet,
[01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:45.660]   testing out the new Adobe neuro filters in Photoshop.
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:48.500]   We now have a photo of what Tim Cook will look like
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:51.180]   when air tags finally arrive.
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:53.020]   - Yeah, you can also adjust age.
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:55.900]   - Yeah, they're using the aging one and he,
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:57.460]   it's pretty credible.
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:58.540]   I think it does a pretty good job.
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:01.260]   I don't know if he will look like that in 50 years,
[01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:03.540]   but not bad.
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:05.660]   I looked like that already.
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:09.060]   So, you know, I can warn you Tim that's coming.
[01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:16.820]   So, if you have a creative cloud subscription
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:18.500]   where that concludes Illustrator,
[01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:20.900]   you'll get it for free on the iPad, that's good.
[01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:26.460]   Anything else to say about this?
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:28.660]   - Not really, they added a couple,
[01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:31.420]   they added a few features to Photoshop on the iPad,
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:32.820]   not many though.
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.860]   So this really is still kind of a,
[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:37.540]   I'm surprised it's taken so long to build up Photoshop
[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:40.660]   as something that's competitive with other photo editing
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:42.420]   and imaging editing apps that already exist.
[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:45.140]   They did add one of the most popular features
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:48.260]   of other drawing apps on the iPad,
[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:51.180]   which is the ability to livestream what you're drawing
[01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:52.420]   a lot of times. - I love that.
[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:54.620]   Yeah, a lot of Twitch people doing that and stuff.
[01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:56.340]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:27:00.580]   - Apple has launched MTV for Apple TV.
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:05.820]   Apple Music TV, I want my Apple Music TV.
[01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:08.020]   That kid in the chair with his hair being blown back.
[01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:09.820]   - Oh yeah, remember that ad?
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:13.700]   - Yeah, 24-hour music, yeah, it was for Max Eltep, yeah.
[01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:18.620]   24-hour music video livestream, just one,
[01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:23.540]   not just videos, it also has his interviews and countdowns
[01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:24.580]   and all sorts of stuff.
[01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:27.100]   So it's video radio, I guess.
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:29.180]   You can watch it in your Apple Music app
[01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:31.140]   or your Apple TV app.
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:34.100]   Mike is that he really liked it, he's been watching it.
[01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:38.580]   - You got a haircut too, you guys all both look so--
[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:40.180]   - We tidied up. - We poppered today.
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:41.660]   - Yeah, we tidied it up. - You cleaned up nice.
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:42.980]   - Yeah, cleaned up nice.
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:47.900]   Don't know what to say about it, except if you have Apple Music
[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:48.900]   you can now have--
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:51.260]   - Well, MTV doesn't show music anymore, somebody's--
[01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:53.100]   - No, yeah, right. - Yeah, well there might be
[01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:55.180]   some reason for that, you know, like maybe,
[01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:58.020]   'cause honestly, if you just go to YouTube
[01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:00.740]   you could play any playlist, almost all of it has video.
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:02.500]   You know-- - But nobody wants to choose,
[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:04.500]   that's the thing, Leo, like choosing is a burden.
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:07.620]   It's why I have access to anything I wanna watch
[01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:10.180]   and I don't watch anything, but if I just had cable again
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:12.380]   I'd turn it on and watch whatever was playing.
[01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:17.420]   - Lori and I no longer have to worry that our November 1st,
[01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:20.740]   our Apple TV subscriptions will die.
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:23.860]   Thank you Apple for extending it to January.
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:26.140]   - Yes, thank you, appreciate that Apple.
[01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:29.060]   - I just wanted to be long enough so that I could get Apple One
[01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:31.220]   then I don't have to worry about it.
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:33.820]   - Yeah, well that's probably part of why they extended it
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:36.460]   is that they know people are gonna wanna subscribe
[01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:38.820]   to something, so if they offer, for example,
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:43.420]   a year straight of TV+, and then you go by
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:46.900]   your year straight of TV+, and then they offer Apple One
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:49.340]   and then you're like, well that ruins everything
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:51.100]   that I just paid for, so yeah.
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:56.100]   - Yeah, so now it's time for our prognostications
[01:28:56.100 --> 01:29:00.940]   'cause we know there's gotta be another event, right?
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:03.540]   Prosser says it's not gonna be weirdly
[01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:06.060]   not till November 17th, which seems
[01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:07.260]   a little bit late.
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:10.620]   - Well you have an election and then you have a hangover
[01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:12.380]   and then it's gonna be best again.
[01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:13.460]   - You think Apple's worried that
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:16.580]   'cause the elections November 3rd, yeah you're right,
[01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:17.580]   they're not gonna send an invitation
[01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:20.020]   to November 3rd 'cause we're busy.
[01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:22.940]   - Yeah, a little bit.
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:25.340]   - We're busy preparing the Red Banner's a revolution
[01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:27.340]   that we might need the next day.
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:29.540]   - And then you're Thanksgiving don't you?
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:30.740]   - Yeah, but that's the thing there,
[01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:33.380]   the Thanksgiving's the 26th, so they're kinda--
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:34.380]   - Yeah, that's the week they can't do.
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:36.140]   - Well the question was, is it closer,
[01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:39.580]   which would we prefer closer to the election or Thanksgiving?
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:43.820]   The election, at this point, so many people have voted early,
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:46.020]   which you would think would make
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:47.620]   the election results come in earlier,
[01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:49.420]   but in fact, we'll make the election results
[01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:51.620]   given later 'cause early voting--
[01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:53.260]   - And they can't do it and they can't do it right away.
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:55.900]   - Yeah, it's confusing in the not many choices in November.
[01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:57.940]   So those of us and I already voted,
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:29:59.780]   those of us who have already voted,
[01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:02.240]   our ballots are just stored in a
[01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:05.380]   hermetically sealed jar in Funkin' Wagnall's porch
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:08.420]   or something until the election day,
[01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:11.700]   and then they count the live votes first,
[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:12.740]   and when the polls close,
[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:15.700]   that's what all the networks are gonna start saying,
[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:17.860]   and those will be the people who took the chance
[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:21.500]   of going out and voting in person on election day.
[01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:24.060]   So there's some concern that those results will not be
[01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:26.540]   the anything close to the actual results
[01:30:26.540 --> 01:30:29.820]   because then they start counting all of the mail-in ballots,
[01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:31.460]   and that could take days,
[01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:33.780]   so the results won't be in on the third,
[01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:37.700]   and so public service announcement,
[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:40.700]   don't go to bed on the third thinking you're Guy One,
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:43.820]   'cause no one knows, it's gonna be a great mystery
[01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:47.380]   unless it's such a landslide that it's obvious,
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:48.500]   but that's unlikely.
[01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:51.340]   So yeah, maybe they're smart, maybe they're saying,
[01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:54.860]   "Well, this could go on."
[01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:57.900]   The tenth might be still people would be watching TV.
[01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:02.980]   As Trump starts waving about threats about the 12,
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:04.780]   invoking the 12th Amendment,
[01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:07.660]   maybe you want to focus on this new shiny gadget,
[01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:08.940]   just for a day.
[01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:09.780]   - Yeah.
[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:10.620]   - Just...
[01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:12.460]   - So this is credible that they would do it
[01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:14.420]   on Tuesday the 17th.
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:15.580]   - Yeah, that sure makes sense.
[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:18.060]   - Now, what will they do?
[01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:21.820]   Will they do, they'll do obviously Apple Silicon.
[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:22.820]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:25.780]   - No consensus, even this close,
[01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:27.940]   'cause presumably whatever it is they're building it now,
[01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:29.700]   maybe not, no, maybe not.
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:31.300]   Maybe they're gonna say, "Hey,"
[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:34.980]   and you can order it December 31st for delivery.
[01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:35.940]   - They said it's shipping this year,
[01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:37.940]   that means it has to arrive on December 31st.
[01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:38.780]   - Oh, okay.
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:39.620]   - Like the Mac Pro.
[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:41.380]   - They said shipping not announced.
[01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:45.100]   - The first system will be out this year,
[01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:47.460]   which means that at least three people have to get it
[01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:48.580]   by New Year's Eve.
[01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:49.580]   (laughing)
[01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:51.540]   - 'Cause I remember the trash can Mac,
[01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:53.620]   you could order it, but you didn't get it.
[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:56.420]   - Like they got 500 out on December 27th or something.
[01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:57.900]   - Some people got it, yeah, yeah.
[01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:00.220]   - Okay, so maybe it'll be a little bit like that.
[01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:03.980]   So some sort of Apple Silicon thing could be,
[01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:06.380]   I mean, the rumors are everything from a MacBook,
[01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:11.380]   nothing to a MacBook Pro to a MacBook Air to an iMac even.
[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:16.740]   - It'll probably be a small MacBook of different,
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:18.220]   new and different powers.
[01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:20.380]   (laughing)
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:22.700]   - Yeah, I think that if Apple has full,
[01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:25.500]   Apple had a full and free choice over what model
[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.180]   was going to be the very first one.
[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:30.300]   I really think that they would choose a MacBook, nothing,
[01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:33.060]   something the most bang for the buck for this initial release
[01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:37.220]   is going to be a low powered Mac that has a battery life
[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:39.740]   that is ungodly long.
[01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:42.380]   That is, that will have iPad like battery life.
[01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:44.140]   And that's the sort of stuff that will get people to say,
[01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:46.540]   "I don't care if this is a brand new CPU.
[01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:48.540]   I don't care if there's gonna be some growing pains.
[01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:52.140]   I want that laptop that I can take on an overnight
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:55.100]   and not have to worry about taking a charger with me."
[01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:56.900]   - Wouldn't that be the same,
[01:32:56.900 --> 01:32:59.820]   like wouldn't that be the same reason to do it
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:02.140]   for the MacBook Pro so that the Pro's
[01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:03.500]   can be really impressed with that kind of thing?
[01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.620]   - Really thin and light and see,
[01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:06.820]   I'm wonderful.
[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:08.900]   - 'Cause I think one of the things Apple's fighting against
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:12.060]   is this idea that arm chips aren't as powerful.
[01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:13.900]   And so one of the things they're fighting against,
[01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:15.820]   and I don't think it's gonna be true at all,
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:18.500]   is that Apple Silicon is gonna have great battery life
[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:20.260]   but be a little underpowered.
[01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:22.340]   So I think it's risky to do that.
[01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:24.940]   I think you wanna also maybe ship that
[01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:28.260]   and then ship one thing that has superpowers.
[01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:29.580]   Maybe just to--
[01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:31.340]   - They're all gonna have superpowers.
[01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:32.180]   - I mean, they're gonna have some looking--
[01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:33.020]   - Maybe they'll do. - That's pretty
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:33.940]   meaningful to the software.
[01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:34.780]   - Right.
[01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:36.900]   - Maybe they'll do the entire MacBook lineup.
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:40.220]   Maybe it'll be a MacBook standard, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro
[01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:41.340]   all on the same day.
[01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:43.180]   Oh God, that would be so hard to cover.
[01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:44.700]   (laughs)
[01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:45.980]   - Yeah, but my only-- - More is my only--
[01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:47.140]   - That's what we're gonna call it.
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:48.900]   - Who do that, Laurie?
[01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:52.980]   - My only qualm with doing the Pro is that it depends on,
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:55.420]   I guess what you're kind of thinking is,
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:58.180]   you can either say that the people who buy Pro's,
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:33:59.940]   if they're spending $2,000 or more,
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:02.220]   they're expecting a finished working thing.
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:04.060]   Also, they're expecting to immediately put this
[01:34:04.060 --> 01:34:07.260]   into service on tasks that will make the money.
[01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:09.500]   And if there's any circumstance under which,
[01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:11.660]   oh well, it turns out that the one app that I want
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:15.140]   is doesn't work very well,
[01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:18.260]   it hasn't been updated yet to work with Apple Silicon yet.
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:20.180]   Or if it turns out that there are some bugs
[01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:21.460]   they haven't figured out,
[01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:22.740]   that's what I think that they would,
[01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:24.820]   that's why if I were making a free choice,
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:26.980]   I'd choose something that was more consumer oriented
[01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:28.900]   where we can figure out that these are people
[01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:31.020]   who are probably gonna be buying almost all their stuff
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:31.860]   to the app store,
[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:34.100]   we can predict exactly what the sort of things
[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:35.420]   that they're gonna be using.
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:38.420]   Now the flip side is that the Pro's are exactly
[01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:40.460]   the sort of people you want because they're the people
[01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:43.020]   who don't make quite so emotional choices
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:43.940]   when they buy these things.
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:47.100]   They will have made a very, very conscious decision
[01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:50.500]   that I want one of the first generation out Apple Silicon
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:52.180]   that I'm willing to take the risks for it.
[01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:55.260]   But like I said, it's all just guesswork,
[01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:59.460]   but I would love to see Apple demonstrate a new MacBook Air
[01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:02.140]   or a new MacBook with nothing and really, really show off.
[01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:05.980]   Here's everything that we're gaining from Apple Silicon
[01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:07.980]   starting off with 18 hour battery life.
[01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:10.020]   And by the way, this benchmarks,
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:15.020]   this can run Photoshop almost as well as a 2018 MacBook Pro,
[01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:18.060]   even though we're only charging $999 for it.
[01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:20.460]   - There you go, that's one way to do that.
[01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:21.900]   - You do need to show performance.
[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:24.700]   Otherwise, I think people are gonna jump to that.
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:27.460]   In correct conclusion, but you make a very strong argument
[01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:29.060]   for why you wanna be careful.
[01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:32.300]   The applications may not be ready.
[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:34.500]   - They can't, they can't fail these first weeks.
[01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:35.500]   - They cannot fail.
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:37.060]   - Microsystems are not ready.
[01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:39.900]   - There's all the transition things that Apple
[01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:43.380]   has been doing to make it so that even if they're not ready,
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:45.380]   they're still usable on Apple Silicon.
[01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:49.380]   So that may not actually be anything to worry about.
[01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:52.780]   You don't wanna confirm people's bias against performance,
[01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:53.820]   right?
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:58.060]   So if, yeah, they're running a Rosetta 2 version of Photoshop
[01:35:58.060 --> 01:36:03.060]   and it runs like a pig, that's bad because then the pros go see.
[01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:03.900]   - What if it didn't?
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:07.540]   - Oh, but if it doesn't, yes, only Apple really knows
[01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:08.380]   the answer to this.
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:12.820]   Will AirPods Studios be out on the 17th?
[01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:14.260]   - So are those headsets or are those
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:16.220]   in you kind of French-Canadian Speedo?
[01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:18.980]   (both laughing)
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:21.180]   - Oh, Renee.
[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:23.300]   - I did that to Lori the other day, I had to share.
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:25.300]   - And now the visuals back in my brain.
[01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:26.140]   - I haven't seen it.
[01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:26.980]   Where is it?
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:28.140]   Show me.
[01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:28.980]   - Oh, just look at me.
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:29.820]   - Oh, don't cross that.
[01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:32.100]   - Just look at the render of the AirPods Studio
[01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:33.820]   and then think of what Renee just said
[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:35.380]   and you won't be able to get that out of your head.
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:37.300]   - Oh, dear.
[01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:40.620]   'Cause they're these square kind of retro looking.
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:46.180]   And so you're saying you could wear this as a bathing suit?
[01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:47.180]   (laughing)
[01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:48.460]   I ain't coming back.
[01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:49.740]   - Okay, okay.
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:52.820]   By the way, how did you feel about Saturday Night Lives?
[01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:54.460]   Bourgeoisie.
[01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:55.940]   - I didn't have time to watch it yet
[01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:58.740]   'cause I was busy yet and I had the link here somewhere
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:36:59.580]   but I just--
[01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:02.220]   - It's, I thought it was hysterical.
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:05.260]   But I could see if you're a Quebecer.
[01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:08.620]   The Montreal Gazette says,
[01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:10.900]   "As punishment for our sins,
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:16.020]   as an elder to sketch about Montreal TV news,
[01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:18.300]   I thought it was deep, deep, funny,
[01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:19.540]   but I won't play it now
[01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:20.940]   'cause I don't wanna get taken down
[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:23.300]   maybe after this show I'll play it for you, Renee."
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:28.540]   How about, so is Tim Cook gonna look like he's 85
[01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:30.740]   when the air tags come out?
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:31.580]   (laughing)
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:32.620]   - That, I don't think so.
[01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:36.580]   And these are rumors that have come out, but you know,
[01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:40.340]   we actually, when we talked before the Apple event,
[01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:44.380]   you had said if AirTags don't come out now,
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:45.900]   then they're never coming out.
[01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:48.420]   And then within that week,
[01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:51.020]   we had heard a new rumor that no, they're not coming
[01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:52.580]   at the iPhone event, but they're not,
[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:54.260]   they're coming out in March.
[01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:58.380]   So that's the new rumor is that we're postponing AirTags
[01:37:58.380 --> 01:37:59.220]   and tell them, "Mark."
[01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:00.060]   - I have a theory.
[01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:03.900]   And I think today's Department of Justice lawsuit
[01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:07.060]   against Google is gonna delay it even longer.
[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:09.100]   The reason Apple doesn't want,
[01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:10.340]   look, the AirTags are done.
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:11.540]   They've been ready for months.
[01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:13.620]   They've been ready for a year, probably.
[01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:15.580]   There's nothing hard about doing this.
[01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:17.820]   They've got the U1 chips and everything else.
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:22.820]   This is easy, but they're really terrified about getting sued
[01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:24.820]   for Monopoly.
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:27.580]   And this is one of the hot, they're Spotify,
[01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:30.340]   but the other one is Tile, the CEO of Tile Testified
[01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:33.100]   in front of Congress about this.
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:37.340]   Tile says, "Apple favors, you know, their location.
[01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:39.660]   "If AirTags comes out, we're out of business.
[01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:41.180]   "They're probably right."
[01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:43.260]   And so maybe that Apple's just saying,
[01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:45.620]   "It's not that important a product for us.
[01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:48.980]   "Why take the chance that this is gonna
[01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:50.700]   "encourage antitrust scrutiny?
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:52.380]   "Let's just put it off."
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:53.740]   - So that was my theory.
[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:55.340]   And I thought that's why at WWDC,
[01:38:55.340 --> 01:38:56.980]   they announced that the Find My Network
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:38:59.140]   was gonna have an API and that they were gonna,
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:00.900]   because Tile doesn't share their network,
[01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:02.100]   but Apple was gonna share theirs
[01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:03.660]   and create a thousand dials.
[01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:04.900]   And then their response would be,
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:06.660]   "Oh, we're not anti-competitive at all.
[01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:08.900]   "We're finally letting any company
[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:11.220]   "that wants to develop it."
[01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:12.660]   But that part's ready now too.
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:14.260]   That came out with iOS 14.
[01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:15.100]   - And they didn't put that out of it.
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:16.700]   - As far as there's a bunch of them that are ready.
[01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:18.100]   I think part of it is that.
[01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:19.500]   I think absolutely they wanted to show
[01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:22.740]   a bunch of third party alternatives as well as the Apple one.
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:24.900]   But I also think they probably believe
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:27.860]   that the demand for this product would be suppressed
[01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:29.780]   while nobody's going anywhere to lose anything.
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:30.620]   - That's a good point.
[01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:33.060]   There's less to, yes, there's less to gain
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:34.500]   by putting it out now anyway.
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:35.340]   - Where's my wallet?
[01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:36.260]   Oh, it's in the kitchen.
[01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:39.100]   - Yeah, it's exactly where it's been in the last six months.
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:41.900]   (both laughing)
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:42.980]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:46.980]   So probably no air tags, probably no speedo headphones.
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:48.580]   - Love to dream that they were coming soon.
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:49.420]   - We might see those.
[01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:50.260]   - No, so there's a squabble, right?
[01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:51.820]   Like there's a leaker battle again?
[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:54.140]   - Is there any battling now?
[01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:54.980]   - Yeah.
[01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:56.460]   - Those leaker, get a little one.
[01:39:56.460 --> 01:39:57.620]   - That's like, it's a new thing.
[01:39:57.620 --> 01:39:59.740]   They've been, they've been battling all along.
[01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:01.300]   (both laughing)
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:02.660]   - All right.
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:04.660]   Anything else that we want to cover
[01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:06.900]   before we get to our picks of the week?
[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:10.500]   - I'd like to, I'd like the first to talk about
[01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:12.820]   that the Apple's now holding Charlie Brown
[01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:14.140]   in the peanut-scang hostage.
[01:40:14.140 --> 01:40:14.980]   (both laughing)
[01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:16.780]   - No, no, I'm so excited about that.
[01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:19.380]   I mean, because I'm a TV+ user,
[01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:22.980]   I watch the Halloween special every year
[01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:24.820]   and I'm always renting it on iTunes
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:28.100]   or trying to find it for free on YouTube or something like that.
[01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:30.260]   So I love that that's up on TV+
[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:31.900]   now I can watch it as many times as I want.
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:33.660]   - So the Snoopy show is on TV+
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:36.580]   but Apple has revealed that there will be
[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:39.980]   a number of new Peanuts specials.
[01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:43.780]   On Apple TV+ and are you saying that you can only watch?
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:47.900]   It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown on Apple TV now?
[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:48.740]   - Yeah, ABC.
[01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:50.700]   - I don't think that's the only place you can watch it.
[01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:53.980]   - Well, ABC was broadcasting it annually.
[01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.700]   They're not, it's not available on broadcast this year.
[01:40:56.700 --> 01:40:58.180]   I don't know if that was part of a deal
[01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:01.180]   that the Charles Charles's organization made
[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:04.660]   with Apple, but that's the fact.
[01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:07.780]   They are saying it is exclusive to Apple TV+.
[01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:09.260]   However, they are being nice enough to say
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:11.580]   that it's for like the day, but for like the day,
[01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:14.460]   but for an after enduring, it will be free to all.
[01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:18.100]   However, number one, that does make it exclusive
[01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:21.620]   to households that have broadband and technology
[01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:23.940]   to stream it, which is a much lower number
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:24.780]   than you might think.
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:26.100]   - Broadcast, yeah.
[01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:29.220]   - And secondly, you can no longer buy it on iTunes,
[01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:32.180]   you can no longer buy it on the Amazon digital store.
[01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:34.380]   You can't buy it on the Google Play digital store.
[01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:36.260]   - Oh, I just know you couldn't buy it.
[01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:38.020]   - Yep, if you don't watch it,
[01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:39.820]   if you've already bought it, then it will,
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:40.900]   you'll still have it in your library,
[01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:42.900]   but now if you want to watch it,
[01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:45.020]   but not watch it through Apple TV+,
[01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:48.140]   you are going to have to buy it on DVD,
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:51.780]   which is kind of a bummer because I feel as though,
[01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:54.100]   you know, the Peanuts specials are kind of part
[01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:55.940]   of our cultural heritage, and it kind of sucks that.
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:57.140]   - That doesn't even make sense.
[01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:58.620]   Why can't you buy it on iTunes?
[01:41:58.620 --> 01:41:59.460]   Like I don't know where it's like.
[01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:00.300]   - What's this?
[01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:02.740]   Frosty the Snowman?
[01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:04.340]   Damn you Apple.
[01:42:04.340 --> 01:42:05.780]   (laughing)
[01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:06.820]   - That doesn't even help Apple.
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.220]   - Apple would love to sell it to you.
[01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:09.060]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:10.700]   - They were selling it for a lot of money
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:11.780]   when they were selling it.
[01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:13.460]   - Yeah.
[01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:14.300]   - It's like the pumpkin spice lot that I never buy.
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:15.140]   - Which is why I never buy it.
[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:16.460]   - I didn't buy it either.
[01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:17.540]   - Yeah.
[01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:21.220]   - This is just why, like I do keep talking about how I buy,
[01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:24.780]   if there's a show or movie that I want to be able
[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:27.020]   to have access to or have my one-up access to,
[01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:29.100]   I will buy it, I will rip it, I'll put it on my server,
[01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:31.180]   because this sort of thing is just going to get worse
[01:42:31.180 --> 01:42:34.380]   and worse where we're used to movies and TV shows
[01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:36.220]   coming and going from different services.
[01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:41.020]   Now these are like tactical assets that are being acquired
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:45.420]   and kept by one service and held apart from the others.
[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:49.860]   It just doesn't make any business sense for them
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:52.340]   not to use this as an exclusive to one network
[01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:53.900]   or another or one service or another.
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:56.140]   So I don't, hopefully it'll return to broadcast
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:59.180]   because we all assume that people have broadband.
[01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:01.580]   We all assume that people have like a Roku box
[01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:03.260]   or an Apple TV box.
[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:05.060]   But the thing is, a TV.
[01:43:05.060 --> 01:43:09.220]   Everybody has a TV and if something is broadcast,
[01:43:09.220 --> 01:43:11.220]   then everybody can actually watch it.
[01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:14.500]   That's why it was so important that when HBO started
[01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:18.140]   under co-underwriting Sesame Street,
[01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:19.700]   it would have been absolute death
[01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:22.820]   if Sesame Street became an exclusive to HBO,
[01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:24.540]   a pay channel for of all things,
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:25.900]   because there's a lot of households
[01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:27.980]   where that's the educational programming they get.
[01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:28.820]   If as long as they get,
[01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:29.700]   as long as they're TV works,
[01:43:29.700 --> 01:43:32.100]   as long as they've gotten antennas,
[01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:33.260]   as long as they've got the cable
[01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:35.980]   that is giving them local broadcast stations for free,
[01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:37.500]   they have access to this programming.
[01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:40.380]   And I just hate the idea that from now on,
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:41.780]   you will never be able,
[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:44.300]   if your parents decided that they didn't want to subscribe
[01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:47.140]   to X service, they didn't want to describe to Disney Plus,
[01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:50.180]   your kids will never see any of the Star Wars movies.
[01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:52.300]   Okay, well, in some cases, that's actually a win,
[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:53.620]   but for some of those Star Wars movies,
[01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:55.060]   but never see Indiana Jones
[01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:57.420]   because we didn't have Disney Plus in our household.
[01:43:57.420 --> 01:43:58.700]   - It is kind of sad,
[01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:02.100]   'cause that was a cultural experience
[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:03.980]   that we all shared.
[01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:05.420]   We'd watch The Wizard of Oz,
[01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:07.620]   we'd watch It's a great pumpkin, Charlie Brown,
[01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:10.700]   and it was kind of a cultural shared experience.
[01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:14.340]   And now it's like everything else, it's just fragmented.
[01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:17.860]   By the way, Andy is rather fond of the physical media
[01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:22.780]   as his most recent Instagram post might indicate.
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:24.300]   - Yeah.
[01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:26.540]   - You bought a few CDs, did you?
[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:28.180]   - Well, see, this is the other advantage.
[01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:30.660]   I went there, I went to eBay
[01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:33.060]   to pick up one specific CD,
[01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:34.860]   and then the place that had it,
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:39.060]   we're doing a sale of like buy two, get three free.
[01:44:39.060 --> 01:44:42.060]   And so yeah, I wound up with like 20, 30.
[01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:43.380]   (laughing)
[01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:46.180]   20, 30 new CDs.
[01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:48.460]   But the thing is, they're my CDs, baby.
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:50.140]   No one can take these things away from me.
[01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:51.940]   - That's why my studio plastic still work.
[01:44:51.940 --> 01:44:54.500]   - The rest of you will suck us, I've got plastic for days.
[01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:56.940]   - And that's why he bought a new CD Ripper,
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:45:00.540]   and I imagine quite a bit of more hard drive space.
[01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:02.620]   - Yeah, but actually it was funny,
[01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:04.140]   it was like that Burgess Meredith episode
[01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:05.780]   of the Twilight Zone,
[01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:10.780]   because like my, I dropped my CD drive
[01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:14.540]   like the day before all of these CDs started going,
[01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:16.380]   so I couldn't watch the work.
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:17.580]   Not until I bought a new drive,
[01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:19.460]   could actually like listen to them so well.
[01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:20.980]   - Frustrating is that.
[01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:28.340]   - I think barring any other important life-threatening
[01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:33.020]   issues, we should do our picks of the week next.
[01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:37.220]   And let me, I would start with you in a while, Andy.
[01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:38.580]   Let's hear it.
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:43.580]   - Okay, now cassettes and walk-bins
[01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:46.380]   have been like making a resurgence chiefly because
[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:49.460]   poor kids like people like me who grew up in the '80s
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:51.780]   who were poor and could not afford them,
[01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:53.420]   now have jobs and can afford them,
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:55.820]   even though like the original walk-bins cost like
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:58.300]   $6,700, $800, $900 if you can find it.
[01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:00.300]   Not to mention the fact that it's,
[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:02.580]   because the original Walkman is a prop
[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:04.340]   in Gardens of the Galaxy that's made them,
[01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:06.900]   you can't even buy broken ones for cheaper work.
[01:46:06.900 --> 01:46:10.100]   But I was able to get this recently.
[01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:11.460]   - Oh geez Louise.
[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:13.300]   - I'm very, very proud of that.
[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:14.140]   - Holy cow.
[01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:16.860]   - No, actually I don't think you had this
[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:21.660]   because this is actually a 16,000 watt charger.
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:24.060]   - Oh my God, it looks just like my Walkman.
[01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:26.140]   - It's built to look like an original like
[01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:27.980]   first-generation Walkman.
[01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:29.580]   - Totally cool with me.
[01:46:29.580 --> 01:46:31.500]   - It had like the sliding volume switches even,
[01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:33.540]   has clicky buttons that don't do anything,
[01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:35.300]   but you can pretend.
[01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:36.140]   And on top of all that,
[01:46:36.140 --> 01:46:39.100]   it is actually a very decent like 16,000 million
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:42.460]   power charger with a USB-C,
[01:46:42.460 --> 01:46:47.460]   mini micro USB, a regular full size USB thing on it.
[01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:51.020]   It also supports Qi charging on the back.
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:53.380]   So I feel as though you'd be almost foolish
[01:46:53.380 --> 01:46:54.300]   not to buy one of these.
[01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:56.380]   Given that it is for $40,
[01:46:56.380 --> 01:46:58.660]   it is a very full featured, wonderful device.
[01:46:58.660 --> 01:47:00.420]   The fact that it makes you,
[01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:02.900]   oh right, I remember back in junior high
[01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:05.140]   when a friend of mine who got one of these
[01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:07.660]   for his bar mitzvah got one and I was totally jealous
[01:47:07.660 --> 01:47:09.980]   and I kinda had to hate him because I was still
[01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:12.620]   like jogging with my record player.
[01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:14.900]   So yeah, it's from a company,
[01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:17.260]   actually this really, really cool company
[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:21.900]   that does like retro, like retro fakes.
[01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:24.700]   It's kinda called Replatronics.
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:26.340]   If you go to newwavetoys.com,
[01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:27.420]   they have this and other things.
[01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:32.180]   They also make full scale like arcade cabinets
[01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:33.260]   that play video games.
[01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:35.580]   They're like maybe Barbie doll scale,
[01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:38.300]   but they're absolutely perfect in proportion and detail.
[01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:40.100]   And they actually play the video games.
[01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:42.540]   So I couldn't talk myself into buying that for 100 bucks
[01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:44.420]   for this for 40 bucks, I could say,
[01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:47.100]   oh well, but we need a charger because of all the time
[01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:51.300]   that we're out of the house all day and the battery dies.
[01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:52.900]   But yeah, it really is just kind of like a perfect.
[01:47:52.900 --> 01:47:54.140]   - That's hysterical.
[01:47:54.140 --> 01:47:54.980]   - I know.
[01:47:54.980 --> 01:47:56.660]   - Real hipster cred on that one.
[01:47:56.660 --> 01:47:58.340]   You fooled me.
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:47:59.420]   All you need some headphones.
[01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:00.540]   Does it have a headphone jack?
[01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:01.780]   You could plug in.
[01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:03.060]   - I only wish it did.
[01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:06.140]   There's no headphone jack.
[01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:08.180]   It wouldn't be great if it had a Bluetooth receiver
[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:10.740]   so you could still just like clip it to your,
[01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:13.540]   even though your phone is hitting someplace else,
[01:48:13.540 --> 01:48:16.180]   it's just there just to relay the thing.
[01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:17.020]   - I love it.
[01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:18.100]   - Nostalgia.
[01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:22.300]   - Replatronics, Retro Walkman Power Bank,
[01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:25.260]   and you got yours from NewWaveToys.com.
[01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:26.140]   - It's also on Amazon,
[01:48:26.140 --> 01:48:29.580]   but I bought them directly from the source from Replatonics.
[01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:31.820]   - Oh, so NewWave Toys is them.
[01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:34.540]   - They are, apparently they are.
[01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:36.900]   Replatronics is a division of NewWave Toys.
[01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:37.740]   NewWave Toys.
[01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:38.580]   - Of course it is.
[01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:41.540]   - Home of Replicate Amusements.
[01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:43.940]   And now I'm really, I'm going crazy.
[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:44.780]   This is great.
[01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:46.620]   - They also make, if you see it,
[01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:49.780]   you can see it right there. - What's this build changer?
[01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:52.180]   - This is a charging port that looks like the,
[01:48:52.180 --> 01:48:53.780]   exactly, looks like the changer.
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:56.220]   The changer machine that's in every single arcade.
[01:48:56.220 --> 01:48:58.180]   These people are insane and I love it.
[01:48:58.180 --> 01:48:59.860]   - That's hysterical.
[01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:03.060]   - How big is that thing for $59.99?
[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:04.540]   - Can't be that big.
[01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:05.940]   - I don't, it's, it would be roughly--
[01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:07.700]   - It must be tabletop sized.
[01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:08.540]   - Yeah.
[01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:09.460]   - Oh yeah, okay, there we go.
[01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:10.620]   - Yeah, exactly, right.
[01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:12.140]   - But it has a bunch of ports.
[01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:14.100]   It's a hub.
[01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:14.940]   Oh, I'm buying it.
[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:15.780]   Are you kidding?
[01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:17.820]   - And it's, and it's scaled to be the same,
[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:20.300]   to be the correct size next to any of these Replicate--
[01:49:20.300 --> 01:49:21.140]   - Oh, so you get the--
[01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:23.700]   - You can have a whole mini arcade in your house.
[01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:25.180]   - That is so cute.
[01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:26.660]   - If you're, if you're, if you're guinea pig,
[01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:27.980]   it could like now be,
[01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:28.980]   it could now be like a,
[01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:30.820]   if you'd be a Pac-Man wizard.
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:33.900]   - Oh, M. G.
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:34.740]   - I know.
[01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:35.740]   - That's like, my, my sales resistance--
[01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:37.740]   - It even has little tokens.
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:40.580]   It even has little tokens in the changer receiver.
[01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:41.580]   Oh my God.
[01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:42.540]   And faux leather.
[01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:43.380]   Oh my God.
[01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:45.740]   These guys are insane.
[01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:46.580]   You got it.
[01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:48.460]   What I love about them is that,
[01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:51.140]   if you've got, if you've got a dopey goofy idea,
[01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:52.300]   don't go halfway.
[01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:54.860]   If you go, if you go all the way with it,
[01:49:54.860 --> 01:49:55.700]   it becomes great.
[01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:56.860]   If you're, if you're become,
[01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:59.100]   oh, well, it kind of reminds me of a change machine,
[01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:01.660]   but no, no, this is down to the last detail.
[01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:02.660]   It almost looks like--
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:03.500]   - Oh, oh.
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:05.980]   See this temporarily out of change light?
[01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:07.500]   That's a real working light.
[01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:09.340]   You could switch on or off.
[01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:10.700]   - Oh, that's so great.
[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:12.900]   - It's a little LED with a switch.
[01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:14.940]   Oh man, Laurie Gillie,
[01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:16.140]   you better come up with something good.
[01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:17.380]   If you want me to spend my money.
[01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:18.980]   I mean, I think Andy's good.
[01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:20.060]   - I can't beat this.
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:21.460]   This is really good.
[01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:22.780]   - Mm.
[01:50:22.780 --> 01:50:25.020]   - Hold my credit card, girl.
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:28.500]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna make myself a mini arcade
[01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:29.340]   in my office.
[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:30.900]   - I love that idea.
[01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:31.740]   - Yeah.
[01:50:31.740 --> 01:50:33.020]   - Oh my God.
[01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:33.860]   Oh my God.
[01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:36.260]   The Street Fighter is 120 bucks.
[01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:37.540]   And it's not, it doesn't work.
[01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:40.740]   Tempest is on, it doesn't work, does it?
[01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:41.740]   - No, no, they didn't.
[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:42.580]   - What was it?
[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:43.420]   - I like their little--
[01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:44.420]   - They licensed the actual game
[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:46.020]   that you can actually play these games
[01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:47.340]   on these tiny stores.
[01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:49.620]   - Oh, well then it's worth 120 bucks.
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:50.460]   - Yeah.
[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:51.300]   (laughs)
[01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:52.620]   - What about that tiny controller?
[01:50:52.620 --> 01:50:54.820]   Was that more than just a tiny controller?
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:58.540]   Was there, is it also a USB charger or something?
[01:50:58.540 --> 01:51:00.700]   - No, no, the arcade replicat
[01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:03.100]   replicatations are actual just like stand up video games.
[01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:04.100]   All they are are video games,
[01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:05.780]   but that's kind of enough.
[01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:06.620]   - Yeah.
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:07.940]   - Yeah, they're so cute.
[01:51:07.940 --> 01:51:10.300]   - Oh my God, Andy, you just cost me so much money.
[01:51:10.300 --> 01:51:12.620]   I'm not gonna be able to get a new iPhone.
[01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:13.900]   - Yeah.
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.140]   - Well, for a thousand dollars,
[01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:16.740]   you can actually have the entire arcade.
[01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:19.340]   You can have the entire room next to the
[01:51:19.340 --> 01:51:21.780]   Kannelson bowling alley with a party room.
[01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:24.420]   (laughs)
[01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:26.260]   - Yeah, the prices on those are pretty good.
[01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:29.220]   - Yeah, considering it's actually plays.
[01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:30.100]   And at first I thought,
[01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:32.260]   oh, it's life-sized 'cause of this picture,
[01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:33.860]   but that's just a GI Joe.
[01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:34.700]   (laughs)
[01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:35.540]   - Yeah.
[01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:37.700]   (laughs)
[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:39.420]   - I've seen these up close
[01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:42.100]   and they really do like fool the eye
[01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:44.100]   'cause the detail is perfect.
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:46.660]   They did not cut any corner.
[01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:48.460]   Like I said, if you're gonna go crazy,
[01:51:48.460 --> 01:51:49.740]   if you're gonna go nuts about this,
[01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:51.420]   go full on, you know, crazy.
[01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:53.300]   Don't like, don't tap,
[01:51:53.300 --> 01:51:54.860]   don't walk up and tap the bell,
[01:51:54.860 --> 01:51:55.860]   ring the damn bell.
[01:51:55.860 --> 01:51:57.260]   They ring the damn bell on all these.
[01:51:57.260 --> 01:52:01.300]   - I might just buy the 25 cent insert coin to play keychain.
[01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:02.940]   I can afford that.
[01:52:02.940 --> 01:52:04.300]   - Yes. (laughs)
[01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:06.780]   - Lori Gill, pick of the week.
[01:52:06.780 --> 01:52:08.180]   - That thing is so cute too.
[01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:10.180]   - I know, I know.
[01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:11.740]   (laughs)
[01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:14.940]   - So if you are not a fan of iPhones' cases,
[01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:17.460]   but you are buying yourself a brand new iPhone 12
[01:52:17.460 --> 01:52:18.580]   or iPhone 12 Pro,
[01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:23.580]   Otterbox has their own MagSafe compatible cases.
[01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:24.900]   - Oh, it's already happening.
[01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:25.740]   - Oh, wow.
[01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:28.340]   - These are, there's no real such thing
[01:52:28.340 --> 01:52:29.820]   as MFi certified at the moment,
[01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:32.660]   but they are certified to work with MagSafe.
[01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:35.140]   So they'll also have the cute little animation
[01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:36.580]   when you plug them in.
[01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:38.700]   And there's a wonderful variety.
[01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:40.700]   They have three different case styles
[01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:45.700]   that have multiple colors and a couple of new patterns.
[01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:47.020]   Even their symmetry one,
[01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:51.020]   which is actually their most popular case
[01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:56.020]   that is available as a MagSafe compatible case.
[01:52:56.020 --> 01:52:59.620]   So, your options are opened up more.
[01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:01.020]   I don't have one of these,
[01:53:01.020 --> 01:53:04.940]   but I have had each of these different versions,
[01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:06.500]   the older versions of them.
[01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:07.860]   - Oh, it's all Lisa uses.
[01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:09.380]   It's all she uses.
[01:53:09.380 --> 01:53:12.580]   - Yeah, they're very, very nice cases, really good.
[01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:15.860]   Really, their button placement is really well.
[01:53:15.860 --> 01:53:16.940]   So these are the same thing.
[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:20.220]   They just have MagSafe magnets in them.
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:22.620]   And when you stick them on that MagSafe charger,
[01:53:22.620 --> 01:53:24.980]   they'll make that fun little animation,
[01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:27.140]   which I noticed.
[01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:30.540]   So to get off track for just a second,
[01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:32.700]   there's two different audio animations.
[01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:35.060]   So there's one when it sticks to the charger,
[01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:37.500]   which is the charging sound you're used to hearing,
[01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:38.860]   but there's another sound.
[01:53:38.860 --> 01:53:43.340]   Did you hear it?
[01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:44.780]   - Yeah, it's like one of those.
[01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:45.620]   - That's that sound.
[01:53:45.620 --> 01:53:47.300]   - One of those thumb up piano.
[01:53:47.300 --> 01:53:50.420]   - Yeah, that's the sound it makes when the case connects
[01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:52.300]   to the device.
[01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:53.780]   - Oh, boom.
[01:53:53.780 --> 01:53:56.060]   - So they'll make that cute little boom.
[01:53:56.060 --> 01:53:56.900]   - Wow.
[01:53:56.900 --> 01:53:58.020]   - And these, these,
[01:53:58.020 --> 01:54:00.780]   the Artabox charger or Artabox MagSafe cases
[01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:02.980]   will also make that cute sound.
[01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:04.660]   - See, I'm so glad this is,
[01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:07.140]   this is why Apple, you want to be open.
[01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:09.900]   Now you're going to have this whole ecosystem of stuff.
[01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:10.740]   That's great.
[01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:12.900]   I know you make a lot of money on MFI certification
[01:54:12.900 --> 01:54:14.100]   and all that, but this is great.
[01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:15.260]   This is great.
[01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:16.820]   - Actually, they don't make that much.
[01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:18.860]   I mean, they make more in Tim Cook's self-accussions.
[01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:20.260]   They're just very controlling.
[01:54:20.260 --> 01:54:21.100]   - They want the experience.
[01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:21.940]   - A lot of the time,
[01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:22.780]   what we describe to money is,
[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:24.180]   we get control obsession.
[01:54:24.180 --> 01:54:25.420]   - That's fair.
[01:54:25.420 --> 01:54:28.140]   And now Renee Ritchie is actually going to make me
[01:54:28.140 --> 01:54:30.220]   spend some real money.
[01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:31.780]   - Well, this was entirely your fault
[01:54:31.780 --> 01:54:33.220]   because you brought up Matthew Panzerino
[01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:34.580]   and I made me think about the last thing
[01:54:34.580 --> 01:54:37.060]   he actually wrote before his iPhone review.
[01:54:37.060 --> 01:54:38.740]   And then it made me think of everything
[01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:40.580]   you and Laurie have been tormenting me with
[01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:43.980]   that I just can't afford or can't own
[01:54:43.980 --> 01:54:44.820]   in my current circumstances.
[01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:46.460]   - I'm just going to say one thing.
[01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:48.380]   I'm having brisket for lunch.
[01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:53.380]   I made an amazing 16 pound Snake River Farms brisket
[01:54:53.380 --> 01:54:56.780]   on the Traeger.
[01:54:56.780 --> 01:54:57.620]   - I'm on my way.
[01:54:57.620 --> 01:55:00.860]   - It was to die for.
[01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:02.500]   - I'm winning your house for a steak
[01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:03.700]   and then Laurie's for video games.
[01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:06.140]   - Well, as soon as we can have gatherings,
[01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:08.940]   we will do the next big twit gathering
[01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:11.940]   and we'll do it at our place and the briskets on me.
[01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:14.580]   I made cowboy beans Laurie.
[01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:15.420]   I made brisket.
[01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:16.260]   I made coleslaw.
[01:55:16.260 --> 01:55:19.940]   I made corn cob, put a slice of white bread on top of it.
[01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:20.780]   It was.
[01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:21.620]   - Yes, man.
[01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:22.540]   - The man was that good.
[01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:23.900]   - That sounds so good.
[01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:26.020]   - It was so good.
[01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:28.300]   Actually, I should make Snake River Farms
[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:29.940]   my pick of the week, but go ahead.
[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:33.340]   Tell us what we should be buying.
[01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:34.660]   - So this goes with that, though, Leo.
[01:55:34.660 --> 01:55:36.620]   So if you want, not just brisket,
[01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:38.660]   but if you want those Snake River Farms,
[01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:40.140]   American Way Goose Steaks.
[01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:40.980]   - I have some.
[01:55:40.980 --> 01:55:44.580]   - The way that only the Celestials
[01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:48.340]   and high end steak houses can cook them.
[01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:50.260]   I mean, you might have your smoker,
[01:55:50.260 --> 01:55:51.860]   you might have your green egg,
[01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:53.740]   you might have your pizza oven,
[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:58.260]   but you need an outdoor gas grill designed specifically
[01:55:58.260 --> 01:56:01.140]   for steak, something that heats up so fast,
[01:56:01.140 --> 01:56:03.580]   it sears the outside in a way
[01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:06.380]   that only those big oyster machines in restaurants.
[01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:08.980]   Sorry, no, they're those big machines.
[01:56:08.980 --> 01:56:10.500]   Salamanders can do.
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:13.220]   And so you get your steak, you put it in there.
[01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:18.260]   It just, from above, it drops like God's own meteor fire
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:19.740]   thunder on the steak.
[01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:22.660]   - 1500 degrees.
[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:23.500]   - Yes.
[01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:25.220]   - 1000-faster steak joy.
[01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:27.420]   - 500 degrees.
[01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:29.820]   - Now, Panzer did say that he burnt a few,
[01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:30.700]   getting the knack of it.
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:33.420]   You do have to judge your timing and your distance.
[01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:34.260]   - Well, for Andy and me,
[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:36.780]   you have to do me good because we sous vide, right?
[01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:38.740]   So you sous vide it and this thing.
[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:40.300]   - No, but so you don't have to.
[01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:41.980]   So like, yeah, so he does the sous vide
[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:44.340]   and then the pan is, well,
[01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:45.620]   he would do this to eat in the grill.
[01:56:45.620 --> 01:56:46.460]   - Yeah.
[01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:48.940]   - But this is, you can eliminate the sous vide step.
[01:56:48.940 --> 01:56:52.420]   You just flash broil the Jesus out.
[01:56:52.420 --> 01:56:54.860]   - That's gonna be rare, rare, rare, isn't it?
[01:56:54.860 --> 01:56:56.940]   - No, it's the same as what a restaurant would do.
[01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:58.740]   Like they would just dry age it for a while
[01:56:58.740 --> 01:57:01.340]   and then stick it under here and, you know.
[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:02.340]   - All right.
[01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:04.820]   So you can get it medium rare.
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:05.740]   Oh my God, it does look.
[01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:06.860]   - He does a whole comparison.
[01:57:06.860 --> 01:57:08.140]   Like if you read the article,
[01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:11.140]   he goes into detail about the difference between the sous vide
[01:57:11.140 --> 01:57:14.300]   and the cast iron versus just putting it under this
[01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:15.140]   hell fired scenario.
[01:57:15.140 --> 01:57:18.180]   - It's very scary because that is a lot of people
[01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:19.180]   I probably owe.
[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:20.500]   - Oh my God.
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:21.860]   - Does he need any new kids?
[01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:22.700]   - Yes.
[01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:23.540]   - Oh.
[01:57:23.540 --> 01:57:24.340]   - My middle- - My middle-
[01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:25.420]   - His favorite Matthew Panzerino day
[01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:27.700]   is when he went to Florida to interview Tim Cook,
[01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:32.300]   then went to the preview of the Star Wars galaxy
[01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:36.740]   event before it opened with an unreleased pair of Nike's
[01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:38.700]   and I'm sure a bottle of pappies in his backpack.
[01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:40.580]   - Oh my God.
[01:57:40.580 --> 01:57:42.740]   It's hipster heaven.
[01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:43.580]   Yeah.
[01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:45.980]   - Okay, well, I'm just the vegetarian sandwich
[01:57:45.980 --> 01:57:47.820]   I was going to make myself in an pita, right?
[01:57:47.820 --> 01:57:50.620]   It's been upgraded to a double cheeseburger
[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:52.060]   from the takeout place on the neighborhood.
[01:57:52.060 --> 01:57:53.820]   Thank you very much.
[01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:55.860]   - You can order some snow wagoes still.
[01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:57.940]   It's still time, Andy.
[01:57:57.940 --> 01:57:58.780]   - Here you go.
[01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:00.100]   - I don't know if I have room on my deck
[01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:02.900]   for yet another cooking device.
[01:58:02.900 --> 01:58:04.100]   - You need unitaskers.
[01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:05.220]   That's what Alton Brown said.
[01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:06.660]   Everything should be a unitasker.
[01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:08.660]   - Oh, it is pretty much.
[01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:09.500]   Yeah.
[01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:10.820]   I got the Traeger and the Big Green Egg,
[01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:13.660]   but I think I need an auto-wired.
[01:58:13.660 --> 01:58:15.340]   - Yes.
[01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:16.180]   - Me too.
[01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:18.580]   (laughing)
[01:58:18.580 --> 01:58:19.420]   - Mm.
[01:58:19.420 --> 01:58:22.740]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:58:22.740 --> 01:58:24.580]   (laughing)
[01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:25.420]   - You welcome.
[01:58:25.420 --> 01:58:26.340]   - I guess.
[01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:27.260]   - Damn you, Renee.
[01:58:27.260 --> 01:58:28.580]   - Damn you, Renee.
[01:58:28.580 --> 01:58:30.060]   Now I have to choose between that and my--
[01:58:30.060 --> 01:58:30.900]   - That's a puzzle, thank me.
[01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:32.260]   - Tempest Replicate.
[01:58:32.260 --> 01:58:33.740]   (laughing)
[01:58:33.740 --> 01:58:35.900]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the fine
[01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:37.860]   and hunger inducing,
[01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:39.740]   I do at least have a brisket in the other room,
[01:58:39.740 --> 01:58:42.500]   inducing end to the show.
[01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:44.340]   - Okay, listen.
[01:58:44.340 --> 01:58:47.540]   - Oh, man.
[01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:50.660]   We're gonna need a bigger deck.
[01:58:50.660 --> 01:58:53.100]   (laughing)
[01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:56.020]   Renee Richie, you can follow him.
[01:58:56.020 --> 01:58:59.340]   By the way, his iPhone 12 review is in depth
[01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:01.540]   and brilliant and it's available right now
[01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:03.900]   at youtube.com/ReneeRidgy.
[01:59:03.900 --> 01:59:06.500]   You must watch, if you're just for the 5G information alone,
[01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:07.460]   you really break it down.
[01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:08.740]   It's nice, thank you.
[01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:10.100]   - Thank you so much.
[01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:11.180]   - Thank you, Laurie Gill.
[01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:13.100]   I'm more.com, her review will appear soon,
[01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:14.300]   but she's managing editor there,
[01:59:14.300 --> 01:59:17.140]   so she's responsible for everything.
[01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:19.620]   Everything you see at I'm--
[01:59:19.620 --> 01:59:20.460]   - Good and bad.
[01:59:20.460 --> 01:59:22.100]   - Good and you survived,
[01:59:22.100 --> 01:59:24.060]   was it a crazy prime day last week?
[01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:27.500]   - It really was, it really was, it was very crazy.
[01:59:27.500 --> 01:59:29.660]   Was there anything really fantastic?
[01:59:29.660 --> 01:59:34.860]   - No, no, this year they kind of backed off a little bit
[01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:36.900]   on their typical Echo devices
[01:59:36.900 --> 01:59:38.940]   that they usually have a bunch on sale,
[01:59:38.940 --> 01:59:40.940]   so that was really limited this time,
[01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:42.020]   there wasn't as much of it.
[01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:44.500]   I noticed there was a lot of things like smart devices
[01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:46.860]   that came with an Echo Dot,
[01:59:46.860 --> 01:59:48.580]   which I think is how they were,
[01:59:48.580 --> 01:59:51.180]   instead of just straight out selling it for $15,
[01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:54.180]   they would sell it alongside another smart thing, so--
[01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:55.340]   - Throw it in. - How about it?
[01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:56.340]   - Yeah.
[01:59:57.300 --> 02:00:00.980]   - I'm gonna have to admit that I actually finally got fed up
[02:00:00.980 --> 02:00:04.780]   trying to prime my Nintendo Switch out of Michael's hands,
[02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:08.660]   and I bought the Animal Crossing edition.
[02:00:08.660 --> 02:00:10.860]   - I love that one, it's so cute.
[02:00:10.860 --> 02:00:13.700]   - And yeah, I've been playing Animal Animal Crossing
[02:00:13.700 --> 02:00:15.900]   a little bit, I bought it 'cause I was gonna play Hades,
[02:00:15.900 --> 02:00:17.940]   which is also wonderful.
[02:00:17.940 --> 02:00:19.340]   I should make that my pick of the week,
[02:00:19.340 --> 02:00:21.140]   that's a really fun game.
[02:00:21.140 --> 02:00:24.180]   And so when I'm get tired of, you know,
[02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:27.460]   killing evil demons in hell,
[02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:31.020]   I can go pick some oranges in my island.
[02:00:31.020 --> 02:00:32.180]   - Relax, do a little fishing.
[02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:34.740]   - Do a little bit of more crossing, do a little fishing.
[02:00:34.740 --> 02:00:36.860]   - Yeah. - It's kind of fun.
[02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:41.820]   - Yeah, we should become friends on the Animal Crossing
[02:00:41.820 --> 02:00:44.540]   so that we can visit your island.
[02:00:44.540 --> 02:00:48.780]   - Yeah, mine's really in the early days, you know, but--
[02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:49.980]   - I've had mine since day one,
[02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:52.180]   and it still looks like it's in the early days, so don't worry.
[02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:54.620]   - Okay, do you have a handle?
[02:00:54.620 --> 02:00:57.220]   Is that how I visit you? - I do, yeah.
[02:00:57.220 --> 02:00:59.780]   - Do you wanna-- - You give each other codes
[02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:01.340]   and you become friends.
[02:01:01.340 --> 02:01:03.860]   - So I'll email you a code or something?
[02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:06.100]   - Yeah, yeah, we can send it to each other.
[02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:07.220]   And you might use them yours.
[02:01:07.220 --> 02:01:09.500]   - Okay, I'll send you my code, I don't know what it is,
[02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:10.300]   but I'll send it to you.
[02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:11.220]   There's an invitation.
[02:01:11.220 --> 02:01:12.740]   I go to the bulletin board and invite you
[02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:14.060]   or something to any way, I know.
[02:01:14.060 --> 02:01:15.460]   - Yeah, yeah, it's pretty easy.
[02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:16.700]   - Yeah.
[02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:19.820]   - I'll send you the link from I'm Wore
[02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:21.500]   where we wrote about how to do that.
[02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:23.420]   - Oh, there you go, well, you know what?
[02:01:23.420 --> 02:01:24.300]   That's what made me think of it,
[02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:27.380]   because you still do a lot of Pokemon,
[02:01:27.380 --> 02:01:29.740]   Nintendo, mobile gaming, you got it all now.
[02:01:29.740 --> 02:01:33.020]   You're really keeping up on all this stuff, boy.
[02:01:33.020 --> 02:01:35.660]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're rebuilding
[02:01:35.660 --> 02:01:40.660]   our game-related content, so yeah, we're up on it, so--
[02:01:40.660 --> 02:01:41.500]   - Good.
[02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:43.900]   - Nintendo and mobile gaming stuff, yeah.
[02:01:43.900 --> 02:01:47.060]   - Yeah, I might have to get Pokemon Sword and Shield.
[02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:48.580]   Is it good?
[02:01:48.580 --> 02:01:50.740]   - It is, I really have a good time with it.
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:52.340]   - Yeah, it's fun.
[02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:54.140]   - Yeah.
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:56.940]   All right, Laurie Gill, I'm Wore.com.
[02:01:56.940 --> 02:02:00.100]   Andy Ennaco, you'll find him on WGBH in Boston
[02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:02.580]   from time to time, you're gonna be on this week.
[02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:05.180]   - Yep, my usual time on Friday at 1 p.m.
[02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:08.300]   As usual, go to www.gphnews.org.
[02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:10.100]   You can stream it live or stream it later,
[02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:11.140]   just to a search for my name.
[02:02:11.140 --> 02:02:16.140]   And they tend to take my segments
[02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:18.820]   and make them separate things you can find
[02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:21.020]   and listen to them all along the room.
[02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:24.180]   What will I talk about this week?
[02:02:24.180 --> 02:02:25.420]   Google, I don't know.
[02:02:25.420 --> 02:02:26.420]   - Google maybe?
[02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:27.580]   - Yeah.
[02:02:27.580 --> 02:02:28.420]   - Maybe.
[02:02:28.420 --> 02:02:30.300]   - That's the gift that's going to keep on giving
[02:02:30.300 --> 02:02:32.580]   till we're well done with it.
[02:02:32.580 --> 02:02:35.260]   - Okay, just when we get rid of the Samsung,
[02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:38.260]   Samsung, the new lawsuits, we get a new 10 year.
[02:02:38.260 --> 02:02:41.580]   - Oh, Scooter X is--
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:44.780]   - This is great 'cause I love reading 500 page legal briefs
[02:02:44.780 --> 02:02:46.900]   that I barely understand on a daily basis.
[02:02:46.900 --> 02:02:47.740]   Can't get enough of it.
[02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:48.580]   - I know.
[02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:54.100]   From Scooter X, nine to five Mac is just put up a gallery
[02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:56.980]   taken with the iPhone 12 Pro camera by Austin Mann,
[02:02:56.980 --> 02:02:58.180]   who's a travel photographer.
[02:02:58.180 --> 02:02:59.020]   - He's so good.
[02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:00.700]   - Ooh baby.
[02:03:00.700 --> 02:03:02.260]   I can't wait.
[02:03:02.260 --> 02:03:05.540]   This is a, well that's too dark to see.
[02:03:05.540 --> 02:03:06.900]   This is with night mode.
[02:03:06.900 --> 02:03:07.740]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:08.940]   That's without night mode.
[02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:10.660]   This is at night.
[02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:12.140]   What the what?
[02:03:12.140 --> 02:03:15.180]   - That can't even be possible.
[02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:16.020]   - What?
[02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:17.020]   (laughing)
[02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:18.020]   - That's impossible.
[02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:19.300]   It's impossible.
[02:03:19.300 --> 02:03:20.140]   I don't believe it.
[02:03:20.140 --> 02:03:20.980]   - Oh.
[02:03:20.980 --> 02:03:22.300]   - Except I do.
[02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:23.140]   - Okay.
[02:03:23.140 --> 02:03:27.780]   Looks good, looks good.
[02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:30.340]   Anyway, thank you everybody for being here.
[02:03:30.340 --> 02:03:32.420]   We do Mac Break Weekly right after iOS today.
[02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:35.420]   Make Tuesday, you're like all Apple Day,
[02:03:35.420 --> 02:03:37.940]   starting at 9 a.m. Pacific with iOS today.
[02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:41.580]   And then when that's done around 11, 11 30 Pacific time
[02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:44.980]   in the morning Mac Break Weekly,
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:48.220]   that would be 11 would be about 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:03:48.220 --> 02:03:50.580]   It would be 1,800 UTC.
[02:03:50.580 --> 02:03:54.580]   I should point out that I think we go into,
[02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:57.660]   we end daylight saving time soon in the US,
[02:03:57.660 --> 02:04:00.140]   at which point we will move UTC doesn't,
[02:04:00.140 --> 02:04:01.820]   but that means our times will shift,
[02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:03.140]   but we'll give you a heads up.
[02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:06.100]   I think it might be next week or the week after.
[02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:07.860]   I think it's the week, it's in November.

[02:05:23.420 --> 02:05:25.020]   as you begin your day.

[02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:26.820]   We'll see you next time.
[02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:29.460]   Now I have the unfortunate duty to tell you
[02:05:29.460 --> 02:05:31.020]   it's time to get back to work
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:33.820]   because break time is over.
[02:05:33.820 --> 02:05:34.820]   Bye-bye.
[02:05:34.820 --> 02:05:37.980]   - I'm Jason Howell, host of Tech News Weekly here on Twit.tv.
[02:05:37.980 --> 02:05:40.580]   Along with my co-host, Micah Sargent.
[02:05:40.580 --> 02:05:42.620]   Each and every week we talk to people
[02:05:42.620 --> 02:05:44.540]   who are making and breaking the tech news.
[02:05:44.540 --> 02:05:47.140]   It could be journalists writing amazing tech stories.
[02:05:47.140 --> 02:05:48.540]   It could be experts.
[02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:51.860]   It could be the sources of the stories themselves.
[02:05:51.860 --> 02:05:53.460]   Developers, you name it.
[02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:55.460]   We bring them onto the show and we talk to them
[02:05:55.460 --> 02:05:59.020]   about why their story is resonating with the world.
[02:05:59.020 --> 02:06:03.940]   You can watch and subscribe by going to twit.tv/TNW.
