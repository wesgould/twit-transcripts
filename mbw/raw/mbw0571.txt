[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.560]   Apple News, I got a news flash right here, breaking news.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.760]   There's some guy with a cowboy hat.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.040]   Sitting next to me, that's not a cowboy hat.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.800]   That's a Tommy Bahama Panama hat.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.200]   That's Scott Born in studio.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.200]   My best buddy from the earliest days of Mac Break Weekly, Scott was one of our regulars
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.120]   along with Merlin Mann and Alex Lindsey.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.840]   And I'm just thrilled to see you.

[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.280]   Thank you for inviting me.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.560]   He disappeared off the face of the earth for a while.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.680]   Is back doing photography podcasts, right?
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.880]   At PPN Photo Podcast Network, we got four shows a month.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.960]   My Paola, Marco Luz, and I do that.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.960]   So yeah.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.960]   PPN.

[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.960]   Yes.

[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.600]   Also here, Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   Great to see you.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   Hey, hope.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.600]   My other...
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   You're all dear friends.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.560]   Renee Ritchie, the newest dear friend in the bunch.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.600]   I've only known him for five or six years.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.200]   I'm not Captain or Cameron Leo, but I make it up in enthusiasm.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.960]   In enthusiasm.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.520]   I'm more.com.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.200]   Scott is a photo ambassador for the Olympus camera outline.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.120]   This is something new for you because when I knew you were shooting, I want to say Nikon,
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.120]   but you said Canon?
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120]   Well, I've had all of them.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120]   Yeah, I was shooting DSLRs.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.120]   Big cameras.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.120]   Heavy ones.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.120]   Heavy cameras.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.960]   And you told us last time that your doctor said you better carry something a little lighter
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.960]   around.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.960]   11 shoulder surgeries.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.960]   What?
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.960]   Wow.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.480]   So he said, "I'm the best in the world at this.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.960]   I can't fix that no more."
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.240]   So he said, "You got two choices.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.280]   Be a cripple in a wheelchair or get something lighter."
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.280]   He managed...
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.880]   Maybe he should have mentioned you could carry it on the other shoulder.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.240]   Did he say anything about that?
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.240]   I'm right-handed.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.240]   Oh, okay.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.240]   I'm a lefty.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.320]   I still don't carry my camera on my right side.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.480]   But I know you use the sling style where you have it on your hip and you swoop it up
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.480]   like that, right?
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.480]   Well...
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.480]   Or no.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.480]   This will work any way you want.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.800]   This is the pro-advantaged strap from Olympus.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800]   Nice.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.800]   Oh, I'm just...
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.360]   You have to use only Olympus stuff now.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.360]   But you have...
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.760]   I tell you what, if you've not seen Scott's amazing wildlife photography, primarily birds,
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.760]   right?
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.560]   Yeah, I got bird brain.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.720]   Once you see it and you then find out, which I did after the fact, that this stuff is shot
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.360]   with a micro four-thirds camera and the clarity, the crispness, the detail you get blows me
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.360]   away.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:27.040]   This is your Instagram, born.scottbyo-u-r-n-e-dot-s-c-o-t-t.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.040]   At this point, I will never, ever, ever...
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.440]   In fact, I want to throw away all my ideas on this.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.600]   I will never, ever second guess it.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.240]   And you have an advantage with micro four-thirds because you have an amazing range of lenses.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.000]   That's a standard from a number of manufacturers.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   It's not just a...
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Everybody makes a...
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.600]   Well, Panasonic and Olympus are primarily the micro four-thirds.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.480]   However, there are third-party lens makers available that you can get their stuff.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.240]   And adapters are easy to find.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.640]   It's just lighter, it's cheaper, it's smaller.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.840]   Well, my wife shoots an OA... what you shoot, which is the OMD...
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.480]   Your wife has excellent taste.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.480]   It's a really nice...
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.480]   I'm very jealous.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.960]   It's the OMD-EM1 Mark II second generation.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.920]   And he shoots the EM1 Mark I.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.920]   Yes, he does.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.920]   Both great cameras.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.520]   Yeah, I mean, and it just goes to show you.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.560]   When I bought that three...
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.720]   I think about it shortly after it came out.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.800]   And it is one of the most expensive consumer products I have ever bought in my life.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.800]   And that might even include...
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.000]   No, no, it doesn't include my cars, but you wouldn't know to look at it.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.640]   But oh boy, it was one of those things where this is...
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.880]   I'm an unofficial Olympus ambassador, but it was a real Mac-like or iPhone-like experience
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.880]   to me with this camera.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.880]   It was just...
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.280]   It fit to my hands perfectly.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.760]   The controls were exactly where I wanted to be.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.880]   If there was anything I wanted to change, I could customize it so that it really is
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.560]   like Tuko and the Good, the Bad and the Ugly, taking apart all the guns in the store to
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.320]   put together the one that was perfect for him.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.560]   And oh my goodness.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.520]   And also, just...
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.000]   The thing that was holding me back, because I was...
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.880]   I knew that this was the time that I finally think that I'm an okay enough photographer
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.360]   that I can take advantage of a better pro-level camera.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.760]   And I was thinking about Nikon's, I was thinking about Canon's, everything that I was reading
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.800]   and everything that had been told to me, both professionally and as a consumer, said, "Well,
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.200]   the thing is, with micro four thirds, is that they're not really fast focusing and they
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.480]   can't really do this and they can't really do that."
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.000]   But within their limitations, and I finally...
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.360]   I had such a good instinct about it that I went forward and I can't think of...
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.720]   Over the years, again, this year I started shooting like action sports, which is something
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.040]   that even the first generation was not supposed to be good at and you can do that.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.040]   It's good.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.040]   It works great.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.040]   And...
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.040]   Oh, my God.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:57.200]   I'm so close to putting money under the mattress for the Mark II, because everything...
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.080]   It seems to be everything I love about the Mark I plus more megapixels plus faster plus
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.080]   all this.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.920]   And I'll just say the last thing though, the ability to just board an Amtrak train with
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.720]   my laptop bag and have a collection of...
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.360]   It's so compact that I have a collection of lenses in there that is about the weight
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.400]   of maybe one lens of how I bought an SLG, a Canon or an icon.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.920]   It's like, why not take the 70 to 300 millimeters zoom plus the medium zoom plus this fisheye
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.920]   lens?
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.560]   Because anyway, I'm enthusiastic.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.560]   I like this.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.200]   I have to say that this comes back to a topic we've often raised on this show, which is
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.200]   computational photography.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.440]   A micro four thirds sensor is a lot smaller than the full frame sensors.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:47.040]   So you're getting less data, but what's changed even from the EM1 Mark I to the Mark II is
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.560]   the brains of the operation.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:54.120]   The Mac in processing speed on all cameras these days is phenomenal.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.440]   And really where that comes into play Leo is things like fast autofocus.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.440]   Right.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.440]   And fast frame rates.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.880]   The EM1 Mark II can do 60 frames per second.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.880]   Not 60.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.880]   Okay.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.760]   I thought, see, I just got the A9, the Sony A9.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.760]   And that does 20.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.120]   I thought that was a lot.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.400]   You really shouldn't video when you shoot 60 frames a second.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.920]   That's video, but you could choose each individual frame as if it were a.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.920]   Yeah, that's what the electronic show you can do.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.280]   You can do 18 frames per second with a camera.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.560]   And I have to say, and I noticed this was the A9 as well, which is highly computational.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.560]   You know, they have the stacked sensor.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.000]   You put on eye focus tracking focus or any kind of track.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.960]   You can face or eye tracking.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.160]   And you just, you don't have to focus anymore.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.960]   Well, another cool thing you can do is you can actually focus by touching the rear.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.160]   I love that feature.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.000]   You just focus and you can shoot.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.400]   You can focus and shoot from here.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.160]   Actually, for videography, for shooting video, that's great.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.640]   The Mark IV Canon 5D Mark IV had just added that.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.880]   And having a touch screen is great, but then the fact that you're shooting video and then
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.760]   you tap what you want it to be focused on.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.000]   And it instantly pulls focus.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.640]   Renee, are we leaving you out?
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.080]   No, I was just in my head.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.800]   I was thinking 10 years since iPhone debuted the feature well.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.240]   OK, yes.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.920]   That's probably not right.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:16.680]   It's the glacial pace of established industries, even when you have strong innovators coming
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.680]   in.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.360]   I actually think that Apple does get a lot, deserve a lot of credit for what's happened
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.680]   in the professional camera realm.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:30.280]   Because if it's a camera phone, the professional say, "Well, why can't we have that?"
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.800]   And I would bet, I don't know, but I would bet that the processor improvements that Apple's
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.160]   made in the iPhone have ended up benefiting the processor improvements in the end.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.520]   Well, and don't discount the fact that the iPhone is the number one control app for this
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.120]   camera for remote.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.280]   I mean, if you have an iPhone--
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.120]   You can focus this thing.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.280]   You can change the app.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.840]   You can set the timer.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.800]   You can do anything you can do with your fingers.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   Oh, that's amazing.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.040]   Did you show Lisa that?
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.200]   I haven't shown her yet.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.200]   She uses-- this is her workflow.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.680]   She'll take a picture using Wi-Fi, get it over to the iPhone instantly.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:09.240]   And then she can use Snap-Seed or any variety of filters and publish it.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.680]   And for, I think, for a lot of people, that's a more sensible workflow than coming home,
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:19.200]   putting it in the Lightroom, modifying it, and putting it up three days later.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.440]   The one reason I really have a soft spot for the Olympus-- and, of course, we've owned
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:30.120]   all the OMDs, and I bought her, her Mark II, is I had the OM-1, which was a film camera.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.120]   Oh, I remember.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.040]   It was the smallest film camera out there, 35 millimeter.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.320]   And every-- it was just-- it was a work of art.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.360]   It had a match needle meter inside of it.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.080]   It was the first camera with a real valuable meter inside.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.320]   You can get it, by the way, for 54 bucks now on eBay.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.120]   I bought one because it was just such a beautiful--
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.120]   It's beautiful, isn't it?
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:11:01.880]   Also, my first real camera as a kid was an OM-2 back when you could go to the local-- you
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:07.920]   go to Leechmere, a chain of stores in New England, and buy anything and return it within
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.640]   30 days for no reason.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.240]   So that was my camera rental place.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:16.720]   So that was-- I want to buy an OM-2 two or three months in a row before they told me,
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.560]   "Yeah, we're not allowed to sell you any more cameras," because you just take them back.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.080]   Hey, throw it out, kid.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:33.920]   We should mention that HyperCard is 20 years old, August 11, 1987, 20 years of HyperCard.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.000]   Here's a post on the Internet Archive blogs.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.680]   One of the reasons it's on the Internet Archive blogs is you can still run HyperCard in your
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.680]   browser using-- we've talked about this before.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.880]   The Internet Archive has bootable Macintosh ROMs.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:54.120]   You can choose the Mac you want to run, and most of those ROMs come with-- the Mac emulation
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.720]   comes with HyperCard.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.560]   So you can-- there's a lot of emulated HyperCard stacks on the Internet Archive too.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:09.760]   So if there's kids listening and you want to find out what-- why do these old folks keep
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.600]   talking about HyperCard?
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:17.960]   Well, you can literally-- I'm now booting up a Macintosh, launching the emulator.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:24.840]   Boots a hell of a lot faster than the Mac Classic did, and I can run HyperCard.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.760]   And you could see this is a stack.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.240]   Seinfeld 1.0.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.200]   That's how old Seinfeld is.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:35.200]   This is kind of a weird mismatch between the timelines of technology and the timelines
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.680]   of everything else.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.680]   Seinfeld feels relatively modern.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.520]   Culture makes no sense in hindsight.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:49.320]   But if you look at this HyperCard stack of the Seinfeld show, it feels like, "Good
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.680]   Lord, this is prehistory.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.480]   This goes back forever and ever."
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:59.360]   Being able to build a HyperCard stack was one of the first real programming things I
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.680]   accomplished.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.680]   And Bill Atkinson, being a photographer, I was very keen on what was going on with this.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.880]   I absolutely think that HyperCard was way ahead of its time, and one of the coolest
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.040]   things that happened on the older Macs.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:19.160]   I'm glad you mentioned the history of it, because it's just such an amazing thing.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.040]   Everybody takes it for granted now what you can do.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.680]   But back then, it was pretty cool.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.280]   It's also something I wish we'd get back to, because HyperCard was-- for people on the
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:33.840]   Mac, I think it gave it people control over the Mac that they might have used to have had
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:39.200]   over the Apple, because you would go to someone's house, whether they were an adult or a kid,
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.560]   and they would boot into whatever custom HyperCard stack they had created to do whatever task
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.800]   that they had set that thing up to do.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.960]   And so, if the Mac felt like they're Mac, as opposed to, "I'm running the apps that other
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:55.080]   companies have created for me or allowing me to create."
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:00.960]   And with the-- if Apple were to create something like that on the Mac these days, oh boy, you'd
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:07.040]   see in-depth, in-depth, eight-dimensional insanity in about eight days, and it would just make
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.040]   me so very happy.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:15.800]   That's one of the reasons we continue to celebrate the Salsa Goyan, you know, Apple Script and
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.520]   Automator, they're really the spiritual successors to HyperCard.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:25.160]   Apple seems to have kind of abandoned them.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.440]   Neither of you went to the Commandee Conference.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.200]   I guess that was last week in-- we talked about it.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.600]   It was last week in San Jose.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.600]   No, I'm afraid not.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.600]   But I saw a lot of pictures and stories from that, and I'm glad that Salsa keeping--
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.600]   Oh, he's doing--
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.320]   --automated, alive, and Apple Script-a-line.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.800]   He's doing some incredible stuff.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.760]   If you go to his sites-- his famous-- he's continued the tradition of creating official
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.320]   sites when he was working at Apple that were technically official, and he's doing an incredible
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:57.080]   stuff that automates stuff within the Omni groups apps.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:02.720]   So things that you didn't think you could do-- you can automate between iOS and Mac OS,
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.960]   even on iOS directly.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.280]   It's just incredible.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.680]   It's all being done by JavaScript.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.760]   It's all being done with open technology, so it could be adapted anywhere.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.800]   He is such an important force.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:21.760]   And I don't know what the equivalent of a MacArthur Genius grant is within our group,
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.600]   but oh boy, he should get the first three of them.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.120]   He's doing such important work for everybody.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.640]   How do you like this?
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.640]   This is my new computer.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.640]   It's a man in the--
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.640]   It's a man in the--
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.640]   --you're killing me.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.080]   This is the world's biggest--
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.200]   A Seinfeld icon looks like the Heath Ledger Joker.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.840]   This is the world's-- let me just see.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.720]   Let me get info here.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.200]   This file here.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.200]   Actually--
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.600]   Is that the resolution of the Apple watch?
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.600]   How is it now?
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.600]   Yeah, probably, right?
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.600]   512 by 342.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.600]   Holy cow.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.600]   Holy cow.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:57.160]   This is a hypercard on the Microsoft Surface Studio.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.160]   Yeah, boy.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.160]   Wow.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.160]   At least it's a touch Macintosh.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.160]   It's the first touch.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.160]   The first touch screen Macintosh.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.160]   I like it.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.600]   That is kind of disorienting in so many ways.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.480]   Anyway, happy birthday.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.880]   And thank you, Bill Atkinson.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.880]   And you know, Bill's around.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.520]   In fact, we're going to try to get him to come up and maybe do something on the 20th
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.840]   anniversary because it's such a big anniversary.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.120]   It was last, I think last Friday, 20th anniversary.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.120]   So the 30th?
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.680]   No, it's the 11th.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.480]   No, it wasn't the 30th anniversary.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.960]   Did I say 20th?
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.960]   Yes.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.960]   I'm really kind of ready.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.960]   No, I feel old.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.600]   I feel really old.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.600]   Interesting.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.600]   I can't argue.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.600]   I remember.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.200]   Interesting revelation.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.360]   We talked last week about Apple's quarterly results and how their number two business
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.160]   was services.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.320]   Thank you CNBC.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.520]   But I really, you know, it's really driving me crazy.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.520]   There's a new thing now.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.880]   I think Bloomberg does it where you can't, it starts.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:57.880]   The audio starts.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:58.960]   The video starts.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.760]   And then it's got a button that says audio.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.960]   But if you click it, it launches it.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.440]   It doesn't turn off the audio.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.440]   It's like, come on.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.880]   Doesn't the browser have that?
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.120]   Like Safari has that auto mute every tab button.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.440]   I guess I got to find that button.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:16.560]   I'm a Chrome user, but I'm considering switching back to Safari just to it's getting such
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.560]   a huge problem.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.560]   Yeah.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.560]   Well, yeah.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.560]   They want those numbers.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.560]   They want the play numbers, Leo.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.560]   They get them.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.560]   Whether they mean anything.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.720]   It's like Facebook would autoplay video in the news roll.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.160]   We have huge, huge numbers on video.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.480]   Anyway, I was talking about, we were talking about services.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:39.560]   This maybe dampens the enthusiasm for Apple's quote services business according to, I guess
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.600]   this is coming from Google, right?
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:48.800]   Google in an investors note on Monday said that Apple pays about $3 billion a year.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:57.840]   I mean, Google pays about $3 billion a year to Apple just so it can continue to have the
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.080]   default search engine on Safari and iOS.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.080]   $3 billion.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:07.600]   We knew we know that number from Eric Schmitt saying something a couple of years ago.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.640]   A couple of years ago, it was $1 billion.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.800]   And it doesn't show the value of those customers.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.800]   Three eyeballs.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.760]   I was going to say, a billion dollars.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:20.160]   It is because, of course, it's iPhone.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.880]   But what it does is it shows you that even in something like services, Apple's number
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.680]   two business, it still stems from the iPhone.
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.760]   It all starts with the iPhone, right?
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.840]   Because remember, they weren't just talking about that, but they were also talking about
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.000]   we mentioned this last week that they didn't break down those numbers.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.540]   But we know that the lion's share of money that make from services is through the App
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:41.740]   Store.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.360]   And they're making most of that money through iOS.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.880]   They're making most of the iOS money through like in game purchases and things like that.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.840]   So we got a way, we got a ways to go before Apple can say, hey, look, we're broadening
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.840]   out.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.840]   We're not reliant on the iPhone.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.160]   Well, they can say that we're no longer reliant on iPhone hardware.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:03.080]   We're now just reliant on services that you need to buy for the iPhone.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:09.040]   Remember, of course, that the billion dollars that Google paid Apple in the last quarter,
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.440]   a billion and a quarter is all profit.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:17.320]   That's there's no, you know, it's all probably is got to have coffee with Sergey once a month.
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.520]   So you could subtract 450 for the start.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:29.120]   So Google may account for as much as 25% of company profit growth over the last two years.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:35.600]   Google kind of explained what we haven't seen the enmity between Apple and Google that
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.280]   we've seen between Apple and Adobe.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.720]   And remember jobs that were going nuclear on Google over Android, blah, blah, blah, that
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.400]   kind of went away when Tim Cook took over.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.040]   There is a billion dollars.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.600]   That's exactly what there's a tight relationship between the two.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.640]   I don't know if that also means the if it has anything to do with the Google apps, it sounds
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.920]   like it's just having Google be the default search engine as far.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.520]   And I have a feeling that this number went up partly because of negotiations.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.480]   Remember when Apple said we're thinking of moving to Yahoo where the rumor was, we're
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.360]   thinking of moving to Yahoo or Bing for our defaults.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:11.400]   That's like, you know, that's like Daniel Craig saying he's not going to be in the next
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.960]   bond movie so they can get his salary up.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.720]   Do you think that's what that was all about?
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.200]   Of course, that's what it was all about.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.920]   Oh, what else is he going to do?
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.920]   I think we talked about this too.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:21.920]   He's born.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.720]   It's going to be very hard to grow the iPhone business in terms of unit sales because there's
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.600]   only so many people on Earth who are willing to have an iPhone, but you can grow the amount
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.760]   of money that each of those customers gives you.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.640]   And that's through accessory sales and Apple Watch and Apple TV are both accessory sales.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.560]   In terms of that, it's subscription revenue to Apple Music.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.840]   It's Google paying you for first placement on Search thing.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:44.360]   All those things increase the average amount of money you're making for a customer on iPhone.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:51.680]   But clearly, just until next quarter in the new iPhone, Apple may in fact be the world's
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.880]   third largest smartphone maker.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.680]   That's for the first time since 2011.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.760]   And it's thanks to, of course, number one, Samsung, you know, and it has been for some
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.760]   time.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:07.360]   But that's thanks to the success of Huawei, a Chinese smartphone manufacturer, they use
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.360]   Android.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:13.680]   Well, they use a highly customized version of Android and successive high end phones like
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.480]   their P10 and their Mate 9.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.400]   And of course, the honor phones, which are a little less expensive.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.120]   Huawei shipped 38.4 million smartphones last quarter.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.120]   Very few of them to the US.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.600]   I don't even know if you can buy them directly in the US.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.800]   And there's certainly not with any carriers that I know of.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:34.880]   Maybe they are in the US, but most of this is in China and Asia.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.840]   But Huawei is very, very successful.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.840]   That may change.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.960]   Let's see what happens in September.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.240]   By the way, we're less than a month away.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.240]   Right?
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.240]   Yep.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.240]   Soon.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.240]   Soon.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.160]   It's going to be a big deal.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.160]   I think you'll see those numbers flip-flop.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.880]   I mean, I think it's two headlines in a row.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.840]   I remember this for years, going back seven to eight years.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.400]   It was Samsung's the biggest, Apple's the biggest.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.920]   And it was just whether Apple was shipping or Samsung was shipping and they would go
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.560]   up and down and it filled a blog post for the day.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:08.240]   Wednesday, a week from tomorrow, Samsung will announce his note A new note.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.280]   There are a couple of things that are of interest that are not Apple related like Samsung's
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.280]   selling note after the exploding note of...
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.280]   Oh, come on.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.080]   They're new tagline is, "Come on, we didn't mean it."
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.480]   It ain't going to blow up.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.960]   No, I just think people have no attention span anymore.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.200]   They're looking at 900 other things on a social feed.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.960]   Did you even remember that they were blowing up until we thought about them selling a new
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.960]   one?
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.960]   Yeah, right.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.960]   Probably not.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:31.960]   There's like 900 other crazy things on Twitter today.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:37.400]   I think Samsung knew that because they said, "We're not going to even change the brand.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.400]   We're just going to go."
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.400]   They didn't.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.560]   Well, because you'll forget.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.560]   It was...
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.640]   Well, it's one dramatic failure.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.880]   If they have two dramatic failures, okay, then you've got to change the brand.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.480]   Oh, then you've got to get out of the business if you ask me.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.480]   You can't...
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.920]   I mean, they were confident enough that they said, "We are going to actually sell..."
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:02.320]   We're going to sell actual Galaxy Note 7s using components that we had in stock anticipating
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.920]   a year's worth of assembly and repair.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.440]   They were confident to say that we think we're going to sell a few hundred thousand of these,
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.600]   at least in South Korea.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.760]   They call it a fan edition or something like that.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.680]   And by the way, that's fan not as a spinning fan, but in a fanatic.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.200]   We asked on Android Central and people...
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.760]   Yeah, there's such high brand affinity.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.760]   There are people who just...
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.760]   They were upset.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.680]   They still were upset they had to give back their Galaxy Note 7s.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.680]   Oh, I am.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.680]   I love my...
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.680]   I've had every note.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.120]   I love the Note 7.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.560]   I will buy a Note 8, absolutely.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.480]   It's also unique beastie.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:42.320]   If Apple had... if Apple ever decided that we're going to do a iPhone 7 Plus or an iPhone
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:49.280]   8 Plus that also had something like an Apple Pencil that actually docked inside the thing,
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.280]   that would be an interesting alternative.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:57.040]   I've never been tempted to own a Galaxy Note, but every time I've had one for review, I don't
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.640]   use the pen for the first week and then I use it for one or two things and then I'm
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.160]   using it all the time until the end of the month and I have to send it back.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.280]   So it's an interesting thing.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.120]   It's a unique beastie.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.040]   A lot of people are making decent note-sized phones.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.720]   A lot of people are making decent note-sized phones for several hundred dollars less, but
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.280]   no one is making something that really serves that kind of need.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:23.440]   Well, since we are less than probably, we don't know, Apple still has to send out invitations.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.440]   They won't...
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.440]   Never do.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.440]   No.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.440]   What date will it be, Renee?
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.440]   You got a prediction?
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.040]   Is it the first Wednesday after Labor Day, that kind of thing?
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.040]   Is there...
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.840]   It's the first or second usually.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.600]   The Apple can do it anytime they want, especially if they're holding it at their own campus,
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.800]   at the Masters of their own Destiny, and it just depends on when they have everything
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:40.800]   lined up for it.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:47.120]   Is the campus done enough that they can hold it now in the new Apple Park?
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.120]   I'm not sure.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.120]   I mean, I certainly hope so.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.120]   I'd love to take a look at that.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.680]   I mean, do we've been teased with it?
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.480]   It feels like for years already.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.280]   My money's on September 8.
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.280]   September 8.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.280]   Yep.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.280]   Okay.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.880]   I'm just going to look at the calendar because I'm curious.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.880]   Is that a Wednesday?
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.720]   No, the closest day to September 8.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.720]   That's a Friday.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   That's a Friday.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.720]   They have Labor Day, I think, right?
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.120]   And they don't assemble on Labor Day.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.840]   I think it's because of Labor Day, they'll do it on an odd day.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.480]   That's why I'm thinking.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.480]   Like Friday.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.240]   Otherwise, it would be maybe the 13th, which is the Wednesday.
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.320]   Or the 12th, because they do a lot of Tuesdays.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.960]   Let's get a pool going.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.960]   We should.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.960]   I'll take eight.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:24.960]   I'll take eight.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.960]   You're going to put your chips on eight.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.760]   Just all that Tim Cook play.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.760]   Yeah, because...
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.760]   Yeah, no, no, no, no.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.760]   You know it.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.760]   You know it.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.760]   And that way we'll get some.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.760]   We'll get a good deal on our points.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.560]   Tim, how'd you like to get in our big $100 pot?
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.160]   All you got to do is seal it in an envelope and I'll give it to you and you can open it.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.120]   Oh, no, that's not good.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.400]   Yeah, yeah, seal it in an envelope, Tim.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.400]   That's a good idea.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.800]   All right, so it's less likely no more than a month away or roughly.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:53.800]   Yes, but...
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.000]   It's close to almost exactly a month away.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   I think it's going to be big.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.480]   I mean, we've got three iPhones.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:03.520]   We've got an Apple Watch with LTE and likely an Apple TV with 4K HomePod and whether they
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.000]   re-announce it or not, there's the iMac Pro still sitting on the horizon.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Wow.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   All right.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.080]   Let's take a break.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.680]   And since we have the guy with the iPhone vest in studio with a scup-borne, let's talk
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:21.040]   about all we know and all we hope for with the next generation iPhone, the 10th anniversary.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.680]   10th anniversary, Scott.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.680]   10 years since I...
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.680]   10 years.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.680]   Did that.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.680]   Amazing.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.000]   In just a second.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.760]   Annie and Akko's here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:37.520]   We're named Richie from iMore.com and from Photo Podcasts.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.520]   Right?
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.520]   I got to say, right.
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.520]   Photo Podcasts.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.040]   I kind of did that Elmer Fudlight.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.640]   I like this.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.800]   PhotoPodcasts.com.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.560]   It's so great to see.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.920]   Scott Borne back in studio.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:57.040]   And you're going to stick around because Saturday you're going to do the new screen series.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.440]   It's all about the screen savers, baby.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.400]   I think we're going to do a lot of camera stuff on Saturday.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.400]   I'm hoping so.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.400]   Yeah, I'm counting on it.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.960]   I need a tutorial.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.960]   How you get those great...
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.960]   A mate?
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.520]   That picture of the bald eagle catching the...
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.520]   You knew which one.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:16.560]   Karsten said I have it right here as a matter of fact.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.200]   Flying straight at you with a fish in its talon.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.680]   Can I just add that I took that from a moving boat at 30 mile an hour winds?
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:28.600]   And last time we were on you said, and the thing is coming at fairly high speed towards
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.600]   you and it's maintaining focus.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.600]   That's the...
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.600]   That's the...
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.600]   That's a beautiful focus.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.600]   That's amazing.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.840]   That is pin sharp.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:42.540]   Scott wrote this really nice blog post about just how to make things sharp that has got
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:48.640]   me... got me... for the next time I'm going to be shooting like, okay, so here's why I've
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.240]   been frustrated because I'm not as smart as Scott.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.680]   I want all my pictures to be that sharp, right?
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.680]   Don't you really?
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:28:01.080]   Even if you love the bouquet in the background, you want creamy bouquet, you still want the
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.560]   subject to be pin sharp.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.160]   That's kind of the prerequisite, right?
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.160]   That's the first thing.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.000]   If it's out of focus, it's over.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   It's not even...
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Yeah, it's hard to sell them out of focus bird picture.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.040]   I have a fair amount of experience.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:19.800]   Or motion blur, which is almost inevitable with something flying at high speed.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.400]   So you use 1500, how fast is your shutter speed, B.C.?
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.400]   Oh, no.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.080]   My minimum shutter speed for birds and flies is one 1500th of a second.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.080]   Holy cow.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:32.120]   And for a sharp wing tip to wing tip here at a 2000th.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.120]   That fast.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.120]   That fast.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:40.560]   And do you cheat a little with the focus by having a narrow aperture or...
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.080]   You know, generally because we're shooting at the high shutter speeds, we have to shoot
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.080]   wide open.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.080]   You have to be open.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.080]   Even if it's daylight.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.960]   You go with the higher ISO to get where we want to be.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.760]   But you know, it's working for me.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.080]   That picture we just showed, which is a mind-boggling picture.
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:03.600]   If you're listening, you can see it on Scott's website, scottb-o-u-r-n-e.com.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.600]   Thank you.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.680]   And just look at his Eagle photos.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.680]   That picture.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.840]   You know, I love when people say, "What camera did you use to take that picture?"
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.640]   You know, must've been a really good camera.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.680]   Well, it was a good camera.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.680]   Are you?
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.680]   No.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.680]   What's your...
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.680]   I keep saying, "Ambassador," that's not quite right.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.280]   So it's called the Olympus Visionary Program.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.080]   So I'm the newest member of the Olympus Visionary team.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.080]   It's quite an honor.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.800]   In fact, it's the highest honor I've ever received in my career, and I'm grateful for
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.800]   it.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.800]   Do you get paid to do that?
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.800]   I do.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   So it's a...
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.640]   But I want to point out that I switched to Olympus before that...
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.600]   In November of last year.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.600]   Right.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.960]   And I didn't start getting paid till July of this year.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.200]   So they came to me, not the other way around.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.440]   And you've been a great advocate for it long before you had anything to do.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.120]   And it's just recognition, and I appreciate it very much.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:55.800]   And I got my hands in a lot of stuff, but I have to say it's a very high honor.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.960]   And they're very Mac-centric, by the way.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:02.800]   A lot of the folks there are in the Mac, so it's a good marriage.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.840]   And chat rooms asking, "We'll take a break.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.760]   We'll come and dress this later, maybe on the new screen.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.800]   And say it was about post-processing, what kind of post-processing you do.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.800]   But we'll find out in a minute, okay?
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   Because I know.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:22.320]   I'm going to keep it a secret for a little bit longer while we talk about my doorbell.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.960]   I have one right here.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.160]   I should give you one, Scott.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.160]   You need this.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.160]   I would love one of those.
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.160]   This is the Ring Doorbell.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.160]   Love these.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.880]   I installed my Ring almost two years ago now.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.840]   And by the way, no handyman eye.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.280]   But it's nice because the doorbell comes with all the stuff you need.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.760]   There's a drill bit.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:39.760]   There's a screwdriver.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:44.640]   They have a normal screwdriver and a handle, but they also have a proprietary bit.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:48.200]   Which makes, you know, so it's locked into your house.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.520]   What you do is you remove the old doorbell.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.360]   You've got two wires coming out.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.800]   Actually, this one doesn't even need a wired doorbell because it's got a lithium-ion battery
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.800]   in it.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.520]   But the Ring Pro is for wired doorbells.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:03.160]   The two wires coming out, if you look at this, it's actually so much nicer than the
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.400]   standard doorbell installation.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:10.360]   They have a plate that you screw into the door jam.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.560]   And then the wires come through the plate.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.960]   There's terminals there.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.680]   And this is the doorbell.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.840]   And it's got contacts on the back.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.480]   It's got a USB port.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.040]   That's because this one has a lithium-ion battery.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.040]   You charge it.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.520]   It goes about a year on a charge.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.520]   So that's why you could do it without a wired doorbell as well.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:31.800]   And then you press this button and you pair it, I'm pairing it right now with my Wi-Fi.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.160]   So this doorbell is on your Wi-Fi network.
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.720]   It's my favorite IoT device.
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:42.040]   By the way, totally secure firmware patches automatically pushed out by Ring.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.640]   To keep it up to date, very important.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.640]   If you're going to get an IoT device, make sure you're getting it from a reliable company
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.120]   that keeps their stuff up to date.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.560]   Ring does.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:53.640]   But once it's paired, you get all this benefit.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:57.880]   Because suddenly, now you've got a camera at your front door that not only lights up
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:03.120]   when somebody rings the doorbell, but even with motion sensors, when somebody walks by.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.560]   And you can set the range so it can go all the way out to the street if you want.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:12.400]   I wouldn't set it onto the street because in every car that goes by will ping you.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.840]   And you can talk to and listen to anybody at your door, see them.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.920]   So when I get a delivery, I can see them and talk to them.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.840]   I can say, leave it there, put it behind a bush, whatever.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.960]   You can keep an eye on that package.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.040]   They also make these great kits.
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.480]   This is a Ring of Security kit that includes the new floodlight cam that just came out.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:33.520]   The floodlight cam is basically a doorbell without the doorbell, the Ring video doorbell
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.520]   without the doorbell.
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:39.520]   It's a camera speaker microphone and it has lights that light up when there's motion
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.760]   detected.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.720]   But they have one extra feature the doorbell doesn't have.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:47.480]   So you can see and somebody comes back in your backyard, lights light up.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.960]   If that doesn't scare them, you're seeing them now.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.160]   Anywhere in the world, you're online, on your phone, on your tablet, on your computer,
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.840]   you can see them.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.360]   And then you can talk to them and say, "Yeah, can I help you?"
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.520]   That usually gets them to run away.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:07.000]   If they still don't run away, you can press a button and send 110 decibel screaming siren
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.640]   and they guarantee you are now going to leave.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.640]   It is awesome.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:15.120]   Works on coyotes as well, I might add, or Bobcat.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.480]   The Ring Floodlight Cam.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.480]   We have a deal.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:22.840]   If you get the Ring of Security kit that's going to include a Ring doorbell, you can get
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:28.280]   your pro, the pro or the original Ring, and one, two, or three floodlight cams.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:33.040]   And you can save up to $150 off when you go to ring.com/macbreak.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.360]   Wall Street Journal's best of CES 2017.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.920]   This company is knocking it out of the park.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.040]   I love these guys.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.280]   I love their founder, Jamie.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.400]   By the way, he's a fan of the screen savers.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.400]   He told me this.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.400]   I didn't realize it.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.680]   He'd been on our show.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.080]   One time, years ago, Jason Kellecan has auctioned off an ad on the Twitch show.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.640]   He asked me ahead of time.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:59.360]   I often add on the Twitch show, and Jamie Simenoff, this was pre-ring.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:05.120]   He had another company, bought it, and did an ad on the Twitch show.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.120]   And we met.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.360]   And I didn't remember that.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.680]   He said, "When I talk to him, Leo, you don't remember me."
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:11.680]   I said, "From what?"
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.080]   And he told me, "Well, Jamie, yes, you're that Jamie."
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.000]   Now he's got this company, Richard Branson's an investor.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.600]   Go to Ring.com/macbreak and get up to $150 off a Ring of Security kit at Ring.com.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.280]   I'm going to give you this.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.600]   You have somewhere you can install it?
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.600]   I have a door.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.600]   You have a door?
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.600]   I can use a doorbell.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.600]   And you need a doorbell.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.600]   This is so much better.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.520]   You know when you buy a house?
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.800]   The doorbell, we bought a nice house.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.280]   It's a very nice house.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.280]   It has a cheesy doorbell.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.280]   Cheesy?
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.640]   It's like they got it at Kmart, right?
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:45.640]   Every time.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:49.840]   And it's kind of falling off, and there's drops of paint where they painted around it,
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.160]   and then every time.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.600]   That's why I replaced it.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.600]   All right, moving on.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.600]   iPhone.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.840]   What do you want to say?
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.840]   First of all, Renee?
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.840]   Yes, sir.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.800]   What's your best guess to the name of the high-end fancy one?
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.480]   You know, I hate making these guesses because it's literally Apple guesses.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.760]   So they get together, they pick sort of a name, they make up a big list, and then they
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.600]   go through them and they talk out all these names and figure out which one is the best
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.800]   one to go to market with.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.120]   And sometimes it's the first name they thought of.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.120]   Sometimes it's not.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:24.200]   The recent MacBook was MacBook Stealth for a while before they settled back down to just
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.200]   MacBooks.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.200]   Thank God.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.280]   Yeah, so I mean, a lot of names sound goofy until you've had them for 10 months.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.000]   We do think that there will be a 7S and a 7S Plus, right?
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.360]   Yeah, and they could just be iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8 Pro because that's a
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:41.600]   very simple, easy to understand nomenclature, or they could just be iPhone, iPhone Plus,
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:45.120]   and iPhone Pro if Apple decides to ditch the numbering scheme.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.400]   I mean, there's pros and cons to all of these.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.080]   And I imagine Phil Schiller and Greg Jaws, we act and everyone are busy hashing that
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.080]   out.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.320]   We are lucky because we do have an expert in iPhone naming here.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:01.760]   Scott Born in 2006 before the iPhone came out, before it was announced, you knew it was
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.360]   going to be the iPhone, right?
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.360]   I did.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.400]   You said it's going to be the iPhone.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:11.280]   And that was actually more of a guess because I mean, there was the right pods.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.400]   Well, we had a little bit of it.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.200]   We had a touch of insight in.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.200]   Oh, did you?
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.200]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   Nobody's going to remember this.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.520]   It's watching the show, but this is like eons ago.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:27.880]   My little buddy, Merlin Mann, would ridicule me every time I'd say I had an insight source,
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:28.880]   but I really did.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.240]   I had an insight source.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.520]   Is he still an apple?
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.920]   I'm not going to say anything else.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.320]   Was it tea jobs?
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.320]   It's your smart.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.880]   Yeah, was it Steve Jobs?
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.880]   It was not Steve Jobs.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.560]   Hey, speaking of Steve, you know, we had, I had Walt Mossberg on triangulation yesterday,
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.880]   which is a lot of fun.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.240]   He had some interesting stories.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.160]   He remember he had quite a relationship with Steve Jobs.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.080]   And I asked him and he said, yeah, I knew Steve was cultivating me.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.080]   I'm a reporter.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.080]   I've worked.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.560]   And I said, he said, I never had dinner with him.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:37:00.720]   It was not a social relationship, but Steve for a long time would call me every Sunday
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.720]   night.
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:07.040]   And the first time he called Walt's wife said, it's Steve Jobs in the line.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:11.320]   And by like the fourth or fifth time she go, it's Steve on the line again because it was
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.800]   always, it was their Sunday night.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:19.320]   And it was an hour and a half minimum conversation with Steve Jobs and Walt Mossberg.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:23.480]   If you haven't seen the interview yet, yesterday's triangulation with Walt Mossberg.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.160]   You know why I met Steve Jobs?
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.160]   How did you meet Steve?
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.160]   Because of you.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.160]   Oh, dear.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.600]   That cannot possibly go well.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.640]   You sent me because you were not either available or interested.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.800]   I went to the I'mack unveiling on your behalf.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   Thank you.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:44.680]   And during the press conference, they said, okay, all you guys from the press go in this
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.680]   room.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.680]   We've actually got some you guys can touch.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:50.840]   I'm in there and income Steve with his posse.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:55.680]   He walks up to me and he goes, so I'm Steve Jobs.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.400]   And I said, yes, you are.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.120]   And he said, what do you think of the I'mack?
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:05.040]   I said, I think he said, this was the first time I goes, what do you think of the I'm
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.040]   ice?
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.040]   I think it's great.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.040]   He goes, of course you do.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.040]   That was it.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.040]   That's my Steve Jobs.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.040]   That's all.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.600]   And that was all because you said means that he that would have been your experience.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:21.000]   I met Steve years before when he was still at next and Pixar.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.760]   And the thing actually that impressed me about his friendship with Mossberg is that Steve
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.640]   was fairly, I don't want to say arrogant.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.600]   He was very confident and a very high self opinion.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:36.000]   And he always, he always got the feeling he knew he was the smartest guy in the room,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   which we, you know, in his defense.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   He was.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.400]   He probably was.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.160]   And when I met him, he barely gave me the time.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.360]   I mean, we, it was social.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.760]   I spent a weekend with him and Lorraine and Reed, who was about two.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.200]   Our daughter was about two at the time.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.080]   His, his, his first born.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:59.080]   And I, you know, read baby stories to read, you know, Lorraine and I had, you know, cocktails
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.080]   together.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.080]   We talked a lot.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:04.880]   And Lorraine was talking about at the time her new vegan food business that she was starting
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:05.880]   up.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:09.880]   Steve talked to me, but it was, but it, and I don't know if it's, he thought, Oh, he's
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.880]   a reporter.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:11.880]   I'm not going to give him the time.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:16.120]   I don't know what it was, but I could tell he did not think I was too bright.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.480]   And so it was always, you know, okay, you again.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.000]   Yeah, I'll talk to you.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.320]   But he was, I still admire him endlessly.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:31.640]   The Steve Jobs Theater is probably where this event will be held in less than a month.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.680]   I hope they're fixing it up right now.
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.680]   I really do.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:35.680]   It'd be so great.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.280]   And if anybody from Apple's listening, send us.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.280]   Please.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:44.000]   No, the reason I sent you is normally, I want to be here for those events so we can watch
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.360]   the stream and comment on it.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.800]   If you're in the event, you can't cover it.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:54.920]   As I learned to my embarrassment in 2010, say no more.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:58.240]   I'm just saying it's a new regime.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.400]   There's new PR people.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:03.200]   I would love to go to this event when you like your go Renee, you'll be there.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.200]   I hope so.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.800]   I never take it for granted or expected, but it's always nice when it happens.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:11.520]   And Andy, if you get the invitation, you have my pledge, we'll cover your flight out
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:17.000]   and put you up because you can go, if I know the Chicago Sun times, it never gives you
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.560]   anything for truth.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.840]   But you can go on our behalf.
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:24.000]   They gave him a rail pass once.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.360]   He takes the train on the Chicago Sun times time.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:32.640]   I try to get the invoice for that MTA fare when I...
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:36.000]   Still waiting 11 years later.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.320]   But you would come Andy.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:41.320]   If you got an invite and it's at the Steve Jobs Theatre on the new Apple campus, you would
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.720]   go, right?
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.560]   I have to think very hard.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.720]   I would give that very positive consideration, yes.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.960]   Well, let me make it easier for you in one regard.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.920]   We'd be glad to cover the year for that.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:52.920]   Okay.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.360]   Anybody who, you know, and Renee, you've got somebody, you've got somebody with the
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.360]   pockets to cover you.
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:02.480]   He blew all his money on Blackberry.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:03.480]   I'm very excited.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.480]   So you think they'll talk about...
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.280]   Now the HomePod they said would not be available to December.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.280]   Yes.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.040]   Do you think they'll talk about it though?
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.040]   I have to, right?
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.040]   They might as I mean...
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.680]   Go ahead Andy.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:18.760]   I think they have to give it its first live fire demo to get people really excited and
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:24.840]   to get people to, again, put that $350 underneath the mattress for December.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.640]   I would be really surprised if they didn't take advantage of that.
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:30.560]   I mean, this is going to be one hell of a...
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:37.200]   If they announce all the things that they've got in their hit pocket for September, October,
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.680]   this could be a really great event.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:45.280]   Even if they can't get people to actually pre-order a HomePod that day, who knows,
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:49.000]   and who knows, maybe they would start pre-orders that day, they can get people when the Halo
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   effect as they're getting excited about the new iPhone, as they're getting excited about
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.760]   the new LTE Apple Watch, too.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.160]   Also that Halo effect will also embrace this device that they hadn't even heard of a few
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.520]   months ago and only got there first in the room, again, live fire.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:08.040]   Remember, all we saw was a static object at WWDC.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.040]   That would be such a great opportunity.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:12.320]   I'd be surprised if they didn't have some sort of a live demo of it.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.320]   And there was only Apple music.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.200]   Music was the entire discussion at WWDC and there's still series capabilities that they
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.480]   haven't gone into at all yet.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.480]   Good point.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.200]   And the display and it's all these other characteristics to it.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:27.440]   Sibyla Narcharum says, "If it's not the Steve Jobs Theater, it'll at least be at the Steve
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.640]   Jobs dirt mounds."
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.600]   Capacity standing.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.440]   I keep getting the name right wrong.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.880]   It's the HomePod, right?
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:37.880]   Yes.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:42.760]   I don't know why I want to call it the HomeHub, partly because it's expected to be a hub
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.800]   for Apple's HomeKit.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:50.120]   I think they're very smartly positioning it because if you make it a virtual assistant,
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.320]   you're going up against Google and you're going up against Amazon.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.960]   And if you make it a hub, then it's sort of relegated to people who have home automation
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:56.960]   stuff.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.320]   By making it a speaker, you're sort of tapping into that Sonos vibe where everybody needs
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:03.200]   a speaker and this is a good speaker.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.040]   I think it's very subtle and very smart positioning on their part.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.520]   Also, it's the feature they can definitely deliver very, very well with version 1.0.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:15.280]   So if they're selling it as a really good speaker, they'll get people who buy it for
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.080]   that reason will be really, really happy.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:21.640]   And then a year later, with a couple or a few different updates, it will start to come
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:26.080]   into its own as a HomeKit controller or as a smart speaker.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:29.240]   But again, that's the one thing they can get people to definitely come in on.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.240]   It'll be the most awesome speaker of that type they've ever heard.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.880]   It'll look really, really cool and it will have an Apple logo on it.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.960]   Those are three things that a lot of people will spend $350 for.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:41.520]   And we've talked to people who've heard it, Jim Dauberple.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:46.560]   And he certainly, Jim is a music lover and I trust his opinion.
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.760]   He says it'll sound very good.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.280]   He said, "Did he not say on the show that he would sound better than the Sonos?"
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.920]   No, they gave us all a Pepsi, well, they gave a lot of us a Pepsi show today.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:54.920]   Oh, you heard a two-ray day.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.880]   Yeah, they were the Sonos and the Amazon Echo.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.520]   And the Amazon Echo is not a great speaker.
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:00.520]   That's not close.
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:01.520]   I mean, anything except said to be great.
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:05.560]   But I would say, I think we heard seven songs, including a couple that were live recordings,
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.480]   not just studio recordings.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:12.880]   And it sounded like two of them were close-ish, but the other ones, it just soundly annihilated
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:13.880]   it.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:14.880]   How did they do it?
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.040]   Did they do an AB switch or something?
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.040]   How did they do it?
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.920]   So, as far as I can recall, they had all three speakers there and the one that was
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.280]   playing would light up.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.480]   But you could also move around the room to hear how the different speakers sounded in
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.080]   different parts of the room.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:31.040]   And then I believe they did a two-home pod demo as well, so you could hear how sort of
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:35.360]   it would work together and fill a room if you had more than one of them together.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:45.720]   And Echo, Amazon and Google who offer their own solution are both very aware of the threat.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.920]   Somebody's looking at Sonos anymore to be the leader in this category.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.240]   And they're both adding Sonos style capabilities.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:57.240]   Amazon has announced that you'll be able to do that kind of that party mode with an Echo
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:01.080]   as well as multi-room listening that syncs up.
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:04.840]   I think Google has announced the, I think the Chromecast audio has been doing that for
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.080]   some time.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:11.560]   So, and the advantage of both of those is that you could put whatever quality speakers
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.080]   you want on them.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:19.080]   If you have a dot which is 40 bucks and a Chromecast audio which is even less, you pair those up
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:23.640]   with good speakers powered or an amplifier and speakers unpowered.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:29.040]   You could make it as, you know, you could put B&W, you know, $20,000 speakers on there.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.720]   Powers Wilkins would be my choice.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:36.200]   And I will just say that I think, I think Andy's spot on in terms of the speaker discussion
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:40.560]   because if they're betting on this baby relying on Siri, I got news for it.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.560]   Ah, disappointing.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:46.120]   I'm interested in getting directions to Oslo, Norway when I want to go down the street to
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.160]   the safe way, which is what Siri does.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:51.600]   But you're not going to ask for, I think they could make Siri better on the HomePod.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.400]   You're not going to ask for directions on the phone.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:58.680]   That's a very, it's going to be a much more specific, you know, vocabulary.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:45:59.680]   And so they can make it better.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:00.680]   I think they can add all these features.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:04.800]   And the one thing that we talked about before with a, with a computational photography is
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.240]   they're, they're absolutely doing computational audio here.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:12.080]   They have the Apple A-H chip as an audio digital signal processor.
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:16.400]   And they're continuously measuring everything that's happening in that room and then taking
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:21.160]   apart analyzing and projecting audio to match exactly all the readings that they're getting.
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:24.560]   And I, that is something that's going to give them an advantage over people who don't have
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.560]   no one else does that.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:26.560]   That's a chip sauce.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.720]   And if it does it well, do you think people will care about that?
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.520]   I mean, one thing we know, thanks to Apple and the crappy white iPod headphones is people
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.520]   don't really care about audio.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.840]   Yeah, that's, that's, that's my, that's what I'm curious about.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.440]   Like I love these Sony headphones.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:44.960]   I mean, they're, for me, expensive headphones that cost like 70 bucks.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:50.000]   And then, but I know some audio files that have like three, four, $500 headphones.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.600]   And there is no way you can get me to care about a $500 pair of headphones.
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.000]   There's, you just can't.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.680]   So I'm willing to go the extra $20 for these and I'm willing to go the extra $300 for something
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:01.680]   even better than that.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:06.840]   So even though you could, I could take as a consumer, maybe I could take the ABC test
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:11.360]   and decide that, wow, yeah, boy, this is, with this computational audio, it's much,
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:16.160]   much better than the Sono speaker or this other speaker, I could say, yeah, but for
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:21.920]   what I want, if I'm going to spend more than $300, I'd much rather now spend four or $500
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:26.640]   for speakers with actual separation or something that can grow with a bit more of a feature
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.640]   than that.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:28.640]   So I don't know how people are going to react to it.
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:32.880]   But again, I think that the way that Apple creates its product, not just the way it markets
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:35.960]   its products, but the way that it creates its products, I think a lot of people are going
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:43.680]   to see for themselves the value in spending an extra $100, $150 on this Apple speaker,
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:47.320]   rather than a really good $200, $250 Bluetooth speaker.
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.800]   There's an advantage to doing it the way they're doing because for instance, you listen to
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:55.280]   music in the kitchen, but it's not a place where you care if it's super high fidelity.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:48:00.600]   A decent speaker like a single home pod would be fine, but then there are places you go.
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:03.920]   Maybe you're living room where you want to hear it in stereo or even in surround, you
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.880]   want to hire quality.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:10.760]   And the capabilities of combining multiple home pods to give you better sound, that's
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.400]   very interesting.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.720]   But maybe that is a small market.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:18.280]   And most people just put it in the kitchen as that's what they do in the echo.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:23.600]   But it does suggest an expansion sort of thing where maybe, again, maybe you did buy for
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:28.320]   $350 just for something in the family room, something casual use, but then you really,
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:29.320]   really love it.
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:33.680]   So you decided to buy another one for the bedroom and then you bought a third one,
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:39.640]   and you decided to redistribute these as a stereo pair in a really good listening space.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.000]   So it's a really interesting way of selling audio.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   And it's very 2017, very 2018.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.560]   I've still got the, I still have now in the corner of my office the stereo that I bought
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:57.960]   after I nearly killed myself writing my first book when I was like 28, 29.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.680]   But it's too, it's too nice.
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:00.680]   It's a pioneer.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:01.680]   It has lots of buttons.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:05.520]   It has this like start, break, remote that I, it's, and I loved it.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:09.040]   And I use, it was in my office like every single, using it every single day, but it's
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:12.960]   just not relevant to the way that I listen to music now.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:18.640]   So maybe there, again, I think there are going to be a lot, I think I spent like $900.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.800]   And so there, I think there are going to be a lot of people that will spend, let's say,
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:24.880]   the same amount of money when they decide they want better audio, but they're going
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:30.240]   to spend it maybe $100, $200, $300 at a time by adding little speakers here and there by
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.240]   adding automation here and there.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.280]   That's a Sonos model, isn't it?
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.280]   Sonos gets you because it's incremental.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.880]   Oh, they got me, Leo.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:38.880]   I know.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.880]   This is what's killing many of us.
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:45.680]   It's thousands of dollars when you add it all up on Sonos speakers and they're, I think
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:48.280]   they haven't done home theater yet.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:49.600]   Apple hasn't done home theater yet.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:53.360]   And most of my Sonos is in the home theater, so I'm not desperate yet, but I'm getting
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:54.360]   there.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:50:01.000]   So, one of these rumors, that's a little more than a rumor and it's probably not surprising
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.240]   anybody's paying attention.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:07.720]   There's a company in Ventec appliances that was always rumored to be, even before they
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:15.440]   announced it, the supplier for the HomePod, the manufacturer, the president of in Ventec
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:18.840]   appliance, David Ho gave a press conference yesterday.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:26.240]   He didn't say the word HomePod, but he said, "A high profile smart home device that will
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:31.800]   launch sometime in December, we're going to have a hard time making them.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:34.720]   They'll be limited in limited supply initially.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:39.520]   We're having, you know, it's not going to, let me read the exact quote.
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.440]   You can determine what he's saying.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:47.520]   We will finally ship the smart home device this year, but its contribution will be, this
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:48.600]   is to their bottom line.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:50.520]   This is their analyst call in Ventec.
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:55.400]   We'll be fairly limited and hopefully that will improve next year.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:51:01.640]   In Ventec appliances, we'll likely only ship some 500, this is an analyst now, 500,000
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:06.440]   units of the HomePod this year, which that's half a million.
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:09.080]   I don't know if they'll be demand, that probably will be.
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.080]   This is incredible.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:12.560]   It's incredibly restricted shipments as well.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:16.400]   Apple is only shipping it to a few countries that have English as a primary language.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.400]   Because of Siri.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.400]   They're also because of supply.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.760]   I mean, they're pretty good at matching the amount they can produce to the territories
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.120]   that they want to put them in.
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:29.560]   I hope we're not going to see some similar, I bet we will, similar restrictions on the
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:30.560]   new iPhone.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:34.440]   Although the latest rumor is it will be shipping exactly the same time.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:40.040]   The other ones will be and there's plenty of them and some rumors go back and forth.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.560]   Hands on what they want to do with the talk.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:42.560]   Nice Leo.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:49.280]   Both of those things, if you've already decided that whatever the new super iPhone is going
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:54.680]   to be or however the HomePod comes out, you better be there the first hour of the first
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:55.680]   day.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.280]   Because you're going to have to, I do think you're going to have to wait a month or two
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:01.680]   if you don't get in on the first day.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:08.800]   I don't know, as anybody, as Renee will confirm, Apple doesn't, unless they're giving you hardware
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.000]   in advance.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:16.080]   They don't call you, if anything I would get maybe two or three days, notice that can I
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:20.640]   be home to sign for a package on a day that something is due to ship.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:25.440]   Otherwise, if I really want to get it early, I'm going to have to like pre-order it as
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.600]   fast as possible.
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:28.600]   Otherwise, you're going to be waiting for months.
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.960]   That's why I didn't get to write about AirPods for a good long time because I didn't buy
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:35.120]   them the first day and had to wait two or three months before they were in the store.
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:36.440]   So that's my advice to everybody else.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:39.080]   Again, get that money under a mattress, get ready to do it.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:43.600]   If you really are that interested, particularly if you think that there's a possibility that
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:47.440]   you're going to make this the big Christmas present to your spouse or to one of your kids,
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:52.600]   again, you're going to have to throw a few elbows in virtual space to make sure you get
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.600]   at the headlet line.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.520]   Do you have banks in Boston, Andy?
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:57.920]   I'm just curious.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.000]   Why the mattress?
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.600]   We are but a simple, puret and fishing colony.
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:09.560]   We feel as though to put our money in banks is to earn money that we have not earned.
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:10.960]   Okay, thank you.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:11.960]   Just checking.
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:17.520]   So I asked Renee, Andy, do you have any thoughts about what the next generation iPhone will
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:21.480]   be called the high-end model?
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:25.280]   I wouldn't be surprised if there hasn't been serious discussion about doing away with the
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.920]   numbering completely.
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:30.800]   That's where we seem to be kind of converging, right?
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:33.600]   Because they've done that before.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.800]   They remember they did away with that for the iPad.
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:42.360]   It basically makes older hardware feel a little bit from fewer than it actually is.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:50.000]   If you just simply call it iPhone plus 2017 edition, that's okay.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.960]   That's like the fourth or fifth syllable by which point no one is listening anymore.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:57.680]   You have to ask yourself at what point is it useful to them to keep numbering these
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:58.680]   things?
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:53:59.680]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:04.360]   If they were to do a new name for this new higher end phone, I'm sure that they would
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:08.400]   want to keep the pedigree that they've been doing before, again, like the Mac Pro or the
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:13.400]   Mac or the iPhone Pro or the iPhone Edition.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:18.240]   Edition would help to make it sort of go down a little bit easier that these things aren't
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:22.640]   such sort of supply and that they're charging so much more for them.
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:26.120]   I have to say that I'm contrary to what I was talking about several months ago.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:30.760]   I'm warming to the idea of having an iPhone edition.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:36.200]   So long as they're using this as an opportunity to really push the hardware forward and not
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.120]   just a way to we're going to make the...
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:41.120]   It's a little too make the same mistake that I thought they made with the watch, which
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:46.960]   is to say we took the same modes, it's the same watch, we just put a more...
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:50.360]   I'm more...
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:51.360]   I'm trying...
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:54.360]   I was about to try to make a 10-minute analogy.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:56.360]   Basically, basically, don't...
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:00.000]   Oh, don't lust after aluminum, lust after gold.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.240]   Don't focus on the world problems.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.640]   Look, here's something good.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:04.640]   Shiny.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:05.640]   Shiny.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:06.640]   So I'd be bored.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:10.000]   So, Edition would make sense from the watch standpoint.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.360]   I mean, if they were, again, if they were to say here is something we can't manufacture
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:18.120]   this in quantities where we can deliver tens of millions per quarter.
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:21.160]   Here's something we can build only about five to 10 million copies of.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:22.160]   No, no, no, no.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:23.920]   I'm not saying ceramic, I'm not saying gold.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:27.360]   I'm saying that here is a new sensor technology, here's a new camera technology.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.520]   Here is something that would really help out ARKit.
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:33.840]   Here's the way that we'll actually be able to see in 3D and that will let you take an
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:40.120]   advanced look at what ARKit can do with people that have these new special kinds of phones,
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:43.600]   that have the special extra hardware, but it doesn't commit them to making sure they
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:46.880]   can source 100 million copies of this component.
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:51.960]   It also doesn't commit them to being able to ship this to every single store and have
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.280]   it waiting for everybody.
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:58.240]   So what I'm looking for in every manufacturer, not just Apple, is, again, something that
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:05.200]   really pushes phones forward because it's really, really hard now to, the lot of the most exciting
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:11.080]   stuff that's happening is how good a phone can you make now for $300 for $400 for $200.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:15.280]   And a lot of manufacturers are doing some incredible hardware for half the price of any
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:17.000]   prestige level phone.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.720]   So it would disappoint me if they were saying we just made it more elegant, we just made
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:26.840]   it more exotic, we just made it more, you know, design pat on our back about how good designers
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:27.840]   we are.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:31.840]   If they said that if we had the chance to only make a one million copies of an iPhone and
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:35.600]   we had the chance to make it a little bit thicker and charge a few hundred dollars for
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:37.360]   it, what would we do with that opportunity?
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:41.280]   And the answer is not we'll pour a different material into the mold and pretend that it's
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.440]   really special.
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:48.320]   I have a theory, but I'm going to let our expert answer before I, because you came up with
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:53.600]   your news of the iPhone, what do you think the 10th anniversary iPhone will be called?
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.600]   iPhone 10.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:56.200]   10, you think 10 or an X?
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.200]   That's my pick.
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:03.400]   I'm thinking, so you can go by as Andy does with the addition that maybe they would follow
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:07.160]   their name, naming scheme for their watch.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:11.280]   I'm thinking, remember, the new iMac is the iMac Pro, right?
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:13.880]   And Pro is probably my second choice.
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:14.880]   Pro might be interesting.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:17.880]   The iPhone Pro, focusing especially on the camera.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:20.600]   From the marketing perspective, Andy's right on.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:26.640]   It's definitely harmful to legacy sales to have you look at an iPhone 4 as something
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.680]   that's really no good because it's so old.
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:34.840]   If you take that numbering system away that makes selling older phones.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:36.120]   They do it with the SE, right?
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:39.640]   The SE is really a 5S, but they call it the SE.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:44.080]   And I think that marketing drives a lot of the decisions at Apple.
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:51.760]   So it's a good bet, but I think the number X is real popular in overseas.
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:54.400]   You see X real bold.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:58.160]   I think that particularly in China, that's popular.
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.520]   I bought a car with an X in the name.
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:01.520]   What was that?
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.520]   The Model X.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:03.520]   Yes, you did.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:07.040]   We've all decided that iPhone AF is just off the table, right?
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:08.040]   A yes.
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.040]   Apple never goes.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:10.040]   iPhone is a bad ever mind.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.040]   That's the new autofocus mode.
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.040]   Autofocus.
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:13.040]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:14.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.040]   I'm on my mind.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.040]   iPhone auto.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.040]   You'd be able to do bird photography.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.040]   There's a scot-borne mode on the new iPhone.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.040]   Scot-borne mode.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.040]   They're out of the...
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:22.040]   Oh, I love the speculation.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:26.400]   And I always like it as we get closer to these events, you know, that gets more heated.
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:27.800]   But I am very excited.
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:31.360]   I have to say this is the first iPhone I've been really excited about in a few years.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:35.240]   Oh, would you like me to channel our friend, John C. Dvorak, to have that ship in?
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.240]   What do you think he would say?
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:38.240]   That'll never work.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:39.560]   No way.
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:41.400]   Who would buy anything that expensive?
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.760]   Got a Windows phone.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:43.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:44.760]   Windows.
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:45.760]   There is...
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.240]   Let's see.
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:50.680]   There is a new MacBook Pro.
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:53.680]   Before we move on, look, we just talk about Blush Gold.
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:55.480]   Yes, because we were...
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:58.000]   So the last rumor, and this is really...
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.720]   The rumors are now flying fast and fast and furious.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:03.480]   So much so that the latest rumors are negating the previous shows.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:07.960]   Last rumor, we had all of the funds available all at the same time, all in the same three
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:09.960]   boring colors.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:10.960]   Yes.
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:11.960]   Not so.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:15.000]   But juxtaposed with that is like a mirror finish rumor.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.200]   I really love that.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.480]   I would buy that.
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:19.120]   Because they'll be in glass for inductive charging.
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:22.880]   So glass plus mirror looks really hot, but also copper, which yesterday there might be
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:24.280]   called Blush Gold.
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:27.120]   And I can get used to almost any name, but that one's going to be hard for me.
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:30.920]   But the idea of a copper colored one, I think, would be interesting given the previous past.
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:32.280]   As opposed to rose gold.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.480]   Just because rose gold is like three years old now only on fashion.
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:36.480]   So they'll be...
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:40.960]   Will there still be jet black and the matte black, whatever they call that?
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:43.440]   I don't know because if it's under glass, it'll probably...
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:44.440]   I don't know what...
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:45.440]   Those are metal finishes.
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.360]   Yeah, you can't really do those on...
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.480]   Like it could be shiny, but I just don't know if they'll use those same names.
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:51.480]   Right.
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:52.480]   Maybe they'll have all new names.
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:53.480]   Blush Gold, Black Gold, I don't know.
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:55.320]   So what's our...
[00:59:55.320 --> 01:00:00.880]   Okay, so assuming it's glass because of the inductive charging, it can't be metal.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:03.520]   They have a patent for inductive charging through metal, but as far as I know no one's
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.240]   ever filled with a phone using it.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:06.240]   No one's on it.
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.240]   You could.
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:10.400]   I mean, if you're doing inductive charging, have a cut out of some kind.
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.480]   Google did that with a pixel and it's ugly as sin.
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.000]   I don't really like the cut out.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.280]   Yeah, they did antenna lines and the cut out, which is like the two things you could have.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.920]   If you do glass, you don't need to do antenna lines either, do you?
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.920]   No.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.920]   Because it's transparent.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.080]   It's RF transparent, yeah.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:27.040]   But the problem with glass is it shatters.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.400]   You can't put it on both sides of the bread.
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.400]   It's gonna fall.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.120]   You know, the argument they're gonna release them all at the same time does make sense and
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:37.760]   here's why, because they sure as heck aren't making any computers that anybody cares about.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.760]   I got nothing else to work on.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.200]   You and I are in the same boat.
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:42.840]   Notice all the Windows machines around me these days.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:47.200]   It's when you have this Surface Studio, which by the way, Consumer Reports withdrew its
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:52.680]   recommendation for all the surfaces because of high return rates and reliability.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:56.920]   Microsoft did counter with a press release that did seem to put that in better content.
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:57.920]   Yeah.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.800]   And then Paul Thorett had an article we'll talk about tomorrow on Windows Weekly, saying
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.040]   not only did Microsoft lie.
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.040]   Uh oh.
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:10.400]   Never mind, lie about how all the issues they were having with a Skylake.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.560]   They said, "It's Intel's fault.
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.160]   The Skylake processor's got bugs and bugs.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:17.400]   And then Lenovo said, "What are you talking about?
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.400]   It's working fine.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.840]   I know we don't have a problem with it."
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:24.320]   And I had a Surface book that had all those power issues for eight months before Microsoft
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.320]   could fix it.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:28.600]   That's the one that was, Microsoft famously said, was a tough computer science problem
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.240]   to solve.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.960]   I love the form factors Microsoft's doing with the laptop, the Surface book, the Surface
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.000]   Pro and the Surface Studio is what an iMac should do.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.560]   And it'd be easy for Apple to do that except for this part, the touch part.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.040]   But the fact that it lies flat like this is awesome, right?
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.400]   It's e-killing me with this thing.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.400]   I know.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.080]   It's fantastic.
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.520]   I'm still not, I still would prefer to use Mac OS.
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:50.520]   I'm sure you would.
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.520]   I would like this with a Mac OS.
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:54.520]   Yeah.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:02:00.880]   And to put it in a little different phrase, I have more computers than I need, but fewer
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:03.480]   than I want.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.760]   And minus one Scott and minus one.
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:07.760]   And the years since.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:13.480]   No, I was just saying I showed you the Lenovo Carbon Notebook.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.280]   And I love it so much.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:21.440]   But the thing is when I switch, I've got my iMacs, my Macs here in the office.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:25.120]   And it's like Windows 10 is really, really good.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:28.440]   It's very, very serviceable, but it's not Mac OS.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:33.360]   I spent an entire weekend trying to, going through all kinds of hackintosh techniques
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:39.360]   to try to get Mac OS running in a virtualization mode on the carbon because if I could get,
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:43.960]   oh my God, it's so kicks the ass of every MacBook I've had for the past two or three
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.960]   years.
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.800]   Well, that's kind of the act.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:51.360]   The real point is that the PC ecosystem is so rich.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.360]   Right.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:56.960]   There are any kind of hardware you want you could get because there's thousands of manufacturers.
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.560]   Apple's the only company.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.960]   Apple makes choices.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.640]   Every manufacturer makes choices.
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:05.040]   The problem is if you don't like Apple's choices, there's nowhere else to go.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.040]   Fistful of dongles.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.040]   Anybody?
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.040]   With the full of dongles.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.920]   I've actually, Renee, that's my solution.
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.360]   I don't use Windows.
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:18.720]   And even with it, I got a brand new Lenovo and the Linux has gone, people are going to
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:19.720]   think I'm an idiot.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:26.680]   Linux has come so far that the current Linux kernels support KB Lake, the latest Intel
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.760]   processors flawlessly.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:33.400]   Nowadays, when you install a good Linux, and there I'll give you a couple of names, but
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:39.400]   a good Linux on a today's state of the art laptop, everything works out of the box.
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:40.400]   Even power saving.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.680]   Stuff that traditionally has been hard.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:47.180]   The cameras, the trackpad, the screens, you're not running X config and it hurts on
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:48.180]   a mission, Leo.
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.180]   They get it done.
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:50.180]   It really works.
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:52.160]   I just tried something called Solus.
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.040]   I was up last night installing this.
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:58.360]   Their third version came out for somebody who's a Windows user going to Solus Linux,
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.480]   so LUS, would be completely transparent.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:06.760]   I use a version of Arch called Entergo's installed on my ThinkPad 470S.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:10.600]   The latest ThinkPad with KB Lake processor flawlessly.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:14.040]   And the thing is, it gives you some of the features that you like in the Mac, that I
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.040]   like in the Mac.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:19.280]   The all the languages, programming languages available, a command, a real command line,
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.200]   not this goofy Windows command line.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:27.080]   But I have to say the real problem is the lack of application software that I'm used
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.080]   to.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.080]   It's a great piece.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.080]   Creative Suite.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.080]   And I can't.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:34.080]   Cloud people are mostly insulated now, but everyone who wants to run to the metal still
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.080]   has that problem.
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.080]   That's true.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.240]   If you're running Chrome, no reason not to use Linux.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:42.320]   And I could set up Linux for somebody who's never used it, maybe using the Solus.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.320]   They would barely know it was Linux.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.320]   They would barely know.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.760]   They'd say, "Oh, it's a weird Windows, but I like it."
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:54.240]   But it also points out a unique advantage of the Mac that there, it's not like the Mac
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:59.160]   App Store is the most holy way to get software ever created.
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:02.720]   Talk to a developer if you want the counter-argument to that.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:07.600]   But I do, when I was, again, going back to the Lenovo and trying to get it set up the
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:12.640]   way I want, there is a Windows App Store, but it's woefully incomplete.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:16.480]   You still have to go to the Wild Wild West and find individual developer sites to get
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.960]   the apps that you want.
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:21.480]   I did miss the idea of, "Well, give me, I'm going to pull down the Apple menu.
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:24.920]   I'm going to go to the App Store and do a search for the type of app that I want."
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:30.560]   And I will probably find the thing that I want in this safe certified store, as opposed
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.880]   to Windows, where I will definitely find it, but I have to make sure that I don't get tricked
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:38.400]   into going to download.com where the code has been infested with that, where or anything
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.400]   like that.
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.720]   So it's kind of a mess.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.960]   I don't think between Linux, Windows, and Mac, I don't think there's any reflection of
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.720]   the ideal of computing.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:52.920]   I mean, there is no bigger nerd than me, but even I, I've got Linux, I love my Raspberry
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:59.080]   Pi, but it would take a lot for me to decide to switch to Linux because there's all those
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:03.560]   times where I just want to sit down, I just want to do the thing that I've set down this
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.480]   computer to do this computer with.
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:09.000]   I don't want to have to investigate which, when I was going to create this.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.440]   Well, modern Linux have stores, and they have update software.
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.800]   You don't really need to go to the command line.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:20.240]   Do me a favor before you send that X1 back.
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:23.920]   Just download in Teragos or Solos and put it on there and play with it for one day, and
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.080]   I just be curious what you think.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:28.960]   I think people have an impression of Linux, well, you do from the Raspberry Pi because
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:36.400]   you're using Raspbian, that the more modern install is, I would say, is absolutely on
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:39.760]   a par with OS X and Windows X.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:44.040]   But that's the other problem.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:49.200]   You have to ask yourself the question, okay, well, which version of Linux do I want?
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.920]   And then which window manager do I want?
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:51.920]   It's a nice choice.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:56.800]   So, well, yeah, you do want the ability to say I took this out of the box, I answered
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.680]   a few questions, and I'm up and running.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:04.160]   Try Solos, S-O-L-U-S-DashProject.com.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:11.200]   Install their default budgie desktop was designed to look like and feel like Windows.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:14.920]   I have a feeling it's very easy install, and I have a few.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:16.640]   You can boot it off a flash drive?
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.640]   Yep.
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:18.640]   Okay.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.080]   I've got I've got Debian running off a flash drive.
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:24.720]   Yeah, it's slow, of course, if you installed it on the X1.
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:33.760]   You see, and by the way, with TLP, I'm getting better battery life on my 2017 ThinkPad than
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:36.400]   I got with Windows.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.400]   So later load.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.720]   Well, it's partly a lighter load.
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:43.800]   It's partly what's really happened is that Intel has taken over much of these power management.
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.320]   A lot of this stuff has now moved into hardware.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:51.720]   So like the function keys to turn up the screen or turn up the volume, the operating
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.320]   system doesn't have to know about that.
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.960]   The hardware handles that all now.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.600]   So it looks exactly the same on any operating system.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:04.400]   The world is changing a little bit here, and I think desktop operating systems, your
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.360]   preconceived notions, I think, have changed.
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:09.160]   Not that I'm proselytizing or anything.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:13.760]   No, but that's like I'm fond of saying, I think that anytime you're going to spend more
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:18.360]   than a burritos worth of money on a piece of hardware, you really have to defend every
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.360]   dollar that you spend.
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:25.800]   So even if you're so thrilled with Windows or you're so thrilled with your Mac before
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:30.760]   you spend $1,000 or $2,000 on a new desktop or a new laptop because you spilled Diet
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:36.000]   Dr. Pepper on the keyboard of your old one, that's a good opportunity to look at the alternatives,
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.560]   even if you can't possibly be swayed into switching to Windows or switching to Mac,
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.040]   the fact that you took another look at Mac will remind you of the reasons why you like
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:49.840]   Windows and the reasons why you took a look at a Windows machine and said, but it's just
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.400]   not really very polished.
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:54.200]   And I really wish I had that sort of peak.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:09:00.280]   When I'm missing the simplest things, just the ability to, I've got pictures that I've
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:04.800]   put on the hard drive and I just want to tap the, I keep going to tap the space bar just
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.160]   to preview them and I can't do that on Windows.
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:11.240]   But there's a utility that I can get for that, like I'm looking for that utility.
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:15.360]   So again, always, always, always do not do something simply because you're in the habit
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:16.360]   of doing it.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:18.280]   You've got to know the reasons why you do the things that you do.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:22.800]   That is the key to surviving 20, 30, 40 to 80 years on this planet.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:28.840]   Well, as Guy Kawasaki said a long time ago, software sells hardware and I mostly use Macs
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:34.160]   because there's a couple of products that I need that only run on Macs.
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:39.160]   Now, those particular products in a few weeks are going to also be available on Windows.
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.880]   We're going to talk about that when we get to your picks and I'm going to tell you that
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.480]   will change your tone, won't it?
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.920]   It's very likely that one of these things is in my future.
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:51.840]   If you use Chrome or a creative cloud, it doesn't matter what OS is.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:59.000]   If you're using Adobe products, it's 99.9% the same exact experience.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.400]   Like using WeChat on the phone.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.400]   Yeah.
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.600]   I wish Adobe would make a Linux version.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.840]   By the way, another issue was raised.
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:06.160]   I read this blog post.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.440]   I think I found it in Hacker News this week from a guy called the Electric.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:14.280]   I'm sorry, eclectic light company, Mac, Mac's painting and more.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:21.920]   He raised a really good point, which is Apple has done a very poor job documenting Mac OS.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.440]   It's changing a lot.
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:26.280]   Remember in the early days of Mac, you had inside Macintosh.
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:31.600]   You had a six foot shelf of very detailed documentation on the API, all the calls, how
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.720]   it worked.
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:39.360]   But Apple, partly because I think it's changed so rapidly and there have been so many updates,
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:43.320]   but they just stopped documenting it.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.640]   That is a big problem.
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:49.120]   It's one of the things Microsoft does a lot better.
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:53.520]   Frankly, believe it or not, Linux does maybe best of all.
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:57.640]   The ARCH Linux wiki is amazing.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.360]   That's one of the reasons I like Linux because you get this great documentation.
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:01.360]   Do you agree, Renee?
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:06.440]   Do you feel like you've made your living documenting stuff Apple has not documented?
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:07.720]   Yeah, no, absolutely.
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.440]   They have gotten way better.
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.600]   They've been putting concerted effort over the last couple of years, but I think a lot
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.600]   of that has gone to iOS because it's just a much bigger platform for them.
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:19.800]   But developer.apple.com and the developer publishing group, they've done a lot of work
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:21.760]   to modernize those pages.
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:26.200]   If you remember a couple of back to a couple of years ago, that stuff was old.
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.520]   And now you're getting a lot more.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:30.440]   And it's updated a lot faster now and there's more of it, but I think it'll take them a
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:32.200]   while before they get through the backlog.
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:37.920]   He's particularly concerned about APFS, the new file system, which is barely documented.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:43.240]   And he also mentions, remember LaunchD was the key to Mac OS?
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:47.960]   Now he says a large proportion of tasks are scheduled and dispatched by something called
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:53.800]   DAS and CTS, which are barely even mentioned in Apple's latest developer documentation.
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:57.800]   A busy part of Mac OS, which doesn't even appear to have a name.
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.640]   And I think that that's a problem.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.640]   I think so.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.840]   I mean, a lot of it is a plan size.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:06.480]   Well they're proprietary, but that doesn't mean you can't document commands and how to
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:08.440]   use them and how they work.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:15.120]   I think I heard once from a guy that they're concerned that they're reverse engineering.
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.120]   Yeah.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:19.440]   They're that fanatical about protecting their deal.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:27.880]   And most of the users who use Apple products don't care if they know how LaunchD works
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:28.880]   or whether LaunchD works.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:30.400]   I think it's worth talking about.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:33.640]   The implementation detail to them is just you turn on your machine and that part should
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:34.640]   work.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.440]   But developers need to know it.
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:38.360]   And we power users need to know.
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:39.360]   Totally agree.
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.360]   Yeah.
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:43.040]   And I think it's just again, getting modernizing and getting it through that backlog of activity
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.040]   that they have.
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:48.240]   And most of the resources, like with the Mac App Store, go to the iOS counterpart because
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.800]   just this year's scale of that as a platform.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.800]   All right.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.560]   Let's take a little break.
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:59.200]   We're going to have more with Renee Ritchie and the Enoco scuporn.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.360]   Very nice to have you in studio.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.800]   Came all the way down to the Pacific Northwest.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.800]   You're going to go run back up for the clips on Monday?
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.720]   Well, for reasons different than you think.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.240]   I'm going to go back up.
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.160]   You don't want to see the sun go out?
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:18.800]   Really, I love the photograph, the stuff on the ground when the sun goes away because
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.200]   the light changes so much.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.880]   I don't point my camera at the sun.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.880]   Oh, that's smart.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:26.080]   I point my camera at the stuff on the ground because it's never going to look like that
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:27.080]   again.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:30.600]   And I don't want to be in the total eclipse because, oh yeah, it's dark and you can't
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:31.600]   use your camera.
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.080]   So you have a partial eclipse.
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:36.400]   A partial eclipse is perfect for what I want to do, which is I'm going to try to photograph
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:41.400]   some birds down in an estuary close to where I live with that weird light on them.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:42.800]   Do the birds act differently?
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:43.800]   Oh, they're going to go nuts.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:44.800]   They go nuts.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:49.040]   The birds are going to lose their tiny little bird brains over this.
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.840]   Because they get quiet all of a sudden.
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.280]   They don't know if it's night or what.
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.800]   Keep in mind that they, you know, birds, most people don't know this.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.920]   Birds actually navigate by the stars.
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:57.920]   Yeah.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:00.800]   It's been proven since the 1950s.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:03.520]   And if it goes dark, they start looking up and going, am I supposed to go somewhere?
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.520]   Where's the stars?
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:05.520]   Where's the idea?
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:06.600]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:08.080]   And then it's going to like undark again.
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:09.960]   They're going, well, that was kind of fast.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.640]   You know who else is going to go crazy?
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:12.640]   Dung beetles.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.640]   Dung beetles are going to lose their minds.
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.840]   They just, this is, I was reading this this morning.
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:21.160]   They just discovered the dung beetles navigate by the Milky Way.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:27.360]   So when a dung, when a dung beetle, and the way they found this out, they put little cardboard
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.760]   hats on them.
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:30.800]   I am not kidding.
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:34.840]   Dung beetles, when they roll a ball of dung, they, you found it.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.520]   How'd you find that so fast, Carson?
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.080]   They roll it in a straight line.
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.080]   Yeah.
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.080]   That's the shortest distance between two points.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.800]   But how do they know what a straight line is?
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.120]   During the day, I guess they can use the sun or whatever.
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:48.360]   But at night, which is most, there are nocturnal dung beetles.
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:52.560]   They went to the nocturnal dung beetles and they navigate by the Milky Way.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:57.720]   In fact, the straight lines parallel the line of the Milky Way and they put little hats
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:01.520]   on them and then they, and they, their lines went all crazy.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:06.160]   You know, the things you can learn on Macquarie Weekly, you can become a very well rounded
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.160]   individual with you, the show.
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:09.840]   I want a little cardboard dung beetle hat.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:10.840]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.840]   Huh?
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.840]   That's our title.
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:13.840]   Okay.
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:19.160]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:23.440]   If you are in the market for a new home, you know, one of the steps unless your Scott
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:27.520]   Bornrich is you got to get a mortgage.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.760]   You got to get a home loan.
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:32.120]   Merle, it always used to mock you.
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:33.120]   I know.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.000]   I miss the Yachtwax and all that.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.760]   You know, I, I, he drove me crazy, but I love it.
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:39.760]   I miss it.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:40.760]   I miss it.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:41.760]   We got to find, we got to find Merle.
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:44.640]   Is he, is he, is he like out of the witness protection program?
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.200]   I don't know what happened to him.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.600]   He's such a great guy.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:50.600]   But I think he didn't want to come on anymore because he said, well, I don't have anything
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:51.600]   to say.
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:52.600]   I said, you, it doesn't matter.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.200]   You always have something to add.
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:58.880]   Remember when we were at, at the house of prime rib and somebody ordered fish?
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:00.280]   I'll just leave that memory.
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:01.800]   I totally remember that.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:04.040]   I will never forget that.
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:07.440]   But you'll just have to imagine our show.
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:10.960]   All I'm saying is if you're having, if you're, I have a dinner with Merlin man at the house
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.760]   of prime rib, do not order salad.
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:14.960]   Do not order fish.
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:18.320]   Do not order anything but meat.
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.560]   You'll be called something akin to a cat.
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:21.560]   It's house of prime.
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:22.560]   You ordered the prime.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:23.560]   The prime.
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:24.560]   Anyway, I showed it.
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:27.600]   They brought to you by rocket mortgage.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:33.280]   If you are like me, you need a home loan to buy a home or maybe you have a home and you're
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.280]   looking at a refi.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.200]   I want to point you in the right direction.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:40.820]   The best mortgage lender in the country, quickenloans.com and you just look at those JD power customer
[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:41.820]   satisfaction awards.
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:46.440]   And I mean, I'm not making this up for seven years running number one in customer satisfaction
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:47.800]   and loan origination.
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:51.400]   I think for the last four years, number one in loan servicing.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:54.080]   I mean, they really are beloved.
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:57.400]   They've created a product that makes me love me more because it's for people like me.
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.640]   It's for the geeks in all of us.
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:02.720]   A home loan approval process is entirely online.
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:08.760]   You do the entire thing on your phone, even like the papers, paperwork that you would
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:13.160]   normally have to go to the attic to get to check stubs or pay stubs or your bank statements
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:17.080]   or whatever that all is submitted to online automatically.
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.080]   Quickenloans has trusted partners with everybody.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:23.720]   So all you have to do is say, yes, send a, you know, tell your bank, yes, send them the
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.360]   information they need.
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.520]   And then because it's all online, it's all computerized.
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:31.920]   There's no human there, you know, crunching the numbers on a, I always imagine them on
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:32.920]   one of those calculators.
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:38.080]   You have to pull the handle to get it to go to do, to do, to do, to do, to do.
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.080]   I don't have to imagine it.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:40.080]   That was it.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:45.080]   Literally our loan officer had a calculator with amortization tables built in.
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:46.080]   It was going to help.
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:48.840]   I think you're much, no, you don't have to do that anymore.
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:50.880]   They did a whole thing is on the screen.
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:56.400]   The, the APR, the monthly payments, the term of the loan, and they calculate what you're
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:02.480]   eligible for in seconds based on income assets and credit, they're going to give you all
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:07.480]   the home loan options for which you qualify almost, almost instantly, a minute or two,
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:09.040]   which means you can do it at an open house.
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.640]   You could say, I want to buy this house.
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.400]   Honey, let's get this house.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.400]   We don't have a loan.
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.400]   No problem.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:19.640]   Go to rocket mortgage.com/macbreak and you will know minutes later what loans the right
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:20.640]   for you.
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:25.400]   The whole idea is to apply simply to understand fully, make this completely a transparent
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:28.920]   process for you and then mortgage confidently.
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:34.160]   Rocket mortgage.com/macbreak, equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.760]   access.org number 30, 30.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:36.760]   I do though.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.120]   I'm going to call them.
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:41.360]   I want them to add some sound effects.
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:45.280]   So go, you don't want it to calculate.
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:46.280]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:52.000]   That would be rocket sounds rocket mortgage.com/macbreak.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.920]   If the burden of applying for a home loan with rocket mortgage, equal housing lender licensed
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:01.520]   in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org number 30, 30 and we thank them for their support
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:02.520]   of Mac.
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:10.360]   Don't they just have like mortgage minus one, square go for mortgage, mortgage, or engine?
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:11.360]   That'd be awesome.
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:15.880]   All right, seeds and stems.
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:20.520]   The news stories that sank to the bottom of the pile this week.
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.520]   Are we going to talk LTE too?
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:24.520]   Because LTE watch.
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:25.520]   Two more.
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:26.520]   Two more.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:31.360]   Yeah, KGI NCNVC Leo and the same form factor, which means I'm not going to be crying weeping
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.120]   for all my lost bands at the bottom of the pile.
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:34.760]   I saw that yet.
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:40.920]   I wonder if you're going to add an LTE radio to a watch and not increase the battery capacity.
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.360]   How's that going to work?
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:46.800]   So I mean, they were really smart with GPS because GPS was a huge drain on batteries traditionally.
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:50.680]   But what they did is just arrange it to be super smart so that it would only sip GPS.
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:55.160]   Like when your arm broke the surface of the water, it would take a GPS hit or whenever
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:57.600]   you did a certain amount of movement, it would do a GPS hit.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.800]   And what I'm hoping is, I mean, there are certain things that they won't be able to
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:00.800]   avoid.
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:03.480]   Maybe they could do low bandwidth or something for things like streaming music.
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:06.680]   But a lot of times it just needs to do periodic calls to make sure that certain amounts of
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:10.440]   data are up to date, preloading that into your watch because you already have that intelligence
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:13.000]   scheduling system and that lets you go on your way.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.240]   So I'm sure it will be a hit, but I'm hoping they manage the amount of hit as best they
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:17.240]   can.
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:25.400]   Zach, five Mac says they'll same form factor, 38 millimeter, 42 millimeter, the non obvious
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:26.800]   change from the existing.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:27.960]   Yeah, it's Ming Chi Quo.
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:28.960]   That's KGI.
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:29.960]   Okay.
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:30.960]   Yeah.
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:36.000]   John Gruber also at a firing fireball.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.840]   He hinted to be a new form factor, but he then said no, not this time.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:41.840]   Gruber's well connected.
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:42.840]   Go ahead.
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:43.840]   There's always future form factors.
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:44.840]   Yeah.
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:45.840]   Alex.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:51.000]   I was just going to say that what I don't even think it necessarily needs to be an LTE
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000]   radio.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.240]   They can do a 4G or even a 3G radio in there for all the things that would benefit actually
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:02.320]   benefit and a watch, which is not going to be necessarily streaming that you're not
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.040]   going to be streaming video on this thing.
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:07.360]   You're not going to be downloading racing games on this thing.
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:12.800]   Really most of what this is going to be done for used for is for iMessage, mostly text
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:19.240]   and emojis at that for communicating fitness data and position data live.
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:24.160]   These are not things that you necessarily need LTE speeds for.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:30.560]   So I have no insight information and we're getting this from sources that are usually
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:35.840]   pretty good with rumors, especially this close to what we expect to be a launch date.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:41.880]   But it bears thinking that even if we're thinking about LTE, LTE on a watch doesn't need to
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:44.280]   mean the same thing as LTE on a phone.
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:46.240]   Actually, I was thinking about that.
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:48.960]   It says no 3G, only LTE.
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:49.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:53.040]   So the logic that I heard and we can sort of toss it around and see if it makes sense
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:54.040]   is two things.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:57.880]   One is for power efficiency, you need to have ubiquity of network.
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:01.720]   Anytime the radio can't reach the network is where it starts to increase power and waste
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:02.880]   a lot of it.
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:07.720]   So if the LTE networks are better rolled out than 3G or 4G networks, then it is a power
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:10.800]   savings and also LTE allows for much better race to sleep.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.720]   So you can turn the radio on, get the data, you need to turn it off really fast, which
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:17.520]   allows it not to consume as much power as it would have had to stay on longer to transmit
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.520]   the same amount of data.
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:23.040]   Well, I don't know, 3 weeks.
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:25.800]   I presume this will all be enough.
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:28.480]   This isn't going to be the year they have two events.
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:32.400]   They only do two when they absolutely have to because it's a lot more work for them and
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.360]   for people who have to go to the events.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:35.360]   Right.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:39.520]   I expect we'll hear a little bit about the iMac Pro.
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.920]   They pre-announced that at WWDC.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:44.000]   Did they say at that time when they thought the iMac was?
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   They said this year, right?
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000]   Yeah, end of year.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   Okay.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.280]   So that would be appropriate to mention that.
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:51.800]   There's 19 people, I think, who pre-ordered that.
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:55.760]   How many people outside Apple?
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:56.760]   All 19 of them are pretty good.
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.600]   How about would you like a new Mac Pro?
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:02.840]   They did say next year we're sorry about the old Mac Pro.
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.560]   The next year we got a new one.
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:05.560]   It's interesting.
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:15.000]   We're starting to see Geekbench results that are labeled Mac Pro, not iMac Pro, but Mac Pro.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:20.880]   They're using the new Intel i9, which is still a Skylake processor, but it's one of those
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:23.560]   18 core.
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:26.240]   It's the Corex processors.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:29.560]   You'd think they'd know better than to Geekbench at at this point.
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:30.560]   Yeah.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.000]   Because that just gives it away, doesn't it?
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000]   Yeah.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000]   I think it's bogus.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.520]   You think it's just somebody.
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:39.560]   I think it's an interesting data point.
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.800]   I don't think it's terribly significant.
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:45.680]   It's from a user named Surfin China.
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:48.800]   I would just bet the ranch on Surfin China.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.800]   Surfin China.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:52.080]   It's identified as a Mac Pro 6,1.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:54.840]   Renee, is that a new model, right?
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:55.880]   I would have to check what yours is.
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:58.280]   I don't remember the names of the iPro models.
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:01.760]   If yours is 5.1, then we're in business.
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:06.160]   I don't know how easy it is to spoof Geekbench, but this seems to have a lot of detail on
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:08.160]   it that I don't know.
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:11.080]   I mean, it's possible they're manufacturing when someone got a hold of it in the factory
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:14.680]   and ran Geekbench not realizing that everything that Geekbench does, I believe by default,
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.160]   gets sucked up to their server.
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:17.160]   Right.
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:23.600]   32 gigs of DDR4-21-33 megahertz RAM in this one.
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:31.680]   It's the sixth generation, but new 18, I think, no, 10 cores in this case, 20 threads.
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:32.680]   I9 processor.
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:38.400]   Well, also, if they are talking about 2018 for release of the iMac Pro, this could be
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:42.480]   the stage at which they make a bunch of them for testing and for deep, steep, soaked testing
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:43.480]   purposes.
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:47.560]   Maybe there's a batch of a couple hundred that they're just cooking out.
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:50.680]   Once again, someone just decided to fire up and put it on Geekbench.
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:56.960]   This is definitely, I would be shocked if this was not as dumb as leaving an iMac Pro
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:59.960]   behind in a German bar at Jeff Fusco.
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.960]   Pod home pods from where?
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:06.360]   Somebody's saying the sixth one is the trashcan model, so it wouldn't be a new model, but
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.520]   that is a new processor.
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:09.520]   So I don't know.
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:10.520]   We'll see.
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:14.640]   Maybe this is just surfing China as a smart cookie.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:18.040]   I got just this morning as I sat down to do iOS today.
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:23.920]   I got beta 5 of iOS 11 and it's going out across the board.
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:26.280]   Anything, what Renee is new in beta 5?
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:30.440]   I'm losing track because one of the things when you're reviewing something, it's just
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:31.440]   got beta 4 less.
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:34.880]   I believe in beta 4 they started fixing the big things that are bothering me, which is
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.240]   like the notifications you couldn't swipe to access notifications anymore.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.240]   And that was super annoying.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:44.280]   And I think since the last beta, you could now swipe to open or swipe to clear individual
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.360]   notifications on the lock screen.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:49.520]   So it sort of reminds me of iOS 7 where people are like, "No, no, too thin, too thin!"
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:51.440]   And they slightly, they can defon.
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.160]   They're fixing a lot of little things.
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:56.200]   They're fixing bugs, of course, but they're also changing UI things that I think people
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.120]   have found the most egregious.
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:00.240]   One thing was disappointing when I had to beta 5.
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:02.440]   But remember, you're on a beta.
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:07.000]   This is not the, is that now it says my smart keyboard is not supported.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.680]   I'm using the Logitech Slim Combo.
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:11.520]   This accessory is not supported as soon as I can.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:14.880]   I got that with a lightning cable on one of the betas and I just had to keep on plugging
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:15.880]   and plugging it in.
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:18.680]   But it's one of those people, someone today tweeted me and said, "I know you always say
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:21.640]   you can never trust any beta, but can I trust this one?"
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:23.200]   No, no, not this one either.
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:24.200]   Because the next one could be terrible.
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:26.680]   No matter how good this one is, the next one could be terrible.
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:31.000]   If you're asking the question, don't beta.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:36.360]   So Megan says I'm a dope, but was this capability always in there?
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:41.720]   Now when you swipe up, you can swipe up to get the task manager instead of just double
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:42.720]   tapping.
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:47.440]   Yeah, so you swipe up once to get the new Doc to check up from the bottom to get.
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:48.440]   I forget what they call it.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.080]   I think it's still the app switcher, but yeah, and you get all your saved spaces and
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.840]   your app windows and your control center.
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:53.840]   When did they re-add that?
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.840]   Because that was something that kind of bugged me.
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:00.600]   I'm so used to doing that swipe up instead of the double tap.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:02.360]   I don't like the double tap because it's a physical tap.
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:03.440]   I never did a double tap.
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:04.440]   I was always swiping.
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:06.040]   So they didn't take it out?
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:07.120]   I just didn't know it.
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:10.440]   I was double swiping, so I don't know if that's a false positive or not.
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:15.000]   I would swipe up to get the menu and the dock and then I'd swipe up again to get control
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000]   side.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.240]   And then the world's dopiest app store icon.
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:22.760]   It looks like a campground symbol.
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:26.560]   It looks like a bench at the campground or something.
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:27.560]   It's free.
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:30.240]   How to make your fire with sticks.
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:31.680]   Yeah, I see that.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:32.920]   It's very, very reliable.
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:36.880]   When I wake up and I check Twitter for the first time, I know that there's a new beta
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:42.120]   or a new OS release when most of my feed is people complaining about a new icon or that
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:45.000]   the calculator buttons are now round and that's zicking to them.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.880]   It's little stuff like that.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:48.120]   Any big stuff?
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.960]   The Maps icon now shows the Apple Park.
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:54.040]   I think that's pretty cool.
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:55.640]   I mean, I would do that if I were Apple.
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:58.240]   That's not functionality change.
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:03.160]   So show that again, Carson, because I'm looking at it.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:04.160]   So now it's got...
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:05.160]   Oh, I get it.
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:06.160]   There's a ring there.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:07.160]   I get it.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:08.160]   Okay.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:14.560]   So now it's still 280, which is the highway that goes right by the Apple campus, the interstate.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:17.120]   But now it's got a circle there, which is obviously...
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:25.320]   If you spent like a chazillion billion dollars on your ring, you want to show off the ring.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:26.680]   You know, there'll be a few little things.
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:33.400]   I feel like the fact that they did these two four and five in such rapid cadence implies
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.400]   to me they're very close.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:41.920]   Usually that kind of velocity either indicates that there was a huge Titanic problem with
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:44.240]   the last one or they're now at the...
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:48.160]   Okay, all the stuff that we were putting off because it was an easy cosmetic fix.
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:51.200]   Now that we know that we don't have an all hands on deck situation, let's wrap this
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:54.720]   up, figure out what we're going to fix, what we're not going to fix, and then ship this
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:55.720]   thing.
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:56.720]   Was there not a rumor?
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:00.560]   I'm looking for it and I don't see it that they would have it out on the day of the eclipse
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:02.440]   next Monday, the final.
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:03.440]   Is that...
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:04.440]   Am I crazy?
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:09.760]   I'm not sure that they wouldn't expect the eclipse to delay a couple of days.
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:14.200]   Usually they'll put out a version and then they'll stop updating it.
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:18.240]   For a few weeks and people start to get nervous but it's just because the Gold Master is ready
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:19.240]   for the event.
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:20.240]   It's lost.
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:25.640]   So yeah, normally they would ship iOS 11 either at the event or at the release of the event.
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:29.000]   The Gold Master usually comes out at the event because it includes things that are specific
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.960]   to the hardware that they're showing up the first time.
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:34.960]   The developers then have a couple of weeks and then it comes out usually two days before
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:35.960]   the new phones are released.
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:40.200]   So the people have time to download it, sort of stage the download before the new...
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:44.160]   So did I dream that it was going to come out on Monday or did there was there...
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:45.160]   Huh?
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:46.160]   Android O.
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:48.920]   Oh, Android O, that's it.
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:50.720]   I'm doing too many shows.
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:52.200]   I have to stop.
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:53.200]   Android O.
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:54.200]   Thank you, Dora.
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:55.200]   Thank you, Dora.
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:56.200]   Thank you, Dora.
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:57.200]   Thank you, Dora.
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.200]   Is it Oreo or Rangutang?
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:29:59.200]   Ocelot, Octopus, I don't...
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:00.200]   I don't know.
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:01.200]   Oranginos.
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:04.200]   If a phone comes out during the eclipse, maybe they'll call it Android Eclipse.
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:05.200]   Uh oh.
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:06.200]   Oh.
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.200]   Oh.
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.200]   (laughs)
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:09.200]   Android O.
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:10.200]   I like that.
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:11.200]   I like that.
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:12.200]   Okay, that's right.
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.200]   Okay, so iOS 11.
[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.200]   I was just confused.
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:17.440]   iOS 11, much more likely to come out in about a month during the...
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:19.720]   And then what will the Galaxy Note ship with?
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:21.720]   Oh, that's a good question.
[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:22.720]   Oh.
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:23.720]   (laughs)
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:24.720]   Oh, that's a good question.
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:25.720]   Maybe that's the name of it.
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.720]   Android O.
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:27.720]   That's a good question.
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:28.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:29.720]   Probably not with O.
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:30.720]   Probably with N.
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:32.720]   As the Halt and Ketch Fire Edition.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:33.720]   (laughs)
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:38.160]   Well spoken as an iPhone advocate.
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:39.920]   I can't help myself.
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:40.920]   (laughs)
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:46.880]   Actually, if you're keeping track, I think Android just went ahead in the malware score.
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:53.280]   They've discovered in the Android Store another significant malware exploit that was in 100
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.280]   or more applications.
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:55.280]   They've killed them.
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:57.640]   Fuchsia will fix everything, Leo, which is waiting for Fuchsia.
[01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:59.240]   Fuchsia, it's all about Fuchsia.
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:00.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:01.240]   The fortune...
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:02.240]   The future is Fuchsia.
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:03.240]   The future is Fuchsia.
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:08.840]   Apple's iPhone 8 facial recognition tech may support, according to Apple Insider, Apple
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:13.000]   Pay 3rd Party Apps and multi-biometrics.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000]   What is multi-biometric?
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.600]   You're going to scan your retina there.
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:16.600]   Scan the retina.
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:17.600]   I think there's a lot of...
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:21.680]   I don't think there was panic, but there was a lot of concern before Touch ID was released
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:25.000]   because we had those little rolling fingerprint sensors and people didn't really like them.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.440]   They didn't have great experiences.
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:28.040]   I think this is similar.
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:31.280]   Apple, it's hard to tell what's actually going to ship or not.
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:35.920]   You have to wait for the product, but this technology is really mature now and you have
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:36.920]   infrared.
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:37.920]   You have laser.
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:38.920]   It's a little bit more than low light.
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:39.920]   It can work in normal light.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:40.920]   It can differentiate twins.
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:41.920]   People are paranoid.
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:42.920]   They don't know.
[01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:43.920]   My twin can unlock my phone.
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:45.200]   First, get a better relationship with your twin.
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:51.240]   But also, no, because there's all sorts of differences that it grew over time when you
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:56.960]   scan a detail at a granular level, even between twins, from acne patterns to the negative
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:58.600]   space between different...
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:00.840]   Anyways, the science is pretty good on this.
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:03.800]   They take a picture, but they do a scan.
[01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:04.800]   They match the point.
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:06.920]   They create math the same way they do with Touch ID.
[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:10.320]   They store it in a secure enclave and they release a token.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:14.880]   If you do have anxiety over it, just wait until you see the demos and people start using
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:15.880]   it.
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:17.080]   I think a lot of the anxiety will be alleviated.
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:18.080]   I love the idea.
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:23.000]   If multi-biometrics means this, add your choice.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.440]   If you want to have it super secure, that you both have to have face recognition and
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:27.440]   fingerprint.
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:28.440]   I always wanted that.
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:29.440]   Pin plus Touch ID.
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:30.440]   I think Enterprise would love that.
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:32.040]   It'd be superb.
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:33.720]   Then you really would have a secure phone.
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:34.720]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:35.720]   I'm sorry.
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:41.960]   I'm super concerned about Face ID being given parity with Touch ID.
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:47.280]   If you're in a sketchy situation, particularly with law enforcement, you just handed over
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:48.880]   your phone saying, "Oh, yeah, that's fine.
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:49.880]   I blocked it."
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:52.720]   Then would they just go this in front of your face and they won't lock it?
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:53.720]   No.
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:58.760]   Because it's basically the law is getting behind the idea that, again, the fingerprint, you
[01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:03.800]   don't have a right to not give a fingerprint, do you have the right to go like this if Johnny
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:07.120]   Law wants to try to unlock your phone by simply looking at you?
[01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:11.960]   I'd have to presume that as is today, you could say, "Do not use biometrics.
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:12.960]   Use a password."
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:15.080]   There's two different...
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:18.000]   I'm just saying this is something that's unprecedented.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:21.400]   We haven't ever had this technology before.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:25.880]   Just like as Renee wrote so nicely on IMOR, "Don't ever buy the revision A motherboard
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:26.880]   of anything.
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:30.760]   I will never buy revision A or revision B of any security system before I see..."
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.560]   Don't turn it on.
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:33.560]   Yeah.
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:37.280]   The list comes from that HomePod firmware.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:38.280]   It's not exactly a leak.
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:40.440]   Apple put the HomePod firmware on a surface.
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:41.440]   It was a mistake.
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:42.440]   It was a mistake.
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:46.080]   There's a lot of code in people who have been parsing that code.
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:53.640]   Apparently, Pearl is the code name or the variable name that refers to the Face ID.
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:55.680]   That you couldn't tell me it was written in Pearl.
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:57.560]   I don't think so.
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:58.560]   Pretty sure not.
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:05.800]   A.X. resting Pearl unlock is one of the functions and the implication is resting means that
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:06.800]   the phone...
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:10.320]   We'd heard rumors that the phone might be able to face recognition from a prone position.
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:11.320]   It's not you the phone.
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:14.720]   The other thing, like to Andy's point, that is a really big concern.
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:15.720]   You have two realities.
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:18.160]   You have the reality on the street and the reality on the court.
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:20.440]   We've already seen that with Touch ID where people either...
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:21.640]   They took it from a corpse.
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:24.520]   They took it from someone who was sleeping, someone who was unconscious and drunk.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.760]   They forced your hand onto the sensor.
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:28.280]   What happens at that level?
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:31.520]   It's hard to control and then you have whether that holds up in court or not.
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:35.400]   I imagine the same thing will happen with Face ID and maybe with other biometrics like
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:37.400]   gate analysis and voice ID.
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:38.400]   Well, and Samsung's...
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:40.880]   S8 has face unlock.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:41.880]   Not very easy to use.
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:43.880]   You have to hold it up and align your eyes.
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:48.600]   You have to choose in advance, whether it's the iris scan or the face scan.
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:51.440]   Of course, iris is much more effective.
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:57.160]   The iris scan has been the hackers at the KS computer club in Berlin figured out how
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:01.960]   you could fake that with a picture with a photo that you take from many feet away with
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:05.480]   a telephoto lens of somebody's eyes, you can then make it work.
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:09.400]   I love the idea of double because you get the eyes but you still don't have the finger
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.400]   marker.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:11.400]   Or a multi-factor.
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:12.400]   I have to have my Apple watch on as well.
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.800]   I love all those capabilities.
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:19.800]   I have to say as the months go by, I'm more inclined to turn off all kinds of biometrics
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:26.360]   and just use a super long unlock code even though it's going to be inconvenient.
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:29.880]   I'm concerned about that sort of stuff.
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:35.800]   We believe although the courts haven't really said this definitively but we believe a password
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:41.920]   is treated as something you know and therefore protected as opposed to your face.
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:43.160]   There's some defolation.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:46.120]   I think there was one court who said that they could compel you to put it in but not
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:49.960]   watch you do it so they couldn't get the code but they could force you to put it in.
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:52.040]   It's a very sketchy frontier.
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.560]   It's fluid still.
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:58.440]   There is a better defense against a password than there is against a fingerprint.
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:02.160]   It's accepted because you're required to give your fingerprint when you are booked.
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:05.600]   You're required to give them a hair sample if they wanted to DNA.
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:07.600]   I still think that's just accepted.
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:08.960]   These are such personal devices.
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:12.040]   There was an article about how these are basically bionics.
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:16.920]   They are your extended brain and they should have every bit of protection.
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:20.800]   More than spousal, clerical or loyally privilege, it should be 100% privilege that it is an
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:24.520]   extension of your brain and you have the right not to incriminate yourself because otherwise
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:25.640]   they lose all utility.
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:27.000]   I like the word clerical.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.160]   I want to…
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:29.160]   Clerical.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:31.760]   I don't know what you meant to say but clerical sounds good.
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:32.760]   Clerical.
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:34.600]   It's like clerical plus surgical.
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:36.600]   It's clerical.
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.600]   I don't word so good, Leo.
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:39.600]   I'm a clergy.
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:44.240]   No, but it's something that as a society we're going to have to…
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:47.200]   There's going to be all these issues with technology that we're going to have to face
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:49.320]   that we just don't have precedent for.
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:50.320]   Get ready.
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:51.320]   This is nothing compared to…
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:55.760]   I've been saying this a couple of weeks that compared to the biology revolution that's
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.320]   going to come here any minute now.
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:02.040]   CRISPR is this close to becoming a technology it's widely used.
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:05.640]   If you can do gene editing on live humans…
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:08.040]   Can I edit my genes after the fact?
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:09.040]   Yes.
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:10.040]   I'm interested.
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:11.040]   Exactly.
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:15.000]   The episode of Star Trek where the fluid bio creatures were more powerful than the Borg.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000]   Right.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.600]   Well, you can edit babies in vitro in the womb.
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:25.160]   I just want to edit out my desire to eat massive quantities of chocolate.
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:26.160]   Me too.
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:27.160]   Yes.
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.160]   That's what I want to do.
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:29.160]   Chocolate everything.
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:30.160]   I just want to say…
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:31.160]   So Scott, you want to edit so that vegetables taste like chocolate.
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:32.160]   There you go.
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:33.160]   I'll take that.
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:34.160]   I'll take it.
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:35.160]   I'll take it.
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:36.160]   No, I don't like this chocolate but boy broccoli.
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:38.960]   Can you imagine the new app store for this?
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:43.360]   I think if we're a possible natural selection would have already done this.
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:49.640]   Why… if all this stuff is so good for you, shouldn't you crave it?
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:51.200]   Why is it better with butter?
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:53.400]   Well, isn't that it was scarce?
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.320]   Like fat and sugar were scarce resources.
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:56.320]   Yeah.
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:57.320]   We learned to initiate them more.
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:58.320]   Yeah.
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:05.520]   I'm reading a wonderful book actually listening to it's unaudible called "Sapiens" by Harari.
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:11.320]   One of the things he says is, "If you were a hunter-gatherer and you found a fig tree,
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:14.880]   we're going to eat all the figs before the baboon tribe comes along and wipes them off
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:15.880]   the tree.
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:16.880]   You just have to.
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:17.880]   Yeah.
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:19.880]   The problem is we've got fig trees in our refrigerator now.
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:21.720]   We've got everything in our refrigerator.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:25.000]   And so you clear it out in case the baboon tribes in the age of all…
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.120]   Our biology didn't look all of as fast as our society.
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:29.120]   This is a good book by the way.
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:30.440]   I really, I really enjoying it.
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:32.960]   You follow Nora Noah Harari.
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:34.160]   That should be my pick of the week.
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:36.840]   We'll get to your picks of the week actually in just a second.
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:37.840]   And I'm…
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:39.120]   I know people are saying, "But wait it.
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:42.400]   You haven't asked Scott Borne what he does to make such beautiful pictures."
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:43.400]   That's going to be your pick.
[01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:44.400]   All right.
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:45.400]   I've decided.
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:47.040]   I have made a unilateral decision.
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:48.040]   You must reveal…
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:49.840]   You're the hero, the host of the show.
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:53.040]   You reveal to the world how he does it.
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:54.040]   It's a secret.
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:55.040]   Damn it.
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:57.040]   In just a moment.
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:58.440]   Oh, you mean you have to have talent?
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:38:59.440]   Oh crap.
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:01.960]   Our show today brought to you by Legal Zoom.
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:05.280]   This is actually something everybody needs.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:08.760]   It is National Make a Will Month.
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:10.480]   So now if you haven't done this…
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:13.480]   And I know young people, young parents, new parents…
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:14.760]   This is something maybe you've…
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:17.920]   I probably should do this, but you're young, you're healthy, you feel good, you probably
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:18.920]   don't…
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:19.920]   I don't want to think about a Will.
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:20.920]   Do it.
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:21.920]   Prepare for your family's future.
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:23.400]   And the thing is it's so easy.
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:24.400]   If you…
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:27.720]   Legal Zoom wants you to do it so badly, they have put together a free estate planning kit
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:31.080]   that you can get just by going to LegalZoom.com/prepare.
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:35.200]   This is at no cost to you.
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:39.680]   Just prepare for your family's future with the most important thing you'll do this summer.
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:42.240]   You go to LegalZoom.com/prepare.
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:43.360]   You're going to get information.
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:46.440]   You are going to get discounts on LegalZoom products.
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:48.640]   So of course, they want you to use it.
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:50.560]   And I'll tell you what, we did our wills.
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:51.560]   Lisa and I got the kit.
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:53.440]   And it really is a great way to do your will.
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:59.000]   If you want to do a living trust, you probably should also do durable power of medical attorney.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.560]   That's really important.
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:05.560]   The only thing you need is in this kit, give you all the tools, whether it's a will or
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:12.000]   a trust, plus an estate plan checklist, an e-book, special discounts at LegalZoom.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.080]   Now I want to tell you LegalZoom is not a law firm.
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:15.920]   That's actually the good part.
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:18.480]   They're not going to charge you $450 an hour.
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:20.240]   They're not a law firm.

[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:34.200]   And that saved me a lot of money.
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:37.760]   But there are times you need to ask a question of attorney and LegalZoom has put together
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:43.280]   a network of attorneys in all 50 states at pre-negotiated flat rate fees.

[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:17.240]   We thank them so much for their support and for helping me create Twit way back.
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:18.240]   Way back.
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:19.440]   Way in 2005.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:22.320]   Let's do our picks of the week.
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:23.760]   I'm going to end with you, Scott.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:24.760]   Don't feel bad.
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:25.760]   Not so fun.
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:29.880]   I'm going to start with Andy and Akko, your pick of the week.
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:33.760]   Maybe you're muted or are we muted Andy or is he muted Andy?
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:35.160]   Hey, muted.
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:38.360]   Sorry, I had some saltines.
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:39.360]   I didn't want to.
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:43.000]   I was wondering what that crunching and nibbling was.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000]   All right.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.320]   Oh, no, don't don't don't skip lunch, kids.
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:47.680]   Doesn't matter how this matter how busy you are.
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:49.440]   Don't skip lunch before a podcast.
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:51.840]   Yeah, two quick ones.
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:56.160]   One is Ulysses, a tech editor for iOS and Mac that we've all recommended before.
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:57.360]   We've all loved before.
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:01.080]   I'm reminding everybody that's a really, really awesome app.
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:07.840]   It is sort of like it's the two best work processes for Mac and for iOS, to me, are
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:09.680]   Scrivener and Ulysses.
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:13.720]   Scrivener is when you really need the atomic writing tool.
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:19.160]   Ulysses is if you like what Scrivener does, being able to collect lots of documents and
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:22.760]   research together in a pile, but you don't want something quite as complicated.
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:26.400]   And I want to sing a lot Ulysses this week because they changed their pricing model to
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:27.400]   a subscription model.
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:30.920]   They're getting a little bit of flack, actually a lot of flack for it from a lot of quarters.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:34.040]   And I really want to say that I absolutely support them.
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:39.840]   They're doing a switch to a model where it's $5 a month or $40 a year, which to me, this
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:44.240]   is professional level software that you use to make money and to make your life better
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:47.560]   and easier and to be more productive and to be more creative.
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:51.760]   And if this is what they have to do to make sure that they can continue to pay themselves,
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:56.200]   continue to make their living and continue to support and improve Ulysses, I'm 100%
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:57.200]   for that.
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:00.560]   $40 a year is cheap for a piece of software of this quality.
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:07.920]   So I'm sometimes just I'm it's not like I'm pleased that I have to spend $40 a year
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:10.200]   instead of just $20 and you won't it.
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:15.760]   But I'm pleased if I can pay this money and as an active gratitude towards people doing
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:19.680]   a tool that solves problems in my life that I rely on, I don't think that's an outrageous
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:20.680]   demand.
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:26.120]   And I'm kind of bothered that people are complaining about it and talking about it as though
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:29.760]   this is part of a really awful trend that they wish they could stamp out.
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:31.680]   The other thing I want to mention is sling TV.
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:34.800]   I canceled my cable subscription last year.
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:39.600]   And one of the reasons why I was able to do that was because sling.com basically all
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:44.000]   the channels that I would have missed really missed out on, I can just get streaming on
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.840]   my Apple TV or on my phone or on pretty much from my Roku any device that I want.
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:52.440]   They just today announced a brand new feature.
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:55.520]   Normally you need an app to stream all these cable channels.
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:58.560]   Now you can just do it through any Chrome browser or window.
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:03.440]   So really anything you've got will work perfectly fine through this.
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:06.280]   I've had the service for about a year, year and a half now.
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:08.160]   It's worked great for me.
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.080]   It's not just live TV.
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:16.120]   It's also like if you go to the Food Network you won't just get the Food Channel live.
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:20.240]   You will also get like chopped the last two or three episodes that you can just tunnel
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:22.760]   down to and here the last three episodes are available.
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:26.240]   So it kind of also made up for not having a DVR anymore.
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:30.040]   I bought the record something if I could simply stream it on demand as long as I remember
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:31.760]   sometimes the next two or three years.
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:36.760]   So it's a great service and it's become better by virtue of the fact that now I don't have
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:38.680]   to worry about having support for an app.
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:40.920]   I can just simply drop it into Windows and it works great.
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:42.560]   It's only the Chrome browser right now.
[01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:43.760]   It's only a beta right now.
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:46.680]   But I would expect that they there's no special plug in.
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:47.880]   You don't have to download anything.
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:49.600]   It's just simply open web standards.
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:53.440]   So I'd be surprised if it doesn't come to Safari and other browsers very soon.
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:58.520]   We should mention that if you are as I am an existing Ulysses owner you have to download
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:04.000]   a new app and it will walk you through a 50% discount for the annual which makes it what
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.600]   20 bucks a year which is I think not a lot.
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:10.040]   Yeah, if you use the app it's worth it.
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:12.240]   There are a lot of apps that I'm in the category.
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:16.240]   If there were a button that would cause them to receive a box of money from me I would click
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:17.240]   that button.
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:19.240]   I'm in that category.
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:20.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:21.240]   I'm getting 25%.
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:24.400]   I thought they said 50 but I'm getting 25% off.
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:28.240]   So it's $29.99 a year, $250 a month.
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:29.240]   So that's not bad.
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:34.320]   I guess I'm a I don't know maybe I paid for it so long ago maybe I don't get the 50%
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:35.320]   off.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:39.280]   Yeah, I mean I'm embarrassed at times like these because I try to be very careful and
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:43.440]   make sure that anything whether it's hardware or software that I use professionally or personally
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:46.400]   after I'm after I done reviewing it I have to like buy a copy of it.
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:48.280]   Other times where I'm like why can't upgrade?
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:52.400]   Oh, that's right because you've been using a free copy you got for years ago and you
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:53.560]   forgot to pay for it.
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:55.240]   Yeah, I try to pay for this stuff.
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:58.800]   So actually I'm restoring purchases now it's still $30.
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:02.400]   So I guess that's the cost but $30 a year is not for something you use.
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:06.480]   And by the way that includes iOS and desktop app.
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:14.040]   And the transparency between the two the ability to flip between an iPad Pro and your desktop
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:18.480]   is just so simple and so quick that it really is a power tool.
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:24.760]   It is a it is a force expander a force multiplier for people who have to take words out of your
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:28.040]   head and put them through your fingertips into a keyboard.
[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:30.040]   Renee Richie pick of the week sir.
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:32.400]   Well, I just wanted to echo what you and Andy said first.
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:35.960]   I went through this with Photoshop creative crowd with Adobe Creative Cloud.
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:38.960]   I used to only buy every second version of the Adobe apps that I used and I worked out
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:43.240]   to be just a better deal for me and I thought it and then I went to one password subscription
[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:47.200]   and Dropbox and it had it does add up but all of these apps I use them so many hours
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:51.280]   out of so many days that it becomes an insignificant not insignificant but a small amount of money
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:54.360]   for the amount of productivity and the amount of time that it saves me.
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:56.240]   So that was the analysis I did.
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:00.360]   I just there's a new 12 South product out called the curve for the Mac book and this
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:04.840]   is more a shout out to 12 South in general because I love these boutique Mac accessory
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:09.320]   makers who just they love their craft so much they make such a studio need is another one
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:14.560]   but you know 12 South really padding quill we were we have an embarrassment of riches
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:19.160]   with these companies and I've used some of the different elevation stands for the Mac
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:25.560]   and this one it just the design of it I just found so simple and so appealing and so clever
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:30.760]   and this is one of those things where I'm going to order this immediately and even if
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:34.000]   I only use it once or twice when I met a standing desk you know it's going to be well worth
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:39.280]   it for me because it is just such a beautiful object and I think they do that superlative
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:43.680]   relatively well from the high rise stands to you know a lot of the products they make
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:48.760]   so this is just it matches the new Mac books it looks great it goes with sort of the thinness
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:52.600]   the lines the curves and super happy with the results.
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:54.680]   What's the website 12 South?
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:58.240]   12 South I put it in the thing I think.
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:01.720]   Oh let me look at 12 South dot com yeah 12 South T.W.
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:03.720]   That is spelled out it's all spelled out.
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:04.720]   Yeah.
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:16.920]   Well I can tell you one pick from Scott Born right away that's that great Olympus OMD 1
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:21.920]   mark 2 camera I highly recommend not cheap but it's less expensive it's about half the
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:28.120]   cost of a high-end DSLR one third the cost of the DSLR replaced in my case it's two thousand
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:31.880]   dollars and it replaced a six thousand dollar right although you didn't have to buy all
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:37.520]   new lenses and by the way they've got some really nice pro lenses so one Canon lens 800
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:41.600]   F5 6L and purchased each and every piece of Olympus gear.
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:43.640]   That'll give you an idea.
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:47.160]   It's not that you use this how do you pronounce it Zuiko?
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:48.960]   I do not know.
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:50.200]   I just call it Olympus.
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:51.840]   I just call it Olympus lenses okay.
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:55.280]   You use those alright they don't pay me to pronounce but I'm going to say that that's
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:56.280]   not your picture.
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:01.360]   No my picture my my pics are related to what you said people do ask me about my post processing
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:08.840]   workflow and of late it's been almost 100% with a company called Mac fun and and we've
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:15.360]   talked about Mac fun on this show many times I know Renee likes them M A C P H U N and by
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:19.560]   way of disclosure I am on the board of advisors that's brand new that's brand new congratulations
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:23.920]   thank you but has nothing to do I've been using the products for years and because I
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:28.840]   looked at your pictures and you said processed in Luminar which is their kind of Adobe Light
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:32.920]   room replacement no it's their Adobe Photoshop replacement oh it's even more than that alright
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:37.280]   it's Photoshop I said well if Scott once you said it I'm gonna get I've been using it I
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:44.420]   love it it's extremely powerful it's extremely easy to use it's intuitive if you've been
[01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:50.880]   put off by the length of time it takes to learn Photoshop you'll love Luminar there are presets
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:55.120]   and by the way go to photo plugins.net I got a bunch of free ones do you have things like
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:50:00.320]   curves and layers and you do have layers you do have you know there are a few things that
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:05.120]   are missing but they're more photo oriented stuff they're heavy duty Photoshop user things
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:11.680]   that are missing right but most photographers I can't do LUT tables no you can't most photographers
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:17.400]   who watch this show yeah are gonna be able to everything very happy Luminar and frankly
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:22.800]   I have to say I also I first started using Mac fun when their Aurora came out that was
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:26.960]   something they did with Trey Radcliffe it's their HDR program tray move from Photomatics
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:32.520]   to Aurora and I thought well if Trey Radcliffe can use the King HDR if so I've been using
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:38.160]   Aurora and I love it and the big news for both these products is that they are both
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:43.000]   very quickly going to be available cross-platform on Windows and on Macintosh see that blows
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:48.960]   me away because that I have to say that and yet another reason why I might move away from
[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:56.480]   the Mac because you know Lightroom yeah Photoshop yeah but to get our Mr. Aurora to be honest
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:01.120]   I went back to the Mac for Aurora and Tonality Pro they're black and white and they have
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:04.920]   a bunch of other cool apps if you you know if you go to Mac they're gonna have to change
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:09.960]   their name though they can't be magnifying that's being discussed probably anyway I just
[01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:15.120]   tell you that people look at that Eagle photo we showed yeah and that's done and that is
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:20.880]   processed in Luminar Luminar and it brings out the sharpening that exists in the existing
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:27.320]   thing you can't fake sharpening but it does it better than anything else I use Intensify
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:32.120]   I use Snap P I use all their products but I use Luminar every day now Luminar can be
[01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:37.000]   a front end to Tonality and noiseless yeah you can run other apps inside apps and you
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.880]   can run Luminar by the way as a plug-in in Lightroom or Photoshop that's actually how
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:46.920]   I do it yeah you can run it in is a plug-in you can run it stand alone yeah I can tell
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:50.920]   you you can try this stuff for free if you are looking for a photo solution if you're
[01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:54.400]   one of those people who complains about the ten bucks a month it goes to Adobe and I don't
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:58.200]   really think it's a big deal to pay Adobe no it's well worth it but if you are then you
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:03.040]   can own this for around fifty sixty bucks and it's not a subscription no it's not a subscription
[01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:07.560]   in fact they've updated it so many times since it came out that I can't even keep count
[01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:11.520]   I started using it I fell in love with it I reached out to them now I'm on the board
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:15.800]   of eyes I believe so much in the product but give it a try it's it's a lot of fun to
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:19.840]   you know that's the other thing photography is supposed to be fun and this helps this
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:26.880]   helps make it fun the presets are cool and I hope people like it and tell them a couple
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:32.280]   of things I want to hear what you think make it for Linux that's I'll be sure we run right
[01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:38.480]   up to the top of the chain okay because I tell you what that would be huge okay huge
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:42.280]   it doesn't have to be open source I'll speak to the meat tree about that soon they're from
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:46.200]   the they're from Ukraine well there's a US side of the company and the Ukraine side of
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:52.480]   the company because I would love to have all these tools and then I also I use photo mechanic
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:58.160]   as my ingest oh well there are some interesting news coming soon I'll just say about that
[01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:03.640]   because that's why I still use it as a just a lightroom plug-in because what they don't
[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:09.280]   give you is the the managing all of your photos well what if what if what if you could
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:15.960]   get a program that was as fast as photo mechanic yeah that did a hierarchical look yeah what
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:21.120]   you had to do and that automatically grouped all the photos you took at the same time you
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:25.560]   took them so that you could very quickly a be seen them out so hot and would keep track
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:28.960]   of all that for you and then put it right into the room what did you do that I would
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:33.720]   buy that right away stay tuned I just I bought photo mechanic like last month for 150 bucks
[01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:38.120]   just because Lightroom so slow to process 40 megapixel images and that is a legitimate
[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:43.040]   criticism of Lightroom it's still slow yeah and and all this software slow on an older
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:47.760]   computer but I'm just telling you there's cool things coming from this company that's
[01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:54.400]   my pick of the week all right MAC PHUN we've picked it before we really like it and I'm
