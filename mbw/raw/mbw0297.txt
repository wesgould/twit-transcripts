[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.000]   Titans of the Mac world talking about
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.080]   Titanic things that happened, including
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.200]   the reasons why.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.400]   Steve Jobs is being fitted for Willy Wonka suit.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.400]   This time, I'm "Macraig" Wieffle.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.800]   "Netcast, you love from people you trust."
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.440]   I'm Andy Nackel, substituting for a traveling Leo LaPorte
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.080]   and a traveling, or probably more likely just having
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.280]   traveled, and now very much resting.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.280]   Alex Lindsey, I really have lined up
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.200]   your basic concert for buying the DASH-type lineup
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.920]   of all stars here for this week's show,
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.040]   starting with "On the Double Bass Guitar,"
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.400]   Mr. Jason Snell of "Macraig Roll" Jason, how you doing today?
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.680]   I'm doing great, Andy.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.320]   Happy to be here.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.080]   I'm in Petaluma, so nobody else showed up.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.040]   Jokes on me.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.720]   Here I am.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.200]   Great to be here.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.360]   Yeah, we sent you on a skypun there.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.520]   And also, on the double bass guitar we have from Daring
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.920]   Fireball, John Gruber, John, longtime no-see.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.920]   Hey.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.640]   Yeah, funny.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.960]   Yes.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.680]   Now, great to see you.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.440]   Jason, I'm very disappointed to find out
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.880]   that you're actually in the studio I was hoping maybe you
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.520]   had recreated the studio in your house.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.160]   It's all a green screen, actually.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.120]   It's complicated.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.400]   CGI involved.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.360]   I was going to compliment you on the accuracy.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.440]   My home renovations the last two months
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.720]   have been to basically make the Twit Studio in my house.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.520]   My wife is mad because there's no kitchen anymore.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.200]   But you've got to do what you've got to do.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.320]   Not not, Jason.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.600]   Is it more like Omega Man where you're feeling like you're
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.080]   the last person on Earth?
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.280]   Or is it more like Outland where you feel like you're
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.720]   the only human inhabitant of a space station
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.280]   on a five-year mission?
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.280]   I'm going to say it's more like 2001
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.840]   before they wake up all the people who
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.920]   are in cryogenic freeze.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.240]   So it's just me and a mad computer.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.240]   And you guys are the mad computer, I think.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.280]   You're tormenting me with your-- I don't have this many TVs
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.040]   at home.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.120]   Yeah, I was saying earlier that if you do want to,
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.120]   like, after this, record an episode of the Macworld.com,
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.840]   like a video podcast, as if you're selling TVs here,
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.680]   let's start looking at the Apple TV.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.440]   I got a deal for you.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.360]   Size is going to be-- what's the pluses?
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.440]   What's the minuses?
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.960]   I think you can cut a pretty good deal there.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.480]   Also on the double neck bass guitar,
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.480]   we're very, very bass-heavy concert today.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.160]   Chris Breen, also from Macworld.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.600]   Chris, how is ya?
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.680]   I am well.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.800]   I'm bass-heavy today.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.120]   And glad to be here.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.760]   Now, what's the album of today?
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.680]   Oh, the album of the day.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.240]   Because it's amazing.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.240]   You always have the album of the day.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.200]   Of course, the album of the day in the background,
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.320]   it is fireside theaters.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.960]   How can you be in two places at once when you're nowhere at all?
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.760]   And because it has Lenin and Marx on the cover,
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.200]   which of course, John Lennon and Groucho Marx.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.680]   Oh, excellent.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.840]   I should have put this in the show notes.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.400]   I assume that you would have prepared the Soviet National
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.680]   Anthem.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.840]   It is May Day, after all.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.480]   So at appropriate time, please, again, stand up, face
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.040]   towards the east and the Hall Hale, the slumbering heroes
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.960]   of the October Revolution.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.800]   But you'll know the time when it comes up.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.320]   I mean, you already know the lyrics, everything.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.080]   I know the lyrics.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.440]   But it turns out that the Chinese have purchased
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.160]   the rights to it now.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.320]   And now under the new China, that if I were to do this,
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.480]   we would be sued out of existence.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.720]   Oh, God.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.200]   Well, I feel like I wasted so much money
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.120]   because I had like-- each one of you
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.040]   was drop shipped like 50 Russian Navy choral member
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.800]   soldiers so you can be in the background
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.240]   getting that sort of stirring sort of--

[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.280]   I only do it in English.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.280]   The original English.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.280]   See, that's why Soviet communism failed, you know?
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.360]   Because they just could not get people on board.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.000]   Lots of early adopters, much like Google Plus,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.280]   that just quickly kind of pewtered out.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.680]   Also, on the double bass guitar we have from BB Edit.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.200]   Sorry, aerobone software.com.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.480]   Mr. Reach Siegel.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.680]   Rich, you have your own chorus member right there too.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.120]   Again, I'm sorry.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.680]   I did order the soldiers online as possible
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.600]   that I clicked Parrot instead of Parrotroop.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.720]   There was a pop up and I ordered off my iPad.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.480]   Also, a toast to all the work glorious workers out there.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.720]   Hi, for one.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.880]   Welcome, our avian overlord.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.280]   Oh, can you go through this?
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.200]   Oh, wait, no.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.080]   That's wrong.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.000]   Yeah, you don't want to put your lips on the wrong one,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.440]   because one will kill brain cells immediately,
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.440]   the other will kill brain cells after five or 10 years.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.280]   Happy May Day.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.000]   Yes, great to see you all, even if it is rainy and miserable
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.720]   outside.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.560]   Well, it's raining and miserable in the Soviet heart.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.360]   That's how they get through that long Soviet winter
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.560]   and why they value such strong, strong spirit.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.480]   So we've got four interesting topics.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.960]   Well, unfortunately, we talked about eight different things.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.160]   We could pick at the end, try to guess which
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.520]   are the interesting ones you'll win a free hat or t-shirt,
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.920]   depending on size is very.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.000]   I actually want to start off by talking about a conference
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.080]   that John and I just came home from the Ull conference.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.480]   Rhymes with Cool, as I was reminded.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.920]   It took place for about two days in Dublin, Ireland last week.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.920]   And it was a really, really cool iOS developer conference,
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.440]   which was, I think John you'll agree with me.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.240]   This has got to be one of the best run conferences
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.480]   I have ever been at.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.440]   I'm sure you'd agree too.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.280]   Oh, it was excellent.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.320]   I mean, it was top notch.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.560]   I mean, and both, as from our perspective as speakers
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.080]   and just talking to the attendees,
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.880]   I mean, it seemed like attendees were over the moon
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.720]   delighted with the way it went.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.840]   Yeah, I mean, every detail, all the way going down to--
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.120]   I don't think I have it here, but just the name tags
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.400]   that you were given when you registered.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.480]   The tags kind of made me think that this is what--
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.960]   if Steve Jobs himself were wanting
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.280]   to do a little film festival for himself and 100
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.280]   of his friends, and he was attending to every single detail
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.680]   himself, it would have worked out much the same way
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.600]   that this conference worked out.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.720]   The name badges-- here it is.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.680]   The name badges were--
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.680]   there you go.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.320]   I don't know if you can see it, but beautifully designed.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.640]   But also, it's not like they were just printed in color
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.440]   like on laser print stock.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.440]   It was like three kinds of textured paper, laser cut outs
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.600]   for the red flag up there, like embossed printing.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.400]   And it was so good.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.920]   You're like, I kind of want to wear this around day to day
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.800]   because it makes my name and my presence look very, very
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.320]   important.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.000]   Yeah, it seemed like the name tag seemed
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.920]   like something you wanted to keep in mint condition for future
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.040]   you're selling on eBay.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.960]   You don't want to get that dented up.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.760]   Don't wear it.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.680]   That's what I thought.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.920]   Don't.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.600]   Yeah, but it was a cool week, particularly
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.200]   because of the people that were there.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.720]   There was a day's worth of workshops
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.360]   than a day's worth of just sort of--
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.640]   it's not quite like a Ted Conference sort of serious
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.160]   of talks, but shorter talks on broader sort of topics.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.920]   It was really cool in that you would have one person talking
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.240]   about one subject, and then two hours later someone
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.840]   would be talking about something else that sort of contradicted
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.080]   the first guy a little bit.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.160]   So it was a lot of discussion, a lot of open minds,
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.520]   a lot of open talk, and a lot of open pints of Guinness,
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.920]   which always helps out.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.080]   Yeah, and I have a friend-- and I forget who I took this from,
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.640]   but I've been to a few other conferences
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.480]   with a similar schedule.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.000]   The C4 conference, which Wolf Wrench, a Mac developer,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.280]   used to hold in Chicago.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.360]   The Singleton Conference, which was in Montreal last October.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.480]   All adhere to the same basic schedule,
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.320]   which-- and I forget who I'm stealing this from,
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.840]   but somebody called it the wedding format,
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.400]   which is it kicks off Friday night.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.080]   And in a wedding, that's like the rehearsal dinner.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.680]   Then the conference proper is all day Saturday, like the wedding.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.720]   And then Saturday night, everybody goes and the attendees
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.000]   stay together instead of dispersing at five o'clock,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.320]   you all go to dinner together.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.920]   Again, like a wedding.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.040]   And then Sunday morning, there's just-- or afternoon,
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.400]   there's a little-- just in case you're still around in town,
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.320]   we can all eat together, break bread, have another Guinness
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.240]   or two, and head off to the airport.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.240]   But that way, everybody gets to see each other Sunday.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.160]   And it's a nice way to say goodbye.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.120]   And I thought it was--
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.320]   I think that formula really works great for a small conference,
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.960]   especially these sort of single track, roughly 100,
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.280]   maybe 120 people.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.960]   And it seems like you get to know everybody.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.760]   That's the other thing.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.640]   It seemed very intimate.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.480]   It seemed like I got to meet over half the people who were there.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.680]   Yeah, absolutely true.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.760]   I mean, I came home with so many new email addresses.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.760]   I was like, oh, hey, the next time you're New England,
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.440]   come and visit me.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.600]   Oh, next time you're in Chelsea, come and visit me.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.600]   So I thought all that sort of cool stuff.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.960]   I mean, it seems as though that's
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.800]   where all the greatest conferences are now.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.200]   We sort of moved away from as if we could still
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.320]   do like a 40, 50, 60, 70, 80,000 person conference
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.040]   like we could like 15 years ago.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.640]   Now all the great conferences are things like Second Conf
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.040]   where it's just a couple hundred people.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.520]   At some point, you will basically meet pretty much
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.520]   everybody that's there.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.200]   And you can really sit there and attend every single panel
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.080]   and every single class.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.120]   And a lot of the good stuff does happen during the lunches,
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.520]   during the dinners, and just when you just cluster
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.120]   into small groups afterward.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.480]   That's where a lot of the value is these days in modern shows.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.000]   Also, you got--
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.520]   I did take a--
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.640]   There's a-- there turned out to be sort of a minor Twitter
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.760]   competition to see who got the best shot of you
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.120]   giving the closing dinner speech.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.440]   We're at the-- they held it at this--
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.080]   the Royal Hospital, which is about a 16-something building,
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.280]   in this really, really church-like cathedral-type atmosphere.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.360]   And John gave this really great talk that was so well received.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.720]   And it was-- it was chiefly-- here it is.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.840]   It was chiefly about-- it seemed to be chiefly
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.560]   about why so many analysts seem to not
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.640]   want to admit that Apple is having a fairly good time of it,
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.120]   a fairly good year.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.560]   I wonder if you could you like sort of sum it up for MacPray?
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.120]   I will try to.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.480]   But the main point is clearly Apple is on top of things
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:49.920]   right now.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.840]   I mean, they're the biggest company by market cap in the world,
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.120]   not just in the tech industry, but period, quarter after quarter,
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.280]   year after year profits and unit sales for all of their flagship
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:07.360]   products are way up with growth rates that are healthy for any company,
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:14.880]   but are sort of astounding for a company that is so literally large.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.880]   There have been other companies.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.880]   You know, and--
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.440]   Everything works.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:29.240]   But in the past, when other companies have sort of grown to the top spot in the pecking
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:35.240]   order, I don't recall seeing so much pessimism quarter after quarter, year after year from
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.520]   analysts and financial watchers.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.360]   Like when Microsoft was the biggest company in the world, it didn't-- they'd announce
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.680]   their quarterly results.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.760]   They'd have record-breaking profits.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.640]   The day after that happened, you didn't see people saying, well, you know, look out for
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.040]   Lotus, they're ready to come back.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.080]   Whereas a day or two after last week's Apple financials, there were people writing into
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:02.720]   Wall Street Journal saying, well, good quarter for Apple, but I say short then Motorola is
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.200]   coming out with new funds.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.240]   And you know, Motorola is coming out with new funds, and who knows anything can happen,
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.480]   but it certainly doesn't seem very likely that Apple is going to lose the lead in profit
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.480]   and revenue from smartphones any time in the next immediate-- or let's say the immediate
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.440]   future, the next year, maybe two years.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.600]   But yet you see this with Apple every quarter, quarter after quarter, there's some contingent
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:33.280]   of analysts who, you know, think the ship is ready to sink.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.080]   And my best explanation for this is not really technical or analytical at all.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:42.640]   I really think what it is is a sort of psychological thing based on first impressions, which are
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.440]   into early impressions.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.800]   And it's that I just don't think humans are hooked up.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:53.040]   We sort of make our first impressions, whether it's a person, whether it's an organization,
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.280]   a store, anything we have a sort of relationship with.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.280]   You make a first impression, you have a very short period of time to adjust it, where it's
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:06.600]   liquid, where maybe you can very quickly decide, you know what, my first impression was wrong.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.360]   This guy who I thought was great, he's an idiot.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:13.200]   You know, you figure that out very, very quickly, but then it sort of cements and it's not going
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.080]   to move very much afterwards, no matter what happens.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:22.400]   And I think that with Apple, a lot of people form their first impression, or at least their
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:30.200]   lasting impression, during those dry years, they-- let's just say for just the '90s, just
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.440]   to draw a rough period.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:38.400]   There, quarter after quarter, year after year, Apple sold about a million Macintosh computers,
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:44.360]   a quarter, about four million of them a year, year after year, quarter after quarter.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.560]   Sometimes a little less, those were the bad quarters, sometimes a little more than a million,
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.040]   those were the good quarters.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:54.920]   And that's not a bad business, selling a million $2,000, $3,000 personal computers
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.120]   a year, but there was no growth.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:02.080]   And they were in an industry, the PC industry, that was growing tremendously during the '90s,
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.560]   which meant that Apple's overall market share was going down, down, down, even though they
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.280]   were selling this same number of computers a year.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.320]   And I think an awful lot of analysts form this opinion of Apple, that they're a niche
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:19.120]   player and they're not really a long-term success in this era.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.920]   And it doesn't matter what has happened since, and that was a long time ago.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.800]   It doesn't matter what happens.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.880]   They still have Apple filed away as the little guy who's going to get beaten by these other
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.480]   guys who do things very differently than the way Apple does.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:39.560]   And so now, I think, well, I just wanted to say, one last thing I think is important
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:44.880]   is that if you really just, in broad terms, want to understand Apple today, it's to think
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.760]   of things like the iPhone and the iPad as personal computers, and they sell for $6, $7,
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.600]   $800 each.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.840]   And this past quarter, Apple sold 50 million of them, totally.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.600]   If you add up iPhones, iPads, and Macs.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.200]   So they're no longer the company that sells 1 million computers a quarter.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.040]   They're a company that sells 50 million a quarter.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.320]   And I don't know anybody who's going to bet that they're only going to sell 50 total
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.320]   next quarter.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.320]   It's going to go up, up, up.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.840]   Jason, do you think there's, is there anybody who's, who, who, when you think of analysts
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.280]   who actually play fair with Apple, who really judge them by the numbers that are actually
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.720]   there as opposed to the numbers that they hope they, they're going to see, is there any
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.440]   company, any analysts you think tends to get it right?
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.840]   Well, I don't keep an analyst scorecard.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.840]   I mean, there are, I, they come and go and they really vary.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.200]   I mean, like Michael Gartenberg gets Apple and he understands and you see him quoted
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.600]   a lot.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   You see on the analyst calls, you know, there are varying degrees of people like Shah Wu
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.520]   sometimes gets called and says reasonable things to CNBC.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:52.440]   Horace did you, obviously, who is at the Ulu conference is an analyst, an independent
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.840]   analyst who has some very perceptive things in terms of charts and graphs and numbers.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:01.880]   But you know, it varies and a lot of these analysts, I agree with John, are thinking about
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.560]   Apple in a different way and I'm not sure whether it's because Apple used to be that
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:10.160]   weird company that was always kind of an underdog selling niche products to a small
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:15.080]   audience or whether it's just that they, they still can't accept that Apple does things
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.760]   differently than other people and that that's why Apple is successful.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.680]   Not, not a reason why they won't ultimately be successful but that they're actually doing
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.680]   it right.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.480]   Although I see the attitude is changing.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.880]   I mean, people's attitude toward Apple the last five years, a lot of that stuff I think
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.120]   has fallen by the wayside.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.040]   There are still those people out there but I think there are fewer.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.160]   I think in business in general, people look at Apple now and are starting to say for the
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.480]   first time, you know, what we should learn what they're doing and understand why they're
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.040]   doing it instead of just sort of waving it off and saying, "Oh, it's Apple.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.040]   They do crazy stuff.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.440]   We can't, we can't duplicate it.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.640]   You just have to ignore them."
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.840]   So I think Apple's made progress and how could they not in the last five years given what's
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.840]   happened financially?
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.920]   Yeah, the other weird thing about being a professional analyst is that you, by some measures, you
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.280]   do get to design the scorecard that you're going to be judging everybody else by.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.360]   John made a really good point about it.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:08.280]   What the scale and the scope of what Apple is depends on how you choose to define the
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.280]   word computer.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:14.080]   If you certainly define it as any device that runs iOS and that's a credible definition,
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.400]   Apple's just kicking butt up and down the schoolyard.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.640]   If you choose to say, "Well, look, this is a phone and people don't really relate
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.520]   to it as a phone," then you could sort of tick off people that way, then you could take
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.680]   a look at how people are actually using iPads and decide, "Well, who cares if it's a $500
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.480]   device that has a really good operating system and runs really, really great software?"
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:36.760]   If people aren't thinking about it as a computer, if it's not stealing sales away from a $500
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.520]   or $700 computer, then we can't judge it that way.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.720]   So it really seems as though you get a different ref on the field who always tries to, has
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.680]   a different idea of what the penalties should mean.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:54.760]   The analyst call actually happened moments after we did Mac Break last week, so we can
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.920]   talk about it this week.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:02.480]   As usual, it's the numbers that really encourage you to come up with new analogies for big,
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.480]   big numbers.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:10.280]   $39.2 billion in quarterly revenue, net profit of $11.6 billion.
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:16.520]   Let's see, that was over $24.7 billion in net profit of $6 billion last time.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.560]   $35.1 million in the quarter.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.520]   These are the sort of numbers that really want somebody in jeans and a casual shirt in
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:31.640]   front of an enormous projected screen pacing back and forth, watching bars rise in the air.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.640]   Let's go back to John.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:40.000]   Is this a superiorly good quarter in a history of good quarters, or is it flattening off?
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.920]   Should we even start to process these numbers at an intellectual level above and beyond
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.160]   to simply, yeah, Apple got all the money last quarter and they're probably going to get
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.640]   all the money next quarter too?
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.720]   I think it's historically interesting.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:20:01.560]   I think that you've got to think of Apple as almost like a new company in the iOS era.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:06.480]   Again, going back to these first impressions, the reason why I don't think that Google
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:14.280]   seems widely misunderstood or that Microsoft seems widely misunderstood is that where Google
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.560]   gets its money from.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:22.680]   People understood very quickly from before their IPO that they have the best search engine.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.240]   Everybody uses it.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.920]   Everybody does lots of searches and there's an easy way for them.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:32.480]   Well, I say easy, but they have a repeatable way of getting a couple of pennies from people
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.520]   every time they do a search because of the ads they show.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.600]   Everybody understood it.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:41.800]   Everybody could see how that was going to make a lot of money and they understood it.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:47.320]   I think you've got to look at Apple just in the iOS era and just see the growth in iPhones
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.280]   and iPads year after year, quarter after quarter.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.440]   To me, the two most astounding numbers last quarter, last from the last week's numbers
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:01.960]   are that the iPhone had 88% year over year growth.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.120]   No longer really a new product.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.240]   That was five years ago when it was announced.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:12.680]   Five years after it was announced, it's still growing 88% year over year and the iPad grew
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:18.080]   151% in unit sales year over year, which is ahead.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.760]   That was announced two years ago initially.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:29.840]   151% growth and just under 12 million units is way ahead of where the iPhone was two years
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.920]   after it debuted.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:36.200]   If that keeps up, there's no guarantee that it will.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:42.840]   If the iPad continues on the trajectory where it's accelerating faster than the iPhone was,
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.640]   which I think it's just tremendous in terms of building a multi-legged, the old analogy
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:54.640]   about you want your business stool to have more than one or two legs.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:59.160]   Boy, that's the iPhone and iPad are two really, really good legs to have.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:05.160]   One of the great quotes from Tim was to put in context was just two years after we shipped
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:09.320]   the initial iPad, we sold 67 million to put that in some contexts.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:15.760]   It took us 24 years to sell that many Macs and five years for that many iPads, three
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.960]   years for that many iPhones.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.600]   There's an incredible acceleration in people adopting the iPad.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.840]   Is this maybe one of the reasons why some analysts are starting to get a little bit
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.160]   cautious about Apple?
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.280]   At some point, the space shuttle takes off the pad and it gets incredible acceleration,
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:35.120]   but at some point, those boosters fall off and now it becomes a Newtonian object.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:41.080]   Jason, anytime when you see these numbers, when you see growth that approaches 100% every
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:45.880]   single quarter, do you start to worry that this is the time to get prepared for the first
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:52.200]   time when Apple can, God forbid, actually make enough iPads to satisfy demand and they're
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.640]   not sold out every single week?
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.280]   I think it's out there, but I think it's still a little far away.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.080]   I think it's a little bit like saying, well, everybody dies, so prepare for the end.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.680]   It may not happen tomorrow.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.680]   It will happen inevitably.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.880]   There is the heat depth of the universe to consider it always.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.880]   Exactly right.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.160]   The universe will end at some point.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.560]   But I don't know.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.760]   The iPhone, you look at that.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:14.320]   I think maybe a year or two ago, we might have looked at the iPhone sales growth and said,
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.520]   well, they can't keep that up.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.480]   But what's happened is they've gone into other markets and they've lowered the prices on
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:24.160]   the products and you're seeing amazing growth on the iPhone in China right now, for example.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.400]   And then the iPad, you're talking about a product that's really creating a new product
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.400]   category.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.760]   They haven't sold that many of them.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.920]   There's a huge market for people who have never bought a tablet computer before, who
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.640]   have never even thought about it before, as that product grows.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:42.800]   So yeah, I mean, you keep thinking it's inevitable that these things are going to cool off, like
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.680]   the iPod cooled off.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:51.080]   But the iPhone, it may cool off in North America and Europe a little bit, but it's got other
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.480]   countries and other regions that are picking up the slack.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:58.120]   And then the iPad is right behind it, accelerating even faster because it's got more potential
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.120]   market.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:03.520]   So these are rockets that are not going to run out of fuel for a while, which isn't to say
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.840]   that Apple doesn't need to be thinking about what's next.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.560]   But I do think that there's room for even more insane growth from Apple in the next few
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.560]   years.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:17.840]   Chris, do you think that the tires coming when during an upcoming keynote, Tim Cook has
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.760]   to haul up the whole, the old line that we've been using about Apple TV?
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.840]   So, well, we consider Mac OS to be a hobby for us.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.960]   We don't reveal the numbers on how many copies that we actually sell.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:36.520]   The velocs in the sales call, the analysts call, the sales of Mac OS devices were also
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.440]   very, very good and very, very strong.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:43.400]   Nowhere near as meteoric as we were seeing in iOS, it really does seem like the acceleration
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.320]   of iOS is outpacing Mac OS by considerable margin.
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:51.840]   Do you think that that means that iOS is going to be the signature, the Tiffany brand
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.520]   for Apple and Mac OS is just going to be something that they continue to sell and continue to
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.280]   work in because we have all this money from iOS.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.880]   It doesn't matter how well we do with Mac OS.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:08.040]   No, because the Macs and the Mac OS are still necessary parts, even if only to support iOS.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.960]   You still need a computer to do a lot of things with your iOS devices.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:16.720]   Plus, there's a lot of work that can't be done on an iOS device that if you're doing
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:23.960]   serious video editing, if you're doing even some page layout stuff, that kind of all the
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:28.360]   typical markets that the Mac has always dominated in will continue to do so.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:32.920]   Because as lovely as these devices are, they're not yet to the point where you're going to
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.880]   be able to do professional kinds of work.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.400]   They don't have enough power to do that kind of thing.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.720]   So no, I don't think so.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:44.560]   I think that yes, this is the sexy product right now and will continue to be as are other
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.880]   iOS devices and they'll continue to have great numbers.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:54.960]   But I think Mac OS will continue to be a bedrock product line for Apple.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.040]   Certainly, their laptop sales have grown a lot in the last couple years.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.040]   And we're seeing people that have purchased an iOS device for, and now they're looking
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:08.280]   back at getting a Mac laptop, a MacBook Air, for example, because they understand that
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.400]   all they've heard about Apple is that this stuff is easy to use.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:16.000]   We will make the way it's designed is now starting to fall back toward the Mac again.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.240]   So I think you're going to continue to see great support for the Mac OS.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:25.280]   Yeah, there was an analyst report that came out a few days ago suggesting that for 25%
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.960]   of iPad purchasers, this is their first Apple device they've ever bought.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:33.240]   So it's kind of maybe working sort of as a gateway drug.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:38.320]   What kind of concerns me is that Apple has always had really great success in limiting
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.080]   the amount of power that they put into computers and devices.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:46.160]   And that's sort of a biased way of saying that they want devices and software that works
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.440]   all the time, that works well with everything else.
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.400]   And sometimes to make that goal happen, you have to simply say, no, the user is not allowed
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.160]   to do whatever they want to do.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:59.520]   My concern is that by the time we see not 10.8, but 10.9, by the time we see 11, Apple
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.640]   might feel as though they've had enough votes from enough of their users to say that it's
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.960]   okay for us to create an OS that maybe is not powerful enough to do professional level
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.040]   video editing, not powerful enough to do professional page layout.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:18.960]   We're willing to give that single digit percentage of the market back to Windows so
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.520]   long as we can focus on the stuff that we really like to do.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.840]   Does that make any sense to anybody?
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:24.840]   I don't know.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.520]   I mean, if you look at the Mac, it's 13% of Apple's revenue, which seems really small
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.040]   and I've had a lot of people say to me, well, this means that Apple is going to get rid
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.880]   of the Mac and it's all going to be iOS.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:40.400]   But you look at what the Mac can do to Chris's point, the iOS devices can't do that yet.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.320]   Tim Cook made this statement about, somebody asked him about fusing a MacBook Air with
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:52.680]   an iPad and Tim Cook said that was a little bit like making a toaster refrigerator combination.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.840]   His point there is that laptops are good for some things and tablets are good for other
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.440]   things.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.360]   We can debate the toaster fridge thing because the convergence may happen, but I think the
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:06.120]   Mac as a product line, if you look at it on its own, it's growing, I think something
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:10.400]   like 15 out of the last 20 quarters, they've set a record for the most Mac sold.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.280]   This was not a holiday quarter, so they didn't.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.480]   But generally, the Mac is doing better than ever.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.280]   It's record Mac sales are happening.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:22.040]   About half the Mac buyers in Apple stores have never bought a Mac before, so they're
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.360]   pretty much picking up market share from Windows.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:29.160]   And so you put all of that together and I think it's a rosy future for the Mac, at
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.160]   least for a while, again, you can never say never, but it's a successful business.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.400]   It's just a smaller part of Apple's whole.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.600]   I don't see Apple walking away from it just because even though it's the only part of
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:45.000]   the PC industry that's growing and it's growing a lot and it's setting records, it's 13% that's
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.080]   not important to us.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.200]   And I do think that Apple makes a lot of money off of the Mac and that there are benefits
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.320]   to having a personal computer in Apple's ecosystem.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.600]   So I'm skeptical about the Mac's demise.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.880]   I think that it's going to be around, but to use that Steve Jobs metaphor, it's very
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:07.600]   clearly becoming more like a truck where it's the device you use for very certain tasks.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.600]   And that's how I use it.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:14.280]   I had a podcast using GarageBand on my Mac and I write long articles on my Mac, but almost
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.800]   everything else I do, I really do on my iPad now.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.080]   So that's the direction it's going.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.600]   I just don't think we're going to be there for a little while.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.640]   I certainly don't think that Apple will ever discontinue Mac OS.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:30.800]   My worry is that if they list the 100 things that a Mac can do right now and they think,
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:37.680]   "Well, if we reduce that list to 80, we can make this 50% easier, 50% faster, 50% greater
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:38.760]   value to the user."
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.720]   I think that would be an inside Apple.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.480]   I think that would be a very compelling argument.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:48.520]   But you also brought up another really great quote from Tim Cook about the toaster fridge
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:53.480]   and Microsoft VR basically had React on Twitter saying pretty good naturally, "Yeah, well,
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.560]   maybe we're not building a toaster fridge.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.160]   We're building a toaster oven and those tend to be kind of popular."
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:04.480]   I think that's the one thing from the call that kind of made me sort of rewind and play
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:10.040]   that back a little bit because I've talked about this before and on the podcast that
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:15.400]   when you use, I'm not convinced that the idea of having a really good mobile operating
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:20.920]   system that also runs desktops that also sit side by side of the desktop operating system
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.760]   is a really bad idea.
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:27.320]   Every single time that I travel with just with a MacBook and an iPad, I feel like that
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:32.200]   was kind of a failure because I want that device on the plane that I could read books
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:38.200]   on and that I can actually use on the 8-inch interface sort of experience.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.720]   But then I want to be able to hook up a keyboard to it and actually use it as a regular desktop
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:46.680]   computer and we can't really lose sight of the fact that the iPad is still a $500 thing,
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.800]   $399 if you buy the iPad too.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.640]   If you buy a really good new iPad, now you're up to $800 or $900.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.920]   That's why I'm not predicting anything for Windows 8, but I'm really curious to see in 2013
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:06.120]   how consumers are going to react to the idea of a $900 Intel-based Windows 8 desktop slate
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.080]   that can also run nice mobile apps.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.840]   Are they going to see it as this runs?
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:15.240]   This is kind of a really chunky, really fat, really heavy, really hot running, really low
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.640]   battery performing version of the iPad.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.160]   Or are they going to say, "Well, I can get this device that is the laptop that I needed
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.280]   to get anyway."
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:27.800]   And also, I don't have to buy this $500 iPad because I can also use it as the kids' tablet
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:28.800]   drawing device.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.520]   I can use it as my e-reader.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:34.480]   I think that there's going to be a lot of votes coming from a lot of different sources
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.480]   to see whether that's going to work out for people or not.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.120]   I mean, lots of people have a toaster oven.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.120]   It's true.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.840]   I would wager more people have a toaster in an oven than just a toaster oven.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:47.720]   But this goes back to Apple focusing on specific markets, especially at the start.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:52.200]   It's the same reason Apple only has a 10-inch tablet and a phone right now.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.560]   They don't have a 5-inch or a 7-inch device right now.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.720]   They went for the sweet spots.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.760]   And I think maybe right now the toaster oven is not a sweet spot for them.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.320]   It's not to say that it might be.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:05.360]   And I think if the Windows 8 stuff is successful, then maybe it is.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:09.080]   I think it's definitely true that Apple wants the iOS devices to be as productive as possible.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:15.520]   And it's not Apple's goal to kind of keep productivity out of iOS in order to save max sales.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.440]   They're definitely not going down that path.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.440]   They want it to be productive.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.080]   I'm not talking about saving max sales.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:24.040]   I'm talking about more about their feeling that as a philosophy that, well, why should
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.400]   there be a backseat in the car?
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.760]   People don't use the backseat in the car except with their trash back there.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:34.040]   Sometimes I think they have a philosophy that's not 100% in sync with the marketplace.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:37.600]   And I think that I do think we're going to see some interesting information coming in
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:42.440]   2013 about once we have our first real competitors to the iPad.
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.440]   We haven't had one yet.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.040]   We've had many, many failures competing to the iPad.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:51.400]   I'm waiting for the first thing that costs roughly the same as an iPad, has a decent amount
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.040]   of apps for it or at least a credible amount of apps for it.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:57.440]   And I really want to see what happens the first time the consumers get to see one of
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:03.400]   these side by side and say, which one of these two things do you want?
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.880]   We want competition more than anything else.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:11.520]   Let's just move on just for a sec because we have to cut to Leo Laporte who has an incredibly
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.680]   important message from the hovering spacecraft that he is vacationing in right now.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:16.680]   Leo.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.920]   Thank you, Mr. Enoco.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.960]   How many times show of hands has this happened?
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.960]   You're watching a show like this and you go, hey, I got a great idea for a domain name.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.120]   And you run over to your registrar.
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.120]   I hope it's Hover.com and you register the domain name.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.720]   Now if it is Hover.com, there's good news here.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.560]   Because they let you trade in those domain names you've never used.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.600]   How many do you own that you've never used?
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.800]   We call them clunker domains.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:50.240]   They will let you trade in the clunker domain for a premium domain and they will refund everything
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:54.280]   you spend at Hover.com, including registration and renewal fees.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.720]   So now go ahead, register domain names as much as you want because if you never use
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.400]   them, you can get your money back.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.040]   That's just one of the many reasons I love Hover.com.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.480]   You've got a domain transfer service.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.200]   I recommend you use it.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.240]   Tell them I sent you and I think they'll give, it's 25 bucks, but I think they'll rebate
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.600]   you that service fee for that.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.280]   But it is also $10 and they will not rebate you.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.520]   There's $10 for each domain you're transferring to Hover.com.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.280]   But with that $10, you get a whole other year.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.200]   So it's actually a very good deal.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:28.520]   $10, you get an additional year and you get all the great domain registration and management
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.480]   stuff that Hover does.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.200]   First of all, simple, clean interface.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.200]   Go look at it.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.760]   Go to Macbreak.com.
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.160]   The domain management stuff is so clean.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:40.400]   There's none of this extra click by this, by this, by this.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.600]   No, you get domain privacy as part of the deal.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.640]   It's just built in.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.480]   And they've got these premium domains.
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:48.720]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:52.840]   If you're trying to register a domain name somebody already has, look for the gold stars
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.840]   next to those names.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.760]   Those are domains that somebody owns and they've set a price.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.880]   Just like you pay, it's like the buy it now price.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.880]   You pay it.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.240]   Of course, no haggling.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.240]   And they don't got to jack the price up when they find out it's you that wants to buy it.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.720]   I think that's pretty good.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:12.920]   So clunker, trade-ins, premium domains, a no-hold customer service policy means once you get
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:16.960]   through Monday through Friday at 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern, you will not be put on hold.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.880]   Your problem will be solved.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.160]   Just the best domain service.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.560]   I talk to people all the time who've moved to Hover and are so happy.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.080]   I want you to do it too.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.080]   Macbreak.hover.com.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.080]   All right.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.080]   All right.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.080]   You want a special offer?
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.600]   Give me a special offer.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.800]   Use the offer code Macbreak.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.280]   You'll get 10% off your domains.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.760]   10% off your domains.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.200]   That does not include the premium domains, of course.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.320]   Macbreak.hover.com.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.320]   Thank you, Andy.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.680]   Back to you guys.
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:51.720]   Thank you, Leo, from the Helicarrier, the new TWIT Helicarrier, hovering in an undisclosed
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.720]   location.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.400]   I'm told it's over one of the two poles.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.000]   So by all means, guess which one you'd like to get.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.680]   That's another T-shirt giveaway.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:04.040]   Guess which pole the TWIT Helicarrier is hovering over for that free T-shirt.
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:08.720]   Be sure we get your size and whether you're allergic to cotton because it's not really
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.720]   cotton.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.720]   We outsourced it.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.720]   We got a good deal.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.280]   I hope you want to talk about it.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:19.360]   The other really cool, really good news from last week was tickets for WWDC 2012 finally
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.360]   went on sale.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:24.200]   Apple was also nice enough to actually tell people when it would be taking place.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:28.400]   It's going to be taking place in San Francisco from June 11th to June 15th.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:34.600]   The tickets, 5,000 tickets went on sale and were completely sold out within two hours.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:41.160]   So Rich, you are not a new person in the field of Mac software development.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.560]   You're not going to WWDC this year, are you?
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:51.000]   No, as it happens, I had previously made vacation plans and I'm going to be enjoying a lovely
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.640]   week somewhere else during WWDC.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:37:01.360]   This happened last year too, although the time period between the announcement of tickets
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:09.400]   on sale and the announcement of were out of tickets was slightly less dramatically short.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.600]   But the tickets still sold out in about half a day last year.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:18.480]   It's a little astonishing when something like this happens, but I got to tell you, I don't
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.080]   think it's all that uncommon.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.920]   Google I/O sells out very quickly.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:30.240]   Many of these wedding conferences, these weekend wedding conferences that John was talking
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:36.400]   about, they're limited, of course, very limited attendance, but they too sell out very quickly.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:42.480]   It's a good thing for Apple because it increases the perceived value of the conference.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:47.080]   I mean, something that sells out that fast must be something that millions of people
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.000]   want to go to.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.320]   On the other hand, it can be exasperating if you're somebody who woke up, if you live
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:38:02.440]   in California or Hawaii or really any place between New York City and the International
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:07.760]   Dateline and discover, "Oh, I missed my opportunity.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:11.240]   How nice."
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.200]   And there have been some discussions of the issue.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:17.920]   My take on it is sort of in an overarching way is that it is Apple's show.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.080]   It is their game and they can run it however they like.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:28.720]   I think if I were supervising the effort, I might suggest doing a ticket lottery so that
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:39.600]   registered developers have the opportunity to buy a ticket if they win in quotes the lottery.
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:46.040]   I once had the fortune many, many years ago to win a Red Sox ticket lottery which got
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:50.360]   me the opportunity to buy tickets on top of the Green Monster and it's a great way
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.360]   to do it.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:56.160]   When you've got limited slots and a lot of demand, people can be disappointed when they
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.800]   don't win the lottery, but on the other hand, they can't complain that there's a bias.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.760]   And I've heard a lot of that this year about WWDC tickets.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.480]   Oh, there was a bias towards people in early time zones.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.000]   There's a bias against people in California.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.320]   It's just the system.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:18.960]   I don't think anybody said, "Ha, ha, ha, let's screw people in California."
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:22.880]   Pretty sure that didn't happen.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.680]   There have been some administrative screw-ups.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:32.800]   There's been discussion of developers who bought tickets, multiple tickets for folks
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.760]   in the company and they had their tickets canceled because more than one ticket was bought
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.280]   on a single credit card.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:46.320]   I'm glad I didn't run into that, but I know some folks who did and that's pretty exasperating
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:52.040]   too, but I think that's just a simple administrative screw-up as well and hopefully that'll get
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.480]   all sorted out quickly.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:40:00.160]   I think in the larger picture though, the developers' conference does remain extremely
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.880]   important.
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:12.960]   If you want to get early access to what's coming up, if you want face-to-face access
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:22.400]   to not only engineers at Apple, but also the developer relations representatives who are
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:29.640]   there, your peers, the term that comes up frequently at Tech conferences is the so-called
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:34.440]   hallway track.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:39.520]   It refers to the whole concept of just randomly running into people in the hallways between
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:45.000]   sessions and just having these great impromptu conversations.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.400]   You can build lasting relationships.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:55.840]   You can have brilliant brain flashes and the value of that really can't be understated.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.880]   How important is it for developers to actually get into that conference?
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.880]   They actually get past that conference.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.120]   Do you think the developers out there who feel as though we will not be able to ship
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:10.200]   our product on time unless we get access to the information and then the sessions that
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:14.280]   are going to be there live this week, we can't afford to wait for the hit video?
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.640]   I don't think so.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:22.680]   The developers' conference to me has always been more of a strategic conference.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.680]   It's never really been a tactical.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.560]   It's never really been a matter of tactical importance.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.760]   I'm sure that there are going to be some edge cases.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:37.320]   There are going to be some folks who say, "Well, I was really hoping I could get in
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.520]   to talk to somebody in person that week."
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:45.680]   Honestly, Apple developer services has compatibility labs.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:51.080]   You can get excellent help from developer tech support.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:55.480]   You can make arrangements to actually go to the Apple campus.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.920]   I don't really see that argument as holding a lot of water.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:06.040]   The developers' conference is more strategic.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:10.640]   It's where you learn under non-disclosure what Apple has planned really for the next
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.440]   year.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:19.160]   It's where you can get good in-depth instruction on stuff that's already shipping.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.800]   Of course, those parts aren't confidential.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:30.920]   You can sit in a session for an hour, an hour and a half, and hear firsthand from the engineers
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:36.800]   who wrote a particular part of the OS and hear them talk about how it works and how to
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.400]   use it effectively and how to get the most of it.
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.160]   That really is strategic, not so much.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:50.280]   Well, I was wondering if it's worthwhile for people who didn't get tickets to go anyway
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:56.440]   and sit outside Moscone somewhere, find a hall, and still have the opportunity to speak
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.880]   with their peers.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:07.560]   The ability to do that, I suspect, is going to be limited.
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.120]   It's an interesting question.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:16.680]   Certainly, the geography of Moscone itself and the way the conference is laid out makes
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:21.280]   it a little bit tricky.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:29.440]   Apple security that we see is going to not be a real tolerant of people just randomly
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:33.920]   camping out there without badges and on the sidewalks.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.120]   No, I wasn't suggesting that.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:43.480]   You could certainly go to San Francisco that week.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:46.480]   Where your Hawkenberry disguise?
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:50.600]   You're the 11th-grade Hawkenberry we've had registered today.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.880]   That's my Hawkenberry disguise.
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.800]   Giant fleshy palm.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.600]   Hide up.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:03.280]   To speak slightly to the slightly less literal interpretation of the question, though, I
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:12.720]   think you could reasonably travel to San Francisco that week and let your friends who were going
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.160]   to the conference know that you were going to be there that week.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:22.240]   I think there may be some people from the greater area who are going to do that.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:25.600]   I can't say that it's a bad idea.
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.000]   I can't really say that it's a good idea.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.040]   I don't think I would do it if I weren't already going on vacation.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:38.880]   That's going to be a matter of individual preference.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:45.160]   Wow, Andy and Octo Skype has died.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.160]   Oh, dear.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.160]   After a short and illness.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.080]   Let us follow the power of the questioner.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.120]   Together again.
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:57.360]   And I'll say together, join hands and say Skype is a worthless piece of junk.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.360]   Amen.
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:03.960]   I only, we only use it because we are forced to use it by the vice-semir popularity.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:08.280]   If we could sit and watch it die, we would watch it die without feeling an ounce of emotion
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.040]   one way or another.
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.040]   Amen.
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.560]   And now let's continue with Macbreak.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.560]   Thank you.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.160]   I'm sorry I needed to get that out of my system.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:20.760]   But I wanted to, I wanted to, on that point of like not actually attending the sessions
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.360]   of WWDC but still singing this sort of important.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:29.240]   We have a bunch of people, two of whom are can actually go to the area of WWDC and see
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.880]   the, if Apple does a media event the first day, they can go to that for essentially the
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.480]   cost of city parking.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:38.680]   John and I will have to pay a bit more than that to fly out to San Francisco.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:43.880]   But I assume that all of us are going to go to San Francisco for to be in time for this
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:44.880]   week.
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:45.880]   Oh yeah.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:46.880]   John, you're going to find out?
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.880]   Yeah, I'll be there.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:50.880]   So what do you expect?
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.880]   I guess.
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:56.320]   What do you expect to get by having your, by having boots on the ground for that week?
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:03.040]   Well it's, I go because, I mean the primary reason I go is it's the best way to meet other
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.240]   people in the industry face to face.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:12.120]   And there's no better way to build trust to, and I'm not even talking about getting inside
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.600]   information or anything like that.
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.680]   It just is, you know, there's an awful lot of people who I consider to be good sources
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:21.200]   or people who I can just throw a fact to and say, "Hey, am I insane?
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:25.840]   Here's the angle I'm sort of taking on this piece, but am I nuts to write this?"
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:30.240]   But I know that it's right up their alley and they can just say, "Send back to me."
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:36.280]   Yeah, you know what, I think you have a good point there or no, I think you're kind of,
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.760]   I think you're off base.
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:43.640]   I have a lot more people who I can send those things to, who I've met face to face than people
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.640]   who I haven't met face to face.
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:52.480]   And it's by far and away, especially now that Apple itself has pulled out of all, you know,
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:57.240]   things like, you know, Macworld Expo in the summer went away almost, or maybe more than
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.240]   a decade ago.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:03.720]   You forget, but now that they've pulled out of Macworld in San Francisco, it's really
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:08.840]   the only chance you get to meet people who actually work at Apple face to face.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:14.840]   So for me, it's worth it just to build, you know, I hate to use the term, but just for
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.200]   networking purposes.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.080]   Yeah, there's definitely that.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:23.000]   If you go out to breakfast at Melzdiner, you will essentially see the authors of pretty
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.200]   much every app that you ever care to use ever, all having $10 on what's around you.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.760]   Jason, your life has got to be pretty much centered around Moscone Center that week.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:35.840]   Yeah, it's easier for me because, you know, I take the plus.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.600]   I don't even have to pay for the city parking.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.680]   It's four blocks away from my office, but it's incredibly valuable.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.680]   It's a great week because all the developers are there.
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:48.400]   These little conferences, like the one you and John went to, are great.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:54.920]   I love those conferences, but WWDC is different in that almost everybody with the exception
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:48:00.120]   of Rich this year, who is an Apple developer is there and all the people from Apple are
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:01.120]   there.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.040]   And basically all the people from the media are there because Monday they invite the
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.480]   media to the keynote.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:11.320]   And so it is the definitive event for Apple because you don't have at an Apple media event,
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:15.120]   only the media and analysts are there, and some people from Apple, but the developers
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.120]   aren't there at those.
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:19.520]   And Macworld Expo, you'll get a lot of developers there and you'll get some media there, but
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:20.640]   you don't get Apple there.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.520]   So this is the big social event, really.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.920]   And I would be very sad if it didn't exist.
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.760]   It really needs to be there.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:34.520]   It's a vital part of the Apple world because everybody who's anybody really is at WWDC.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:41.520]   No, no, as members of the members of the August media, are we expecting big announcements
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.520]   for WWDC?
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:47.640]   It used to be just like clockwork, you could expect the big iOS announcement for the iPhone
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.280]   platform to happen in June or July.
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:53.240]   Now that's not quite so reliable anymore.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:55.680]   What are we thinking we're going to be hearing if they do to a media event day?
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.400]   Well, it's a developers conference, right?
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:02.880]   And I think Apple's pretty good at making it primarily a developer message and focusing
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:07.240]   the whatever big announcements they've got on things that are also relevant to developers,
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:11.200]   which is why it's probably going to be at least primarily OS announcements.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.360]   We've had the pre-announcement of Mountain Lion.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.800]   I expect that we'll have more detail about what's going to happen with the release of
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.120]   Mountain Lion.
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:20.440]   When is that going to happen?
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.240]   How far along are they?
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.520]   And usually once a year we get an iOS announcement.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.120]   It would be iOS 6 now.
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:32.200]   And I would imagine we'll get a lot of detail about what that next wave of iOS is going
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.200]   to be to.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.760]   And maybe there'll be some hardware announcements there, but I don't think they're necessary.
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:40.960]   I think that the OS is, which are the things that the developers really care about, generally
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:44.640]   are going to be the backbone of any kind of media event that would happen.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:50.160]   Do you think the developers are generally happy this year?
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.800]   Or are they going there with a certain sense of expectation that some of their problems
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.560]   are going to get solved?
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:03.560]   I don't think there's a mutiny rising, but 2011 and early 2012 has marked in terms of
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:08.080]   talking with the developer friends, more angst, more agitize, more.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:11.800]   I really hope that they post a document at some point someplace explaining what the heck
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:15.240]   I'm supposed to be doing with those features that they told a million billion people around
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:16.240]   the world.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:19.720]   My app was supposed to support in three months time, but I have no idea how it's going to
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:20.720]   support it.
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:26.080]   I don't expect they're going to be showing up wearing Guy Foxmax or anything like that.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.840]   But there seems to be some grumbling in the year.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.840]   Is anybody else hearing that?
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.560]   I don't know.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:35.040]   I think they always grumbled.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:38.200]   This is when you smooth things out with developers, right?
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:40.520]   Yeah, developers love to complain, right?
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:41.840]   There's always something to complain about.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:42.840]   You complain about your tools.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.920]   You complain about the OS.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:49.920]   You can complain about the policy.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:57.240]   I think the big S word is going to be on everybody's lips at this developers conference.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:02.080]   The other S word, sandboxing.
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:09.480]   Because of course that is something that sort of publicly or semi publicly has been kicked
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:10.480]   around a lot.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:17.720]   Apple announced this at the developers conference in 2011 and they said, "Okay, by the beginning
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.760]   of November, you need to be sandboxed."
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:24.960]   Then they kicked that deadline down the road a little bit and it became March and then March
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:29.440]   came and it didn't happen and it became June.
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:38.840]   Apple's way of doing things sometimes involves saying, "This is how we're going to do it."
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:44.360]   Then everybody either comes along or pushes back.
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:50.080]   Pushing back is as important a part of the process is coming along.
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:56.040]   If developers push back, Apple says, "Okay, let's adjust and keep moving forward."
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:00.800]   I think we've seen some of that and I think that the deadline changes for sandboxing are
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.800]   the result of that.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:08.080]   I believe there have also been technical changes as a result of developer feedback and I think
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:14.800]   we're going to see that continue to evolve in particular because sandboxing is a very
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:17.800]   tricky and complicated issue.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:19.760]   You talk about trucks before.
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:25.560]   Well, if you're a truck, sandboxing presents a pretty serious issue.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.320]   There are a lot of unanswered questions.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:30.840]   There are a lot of answered questions and I think that Apple's going to be listening
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:31.840]   pretty carefully.
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:36.880]   They're going to need to listen pretty carefully and keep adjusting.
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:43.400]   I myself am curious to see what happens when June rolls around as far as sandboxing goes.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:48.440]   As far as announcements go, one thing that John touched on was the Macworld Expo and
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:52.160]   Apple having pulled out of it.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:53:00.480]   I see the WWDC keynote, the public keynote taking the place of the old Macworld Expo in
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:05.680]   Boston when it comes to Apple's summertime announcements.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:11.760]   Sure, not only has Jason said, will they announce things that are relevant to developers?
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:15.720]   OS announcements, yes.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:18.600]   We could see a hardware announcement.
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:20.760]   We have seen summertime hardware announcements.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:25.400]   You might also see things that pertain to back to school, although it's a little bit
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.960]   early for that.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:36.680]   I think the picture is pretty wide open for what we could see happening in June.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.840]   Everybody wants a new Mac Pro and it's May.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.960]   Could they wait until June to announce something?
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:42.960]   They might.
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:49.640]   Yeah, well, I already have an embossed number card in my wallet with a randomly generated
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.760]   number that I generated exactly two and a half months ago.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:58.200]   That the whatever number this is, that n- that n- that n- person to ask me about an Apple
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:03.880]   television set will get both a $20 gift card to Dunkin' Donuts and a punch right in the
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:04.880]   gut.
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:10.040]   So that's, that's, that's, if I'm really looking forward to like never having to answer that
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:14.920]   question again, I, I, I, I now want them just to get like, you know, you know, when you
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:18.480]   go to a waterbed store and they give you a free TV just for coming in and getting a sales
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:24.280]   pitch, if they just simply buy one of those like off brand, Lutonian manufactured TVs,
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:28.960]   put an Apple logo on it, that will solve all of our problems just by re- removing it
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.080]   as a topic of conversation.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:33.320]   So we're not going to know what's, we're not going to know what they're going to be
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:38.040]   announcing in June until June, but hopefully we'll have something less to talk about after
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.360]   that happens.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:41.080]   Two absolutely ridiculous stories.
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:42.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.080]   You're about to say?
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.880]   Well, I just had one thing to add on WWDC.
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:45.880]   Sure.
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:51.000]   The other thing is that there's an old saying that, that, or that when somebody comes into
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.800]   a lot of money and people say, well, that really, he, he really changed.
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.960]   He changed after he, he had success.
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:00.440]   I tend to think that it's not so much that people change when they have success is that
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:01.960]   their true selves come out.
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:05.480]   It's that when you don't have to answer to anybody else, the more independent you are,
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.920]   the freer you are to just sort of be yourself.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:09.680]   And I think you see that with companies too.
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:15.200]   And now that Apple is successful, I tend to think Apple is becoming more and more Apple-y
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:22.320]   and part of Apple's nature is to be a little insular and to work on things in private and
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.840]   then release them and just say, here's how they are.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:30.440]   And in some ways that doesn't work with developers, with third party developers where they need
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:31.600]   to get them on board.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:33.360]   And I'll just, just two quick examples.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:39.000]   One, what Rich said, sandboxing, which they sort of sprung on everybody last year.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.480]   And clearly, at both, in the immediate, like the first day after they announced it and
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:45.600]   what people were saying in the hallways.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:51.960]   And now, what is it, 10 months later, after they've missed three deadlines, it's very
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:56.680]   clear that there were an awful lot of cases, not even edge cases, like very common cases
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:00.400]   that Apple either didn't consider or just overlooked.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:05.720]   And I'll also say with the whole iCloud storage, which is clearly, I mean, they announced it
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:12.520]   as a primary focus for the company for the next 10 years of that, that's the new hub,
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:13.520]   is iCloud.
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:20.120]   Well, I don't think we're nearly as far towards using iCloud as our storage for lots
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:24.960]   and lots of stuff as Apple made it seem we'd be 10 months later a year ago.
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:31.040]   And I think a lot of that is that they, Apple doesn't do that well at the dance of, here's
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:36.400]   what we want to do is Apple, let us listen to what you need developers, the people writing
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:37.400]   all these apps.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.960]   What do you need from this?
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:41.600]   The back and forth happens very, very slowly.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:47.080]   So that's the thing that I'll keep my eye on at the keynote is how much have they reacted
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:50.960]   to the feedback they've gotten on those two things in the last year, and they have gotten
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:51.960]   an awful lot of feedback.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:54.560]   Yeah, that's for damn sure.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:57.040]   But do you think that's going to change at all?
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.760]   With Tim Cook in charge versus jobs?
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:04.680]   Because I know that I understand what you're saying that Apple becomes more Apple-y, but
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:09.040]   is that attitude changing a little bit in that Tim Cook has sort of signaled there's going
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:13.800]   to be a kinder, gentler Apple without completely opening up the kabana?
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:15.040]   I think that's very possible.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:19.920]   And I think that's definitely something that for us who like to read into every single
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:25.520]   thing they say and what they don't say, definitely something to keep an eye on going forward.
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:32.000]   And this will certainly be the first year, obviously, where the keynote is, the WWDC
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.160]   keynote is not influenced directly by Steve Jobs.
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:40.920]   Yeah, this is the first post jobs true Tim Cook in control message to developers.
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:45.880]   So that's going to be another high water mark to see if that attitude sort of changes.
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:46.880]   Right.
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:51.000]   How much of it is back and forth and how much of it is Apple coming down the mountain with
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:55.400]   this year's directives written on stone tablets?
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:56.920]   Here's what you're going to do this year.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.720]   Also, Apple has been spanked several times before.
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:04.160]   We forget the initial debacle about the iPhones at the original price where they thought they
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:06.960]   could charge about as much for a phone as for a laptop.
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:11.840]   And what was it six weeks later that they said, okay, just kidding about that original
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:12.840]   price.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.880]   Of course, we're only going to be charging you 299, which is pretty much what everyone else
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.840]   is charging for a smartphone.
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:23.320]   So do they listen or do they just realize that we're getting hit a lot in a very in very
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:24.640]   soft places of our body?
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:25.840]   We don't want to get hit anymore.
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:30.640]   And so we regretfully acknowledge that we have to sort of react to what how people are
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.120]   perceiving our decisions.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.240]   What do those things happen?
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:38.840]   I think sometimes it's Apple responds because there's a crisis and Apple needs to be seen
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:40.280]   as reacting to it.
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:42.560]   And then other times it is Apple listening.
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:46.040]   And I think with a lot of developer stuff, there are cases where Apple is really pushing
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.080]   something that it feels is the right thing to do.
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:51.000]   And it's going to say, yeah, I know you guys don't like it, but this is the right thing
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   to do.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:57.720]   Other times though, I think that there's internal strife at Apple and somebody wins and that's
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:58:59.080]   what gets announced.
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:04.280]   And everybody who disagreed with it is waiting to hear the developers say, wait a second,
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:07.280]   that doesn't make sense for all of these reasons, at which point those other people
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:10.400]   inside Apple can say, see, this is a problem.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.320]   And then there's an internal debate about it.
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:13.480]   And I do think that happens.
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:17.720]   And I think that what Rich said about the evolution of the sandboxing issue is a great
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:22.720]   example of that where Apple, you know, they, you know, Apple tends to like the Apple's
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:26.760]   very comfortable making pronouncements saying, this is how it's going to be.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:29.800]   But it does listen and it does evolve.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:35.880]   It's got a little more pride than to accept and talk about that openly, but it is happening
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.440]   with things like sandboxing.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.560]   So I think we'll see a little bit of both, right?
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:43.280]   We'll see some pronouncements and we'll see some evolution of Apple's past claims.
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:48.760]   And to John's point, I really hope that Apple treats their developers with some of that.
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.120]   Like, there's what we'd like you to do.
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:53.880]   It's always a better message to say, here's what we'd like you to do rather than, here's
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:56.200]   what we, here's what you will do for this next year.
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:57.200]   They're capable of it.
[00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.200]   There's going to be.
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.120]   Yeah, they're capable of it.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:05.880]   Well, there are two semi-ratticulous stories that, that crossed the wires last week.
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:11.800]   One is the absolute shock and scandal that Apple as a company might try to use legal
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:16.520]   means to pay somewhat less taxes than they might otherwise have to.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.560]   As you can see, I have not been able to feed Bay or clothe myself ever since I heard this
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.560]   news.
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.880]   I've been in the field position underneath that table over there.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:24.880]   I'm shocked.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.320]   I think this is an issue.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:34.800]   Yeah, it's more of the junior high school, click sort of dynamic at play that's more
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:35.800]   interesting.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:42.080]   This story initially was put out by New York Times, which already is getting some heat
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.440]   over all their coverage about Apple's labor practices.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:49.840]   And then Forbes came out with an article after the New York Times scandalous piece about
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.480]   the tax situation saying, yeah, you know what?
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:56.840]   Basically, when you tell how little percentage of Apple's income they've paid in taxes, you're
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:01.120]   basically basing their current profits off the estimated taxes that they went that they
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:05.840]   made two years, a year or two ago before that before they had all these earnings.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:09.040]   And so your estimates are way, way, way out of whack.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.920]   So there's a lot of TMZ.com style.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.120]   Well, he said it then she said, but you won't believe what the New York Times said after
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.520]   she heard.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.440]   But is this is this is this any kind of a story?
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.360]   Is anybody having opinion on this?
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:24.960]   It's a story, but it's not a story about Apple, right?
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:31.160]   It's a story about about taxes and regulation and you know, companies, public companies
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:35.560]   have a financial duty to their shareholders to make as much money as possible.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:40.640]   And that includes using all existing laws in order to make as much money and pay as
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.720]   little in taxes.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:46.360]   So this is this is a little like those stories about millionaires saying, you should tax
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.360]   me more.
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:51.080]   And then other people coming out and saying, why don't you just write a big check?
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:54.440]   The whole point is if I don't have to pay you money, I won't.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.600]   So you should make everybody have to pay.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:00.120]   And that's why this story is a tax reform story more than anything else.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.880]   Because you know, Apple's never going to just donate money to the government out of the
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:07.200]   goodness of his heart, just like no other public company is going to do that.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:11.480]   So you know, Apple's a great example because they're riding high, but this is a this is
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:13.800]   a tax reform story, not an Apple story.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:19.520]   Yeah, I think Apple during the during the the city county, Cupertino City Council meeting
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:24.200]   in which Steve Jobs came and presented the idea for the new Apple campus.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.400]   There's that famous quote where a city councilman was sort of hopefully saying, yeah, what
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.600]   we're wondering, like, since you're putting all this money into your building, maybe you
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:34.680]   could also give us like free Wi-Fi for the whole city.
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:38.760]   And then Steve just smiled and said, yeah, well, our philosophy is that we pay you a
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:45.280]   huge amount of money in taxes that you can then use to go buy your own Wi-Fi.
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:50.280]   So I think that that's pretty much the Apple attitude towards taxation in a nutshell.
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.560]   I mean, but you're right, Jason.
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:55.520]   If you if you lay two pairs of shoes in front of somebody, one is a tight, uncomfortable
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.920]   pair of shoes and the others are a pair of ugs that are loose, warm and comfortable.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:02.720]   Yeah, they're probably going to choose the ones that hurt less to actually use.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:06.000]   I think that seems like an actually correct thing.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.080]   One of the other story that was kind of more kind of more interesting comes from a book
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:15.040]   by Ken Siegel coming out called Insanely Simple, the Obsession that Drives Apple's
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.040]   success.
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:21.680]   A story which he claims is well sourced said that during Apple's comeback when they were
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:27.760]   shipping new iMacs, Steve Jobs had this idea where he wanted to include a Willy Wonka-style
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:33.440]   golden ticket inside the one millionth Mac that they shipped and that if you bought
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:37.520]   an iMac and open it and got the golden ticket, Steve Jobs would come, we would become the
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.680]   Cupertino, Steve Jobs.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.840]   This is the part where I had to read three times to see if it was actually sourced.
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.040]   It was apparently.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:48.760]   He wanted to show up dressed like Willy Wonka in a top hat and tails and take you on a tour
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.840]   of the Apple Campus.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:57.720]   And supposedly the only reason why Steve got talked out of this was because California
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:02.640]   law says that they couldn't do a sweepstakes that required the purchase of an iMac.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:09.040]   And if not for that, there would be somewhere hanging in some closet, a mock turtleneck
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.720]   version of Gene Wilder's costume from Willy Wonka.
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.560]   I want everybody's take on this.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:21.080]   I also want to know that if Slugworth were to pursue each of these winners, what device
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:28.400]   would they want this person to steal off the Apple Campus and what absolutely amusing
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.520]   fate would befall each of them, Bopel's own oompa-loompas.
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:35.040]   And I'm going to start with you, Jason.
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.760]   Could you repeat the question you're breaking up?
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.560]   Your Skype is killing.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.560]   Oompa-loompas?
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.200]   Something about oompa-loompas?
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:42.200]   Yes.
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:48.240]   I'm not crazy about the color, though.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:52.520]   It's not a Johnny Ives sort of palette color orange for an oompa-loompa.
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:56.560]   Although the pocketed shorts really are very comfortable in room, especially in the summer
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.560]   months.
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:03.960]   I'm sorry, if a contest winner is getting a tour of the Apple Campus and you basically
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:08.200]   happen to have cornered them in a dimly lit alley, you've got the dark suit, you've got
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:12.240]   the thick glasses, you're saying, "Congratulations, young boy.
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.840]   I will give you 10,000 American dollars.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:21.520]   If you can withdraw from the factory information about the following product, remember this
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.640]   name, boy, and the wisp money will be yours."
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:30.280]   So what I'd say is that Steve Jobs was a much better businessman than Willy Wonka.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:34.280]   And he would absolutely not take the contest winner.
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:37.720]   Remember that Willy Wonka really knew how to control labor costs.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:40.200]   He had a very fixed targeted demographic.
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.560]   He had his own R&D, a secret of R&D department.
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:50.360]   I saw 13-year-old oompa-loompas going through the gates at the Willy Wonka chocolate factory
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:54.360]   when I was in wherever his factory was.
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.360]   Yes.
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:56.360]   Exactly.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:59.160]   Jobs is not going to take people past the fizzy lifting drinks and the everlasting
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:04.480]   gobstoppers and the TV that makes you into a person in a TV set.
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:05.480]   He's Wonka Vision.
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:06.480]   Thank you.
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.480]   He's not going to do that.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:09.480]   He's going to take them to the cafe.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.440]   You're so super secret TV-set.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.600]   The parallels are frightening.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.600]   Yeah, it is.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.800]   Gene Munster put you up to that, I bet.
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.680]   So I don't know.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:22.960]   I think that Steve Jobs, going to the mothership, going to the cafe max, walking around, introducing
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.160]   them to some people.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:29.920]   I think having been to that, as I think John was, into that the radio testing lab with
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:34.000]   the Anechoic chambers and all of that, that was the first time anybody from the public
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.760]   had been led in there.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:40.040]   I felt like the snipers were trained on us and they were like black cloths over everything
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.600]   that might possibly be.
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.520]   We were hardly industrial spies.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:47.120]   We were a bunch of shell shock journalists.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:51.760]   Steve Jobs would not reveal the crown jewels to the winner of the...
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:56.200]   He'd buy him some pasta at the cafe and call it a day.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:57.200]   That's my prediction.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:02.480]   Plus nobody would ever, ever get on the great glass elevator with Steve Jobs because it
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.480]   would be the...
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.480]   He would yell at them, yeah.
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.480]   He would yell at them.
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:09.560]   He'd like to build with glass, free-stranding structures without any elements.
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:14.160]   Oh my God, we're peeling the onion here.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:19.400]   My problem with the story is that...
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:25.160]   Not that I don't believe it because there's no reason to dispute Seagal's writing on it.
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:30.560]   But the problem I have getting it into my head is that in my mind Steve Jobs was one
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:34.320]   of the coolest guys who ever lived and this does not sound cool at all.
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:38.080]   This sounds incredibly awkward and uncool.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:43.880]   It's like finding out that Paul Newman had a pair of pink slippers that every time he
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:48.480]   watched TV, he wouldn't turn it on unless he was wearing his fluffy pink slippers or
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.480]   something like that.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:56.800]   It just doesn't fit into my head of the way I conceived of Steve Jobs.
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.360]   I think it was one of Steve's flashback days.
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:06.000]   I think it was just a regrettable thing that went back to the '70s and some of the...
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   I know.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.960]   No, no, no, Steve, let's talk tomorrow.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.480]   And the next day he said, oh yeah, a terrible idea.
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.640]   But going to your slug worth point.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:19.440]   In this case, I think that slug worth, instead of actually secretly working for Jobs, actually
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.080]   was working for Microsoft.
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:27.440]   And the one thing that they wanted was the Pitman because they thought maybe finally they
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:30.960]   would get on top of something and get ahead of the game.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.960]   And that's actually what happened.
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.520]   And finally the Xbox came out.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:37.760]   So it shows you that every once in a while these things pay off.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:41.360]   Rich, what do you think?
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:48.960]   You know, I got stuck on the vision of Steve Jobs wearing Paul Newman's fuzzy pink slippers.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:52.680]   Slippers and I never quite got over it.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.520]   Now I can't see it happening.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:09:01.760]   I could see having lunch with him and maybe an hour alone in the Apple company store.
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:05.320]   But no, not much more than that really.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:09.440]   Andy, I've known you for almost 20 years and this is the most complex and bizarre hypothetical
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:11.320]   question I have ever heard come from you.
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.320]   So congratulations, sir.
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:15.840]   I'm trying to keep you on your toes, gentlemen.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:18.960]   Make sure you get your protein when you know you're going to be on a panel with me sometime
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.200]   later in the day.
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.680]   The other thing too.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.360]   I should go ahead.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:28.560]   Well, here's the thing is if you got to meet Steve Jobs, wouldn't you be disappointed if
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:35.360]   it happened and he was wearing anything other than a black turtleneck, Levi's jeans and
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.360]   new balance 991s?
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:41.600]   If he was wearing anything other than those things, you'd be ripped off, let alone if
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.320]   he's dressed up as Willie Wong.
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:48.440]   Maybe it's like a quick release outfit like what strippers wear and he'd pull it off and
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:53.120]   the black turtleneck would be underneath.
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:56.960]   Dennis Leary tells the story about meeting Dean Martin.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:01.640]   And so he's like really excited because we Dean Martin even like in his old age was still
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.760]   the coolest guy in the world.
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:03.760]   He was still Dean Martin.
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:07.880]   And he's all excited about going to his house and meeting him for going to his house for
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.880]   a drink.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:13.040]   And Dean Martin answers the door and he's then Dennis Leary is disappointed because he's
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:16.000]   wearing a member's only jacket.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.880]   But then he says, but then like five minutes later, I'm like, God, I want to get a member's
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:21.880]   only jacket.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:23.440]   That looks pretty cool on him.
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:29.320]   So we would all be shopping for like, you know, pumpkin orange top hats after that first
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:33.920]   press photo of Steve Jobs and the Willie Wonka costume was released.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.920]   Okay.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:38.000]   Well, we got, I think we, I think we crack this.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.880]   We crack the code on the Wonka slash app singularity and we're going to leave it for younger and
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:49.440]   more energetic and more LSD fueled journalists to pursue.
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.480]   We're going to get to our tips of the week and our picks of the week.
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:56.840]   But before that a shout out to our friends at audible.com.
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:01.760]   I am, there are so many people who are really big, big fans of audio books.
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.440]   Podcasts are great.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:04.560]   You're listening to one right now.
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.480]   Hopefully I, each one of us could list the 10 of them that we spend way, way too much
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.560]   of our free time listening to.
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:15.800]   But it's always so wonderful when you get a chance to read a full length book from name
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:21.200]   brand and not so name brand authors read by some really, really great voices.
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.520]   And audible has tens of thousands of these books, no matter what topic you want, whether
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:27.640]   it's fiction, whether it's nonfiction, whether it's people that you like or people that
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:34.040]   you, your mom likes to read, you'll find titles there in on audible.com.
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:39.840]   My pick for this week of a title that you can download and try for free is my, probably
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:42.200]   my favorite John Steinbeck book.
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:45.200]   Also probably one of my favorite blogs ever.
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:50.880]   Unfortunately, he wrote this in 1962 before there was such a thing as ASCII text.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.960]   And so it was forced to actually write it in the form of a book.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:59.240]   It's called travels with Charlie in search of America, where Steinbeck, he was in his old
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.240]   age.
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:07.160]   He got into his head that he really wanted to buy an RV, load the RV with camping equipment,
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:11.680]   a couple of guns and his dog Charlie and just drive around the country revisiting all the
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.400]   places that he used to go to when he was a kid and sort of see how things had changed.
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:16.760]   He didn't have really have a book in mind.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:21.840]   He just wanted to, you know, enjoy a little vacation on his own sleeping in the back of
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:27.120]   a truck that he named a Rossignante after Don Quixote's horse.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.000]   Yes, as you can imagine, his wife and all his friends said, yeah, you're going to be
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.120]   driving down the backwoods of the south, the Midwest and the northwest, northeast in a
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.080]   truck all by yourself.
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:38.880]   You are kind of an idiot, John.
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:42.480]   You're a very well written idiot, but you're still kind of an idiot.
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:46.960]   But it's a book that is always on every single phone and every single ebook reader that I
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:51.800]   have because every time I'm traveling, I usually dip into it and read another couple of chapters.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:56.880]   I was reading it on the plane, as a matter of fact, yesterday on the way back from Ireland.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:03.440]   And this book, as well as pretty much any other, can be yours for free if you go to audible.com/macbreak
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:05.920]   to download your free book.
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:08.800]   You have to tip every single week.
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:13.120]   When we never ever run out of great titles, there's millions of titles figuratively speaking
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.960]   in the backlist and more to come every week.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.600]   Now let's go into our tips of the week.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.160]   Chris, you have an iOS tip for us.
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:23.640]   I do.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:30.000]   Sometimes one travels abroad, as both you and John have the opportunity to do this last
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   week to go to Ireland.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.200]   Well, let's say that I'm going to be traveling abroad and have my iPad with me and maybe
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:44.040]   I'm not going to have access to GPS or Wi-Fi or whatever expensive wireless plan there
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.040]   is abroad.
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.920]   And instead, I'm going to be traveling to a city.
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:52.840]   So what I try to do then is I cache maps before I leave.
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:59.360]   So in this case, let's say I were going from Phoenix Park in Dublin and I wanted to go
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:01.520]   to Trinity College afterwards.
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:05.720]   So I would pull up the maps app while I have Wi-Fi access.
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:07.440]   So I'm at home or at the airport.
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:08.440]   I pull that stuff up.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:15.920]   And then once I've got my route selected, I click on list and I can see the steps where
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:17.400]   I need to travel.
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:22.240]   So if I were making the walk from Phoenix Park to Trinity College, and then I do something
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:25.600]   really, really analog and I just take a screenshot of it.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:30.880]   And so I find the six or seven little trips that I intend to take while I'm in Dublin
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.640]   or wherever I happen to be traveling, I pull up the map so I can get a general idea of where
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:36.760]   I'm going to be walking.
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:40.240]   And then I pull up the list and if the list is too long, you scroll it up and you take
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:41.640]   two screenshots.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.880]   And then I cache those in my photo album.
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:48.040]   So that later, whenever I am, I can pull up those spots.
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.120]   First of all, it reminds me that, oh yes, I intended to do this.
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:54.720]   Secondly, it gives me the steps for doing exactly that.
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:15:00.600]   So it's pretty analog and it's pretty simple, but it's a good idea to take screenshots of
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.360]   things that you want to remember, particularly if you're going to need internet access or
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:07.040]   Wi-Fi access and you don't have it.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.280]   And that's my iOS tip.
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.400]   Yeah, the screen capture, if you don't have, if you never use it, hold on the home button,
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:17.120]   press the power button at the same time, you'll hear a camera click.
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:20.760]   And it will save the screen to your pictures folder.
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:21.920]   I use that all the time.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.920]   What kind of sickens me is that I, especially when I'm traveling, I will do that to an email
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:32.480]   that has information that I absolutely need because I have from absolute sad and wearying
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.480]   experience.
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:39.880]   I know that my ability to use the iOS mail app to search my existing inbox for an email
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:44.680]   from an address that I know for a fact to the letter it came from is pretty variable.
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:48.040]   If I really want to get that address later on, I'm really going to have to take a screen
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:51.440]   capture of that piece of email.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:55.200]   And Jason, you've got our back of us because of the week, don't you?
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:56.200]   I do.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.200]   I have a Mac tip.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:01.080]   This is a feature in Lion, but I think that not a lot of people know about it.
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:03.040]   And I'm surprised how many people don't know about it.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:09.480]   So basically, when you're in the Finder, if you click in the search box and start typing,
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:13.920]   it will do a traditional spotlight search, which I'm going to do on my computer here,
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.040]   which I don't think you can see.
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.360]   So that's unfortunate.
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:20.840]   But if you wait, a little pop-up will come up and it'll give you some options about how
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:23.480]   to define what you typed and what it means.
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.800]   And one of them is just the content.
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:27.760]   You can also do something like file name.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:32.160]   So if I type, if I'm searching for a JPEG with the name iTunes in it, I can choose file
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:35.640]   name and I just click on the thing that says file name contains iTunes.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:39.880]   And then I type JPEG, literally just the next thing in that search, and it'll pop up with
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.960]   an item that says file name contains JPEG or kinds JPEG image.
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:48.360]   And then I click on that and it's building these little tiny chunks all stacked together
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:51.480]   in that spotlight window that says, oh, look, there it is.
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:54.080]   That's my computer that says these things.
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:56.400]   And then it says search the desktop.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.480]   I can search this Mac.
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:59.560]   And here come all the hits that are up there.
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:03.360]   It's search by name and with a certain file type.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.440]   This is really easy.
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:09.160]   It's much easier than the old method where you had to sort of type kind colon and JPEG
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.360]   and hope that worked.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.880]   If you start typing something in, it'll try to guess.
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:14.120]   Do you mean the name?
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.120]   Do you mean the contents?
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.440]   Do you mean a file type?
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:21.200]   So if you're looking for a Photoshop file with a certain word, you can do it very quickly.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:26.240]   And then of course, you can always click save to save that out permanently in your saved
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.880]   searches and get back to it later.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:32.880]   But I think people don't know just how easy it is to do these more advanced searches in
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:35.160]   Lion in the Finder than you could do before.
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:39.280]   It's not just full text search of contents of your documents anymore.
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:43.360]   You can actually very quickly come in and search by name and by kind and stack them up
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.360]   and find exactly what you're looking for.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.760]   So you should try it.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:47.760]   I use it all the time.
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.600]   I use it much more than I use Spotlight Search.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.640]   I basically don't use Spotlight Search in the Spotlight menu.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:53.640]   It's very rare.
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:56.440]   I use the search in the Finder every single day.
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:02.080]   And isn't it cool to find out exactly how many different things you can search on?
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:07.880]   I mean, whenever I'm trying to make a point about how good just the Spotlight engine is,
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:16.400]   I just do a demo where you can do a search for just the fireworks photos from the 4th
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.400]   of July just by simply saying that you've shot with your iPhone.
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:25.520]   You can say do a search for pictures shot with an iPhone on July 4 of any year that
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:30.760]   where the shutter speed was at least this and the time was after 6 p.m.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:35.520]   And you can build that search and not only find those photos but also save that as a
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:40.320]   smart folder and any time that any sort of a supposed 4th of July fireworks photo lands
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:45.080]   on your lands on that folder and lands on your computer and land in the smart search
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.080]   folder.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.760]   So thank you very much for that tip.
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:51.480]   And I'll just move on to our picks of the week and haven't heard from Rich for a while.
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:52.560]   So Rich, why don't we start off with you?
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.160]   I know you got a really good utility.
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:57.240]   I have this one myself and I used it for the past six months.
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:59.320]   I'm sorry for the past couple months.
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:05.520]   I was introduced to this neat little trick by that's developer.
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:08.680]   The application is called drag and drop.
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:11.240]   Drag and the RAGON drop.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:13.200]   One word.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.840]   And what it does is it puts a little well on your screen.
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:21.080]   You can start dragging something, anything, text, the picture, anything you could drag
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:23.840]   from one application to the other.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:29.080]   And you shake your mouse and it puts a little well on the screen.
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:33.240]   I see somebody playing the demo film there.
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:38.440]   And you drop it in there and then you can go find your buried destination.
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:42.760]   Now you might say, oh, well, I knew that I could switch applications while I was in the
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:44.720]   middle of a drag.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:51.120]   But this really goes far beyond that if the window that you want to drop into is buried
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:54.000]   then switching applications doesn't help you.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.480]   So the well is just extremely handy.
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:01.040]   It also supports pasting into the well so you could copy and paste into the well then
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:04.960]   go find your target and drop it in there as well.
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:11.120]   So it's very cleverly done, very nicely executed little product.
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:19.840]   And its usefulness goes far, far, far beyond the $4.99 asking price.
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:22.560]   I approve of his choice of distribution methods.
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:27.040]   He's got it both in the Mac App Store and for direct sale.
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.360]   That's shinyplasticbag.com/dragandrop.
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:36.920]   Yeah, I mean, there are those utilities that you install them then you realize why has
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:41.640]   this not been part of the OS since 10.4?
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:45.040]   This wasn't as important as getting print servers actually working on the operating
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.040]   system.
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:49.600]   But why is it so difficult to move data from one app to another when I have more than four
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.440]   windows on the screen at the same time?
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:56.480]   So yes, that's a hearty endorsement from many places there.
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:58.920]   Chris, what's your pick?
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.760]   I actually have two picks.
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:05.520]   Last week was Audubon's birthday, the bird guy.
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:10.480]   And if you watch birds at all, if you like tracking down birds, you have a copy of this.
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:13.040]   This is the Peterson guide.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:17.840]   And there are several bird books around and people are using different ones like this
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.320]   and the National Geographic has one.
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:25.800]   One thing unique about the Peterson guides is that they're all drawings instead of photographs.
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:28.920]   The tendency now is to go for photographs.
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:31.600]   But the traditionalists still carry Peterson.
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:34.760]   Well, the birders rarely carry these books anymore.
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:38.160]   They don't need to because they have apps for all these things.
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:44.080]   So there are a couple of bird apps because of Audubon's birthday that were on sale.
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:45.080]   And one still is.
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:51.880]   The Peterson guide is normally $20 and now it is just 99 cents on the app store.
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:56.960]   So if you have any desire to go out and look at birds, it's a very handy guide.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:57.960]   Oh, good.
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:58.960]   You can see it on the screen.
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:03.280]   So it has the same illustrations that they use in the Western and the Eastern bird guides.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:06.560]   And this covers the US and Canada.
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:10.640]   It also has a directory of bird calls.
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:15.640]   So unfortunately, nobody has yet come out with the Shazam for bird calls where you can hold
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:18.720]   up your phone, hear a bird call and have it identified.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:21.880]   There actually is that there is this technology I've been told.
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:26.800]   But it's very expensive and it's sold not in an iOS form.
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:29.120]   So we're hoping that somebody will get that eventually.
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:31.000]   So Peterson guide is one.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.280]   And then there's Audubon Birds, which is a field guide to North American birds.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:37.360]   That was 99 cents last week.
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:42.360]   It's now up to 299, but still that's much less than the $20 it was before.
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:45.200]   The interface isn't as elegant as the Peterson guide.
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:49.680]   But one thing about this that I love is that it works with location.
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:53.600]   And if you're a serious bird or even a medium to serious bird or one of the things that
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:57.960]   you want to know is what around to me right now is rare.
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:00.440]   What bird near here shouldn't be here?
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:04.760]   For example, where I live near Santa Cruz, California, there are a pair of bald eagles
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:05.920]   nesting.
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:08.320]   We do not have bald eagles here ever.
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:10.040]   So this is a huge deal.
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:17.120]   So all you have to do is enter a search location, so Santa Cruz, for example, and it will tell
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:18.120]   where you are.
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:21.280]   And then you click on birds that have been spotted in your area and it keeps a track
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.360]   of about the last three weeks.
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:27.960]   And in this case, it showed that there were indeed this pair of nesting bald eagles.
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.960]   It told you where they were sighted.
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:33.440]   So if you're a birder, then you go out and you can add to your lifeless.
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:38.640]   Many of lifeless, both of these apps have lifeless in them, which is I've seen a new
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:44.200]   bird punch a button and you can automatically document where you were when you saw at the
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:47.120]   time and then you can add any notes you like.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:51.600]   So again, this is much easier than carrying around that little scribbly notebook that
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:52.760]   birders used to carry around.
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.400]   Now it's just simply a tap.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:55.480]   Here's where I was.
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:56.480]   This is the document.
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:00.160]   If you like, you can take a picture and then incorporate it into the app.
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.080]   Both of these are brilliant apps.
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:05.160]   There are two other bird apps that aren't on sale but are worth looking at.
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:07.560]   That's the Sibley Guide, which two is a book.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:11.360]   And then there's Ibird Pro, which has been around for several years now.
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:14.240]   Excellent apps, all four of them are excellent.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:18.480]   And if you're a bird watcher, it's likely that you're going to carry more than one of
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:19.480]   these things around.
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:23.560]   So right now, the best bargain is the Peterson Guide and the Audubon Guide.
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:24.560]   Excellent.
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.880]   Chris, are you a birder?
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:27.880]   I am.
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:29.720]   I'm not a really good birder.
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:35.240]   But it's something, because it works with geeks, and I'm sure there's some geeks listening
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:37.880]   out there who are going, "Oh, bird watching."
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:42.880]   But what it does is it gives you an excuse to go outside and hunt for something without
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.800]   killing it.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:48.120]   And for geeks it's good because you're curious, you want to find something because you need
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:52.320]   to have some other reason to be outside instead of just being outside.
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:58.480]   So it really is a great occupation for people who are curious but need that motivation other
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:03.000]   than just getting exercise and getting some vitamin D.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.280]   Yeah, I know the feeling.
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:10.760]   I take my regular constitutional but mostly it's because I got this new pedometer gadget
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:16.640]   that hooks up via USB and I just want to play those little games and get the idea that
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:20.720]   Andy, you'll get fresh air, you'll extend your lifespan, you'll control, all these things
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:21.720]   are good.
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:23.080]   No, that's not a convincing enough argument.
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:28.440]   Yes, but if you get those 500 more steps, you'll get two more gold coins, you got me.
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:29.440]   That's it.
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:32.440]   Jason, what's your pick this week?
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:36.680]   My pick is a game that I heard about on the internet.
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:41.360]   It's an iPhone and iPad game called Magnetic Billiard's Blueprint.
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:44.000]   It's got this whole big website.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.600]   It's by the Pickford Brothers.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:47.600]   And you know what?
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.160]   It is really good.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:50.880]   I'm sorry, I've just moved it.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:51.880]   There it is.
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:56.240]   So it's a geometric game.
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:01.200]   It's very much like the game it reminds me of is Orbital, which is one of the most addicting
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.560]   iOS games that I've ever seen.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:09.320]   It basically, it is like Billiards in that you have to make shots with these various colored
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:14.000]   balls that are on the screen and you get points for banking them off the wall and for getting
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:19.880]   near but not touching balls of different colors before hitting the same colored balls.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.560]   And then they form geometric shapes.
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:25.120]   They adhere together and you get bonus points for various things.
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:29.440]   And it's a great sort of way to pass the time.
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.440]   It's shocking.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:35.480]   One of the terrible mistakes is giving you a game center reward for playing the game
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.760]   for an hour because you go, "What?
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:38.960]   That was an hour?"
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.600]   And it's quite disturbing to discover that.
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:43.480]   But it is a lot of fun.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.400]   You know, I've been playing it for the last few weeks.
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.400]   And it's a little quirky.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:51.600]   It's got a lot of synthesized voice sound effects and it tells you things like, "Cool
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:53.840]   a shot with these robot voices."
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:58.880]   And the authors of the game pop up at various points to tell you things.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.920]   So it's definitely got a kind of quirky handmade feel to it.
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:04.880]   But at its core, it is this really cool geometric.
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:11.440]   It's all about angles and the amount of spin or the amount of power you put into your shot.
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.240]   And you can make some really terrible shots.
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:17.200]   And over time you learn to make these really precise great shots.
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:19.160]   So it's not even though it's called Billiards.
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:24.120]   It's really not so much a Billiards game as it is a strange kind of geometry and physics
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:28.840]   game for iOS that if you ever played Orbital and if you haven't, you should look for Orbital
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:31.120]   too because it's fantastic as well.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.120]   It's in that vein.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:33.880]   You can just play it forever.
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.480]   So magnetic Billiards.
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:37.360]   And I think it's free.
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:40.800]   And then for some extra levels there are in-app purchases.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:45.680]   But you can play for well over an hour, let me tell you, without making any in-app purchases.
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:52.000]   That sounds like exactly my kind of game because I had to kind of quit using Orbital because
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.320]   I found myself every time I had more than 20 seconds worth of idle time, I would be
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:59.600]   like getting out of Orbital to see if I can get at least one game going.
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:04.560]   I realized that I was not at any point during the day I was never giving my brain even one
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:08.120]   minute to shut down because I was feeling all of my downtime with Orbital.
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:10.400]   I felt as though that was medically contradicting it.
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:11.400]   Yeah, it's a dangerous game.
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:12.400]   But it's great.
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:15.960]   If you want to throw your life away, Orbital is the game for you.
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:17.880]   Try it out and then magnetic Billiards.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.720]   It's broken like a dead.
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:25.320]   If you want to throw your life away with those damn computer games, I can't stop you.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:27.520]   You can break your computer with those.
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:32.040]   John, what's your pick?
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:36.480]   My pick is an iPhone app called Screenshot Journal.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:42.840]   So it sort of ties in nicely with Chris's tip from earlier.
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:50.880]   And it's an app by UIforge, which means it's designed by my friend Brian Bell, also a mutual
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:53.280]   friend of Rich.
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:59.000]   He's done some icon design for bare bones and Jacob White, who did the programming.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.480]   And it's a very simple app.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:03.040]   It is for people, for UI designers.
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:07.360]   I use it as a beta tester for iOS apps.
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:10.040]   And all you do, it looks through your camera library.
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:14.600]   It finds the images in your camera library that are screenshots.
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:19.240]   And it puts them, separates them from your main library of photos.
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:20.760]   Just shows you your screenshots.
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:26.120]   It lets you open them up and zoom in with pixel precision.
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:29.360]   And the big thing to understand is that, well, why not just use the camera app, which
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:30.440]   lets you zoom in a little.
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:34.360]   Number one, Screenshot Journal lets you zoom in way more.
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:39.920]   And number two, the big thing, if you're talking about nitpicking little, literally just pixel
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:45.920]   level details, when you zoom in in this app, it just makes the pixels bigger.
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:49.440]   And it looks real, real pixel-y and blocky, which is exactly what you want.
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:54.560]   Whereas the built-in camera app does something which is the right thing, in most cases, for
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:58.800]   most people, which is when you zoom in, it kind of blurs everything to try to keep it
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:04.040]   looking more aesthetically pleasing, like when you zoom in on a photo, which is exactly
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:10.920]   not what you want when you want to argue about pixel level precision of UI graphics.
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:15.040]   It is, however, I must warn you, it is an extremely expensive app.
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:18.320]   You are probably going to have to take out a second mortgage on your home to afford it.
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:20.320]   It costs $1.99.
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:23.160]   Damn it.
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:24.160]   That's outrageous.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:25.160]   Forget it.
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:26.160]   Clearly it should be.
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:30.880]   I will, however, for Brian and I will vouch for that app as well.
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:34.200]   It's an excellent little product.
[01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:40.760]   And I have been, and will remain a fan of Brian's work because he's a very talented
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:42.000]   designer.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.160]   It is a very simple idea.
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:48.920]   And the fact that Brian is a terrific designer means that the app itself, even though it's
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:55.120]   meant for you to use to examine your own UI designs, the app itself has a very, very pleasant,
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:31:03.160]   simple, obvious, but very, very aesthetically pleasing design to great little app.
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:04.920]   One star.
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:08.280]   Why does this cost $1.99?
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:11.840]   This should be free.
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:16.280]   Did you write that in all caps because that's mandatory when you give it a review like that?
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:19.160]   No, no, I was using all kinds of international characters.
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:22.000]   The Arabic characters let you do like fake smiles and stuff.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.080]   I believe my message will have been sent.
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:31.320]   My own pick of the week is a really cool camera app that I was told about during the trip,
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:32.320]   as a matter of fact.
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:35.320]   I have yet to find a camera app that I really, really like.
[01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:40.040]   I find a lot of different apps that have a little bit of what I want in the camera app.
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:44.240]   Chiefly, what I want is an app that doesn't accidentally start taking video when I meant
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:46.000]   for it to start shooting pictures.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.280]   So if you can just do that, then I think that you're well in your way.
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:57.080]   This is 645 Pro by Jagger, JAG.GR's URL.
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:58.880]   It's also of course in the app store.
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:03.920]   Tries to emulate a professional level camera.
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:08.640]   And so you get this really, really cool professional level camera interface.
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:12.360]   You've got two wheels on the side here for selecting what film format you want.
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:16.400]   You've got another wheel to select aspect ratios.
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:21.280]   But it has two or three big features that make it unique and that I really, really like.
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:25.600]   Number one, there is this fake LCD panel on the bottom that shows you just like on a regular
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:26.600]   camera.
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.600]   Here's the shutter speed that's about to select.
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:32.400]   Here's the histogram, that live histogram of here's what value is it seeing.
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:37.320]   It allows you to really see the picture before it gets taken and spot the problems that happen
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:38.320]   before they happen.
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:42.240]   Oftentimes, I'll take a picture with my iPhone and realize that, damn it, it exposes properly
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:45.600]   to all kinds of blowouts in places that are really, really important.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:48.560]   You can check the histogram this way and figure it out that way.
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:54.560]   The second feature of it is just it does a much, much better job of like spot exposure
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:55.960]   and spot metering.
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:33:00.640]   There is my friend Batman who watches over me and is prepared to punish Skype for all
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:03.800]   the evil that it does, the cowardly superstitious app.
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:10.040]   I don't know if you can see in the corner there, on the iOS, in the standard iOS camera
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:13.400]   app, you can tap to set the exposure.
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:17.800]   But the focus zone, excuse me, the hot zone is way, way too big.
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:21.080]   You can't get a nice precise sample of just this one area.
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:25.920]   Secondly, you have to, while you're holding this camera, this slick, shiny, not holdable
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:30.040]   thing in your hands, you have to sort of move your thumb over to sort of make sure you highlight
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:32.600]   it, then get it back to the camera thing.
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:35.880]   This one is just a small spot that's right in the middle of the crosshairs.
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:41.200]   All you have to do is just aim it where you want to go, tap the dedicated auto-exposure
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:42.200]   lock button.
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:46.480]   Then you can move it to another place, tap the dedicated auto-focus lock button, then
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:50.600]   both of those things are locked in, so now you can keep just taking pictures.
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:55.560]   That's the reason why that picture of you, John, giving the talk with that big, big
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:34:00.640]   spotlight in your face, which much of the big spotlight in your face, it was just impossible
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:04.720]   for me to shoot with the iPhone because auto-exposure just could not handle it.
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:09.200]   And then every time, like I moved or you moved, it would just lose the spot.
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:11.040]   This was so much easier to shoot.
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:17.120]   The other cool feature I should say is that it can also save not only in the standard
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:21.600]   JPEG, but also JPEG plus an uncompressed TIFF.
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:25.800]   So if you have ever been concerned about, you've dumped your photos and you realize,
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:27.320]   "Oh, God, these are way too jaggy.
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:29.760]   There's too many compression artifacts."
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:33.400]   If you shoot with this one, you will not only get a standard JPEG in your master camera
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:39.080]   role, but once you connect it to iTunes via USB, you will be able to remove from the app
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:44.640]   via the standard document transfer feature a TIFF version that's uncompressed and ideally
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:48.200]   much, much better quality than what you're getting off of a JPEG.
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:53.120]   I've had a couple of days to play around with it and do a bunch of side-by-side comparisons.
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:57.680]   Unfortunately, it's not quite as good as you might hope.
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:01.520]   It's not the equivalent of having a camera that can shoot raw, for instance, but there
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:06.000]   are many instances in which, yeah, you can really notice an improvement between this TIFF
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.760]   version and the JPEG that the camera app would have shot.
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.760]   And it's fairly cheap.
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:14.360]   It's $2.99.
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:21.840]   So basically $1 more than the already grossly overvalued screen capture utility, but it's
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:24.600]   pretty good as it is.
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:29.640]   As usual, I'm still waiting for that one app to rule them all, that one camera app that
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:31.600]   fixes everything for me.
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:35.880]   Until then, I looks like I'm going to be stuck having four different apps that I switched
[01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:39.640]   between depending on where I'm after at any given moment.
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:42.640]   Is anybody happy with the camera app?
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:46.520]   Is anybody willing to spend it here?
[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:47.360]   Jason?
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:48.360]   No.
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:50.920]   Not getting anybody here.
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:54.480]   I got during my talk at the conference.
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:57.480]   I mean, there are like 120 people in the room.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:02.200]   I said, everybody, raise your hands if you have a video file on your iPhone right now
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:04.960]   that's shorter than two seconds in the room.
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:06.840]   Every single hand went up.
[01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:13.200]   So I honestly think that we should almost set a timer now, that Apple has a maximum number
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:18.960]   of days in which to fix that problem before we just say somebody just doesn't deserve
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:23.760]   whatever lunch that they're getting for free at any point in their days as an employee.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:26.640]   Well, that's all the topics that we were going to go through.
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:28.880]   That's also some great picks, some great tips.
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:33.040]   And the only thing that's left is to go around the corner and thank all these wonderful people
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:36.280]   for their wit, their intelligence, their insight and their generosity.
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:39.520]   We're dealing with a host via Skype.
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:43.960]   That Skype just simply seems to hate with a passion of a thousand burning sons.
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:45.480]   Jason, what would you like to plug?
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:47.360]   You have so many editorial projects going on.
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:48.360]   Who can pick just one?
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:50.000]   Yeah, I'm going to pick.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:57.600]   We actually launched a brand new site called TechHive@techiv.com.
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:02.400]   It is from the editors of Macworld and PCworld and it is a beta site.
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:05.560]   The full site will launch this summer and it's a place for us to talk about things that
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:07.360]   aren't Macs and aren't PCs.
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:10.360]   So there's a game story up there now.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:13.920]   A thing about Android, some iOS stuff, a lot of fun.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:17.840]   We're getting a movie critic to write a twice a month feature about great movies that are
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:21.040]   coming on and off Netflix streaming.
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:23.560]   Lots of good stuff that we're going to try out there in the next few months.
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:27.640]   That's the big editorial project right now at Macworld and PCworld.
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:28.720]   So check it out, TechHive.
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:32.960]   Another addition to the massive Jason Snell constellation.
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:35.960]   Yes, my brand portfolio.
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:40.800]   John, we can see it during Fireball.
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:46.120]   The coolest thing was being at the reception at this big house, not knowing we're about
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:48.720]   to be visited by the Lord Mayor of Dublin.
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:52.440]   And he makes it be, he introduces himself to you and as soon as he finds out who you
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:57.640]   are, John Gruber, I read during Fireball every night for 10 minutes and I found him
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:01.600]   up at this conference because I read your blog, "Oh my God, you're so awesome."
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:06.760]   So it's not only tech influence, but it's now its political influence as well.
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:12.240]   So I'm looking forward to bowing down before the ever expanding during Fireball Empire.
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:14.360]   I have to say, I was very surprised by that.
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:18.360]   I mean, I was already extremely excited to be there.
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:19.360]   It's a beautiful mansion.
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:20.360]   I mean, I had no idea.
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:22.200]   I mean, here we are meeting the Lord Mayor.
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:26.120]   The best part, I thought the best part is you come in the door and the butler and the
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:32.080]   Lord Mayor's mansion in Dublin, asks if you need anything and asks if you want a pint
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:33.600]   of Guinness and you go, "Yes."
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:34.600]   Of course.
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:35.600]   And then 30 seconds later.
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:37.920]   There's only one right answer to that question.
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:39.720]   30 seconds later.
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:46.520]   Here in the mansion, the Lord Mayor's butler comes over with a fresh pint of draft Guinness.
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:51.160]   And everybody says it's just one of those things, but it is absolutely true is that
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:55.440]   in Dublin, the Guinness is incredibly good.
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:57.000]   I mean, it's so much better.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.640]   It's a fine beer anywhere in the world, but in Dublin, it's unbelievable.
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:07.320]   It is sort of like, it's like the difference between sugar coke and I've roped those corn
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:08.320]   syrup coke.
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:10.520]   It's like, this is the real thing.
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:13.280]   And there I am enjoying the Guinness and the Lord Mayor comes up and says he found out
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.760]   about the conference on my website.
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:17.720]   I was like, "You know, maybe I should just move here."
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:19.640]   That's pretty awesome.
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:20.640]   Yes.
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:25.040]   And it's also absolutely true, like what you're saying about the Guinness because I'm not
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:26.200]   a beer drinker.
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:31.600]   I'm almost sure that people think that I'm either an alcoholic or just some sort of
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:32.600]   pure.
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:36.600]   By the number of times they've seen me in a place where everybody is drinking and I'm
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:37.600]   not drinking.
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:40.800]   But it's like, well, I just don't happen to drink that often.
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:44.760]   So as well, I'm in Ireland, I have to at least sample a Guinness expecting like just
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:46.560]   with every other beer I've ever tried.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:47.720]   I'll have a couple of sips.
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:51.240]   Let's taste a couple more sips and then put the half-class back down and walk away from
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:52.400]   it again.
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:58.320]   On Sunday alone, I had three pints of Guinness.
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:00.400]   I drunk more Guinness.
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:02.080]   It's like drinking water.
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:03.080]   Come on.
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.080]   It's really incredible.
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:06.080]   It's it's.
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:08.640]   It's a beautiful city.
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:09.640]   The conference was great.
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:14.280]   The Lord Mayor was it was a privilege and an honor to meet him, but I kind of can't stop
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:15.880]   shutting up about how good the Guinness was.
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:18.800]   It was like mine.
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:23.720]   And unfortunately, I want to tell people are asking me, I'm meeting up with friends like
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:25.240]   tonight and for us the week.
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:26.880]   And of course, oh, how was Ireland?
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:29.840]   And I have to like, I remember that there's an article in the onion about this guy who
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:33.320]   wouldn't shut up about how good the Guinness was in Ireland and how they don't make it
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:34.320]   properly over here.
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:37.920]   And I have to like put on that little, that little separate like egg timer in my head.
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:42.040]   And when you talk about how good the Guinness is, get it down to eight seconds and says,
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:43.400]   oh, it was really, really good.
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:45.200]   I was drinking it all the time and you know me.
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:46.280]   I don't drink that much.
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:49.520]   And then change the subject or else you'll become that guy who says, right, of course,
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:52.360]   you really can't have a proper pipe unless you're in Ireland.
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:56.440]   Ideally, this little put out of the way pub outside of the tourist area that I found on
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:57.440]   my second day.
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:59.440]   Yes, but Guinness.
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:04.160]   But believe what they say it really is it's it's it's it's the book of Kells also a
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:06.480]   really good national treasure of Ireland.
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:11.400]   We both saw the book of Kells, but if I had to if I could only rescue one thing out of
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:14.960]   Ireland before the aliens wipe it from the face of the earth, that's not going to happen.
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:16.560]   But let's say would have where to happen.
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:20.080]   You see that the whatever it is that gives us the ability to keep making Guinness or
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:21.400]   the book of Kells.
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:22.400]   Sorry.
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:24.480]   That's why we have ebooks guys.
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:25.480]   Yeah.
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:30.840]   Chris, where can we find you?
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:35.800]   Well, apparently you're going to find me at the Guinness factory next opportunity I have.
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:40.400]   I've actually been I've been to Dublin once and I have been to the factory and and you
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:44.240]   take your tour and you get your two points at the end of the tour and even if you do
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:49.840]   it at 9 a.m. and generally I'm not sort of a 920 a.m. drinker, but you have to.
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:54.400]   And you're there because it's just that good and and it would be then you know it's
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:58.280]   insulting to the to the natives and I have an Irish last name and so therefore I feel
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:41:59.560]   like I need to do that.
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:04.160]   Otherwise you can find me at Macworld.com and and I've had a number of training videos
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:05.320]   at Linda.com.
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:07.040]   So check out both.
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:12.120]   I'm going to I'm going to have my first piece on tech hive later this week.
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:14.360]   So take a look at that too.
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:17.760]   Can you give us a little teaser or you're under NDA?
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:19.200]   I'll have to ask my boss.
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:20.880]   Boss, can I give a little teaser?
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:21.880]   Sure.
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:22.880]   Go ahead.
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:25.640]   Also everybody who comes to tech hive will be offered a pint of Guinness.
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:26.640]   So really?
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:30.560]   No, no, no, Jason Snell's Butler.
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:31.560]   Yes.
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:37.320]   Yeah, I have the the pieces that exhaustive look at music subscription services.
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:42.840]   So I'm comparing Spotify and Rhapsody and Mogg and slacker and already a switch is the
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:48.120]   best deal and whether you're a good candidate for these kinds of services.
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:50.520]   Excellent.
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:55.520]   And rich, where can we find you and where can we download BB edit from both places or
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:58.720]   just one place now?
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:03.680]   You can find me and my products at barebones.com.
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:05.200]   We have BB edit up there.

[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:13.120]   not least, you know, Jimbo.
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:19.080]   And also I'm I've been told that I need to plug another product, the famous blue Norwegian
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:20.520]   brand birdie nibs.
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:25.960]   Oh, yes, first by nine out of 10 right thinking parrots.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:28.000]   Oh, yes.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.800]   They vote with their talents on how much they love and want the blue Norwegian birdie
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:32.800]   nibs.
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:33.800]   Is that not true?
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:34.800]   Yes, they do.
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:35.880]   That is absolutely true.
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:38.000]   So barebones.com it is.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000]   Excellent.

[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:54.120]   for my celestial waste of bandwidth and you'll find an internet pipeline that'll take you
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:56.640]   exactly to that exact same place.
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:01.280]   Thanks to everybody for taking part in this special show for everybody who's listening.
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:02.440]   Mac break is broken.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:03.440]   Done.
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:04.440]   Now get back to work.
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:05.440]   You gold bricks.
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:06.440]   You're time to lean.
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:07.440]   You got time to clean.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:18.760]   [Music]
