[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   This is MacBreak Weekly and with us around the table today,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Scott Born is not here, I'm sorry to say, and it's too bad,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   because he really should be here today as the iPhone advocate,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   because he would get to go "neener, neener, neener" to me today.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Erica Sedoon is on the line also from the unofficial Apple web blog.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Hello, Erica.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Hello.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   She's also probably the foremost, well, maybe not the foremost,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   but it's been very active in iPhone applications.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   She wrote, "Not only did you write a really great one called
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   "Sentunes," is it Sentunes?
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   That allowed me to use something like that.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Sent Songs.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   You don't even know.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   That allowed me to send any ringtones to my iPhone's Ringtone folder,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   also email songs, but also she did a lot of the underlying
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   shell utilities for the BSD stuff, which was great.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Did you do SSH as well?
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   I did not.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   That was nerve gas.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Oh, nerve gas.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   There you go.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   You know, you guys can't hear it probably.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Can you hear, Erica?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Everybody here all right?
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   She's a little low.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Okay.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   So let's say hello to the other guys.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Andy Inako is here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Hello, Andy.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I'm going to try not to whistle or annoy you in any way today.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   You can stop whistling, but I hope you never stop annoying me,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Leo, because when you annoy, you help the industry.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   There I said, "This is going to be the Leo Apology show today."
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Chris Breen is Leo Laporte, National Day of Atonement.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   It's my day of Atonement.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   The Yom Kapoor at the Laporte House.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Chris Breen is here.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   He is from, of course, Mac World Magazine, the Mac 911 column,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   and has written many, many books.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   His latest is an iPhone book.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And I have to, honestly, I have to thank Erica largely for that,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   because if it weren't for her screen capture utility that she
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   allowed to work on the iPhone, I would have been sunk.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I was looking at taking pictures of the interface.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I thought, "No, I can't pass that.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Steve could do it.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I'm sure I can do it too."
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And Erica came up with the solution, and I am bowing in her
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   direction as I think a round of applause in order for Erica Sedun.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Well, actually, you need to thank my husband.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Why?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Really?
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Because when I wrote it, I said to him, "Do I put this out there?"
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Because, you know, I'm writing a book, too.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And he said, "You can be a good business woman, or you could be a good person."
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Oh, now that's a nice guy.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And you did it.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   You were a nice person.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Now, I thought the book was on hold after the breaking of the iPhone.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   That's a different book.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   The book that's coming out December 17th is from A Press,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   and it's called "Taking Your iPhone to the Mac."
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Excellent.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Well, this is the person who should know how to do that.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Also, here for you is the last time for sometime, Mr. Merlin Mann.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Hello, Merlin.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Hello, Leo.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   How are you?
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Can we tell people why this is your last time for some time?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   For some reason.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   It feels like you're Max Detweiler, and I'm the Von Trapp family.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   So, you're about to announce this for the last time.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Well, that's the reason.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Last time that he'll be performing for some time.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Nick, he's got a balloon out back and will be flying over the border.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Yeah, you can.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   You can.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   My wife is apparently going to provide us with a daughter very soon.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Oh, now we know it's a girl.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Yeah, well, how exciting.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   What name?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Oh, now you think I'm going to tell you that?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Oh.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Well, we were going to call her.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   It looks, it's pronounced Joan Bennett, but it looks like John Benet.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   When you start it.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   No, no.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   She's our little cow girl.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   No, that's private.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   But yeah, I'm kind of going to slowly go a little bit.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   A little bit off the grid and regrettably.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   What we doing?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Matt, break with you.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   You will.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   You'll be back very quickly.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   And Erica, who has baby's nose that you'll be so anxious to get back on.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I want the break.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   You don't want to talk to grownups really bad.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Chris knows that too.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I think.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Any minute now you're going to be saying I need to talk to a grownup.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   So, when is Madeline do?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Yeah, later this month.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   That's exciting.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   So now it's now we can admit it's official to everybody.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   We've got a bunch of babies.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Oh, actually I should add Alex Lindsey is also having a baby.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   He is not.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   That's out.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I think that's out.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Alex Lindsey, the official three, the Twit three are Merlin, Alex and Patrick Norton.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And I think everybody now knows about all of them.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I'm going to see if I can add Alex.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   He said he would be in a hotel.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   He's probably, I don't know if he's available or not.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   I don't see him on Skype.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Oh, there he is.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Hello, Alex.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Well, we do.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   I'm the largest panel ever.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Alex Lindsey is also here from the Pixel Core.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.240]   Well, is one of us going to be the designated Scott to be a karma suck about the iPhone?
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.640]   I will be because I deserve to be because I was the one who said Apple did it on purpose.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.800]   And if they didn't do it on purpose, they could have done a better job not doing it
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   on purpose.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.680]   And I've been very whiny and vocal about it.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.600]   And a lot of people have offered me cheese with my wine.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.000]   And Erica Sedoon is here to say they didn't do it on purpose after all.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   That's what you that's what you posted today.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.280]   Well, I don't know for sure.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.280]   No one knows what they're real intent because they haven't said a word.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.560]   I just think that if they were going to brick it, they could have done a much better job
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.560]   at it.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.960]   So they just didn't do it as well as they could have.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.720]   Now somebody said to me that correct me if I'm wrong, that it was a buffer overflow
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.560]   exploit that allowed the phone to be unlocked in the first place and that by patching that
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.720]   exploit Apple bricked, but they had to patch the exploit.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.720]   Is that accurate?
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.720]   Not as far as I know.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.720]   That's what I didn't think it was.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.760]   The first jail lock were just emulating I to.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.760]   Okay.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:39.200]   iTunes used to be able to do all sorts of lovely things like mount discs, copy files.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.200]   Now it doesn't.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.920]   Yeah, it really annoyed me in fact that I couldn't mount the iPhone and as I would
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.400]   with used to be able to with an iPod.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.920]   There is no option in iTunes to allow you to get this access.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.520]   Yeah, that's too bad.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.160]   Is that for all iPods now?
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:05.480]   It is to the best of my knowledge for the iPod touch and the iPhone and is not exclusively
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.560]   you know, it's not it.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.520]   So Chris Breen, you could still you could still mount an iPod and copy songs over to
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.440]   it, but just not the touch and the.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.200]   Yeah, as Erica says, it's it's the you can't mount the iPod touch.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.800]   That's really annoying as a hard drive.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.920]   Yeah, but you can put the iPod touch into manual mode, which is something you can't do
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.920]   with the.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.000]   You'll still do have that manual way to copy songs on there.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   It's very frustrating.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.720]   I have to sync my iPhone to different computers depending on which songs I want to have on
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.720]   there.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.280]   I haven't gotten around to moving everything over.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.720]   Yeah, that's one of the reasons why I'm keeping one of my iPhones at 10 point at 1.02
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.480]   strictly because there's this one really cool third party app that lets you download
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.640]   podcast directly.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.360]   And the ability to simply.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.480]   Get airplane content on the taxi cab on the way to the airport.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.480]   Instead of waiting here at the hotel saying, Oh, please, sync, please, please just sync
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.160]   so I can leave the hotel.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.160]   Exactly.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.160]   Exactly.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.840]   I can't tell you how many times I've done that.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:11.240]   So Erica, how do we what is the evidence that what do we know about what Apple did?
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.960]   I think Apple still to be faulted a little bit for not stepping forward and saying what
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.960]   their intent was.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.680]   But what let's read the tea leaves from what you know.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.440]   And I think you probably know as much as as anybody except maybe the inner circle at the
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.800]   dev team about what's going on.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.800]   What happened here?
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:35.000]   To the best of my understanding, Apple bricked as many if not more locked iPhones than it
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.080]   did on last one.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:44.720]   However, when people brought their phones to the store after a failed upgrade, the locked
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:50.080]   ones were given service and the unlocked ones were not because Apple had posted that big
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.600]   right thing saying we will not know.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:59.800]   Now how do we know how do we know that the people bringing in the so-called unlocked bricks
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.480]   really weren't.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.480]   Lock unlocking it.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.120]   I mean, how do for instance, I have a friend I won't say names who did in fact brick his
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.280]   phone foolishly putting one one one on it.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:15.640]   So went back and went through a process of really breaking it badly.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:21.000]   He reverted to 102 and then started the one one one upgrade again and pulled the plug
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.160]   halfway through the firmware.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.400]   I mean, really damaged the phone, I think.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.440]   Then brought it in and Apple said, well, you unlocked it and he said, what's that?
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.480]   And the genius said, well, you know, make it so you could use it with T-Mobile.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.960]   He said, no, no, I don't have a T-Mobile kind of an AT&T account.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.320]   And the guy gave him a new phone.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.560]   How do we know that that's not what's happening?
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:46.680]   I really can't talk about people who use deceptive methods and so forth.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.200]   I kind of added my territory of expertise.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.440]   I'm just I'm so we're pretty sure that a lot of real phones have been bricked like unlocked
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.000]   phones have been brick.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.280]   Katie Halfner of the New York Times has a 14 year old daughter who had her completely
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.520]   unmodded, completely locked iPhone brick.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.520]   All right.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.520]   Well, I trust Katie.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.440]   Yes, okay.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.480]   So that means that it just was a bad update.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.920]   I think it was a bad update.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:24.040]   I have an unlocked phone, which obviously has been modded, but I never unlocked it that was
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.320]   with an AT&T go phone account.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:35.320]   And it seems that go phone accounts were bricked more often in a statistical sense.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.320]   Right.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.280]   So for this for this corollarity, for this to be true, the corollary would also have to
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.760]   be true that there were unlocked phones that were not bricked.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.760]   From what I understand that did happen.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.760]   Yes.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.760]   Okay.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.760]   So some people got away with it.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.760]   You can see on gadgets, several firsthand accounts of that.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.440]   So it's just a case of what?
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.080]   I mean, my what my position was all along was it will Apple could have checked, you know,
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.960]   a CRC on the firm where a checks them on the modem firmware and said, well, this modem
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.200]   firmware has been changed.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.200]   We're not going to update.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.560]   I mean, admittedly they put out the warning and they don't have how much responsibility
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:20.480]   they have to tell people, but they could have done that easily.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.160]   Not a lawyer.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.600]   And this kind of goes into lawyer territory when you start talking about defective upgrades,
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.160]   negligence and things like that.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.040]   Oh, see, I have no hesitance and then lie bling people.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.200]   But I appreciate it.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.200]   I appreciate it.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   I appreciate it.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.760]   I appreciate slander.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.400]   I appreciate your reticent, Sarah.
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.200]   We'll add it to the list of things you're atoning for.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.200]   I think this falls under the legal category under title, title seven of talking smack.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.200]   Talking smack.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.200]   That's what I did.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.200]   It was just it was just trash talk.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.560]   It wasn't it wasn't slander.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.800]   It was trash talk.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.680]   So Erica, actually, there is some good news for unlockers.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:04.160]   By the way, I got an email from somebody who said, I'm not I'm now since you see seem to
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.640]   have no difficulties stealing from Apple and AT&T.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.400]   I'm going to stop paying for Twitch.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.400]   Okay.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.760]   Well, you can have your $2.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.120]   I don't feel that I'm stealing from Apple by unlocking a phone and I paid for the phone
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.360]   and an 18.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.720]   I'm not using AT&T service.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.960]   So why should I pay AT&T and everything?
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.960]   Anything.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:28.480]   My understanding is legal in the United States, at least until 2009 to unlock your phone and
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.360]   use it with whatever carrier you have.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.360]   I agree.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.240]   We've said that several times.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.240]   So anyway, this guy.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.240]   I'm not a lawyer.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.240]   I'm not a lawyer either.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.560]   I don't play a lawyer on TV.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.040]   I don't even do aspirin commercials.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.960]   Now, tell me.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.920]   Say tell me Erica.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:49.280]   What is the latest on unlocking 1.1.1?
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.920]   There are about three unlocked phones, maybe four now.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.920]   Wow.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.920]   It is not at all clean.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.400]   It is extremely hazardous to iPhone.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:09.200]   But from what I understand, the people who are doing this are very optimistic that they'll
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.480]   get it cleaned up very quickly.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.480]   That surprises me.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.960]   Because I remember your post where you were talking about the fact that it was a sign,
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.760]   digitally signed and it would be much more difficult to hack and jailbreak was talking.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.920]   Yeah, I was talking about mostly the iPod touch.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:24.880]   Okay.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.120]   The iPod touch is just fanatically, insanely locked down.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:35.640]   Which is of course why the jailbreak, even though the iPhone 1.1 upgrade, the jailbreak
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:40.480]   on that has been going for at least two weeks shorter a period of time.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.680]   It happened first.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.680]   Right.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:49.600]   So, do we think we'll be able to get third party apps on the 1.1.1 release anytime soon?
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.600]   Oh, yeah, totally.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.200]   Yeah, it's there.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.080]   And unlocking 1.1.1.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.080]   It's also doable.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.080]   Boom.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:02.960]   I can't really say about that because Apple is just kind of freakish with their baseband
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.960]   stuff.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.960]   Right.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:11.720]   And to translate that into English, they have made it less approachable.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:17.640]   The part of the iPhone that communicates with the modem that communicates with the cell
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.800]   phone network.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.800]   It's not as easy to get there as it was.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.120]   And the baseband update was the key to getting the firmware update.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.320]   It was the key to getting unlocked.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:34.360]   And unfortunately, it doesn't look like the relock is anywhere near ready yet.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.360]   Okay.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.640]   So it is a cat and mouse game.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.840]   I had thought that maybe Apple won already, but it sounds like it continues to be a cat
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.000]   and mouse game.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.200]   I think the cat's tired, the mouse is tired, and everybody's just kind of waiting to see
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.520]   what happens with leopard.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.520]   Which I really don't think will bring a software development kit.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.080]   Could could.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.080]   That's an interesting point.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.080]   We'll get to that in a second.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.240]   Could an Apple lock it down pretty solidly if they wanted to?
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.080]   Couldn't they use signing and things like that?
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.040]   Yeah, it would be called the iPod touch.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.200]   Well, why didn't they do that with the phone?
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.200]   I don't know.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.200]   Good answer.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.200]   Good answer.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.400]   So I mean, that led some credence to the fact that they're not completely against people
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.360]   unlocking or adding third party apps.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.120]   They are not helping us.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:22.760]   Really, there's no reason that we should have gotten onto the iPhone other than the fact
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.520]   that there are a few people with a lot of PSP hacking experience.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.520]   Oh, interesting.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.760]   Apple does not open the door.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.760]   Right.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.040]   Apple does not want us there and Apple will do everything they can to make sure that the
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.880]   iPhone and the iPod touch are locked down and under their control.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.720]   Allah, the other iPod.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.320]   And it's your instinct that there will be no SDK for the iPhone when leopard is released
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.320]   this month.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.320]   You mean public SDK?
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.320]   Public SDK.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.320]   Yeah, obviously there's an SDK.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.320]   There is an SDK.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.320]   Yeah, somebody's developing.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.320]   Right.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.320]   It exists.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.320]   Right.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.320]   Yeah, I doubt it.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.320]   I can't say for sure.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.680]   I'd be delighted, but I don't think it's going to happen.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.120]   Will you keep developing apps for the iPhone?
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.640]   I haven't for the last couple of weeks.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:10.920]   It's just kind of been why bother until we kind of know which way we're going.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.720]   No, it makes sense.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:18.920]   A lot of the other developers just basically are in a wait in Seattle to.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:19.920]   Right.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.520]   Guys, anything you would like to ask Erica since we I mean, it's a great opportunity
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.880]   to talk to her.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.680]   I have a question about the root access on the iPod touch.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:34.200]   I read one of your entries on official Apple web log that said somebody had gained root
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.760]   access to the to the touch.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.720]   Does that mean anything for us?
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.680]   All it meant is that we can now copy the files off to take a look at them.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.960]   There's no read right access.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.720]   There's only read access.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.720]   Okay.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.920]   That was the first step in jailbroken.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.240]   Yeah, that was the first step though.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.040]   I remember to jailbreaking the phone was getting that root access.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.600]   That was huge when that happened.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.480]   Same technique or is it a different technique?
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:07.440]   It is a different technique than I used to get to the iPhone root for 111.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.360]   But it's the same technique that is involved in the jailbreak.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.360]   Interesting.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.360]   Interesting.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.760]   Erica, do you think that the when these phones are broken for apps?
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.520]   Do you think that it's going to be the same sort of interface and the same sort of installer
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.360]   platform that we've been using via app tab?
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.360]   Cool.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:35.240]   The jailbreak right now is hideously ugly, but I am hoping that something clean will come
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.240]   along.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:42.000]   Obviously, app tab won't work because the way app tab does things now is it pretends
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.920]   to be iTunes.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.400]   And it issues iTunes commands to the iPhone and the iPhone says, "Oh, goodie.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.560]   I'm talking to iTunes."
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.080]   And then it responds to it.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.280]   You don't have that with 111.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:18:01.120]   Apple completely reversed the way that iPads and iTunes talk to each other.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:07.520]   So instead of iTunes sending commands to the iPod attach and the iPod touch thing, okay,
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.920]   I'll do that.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.000]   There are now three commands basically you can send.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   They are hello.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.520]   Goodbye and start restore.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.920]   And that doesn't give you a lot to work with.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.400]   But from a user point of view, do you think that the procedure that once you jail broke
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:28.040]   your phone, do you think that the install app that a lot of us are using right now is
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.880]   going to be the same basic installer platform for getting--
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.440]   Do you use the installer app right now on the phone today?
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.440]   Go ahead.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.000]   You've got pictures on them.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   I've got pictures.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.760]   It made me feel really good to see that Starbucks Wi-Fi Apple Wi-Fi store icon right next to
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.760]   the app tap icon.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.320]   I thought, yes.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:53.200]   Was 111 a complete rewrite of all the software on the phone?
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.760]   Some people have said the 1.0 version of the iPhone was such a rushed hack job that they
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.520]   really-- this 111 is really the way it ought to have been in the first place.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:09.440]   I haven't had enough time to really look in the frameworks and be compiled them and dump
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.440]   all the classes yet.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.600]   So I haven't really read through the frameworks.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.600]   Hello, everyone.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.600]   What I can tell you is that the frameworks, a majority of frameworks have been recompiled
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.200]   and are not compatible with 1.0.2.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:29.440]   And the way I know this is that I put all the apps from 111 onto a 1.0.2 iPhone and then
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.880]   attempted to run them and so where they failed.
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.880]   Right.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.880]   Right.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.360]   So it's clear that a lot of frameworks have a lot of new functionality.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.520]   There's a lot of rewriting.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.640]   I just can't tell you exactly to what extent.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.640]   I don't know how you have time with a-- what do you have?
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.640]   A three-year-old and a two-year-old?
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.640]   Four.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.640]   Four.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.600]   I don't have-- I have time to do all this, but I'm glad you do.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.160]   And do you have any advice for Merlin and Alex?
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.640]   Baby Bjorn?
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.640]   Yes.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.640]   And drugs.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:04.240]   Drugs during delivery or after delivery?
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.240]   Both.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.560]   My wife, God lover, she's been really reticent.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.440]   I want to go to Costco and see if they have baby Benadryl and really, really large, I
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.440]   guess kind of like, I don't know, like--
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.440]   It is.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.440]   --carcants.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.440]   It's called Sleepy Baby.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:22.200]   She thinks that's not a good idea, but I just want to be ready.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.200]   We actually gave our kids a good drill.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:29.560]   I always felt with your pediatrician before administrating, administering baby Benadryl
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.840]   and trying to charry flavored Jackie Daniels for cuts.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.720]   And you will actually get a better deal at efforts and Walgreens than you will at Costco.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.720]   There you go.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.600]   You're full of caution and tips.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.600]   You're ideal.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.600]   Isn't this great?
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.240]   We've never had anybody so circumspect on this show in a year of podcasting.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.200]   Scott was pretty close a couple times.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.200]   He had that disclaimer he wanted me to read, but I only read it once.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   What is his disclaimer?
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.400]   You can have a disclaimer.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.040]   Would you like a disclaimer?
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.880]   Let me see if I can find Scott's disclaimer and I'll just read it even though he's not
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:02.880]   here.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.880]   I love this disclaimer.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.880]   I think we should all have the disclaimer.
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.440]   I think I am not a lawyer.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.080]   I said I am not a doctor.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.080]   Sure.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.200]   He actually went to his lawyer.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.480]   Part of the problem is that Scott actually owns Apple stock, which none of the rest
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.480]   of us do.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.280]   So he went to his lawyer and--
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.280]   Think about that.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.120]   Nothing I say has to do with forward looking stuff.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.520]   This is not a forward looking statement.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.120]   I'm trying to find his disclaimer.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.560]   Clearly, I don't pay much attention to it because I've lost it now.
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.040]   Here it is.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:39.080]   Any or all of the contributors to TwitNet cast, their families, agents, heirs or assign,
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.760]   may hold positions and securities registered to publicly traded companies mentioned on
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.760]   the Twit Network.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.760]   Member of DSC.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.200]   You're now off the hook.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:52.920]   Erica, thank you so much for joining us and giving us the straight story.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   We've got to get you back.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.160]   Anytime you're available, I'll send you an email and when you can join us again, we
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.360]   really would appreciate having you on again.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.360]   Thank you.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.360]   It's been a pleasure.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:07.000]   You can find Erica's blog at ericacedoon.com, E-R-I-C-A-S-A-D-U-N.com.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.120]   And of course, she contributes an awful lot to the unofficial Apple Web blog, which is
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.120]   a must read.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.760]   Of course, if you don't read that, you're not really a Mac fanatic.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.320]   T-U-A-W.com.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.160]   And she has a blog there as well.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.720]   Thank you, Erica.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.720]   All right.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.720]   Bye.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.560]   I guess she hung up on us.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:31.520]   So anyway, I guess I know Apple and Apology.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.640]   I'm sorry, Apple.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.680]   You didn't do it on purpose.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.200]   It was just a side effect.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.280]   I still think that there was checking that could have been involved.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.280]   They could have.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.280]   Yeah, they could have projected.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.280]   That's the...
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.280]   But you know what?
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.280]   They had no obligation to do so.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.840]   And they did warn us, which they also had no obligation to do so.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.560]   And they were very clear about that.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:53.120]   But by the time they warned you, you had already probably done the damage.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.120]   No, no, no, no.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.320]   They gave news warnings.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:03.400]   But the very first thing you see when you are going to do the firmware is a big disclaimer.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.760]   Capram is nobody reads these.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.560]   It kind of looks like the user license agreement, you know, and big disclaimer saying, "Don't
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.400]   do this if you hack the phone."
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.120]   And I was smart enough not to do it.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.440]   And most people, Andy, you didn't brick your phone.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.000]   I certainly did not.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   But I do know...
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.160]   They're limited to how high a fence that Apple can build at some point.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.920]   You realize that someone who's determined to get a really good close up shot of the tiger
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.480]   at the zoo is going to try to get that close up shot of the tiger at the zoo.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.480]   1.1.1 was an attractive nuisance.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.480]   And there you go.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.040]   That's like a pool with no swence around.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.040]   A pool with no fence around it.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.040]   Well, there's a fence.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.440]   Some kids are going to die.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.080]   That's just what happens when you have a pool.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.160]   If you want to have a pool, things are going to go wrong.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.160]   Things are going to go wrong.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.160]   That's why we have a pool.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.160]   The question is...
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.720]   I think I missed the very beginning of the conversation.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.960]   Is it possible to go back from 1.1 to 1.02?
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:50.960]   Sort of.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:51.960]   Yes, sort of is the answer.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.960]   Yes.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.680]   Sort of the question, sir.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:24:01.040]   As a 1.02 person, the question I have is my phone going to increase in value because
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.280]   some people want to hack it and they can't.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.760]   It's like a Series 1 Tivo.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.080]   It's the ultimately hackable iPhone.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:13.040]   Because, I mean, right now on eBay, you can buy a 8 gig for like 485.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.400]   So it's selling for more than...
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.400]   I mean, that's bid it.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.400]   I don't know.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.400]   A whole bunch of bids.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.400]   Shoot.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.400]   I gave away my...
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.000]   iPhones, I gave one to Amber and one to the lab.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Both of them in Canada.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.440]   By the way, an interesting thing that Rogers says, Sim did not work in the hacked iPhone.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.800]   I should have asked Erika about that.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.000]   No, I don't know if it was...
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.400]   I don't know what was going on.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.840]   Sean's working on it trying to figure that out.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.840]   Anyway...
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.160]   Yeah, but in terms of eBay, I think that there are people who are going to bid on the phone
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.280]   anyway just to own it so they can smash it and say, "Ah, there, you're a liner.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.280]   Here, we've destroyed your hack phone.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.280]   They should all be 1.1.1.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.280]   You want...
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.280]   You want a brick?
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.280]   I got a brick.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:54.400]   It sounds to me like it's going to be irrelevant to have a 1.02 because it sounds as if they're
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.840]   going to be porting this stuff to 1.1 anyway.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:01.600]   Which thrills me because today, literally half hour before sitting down and record this,
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:07.080]   I got from Wiley, from my publisher, the very, very last thing I can possibly change about
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.080]   my iPhone book.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:12.280]   It is the back cover and believe me, this stuff about the applications, I'm changing
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.280]   stuff on the back cover to make sure...
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.760]   Hey, no, attention to chapter 13.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.760]   The back cover.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.840]   No, no, no, no, no, I was sitting there facing that blinking cursor because I had my final
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.840]   like four hours.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:29.600]   I'm like, "Okay, I'm going to have to sit in front of my scrying pool for three hours,
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.560]   clear my mind and try to envision what the world would be like in two months and figure
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.840]   out how I can rewrite this or what it will all work."
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.480]   And I'm like, "I bet that they're going to find a way to rewind it.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.600]   I bet that there's going to be a way for 1.1.1.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:45.320]   I bet if I simply include a link to these three websites, including the unofficial Apple
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.720]   Web log, it will say, "Here's how to do it."
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.720]   Yes!
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.720]   Alaluia.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.720]   Although, don't you think people...
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.800]   I certainly am not going to hack my phone.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.200]   I think now the lesson and probably what something we should have said in the beginning
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:03.720]   is like a beginning of all this hacking is, until they provide you with a way to completely
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:09.040]   reverse any changes you make to your phone, I would be very careful about applying these
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.040]   changes.
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.920]   Well, I think that's why they did it.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.200]   Part of the reason this update was so aggressive is they're really like...
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:21.960]   "Taking dead iPhones and putting them on pikes in front of Apple HQ and saying, "Okay,
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.280]   see, we warned you once, check it out."
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.600]   Well, I'm certainly not going to hack my own hacked iPhone.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.960]   This is going to be a stock iPhone from now on.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.920]   Well, if I could make it throw out something that's probably a little controversial, but
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:40.120]   just as a born-ask point, I mean, for me, this would all be great if it worked and it
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:44.760]   was something that was easy to do, but I mean, I don't know.
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:50.640]   I guess for me, part of the reason maybe this identifies me as the truest of sad Apple fan
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:56.480]   boys, but one reason I do like this stuff is that it doesn't require a lot of fiddling.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.000]   It's almost like if you...
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.760]   It's a shame that they haven't done this.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.840]   I think I was probably one of the first people out in front of this saying it's crazy that
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:08.040]   they don't put applications on here or have an SDK, but at the same time, gosh, I don't
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.040]   know.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.240]   I think for the garden variety user, if you want to be able to tinker around with this
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.640]   kind of stuff, there's other platforms and other units that you can do this stuff with.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.640]   And I don't know.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:22.560]   I guess I just wonder how much do you think this affects Joe Garden Variety iPhone user?
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:28.120]   This is going to affect the average user the first time that he needs access to a certain
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.360]   piece of software or a certain piece of information, but he can't access it because he's in an
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:36.920]   airplane or in a tunnel or otherwise disconnected from the internet, which for now is his only
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.520]   official lifeline to iPhone applications.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.520]   Yeah, but that's...
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:44.360]   He's going to be saying to himself, "Why can't I simply copy a document onto my iPhone and
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.320]   be able to read it?"
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.160]   And again, not to be all scot-born, but it still does what it says on the tin, right?
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.520]   I mean, granted, with this last update, it sounds like they kind of ate the booger.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.720]   But at the same time, your iPhone does what your iPhone is supposed to do.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.280]   They're holding up their end of the bargain by delivering stuff that works.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:05.560]   I guess I just wonder, it seems like if you really want hackable stuff, there's hack
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.880]   things you can hack out there.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.520]   Is it just the challenge of being able to do this or is this really like hardcore functionality
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.480]   where you just don't even want to use the iPhone if you can use it?
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.480]   I'll tell you what I did.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.480]   I'm going to keep my iPhone.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.480]   I'm not going to hack it.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.480]   I'm not going to add 30-party apps.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:21.000]   And I bought a BlackBerry 8320 that is wide open and unlocked and I can add any app I
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.200]   want.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.600]   And that's what I'll be using for my internet access, for my browsing, for my email.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.600]   Because that's...
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.320]   It's kind of funny that the brand new iPhone commercial I just saw last night during the
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:37.040]   CLCS or the VF, whatever, was all about this guy.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.600]   I used to carry a phone and a camera and a PDA and a sandwich.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.560]   And now the iPhone is all those things.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.560]   It's only one thing.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.720]   And now we're talking about buying a second phone to cover up the inadequacies of the
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.680]   one phone that you really, really want to use.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.680]   And that's kind of my point.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.000]   Because it isn't all of those things really.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   I mean, they haven't done that.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   They haven't changed.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   They can't be all those things.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Let me tell you that.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.080]   I had a very little headache to carry everything around me.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.680]   I had the iPod.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.280]   I had a camera and I had a regular phone.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.280]   This guy's from a...
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.920]   And a phone I use for text messaging and emails and stuff like that.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:08.920]   Stuff like that.
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.920]   One thing.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:10.920]   One thing.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:15.560]   I want to get up, grab my wallet and my iPhone and walk out of the house and jump in my
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.720]   car and go.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.120]   I never forget my phone.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.120]   Guy looks like...
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.520]   He doesn't look like the typical iPhone user.
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.000]   I wonder if he really is an actor.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   But...
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   You mean he gets dates?
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   He's kind of muscular.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   I don't...
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   I just...
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.280]   I guess I disagree Andy because I mean, on the one hand, I totally agree.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.520]   I wish this were the mobile computer that it clearly wants to be.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:44.360]   And I wish this were clearly the device that all of the Macintosh or Mac as we say, Mac
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.600]   users want it to be.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.120]   I couldn't agree with that more.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.280]   I guess I just don't get the part though about how it's not doing what Apple said it
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.280]   should do.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.280]   I don't know what it is.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.280]   It's doing everything.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:59.280]   The big fear is always those three hours you spend in an airplane, snacks to somebody with
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.520]   a different phone.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:04.520]   What I worry about is that someone who's going to be a happy iPhone user is going to be sitting
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:10.040]   next to someone who has a trio or has another phone and saying, "Gee, you're actually reading
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.360]   and writing Microsoft Word documents on your phone.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.360]   How do you do that?"
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.760]   Well, I just buy a third-party app, a third-party app on a phone.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:20.680]   And suddenly, they were happy with what they had out of the box, but now they realize there's
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.200]   a larger world out there and things that they would like to be able to do that they don't
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.040]   understand why they can't do it.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.200]   But that's a failed business opportunity.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.440]   It's not that they've misled you about what you were going to get.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.120]   I don't care about business opportunities.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.680]   I care about users having the features that they actually are going to want to have because
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.080]   this is not a disposable two-week old device.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.120]   This is something you're going to have for a year or two.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:47.320]   I think the danger really for Apple, and I don't think they misled anyone.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.560]   I think it does exactly what it does.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.320]   And I do think it's the best cell phone I've ever had.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.400]   And I've had a lot of them.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:31:00.360]   And so I'm happy with the phone.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.640]   That's the problem with other phones.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.680]   They just had a very limited expectation of what they were actually capable of.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.120]   And this phone, you can immediately see it.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:11.840]   So there's this expectation that occurs whether Apple gives it to you or not that you have
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.040]   this expectation that I'm going to be able to do everything with this phone.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.240]   And here's the part that the Hertz is that you could.
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.120]   You could do it, except they won't let you.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:25.480]   Now I think that what I'm hoping to see down the road is that give me a tester in Xcode
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.320]   where I can prove to you that I can write.
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.120]   So it's like a simulator in Xcode that's the iPhone.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.920]   And I'll write code for it in Xcode.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.880]   And then I'll upload it to Apple saying this is an application that I'd like to write.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.880]   And they can test it or whatever.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.800]   And then they bless it and they sell it through iTunes and they take 60% and they give me my
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.800]   money back.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.840]   And the thing is it would be a good business model.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.040]   And people would make stuff for them.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:50.080]   There is rumors that the SDK is quietly floating around among some developers.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.960]   I mean, it doesn't sound like Apple wants to keep this closed for very long.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.240]   It's just a question of whether they can get people, allow people to make enough apps
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:00.880]   fast enough to keep people happy because I think that a lot of us know immediately that
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.320]   we could turn it into something else.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:06.400]   You know, also provided they don't cross the AT&T line, which is will they give us a chat
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.400]   client?
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.800]   No, because they would like to drive us to SMS.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:13.520]   So that, yeah, as I said last week, the problem with Apple controlling this stuff is
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.520]   that there's going to be a line, you know, they're going to make the sandbox and say,
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.760]   okay, this is what you can have.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.720]   And even though it would be really cool to have this and I know you can get it on other
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:25.040]   phones, we're not going to let you have it because we haven't arranged with AT&T.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.360]   Well, and the danger for Apple is that now they've shown people, I mean, people have
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.160]   proven that they really, really enjoyed us.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.240]   They really love this phone.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.680]   And now you've got, you know, some company in China that does the whole thing that feels
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.440]   and looks the same way, except it runs on Linux and it's wide open and people can add
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.440]   all this stuff.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.480]   And I have to admit that if it ran and had that feature feel, although Apple has, you
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.840]   know, had 200 patents or something like that.
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.160]   If it felt like, you know, it just felt fluid, you know, I'd be tempted because there's
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.920]   lots of tools that I'd like to have with the phone that I carry around, you know, that
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:58.120]   are very specific and very, you know, idiosyncras, you know, I want to be able to manage time
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.480]   code while doing shooting.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:04.640]   And I want to be able to write a little little app that does that, you know, and that's not
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.440]   something I expect Apple to bless anytime soon.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:12.560]   Yeah, well, I know that the people who accused us of being winders last week would say, well,
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.440]   the iPhone's not for you then.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:21.480]   And I think that's Merlin's point to an extent that like, yeah, I mean, I guess, well, also,
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.680]   I guess I'm feeling a little bit defensive because I don't want to paint myself as somebody
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.960]   who's not into having applications since the since literally the moment this was announced,
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:34.160]   my first thought was this is going to be the ultimate mobile computer for our time.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:38.080]   And the idea of not allowing people, well, I mean, I've also we're talking about a lot
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.680]   of different things here when it comes down to it.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:42.600]   I mean, let's, let's be honest, it's, it's easy on the one hand to go, well, Apple screwed
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.240]   up because they didn't do this thing.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.680]   Everybody wanted, but if we really break down what everybody's talking about, there's
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.520]   a lot of different conversations going on.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:52.520]   There's one conversation that is very much about what I should get out of a company that
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.960]   I buy stuff from and what access I should have to the things that I get.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.400]   There's another one that's a very practical, more practical component of saying, well,
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.360]   you know, I don't really care how it happens.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.520]   All I know is I want time code on my phone.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.520]   And then you've got, you know what I mean?
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.880]   I guess I'm saying there's a lot of different things that people are saying here.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:13.120]   And then the thing that I'm trying to say is that I think one thing that makes Apple
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.880]   good at this stuff for better for worse is this Catholic approach, this Vatican approach
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.880]   that says, you know, here's the stuff that we're going to give you and we feel pretty
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.960]   confident this is going to work well for people.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.160]   And we're not going to mislead you.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:26.080]   I hope that's, that's the case about what this will do.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.360]   I think they're crazy not to have the apps.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.880]   I want to be super clear about that.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.360]   But at the same time, you know, there's a lot of devices.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.640]   It's just that everybody so emotionally attached to Apple as this brand and as this
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:39.680]   company that there's stuff that Apple's doing that people are being crazy critical about,
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.680]   which is certainly their prerogative.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:44.720]   But there's a lot of companies out there that are doing tons douchey or stuff.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:46.720]   That's the truth.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:48.400]   It's our Apple that's doing it.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.400]   That's all.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.400]   That's right.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.000]   It's not just that it seems like I getting, I'm getting a sense of deja vu only this
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.040]   is happening through a warped mirror image where, you know, Xerox had this wonderful computer
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.400]   called the star and they said, isn't it wonderful?
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.000]   It's a photocopier with a screen on it.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.840]   So you could change the documents that you're photocopying.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.920]   And then a guy named Steve Jobs said that's an interesting idea, a photocopier with a screen
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.920]   on it.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.920]   You're sure that all it is is a photocopier with a screen on it?
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:11.920]   Yes, it's a photocopier.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.320]   Who do I think more than photocopier with a screen on it?
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.960]   I feel that someone's going to look at the iPhone and say, really?
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.600]   It's just an iPod and a telephone with a touchscreen.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.000]   But we have complete control over it.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.520]   No one would want anything more than that.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.000]   And they're going to get their butts.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   And we did.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Great article.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   Who would do that?
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   Who?
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.680]   And really, no, no, but I mean, you know, like, don't be cynical.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:38.400]   Who, what company has the ability to create something that works as satisfyingly as an
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.400]   Apple.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.400]   Well, I think you're going to see a lot of people try it.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.400]   It'll be interesting.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.400]   HTC, LG, Samsung.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.400]   HTC.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.040]   You're going to anybody.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.320]   If they simply said, hey, look, all you clever, really wonderful companies in California
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:55.120]   that do things almost nearly as good as the iPod, we can build you hardware.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.120]   We saw it in the software.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.120]   And it works.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.120]   But we worked with iTunes.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.920]   Well, I can't work with iTunes.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.920]   Well, there you go.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:05.920]   Does iTunes give me unlocked non-DRM content for 89 cents a song?
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:06.920]   No.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.960]   There's this whole platform you should know about called Unix where you can go out and
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.720]   do whatever the hell you want to do.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.560]   The question is, and this is why I say let's buy a spare.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.560]   It's all the Internet's phones.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.560]   Kind of stink.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.560]   Yes, they do.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.560]   That's exactly right, Andy.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.560]   But why I'm saying we should find fair.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.560]   You think how should as a one or the other sort of situation.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:28.680]   Right now we are seeing more devices coming along that are not as flawless as the iPhone
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.840]   in execution.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.600]   But damn it, they're good enough for most people.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:36.960]   And once again, when you have these people who are having those airport, those airline
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:44.080]   row conversations with a phone that not as flashy, not as expensive, not as media friendly
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.640]   in terms of getting press and getting people to write about it as the iPhone.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.240]   But dang it, it has the time code software and it has the outliner.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:56.080]   It has that cool software that the person wants and all the software works on an airplane.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.760]   You're going to have people who are not, they're not going to be angry with Apple, but they're
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:02.120]   going to not re-recommended quite so strongly to other people.
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.920]   Or maybe they're not going to make their next phone an iPhone.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:09.920]   Let me quote Eric Hessendahl who has sold all who writes the bite of the Apple column
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.440]   in Business Week who makes this point.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:16.320]   I think quite articulately he says the article is why I won't buy an iPhone.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:21.200]   He says even though I buy everything else from Apple, at the end he talks about the
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.360]   real issue that we're all talking about.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.680]   This is inconsistent with Apple.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.480]   This is an Apple itself, the creation of two guys in a garage with a knack for making interesting
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.040]   ideas into real things.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:35.000]   So why punish the people who try to create something interesting, threatening them with
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.040]   the prospect of an inoperative phone?
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.560]   Apple insiders argue privately the iPhone is a new device.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:44.360]   In time they say maybe the development policy could change.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:48.520]   Although none say definitively that it ever will until it happens, the company that styles
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:53.800]   itself as a technology supplier of choice for creative people with great ideas is insisting
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:38:00.000]   that to own its products is to accept a defined orthodoxy where there's only one acceptable
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.440]   way to do things.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.760]   I think Apple has always said that, but he says that doesn't sound like the Apple I know
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.760]   so I'm not going to buy an iPhone until Apple commits to changing this policy and I don't
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.480]   think you should either.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:17.760]   He says, isn't that kind of what we're saying, Merlin, that yeah, you're right.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.480]   I can't deny what you're saying that Apple's giving us this phone.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:25.160]   It's doing everything it said it would, accept it or don't buy it.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.680]   But people will use Apple's want more and hope for them.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.680]   They do.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.720]   And this is why I think I'm being a little bit, I feel like I'm being a little bit mischaracterized
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.720]   here.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.120]   What I'm trying to identify is there are certain movements in the world.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.360]   I would say that being a vegetarian is one of them.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:43.280]   In 1970, probably it was really easy for everybody who was a vegetarian to say, hey,
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.280]   you have vegetarianism.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.800]   Well, today being a vegetarian is very complex.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.360]   Some people are doing it for health reasons.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.800]   Some people are doing it for moral reasons.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.680]   Some people are doing it for economic reasons.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.120]   And those people don't agree on the exact reasons why you should be a vegetarian.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.320]   They just all know that they're not happy with eating meat.
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.280]   And I think right now what you're seeing is a lot of people who are all pissed off about
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.040]   how the iPhone is put together for really different reasons.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.040]   And I'm trying to say, I don't think there's one answer to this.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:09.160]   Because if you say to somebody and I don't want to be all sky is falling, but yeah, there
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.640]   is something to be said about keeping that experience working the way it does.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:16.880]   I think it's a little bit facile to say that any company can come in and gobble up what
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:21.160]   Apple has done here simply by adding something like the ability to put out.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.680]   I wasn't saying that.
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.320]   I don't really care about market share.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.720]   I don't really care about any of that sort of stuff.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:30.040]   What I care about is that again, users getting the best experience possible.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:35.760]   And whereas a few months ago, my stock in the iPhone is a little bit down than what it
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:40.440]   was a few months ago because I really have to take into account what people, what people's
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.560]   experience is going to be like with this device over the life of that product.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.560]   And you see the other side.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:45.560]   You see the other side now.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:46.960]   That's a huge part of it.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.160]   Well, I've seen lots of I try to see all sides simultaneously.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.160]   You really have.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.160]   You see third party.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.320]   I installed these in my in my right.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.320]   Exactly.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.320]   In my office right now, I have five different phone platforms.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:01.880]   And right now, if three months ago, I might have been willing to say, Oh my God, this
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:05.000]   is the iPhone is just so head and shoulders over all these other phones.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.080]   All these other phones have better uses for specific purposes.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.480]   Blackberries are still the king of email.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.320]   But now it's more like, Well, if you want this, it's the iPhone.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.920]   If you want this, it's a symbion phone.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.520]   If you want this, it's more of a trio you're looking for.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:22.840]   I just think that new Verizon is going to be competition.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.600]   This is the I'm not really sure.
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:31.760]   I like the fact that it is so it is so ecumenical when it comes to accepting media that has just
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.320]   a slot with a commitment memory card and you put something on that card, put it in the
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.880]   slot, it will play it if it understands that format.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.240]   I do I have used it.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.760]   I don't think that it is nearly as slick an experience.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.920]   So nothing's as look an experience as an iPhone.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:50.040]   I think it's it's an upgrade from most Windows mobile phones out there.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:53.920]   I don't think it's a really terribly easy to use phone.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.200]   But again, it does get past that.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.240]   Is it good enough for most people hurdle?
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.760]   I mean, even Steve Jobs understands that you can't you don't keep your lead forever.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:06.920]   I remember him saying, you know, we had we had a lead on Microsoft when an 84 when the
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:11.240]   Mac came out, but they caught up because we sat still and I think that they're there.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.800]   I mean, maybe it's going to take 10 years.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:13.800]   I don't know.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.760]   But I think that it's not going to eventually somebody can come up with something just as
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.760]   good as the iPhone.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.800]   Don't you or you think Apple's the only one that could design something like this?
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.720]   What it's it's not just as good.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.000]   I think the problem is is Windows has never been just as good.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.400]   Just close enough, I guess.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.840]   The problem was that it became close enough fast enough and Apple wasn't moving.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.480]   You know, Apple created what here's what happened.
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:35.400]   I mean, in my opinion, I mean, you know, Apple created something and got a vision going in
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.840]   the 80s and then didn't wasn't able to maintain the pace.
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:42.160]   And so the thing is is that if they if they create this, they've opened up this whole
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.840]   new, you know, bottle wax.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.360]   Well, that's why you let the third party get involved.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.360]   They can help you.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.840]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:53.120]   And so so the thing is is that if they if they hang on to it too tightly, it doesn't
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:57.720]   someone's going to create something that's not as good, but good enough to to go past
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.720]   them.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:02.120]   This would also be a this would also be an interesting point to insert my crazy obsession
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.520]   about the whole Apple Google thing.
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:09.120]   It would be interesting to postulate whether one reason that they hold off on turning this
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:14.360]   into, you know, the Oklahoma land run is because they could potentially be in negotiations
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.760]   with different companies.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.800]   They don't want to put people off on.
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.280]   I mean, who knows what kind of stuff Apple's coming up with?
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:24.760]   I think one way to look at Apple is they're looking way beyond just the iPhone and the
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.960]   iPod and the Mac.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.880]   I mean, I guess to a lot of people, that's really obvious, but it's interesting that
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:35.080]   as as fanboys or whatever you want to call us who are constantly looking back and trying
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:38.400]   to kind of read the tea leaves on what's happened so far, I think it's interesting to
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.520]   think about what what if things were going to get really, really crazy and what if they
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:46.160]   were really trying to up end the entire platform idea of how business works, which I think
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.400]   is what this is.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.720]   This is sort of a point that I made in my sometimes column last week where the problem
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:54.520]   for me is not so much that they're trying to or excuse me that they haven't doing things
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.040]   that have a side effect of shutting down third party apps.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:01.200]   My biggest problem is that they're doing things that shut down third party apps and
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:06.560]   they're not saying, I know we're costing people this, but we have plans in place right
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.560]   now.
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.000]   We can't tell you when they're going to come up, but believe me, third party app.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Trust me.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   Well, even that's long.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   That's why I called.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.360]   I mean, I got some email because I refer to the iPhone as the Lindsay Lohan of technology
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:22.680]   where great start, it's through bad management.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:28.480]   He's starting to take some hits, but it's still very, very much recoverable.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:33.440]   But again, most of the problems that Apple is having with public opinion or public impressions
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.160]   of the iPhone can be corrected.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:39.920]   If they simply said, look, we're going to send some high ranking Apple guy out.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.440]   We're going to put him in a nice sweater.
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:45.720]   We're going to have him talk to Charlie Rose and explain all this sort of stuff.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:49.680]   I mean, again, my qualms about what Apple's doing with the iPhone would be completely set
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.680]   aside.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.080]   If they said, look, we've got a software development kit.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:55.280]   What we're working on is just that we're doing, we know we're doing something kind of special
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.880]   here that could break a lot of things if we don't do this carefully.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.600]   But I think that's just likely to happen is Steve Jobs sitting down and having a prime
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.960]   rib because Apple just doesn't do that.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.560]   They don't talk about what they're going to be doing.
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.360]   My concern is which model they're using.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:14.440]   And if they're using the iPod model, yes, it's become a wonderful device and it was
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.920]   pretty good to start with, but it's locked down.
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.080]   There's not a lot you can do with it.
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.080]   It really is.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:22.280]   You're going to work with our ecosystem and that's it.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:29.040]   I would like to see it open up to SDK and it could be that we're just way too early
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.640]   on all this stuff.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.320]   It's not even Christmas yet.
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:37.320]   That's another thing to think about is what would Apple have to gain by calling a press
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.840]   conference tomorrow morning and saying, okay, yeah, we'll open it up to apps.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.360]   I mean, they're famous for keeping stuff in their pocket and it wouldn't surprise me.
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.840]   I'll pull this out of my butt.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:50.040]   It would not surprise me at all if we heard basically radio silence on this until after
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:55.280]   Christmas and then what, say, Mac world, we start seeing, okay, well, here's an SDK and
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:59.720]   by the time of WWDC, we expect to see applications coming out.
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:01.160]   That would not surprise me at all.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:05.520]   It really would be to their benefit because there are admins who have to make their plans
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.560]   three, six months, 12 months in advance.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:12.140]   That oftentimes the difference between them approving this device for their corporations
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:15.800]   use and not approving it is knowing that at some point they'll be able to roll the
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:19.160]   their own apps or they will be able to get the sort of data on the device.
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:23.360]   I should point out, by the way, that John Gruber, John C. Welch and even the Mcallope
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.080]   have all taken this to task.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:32.720]   The Mcallope most eloquently when he said, we keep expecting Reese's peanut butter cups
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.440]   when we were giving Hershey bars.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.160]   And well, let me let me say this right now.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:39.400]   I'm going to give you, I got to find the exact quote.
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:44.600]   He says basically that that just exactly what you said, Merlin, which is, look, Apple's
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.520]   given you what they promised.
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:47.520]   What's the difference?
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.440]   What's the problem?
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.520]   And we want, we want something more.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.080]   And John suggests that you wanted a cow that created cheese.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.640]   Well, that's because of that analogy.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.640]   Yes.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:58.640]   I love that.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.640]   I love that.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.280]   My cow analogy, which is probably way over Burton.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:05.080]   He says the Mcallope's just a little baffled as to why Chris and Leo, after being told repeatedly
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:09.280]   that they would be given Hershey bars, keep expecting Reese's peanut butter cups to fall
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.000]   out of the wrapper.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.040]   Well, because they gave us, I mean, with the third party apps, we actually had those
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:18.280]   Reese's peanut butter cups and we tasted them and they were really really.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.680]   They accidentally opened.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.360]   They accidentally opened the pantry while we were there.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:27.560]   And we saw it's more like Apple saw how much we liked the Reese's cups and suddenly made
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:31.800]   it impossible to combine chocolate and peanut butter, which seemed kind of arbitrary.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:37.360]   I will give the Mcallope credit though for using the term to describe me as the Buffant
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.360]   of knowledge.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.960]   I'm glad he put that on a business card.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:41.960]   I thought that was brilliant.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.960]   And we'll get that off.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.280]   This is really good.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.800]   You do have a little bit poofy hair.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.360]   I just want to say that Chris.
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.920]   Everybody knows that.
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.040]   Do you comb it that way?
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:55.240]   No, it's just the way my head is shaped.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.240]   My head would look away if I had no hair at all.
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:02.360]   He's very wisely linked to a picture of you at the Geek Cruise just so people know what
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.360]   you're talking about.
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.360]   Thanks.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:06.360]   Which is interesting that he has this picture.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:11.920]   I'm wondering if maybe he was on one of these Geek Cruises and just didn't reveal himself.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.280]   We will have the Mcallope on next week.
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:17.120]   So if you will have us, Mcallope.
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:20.960]   But there was a lot of really good discussion about this subject.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.240]   I think it was pretty healthy for the Mac community.
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:27.080]   However, whatever side you came down on.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:31.920]   And it showed that we're not just fanboys who sit back and say, "Do it to me, Mac."
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:34.520]   There's another great one.
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:35.960]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.880]   Look, there's a reason Mcallope tends to buy Apple equipment.
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.880]   And it's not because the company ties him up and puts a red rubber ball in his mouth.
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.240]   Let's leave that to Mrs. Mcallope, shall we?
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:49.600]   It's because there's stuff works and looks better than other stuff.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:53.400]   If someone wants to make stuff that looks and works better than Apple stuff, well, the
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:57.960]   Mcallope might have to have some plastic surgery, but he'll be happy to use it.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:03.400]   It's the ultimate first world problem for Apple because what this says, we've talked
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:04.400]   about this Leo before.
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:08.240]   You remember talking about Brent, your former biggest fan?
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:12.120]   What this says to me is that this is an audience that's incredibly engaged and attached.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:15.720]   And maybe this is a conversation that Apple needed to hear.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.260]   If nothing else, they're getting so much publicity.
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:21.680]   Even if it's people who are all angry, yeah, right, they're going to go out and buy what,
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:22.840]   like Vista tomorrow.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:28.240]   So these are people who are telling them an unvarnished version of what they require
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.400]   from Apple.
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:33.600]   And boy, that's the kind of thing you're never going to buy focus groups to give you this
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.840]   kind of unvarnished opinion.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:39.440]   This is exactly what you'd hope for if you're a company that deals with consumers.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:40.440]   Listen to your consumers.
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.920]   They're saying something to you.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:45.440]   All right, let's move along as long as we're unhappy and disappointed.
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:46.440]   How about?
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.120]   No, I'm happy now.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.200]   No more hate mail, please.
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.680]   I love whatever Apple does from now on.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.520]   You know, it's really came down the line.
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.280]   You know, the Apple fanboys were mad at us for not being such fanboys.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:00.120]   And then there were a lot of Windows people who had other reasons to.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.360]   No, exactly.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.800]   I thought it was so funny because this is the first time I've sort of crossed the fanboys.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:09.680]   And I got a very interesting collection of email on the one side with the fanboys who
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:13.640]   were just furious that I would dare knock Apple for this stuff.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:19.040]   And on the other side, I was sent laundry lists of complaints people had had about Apple
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.040]   forever.
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:24.520]   And you know, some of them said now that you're in the fall.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:29.640]   Well, the first thing fanboys do, of course, is accuse you of being a fanboy.
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:34.720]   The minute you criticize their personal religion, you're a fanboy on the other side.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:35.720]   Right.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.640]   It's very, it's a very interesting experience.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.440]   Let's talk about leopard because this is supposed to be leopard month.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:47.520]   Both think secret and Apple rumors are saying for reasons they haven't made clear September
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.760]   or October 26th is going to be the day.
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.520]   Anybody have inside information?
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:55.520]   I don't have any inside information.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:57.360]   It sounded like I was talking to you.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.520]   Unlike John C. de Vorak.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.320]   I honor my end.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.760]   Oh, you know something?
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.760]   Do you know something?
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.760]   Who said that?
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:05.760]   Was that Patrick?
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.760]   I think it was Patrick.
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.600]   Well, I'm not in DA so that I actually don't have to know anything.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.600]   It's my...
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:13.600]   I got nothing.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:15.320]   No, I mean, I was a...
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.920]   I had a kind of a bit of...
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:20.200]   I think I talked to you about a little Leo, but I had a kind of a horror story with my
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.640]   little Macintosh last week.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:26.120]   And so I spent a lot of time in the Apple store and they seem pretty sure that they were
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.480]   going to get it by the end of the month.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:28.640]   Well, they've said the end of the month.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.880]   I mean, they've never said anything but the end of the month.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:31.880]   I don't think...
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.440]   Yeah, I think they're just going to get as close to the end of the month as possible.
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.440]   That means Halloween, right?
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.280]   I don't think it's going to be fully cooked.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:40.240]   I think they're going to want to avoid that Halloween trick or treat.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.640]   What's in the box?
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:43.640]   Put your hand inside.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.480]   Hey, wait a minute.
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:46.720]   This is just full of rocks.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.720]   No, I'm not sure.
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:49.720]   I pre-ordered it.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.720]   I'm ready.
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:55.360]   I mean, again, no matter what I say about the iPhone is the minute it comes out, I'll
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:56.360]   be in line.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:58.320]   Yeah, I put it up.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.320]   Mclop says we're asking too much of it.
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:04.080]   He also criticizes you Chris Buffont-Breen for Chris.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:08.320]   Why is this only turning to gang up on Chris Breen?
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:09.880]   No, we love Chris Breen.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.640]   It's the back lobe.
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:15.960]   We've all been compiling a list of complaints about Chris forever.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.560]   Now they're all coming down.
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.400]   Mostly we envy his lush head of hair.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.840]   We do, exactly.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.680]   So Buffont of knowledge.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:23.680]   Yes.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:27.440]   He says that both you and I last episode, I think, we're saying leopard ought to be something
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.440]   good.
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.800]   I'm expecting quite a bit of it.
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:32.040]   He says, you don't have to expect so much.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.280]   Why do you want so much?
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.680]   Yeah, I saw that comment.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.640]   I think it was a little bit out of context.
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:42.220]   I think that particularly I was talking about some of the things that we've seen in the publicly
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:47.240]   available knowledge where we're seeing some interface stuff that's just a little odd.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:53.120]   The whole reflective doc thing you put on the right or left side and the doc analogy disappears.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:56.880]   Translucent menu bar is kind of strange.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.000]   And the flat gray folder.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:03.440]   So I think partly what I was speaking about was leopard coming out and people looking at
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:09.640]   sort of the physical visage and say, oh, is this really?
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:12.000]   Is this the best we can come up with for all this time?
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   Right.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   Right.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.160]   Well, and I'm wondering, sometimes you do eye candy if you don't have anything more substantive
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:20.840]   under the hood, you know, like Vista did, for instance.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:26.720]   So I'm wondering if, but let's ask the question, the mackelep's posing.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.240]   You know, this has only been two years since Tiger came out.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:30.760]   Do we really need a major update?
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:31.760]   Is this just going to be?
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:34.080]   I mean, why are we asking too much of leopard?
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.160]   Are we waiting hoping for too much?
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.160]   Will we be disappointed when it comes out?
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:41.880]   Isn't it isn't a true that they tend to sort of alternate the really, really big updates
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:45.600]   that are designed to make the users go wild and really, really, and the ones that are
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:49.160]   with the have updates that are more subtle things that developers can take advantage of
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.720]   to make the next generation of really, really good software.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:52.720]   It seems to be.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.720]   Exactly.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:59.920]   So I think that's one of the things that I'm really, really like about it for users.
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:04.400]   I mean, CoverFlow, I kind of laughed at it when I first saw it in the Finder, but dang it,
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:05.940]   I use it all the time.
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:06.940]   It's wonderful.
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:08.900]   It'll be nice to have that as a document preview capability.
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:09.900]   Exactly.
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:12.520]   I mean, so many because I'm, you know, I'm just like everybody else.
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:13.520]   I'm a total idiot.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.400]   I don't really organize things into folders.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:21.160]   I just simply say, Oh, a folder marked pictures 0141 say project three.
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.320]   Okie dokie.
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:25.680]   It could be any one of these 800 documents, but with with leopard, it's like, okay,
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.360]   but oh, yes, there it is.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:28.360]   Cool.
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:29.360]   I'll read it.
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:30.360]   Oh, that's not it.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:31.360]   Move forward.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.360]   I think that's what a computer should do.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.360]   That's the Google model versus the Yahoo model.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.440]   I think it's exactly the idea.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:39.520]   Yeah, I think that if it disappoints people, it's only because it doesn't go as far as
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:41.200]   maybe people were might hope.
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:45.440]   I'm still hoping for an operating system that can simply either through voice or even through
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:50.480]   a text box, lobby to say, show me the sometimes column that I wrote three days ago and simply
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:54.040]   say, Oh, you must mean this one because there's only one that matches all those parameters.
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:56.200]   I can understand English here.
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:59.880]   I think you want a quick silver with the neural implant plug in.
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:00.880]   Yeah, baby.
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:03.240]   That's what I'm hoping for.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.720]   That's what I'm waiting for.
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:05.720]   Guy, go ahead.
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.720]   You want what?
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:10.680]   I was making a wise-ass comment.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:15.480]   One thing I'll be curious about is whether I can do a raw install on my on my laptop.
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:18.320]   Well, okay, let's let's raise this issue because this is what what happened for Alex
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:19.880]   his laptop.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:21.320]   He put a new hard drive in.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:24.440]   He had disks from a different laptop.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:26.840]   I wasn't able to install them on that other one.
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:27.840]   Not only that.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.760]   So I want to put a 250 gig drive in, which I did, which was great.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:32.240]   I didn't do it.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:35.320]   I did the first one I ruined my laptop.
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:38.120]   That was my last laptop.
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:44.240]   So I just took it to the PowerBook guy and he swapped my laptop, swapped my hard drive.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.360]   Then I took it back and I said, I don't want you to put anything on it because I just
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.360]   want to put everything back on.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:50.400]   I want a super clean install.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:53.000]   And I had checked my disks before I gave it to him to make sure I had them.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.880]   So this is MacBook Pro.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:59.840]   So I put it in and of course it says you can't you can't install from this disk.
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:00.840]   This isn't the right.
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.760]   This one isn't incompatible.
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:03.920]   And so I was like, okay, okay, okay.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:08.120]   And I looked around and I turned out, I guess for whatever reason I didn't, I couldn't find
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:09.120]   any.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:13.320]   I went over to the Apple store and just bought a new I figured a new version of OS 10 will
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.320]   be good enough.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:18.280]   And then I put it in there and I put it in there and I put it in there and I put it in
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:23.680]   a brand new version of OS 10 and that I bought for 130 bucks, which of course I can't return
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:25.520]   and because of the software.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:29.040]   And I put it in and of course it won't work either.
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:30.040]   You know, it can't even.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:34.640]   So then I call it just says this hardware is incompatible with this operating system.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:35.640]   You know, just boom.
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:36.640]   It just it's just immediate.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:40.200]   You know, as soon as you as soon as you boot up into the CD mode and get ready to do
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:43.080]   the install, it'll do the check and it says immediately just comes back and says it can't
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:44.080]   do it.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:51.760]   And then I call Apple care with, you know, in India or whatever and they make it clear
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:52.760]   that you can't do that.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:53.760]   You're going to have to.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.360]   So I then I pay another 40 bucks and I and I assume I've been traveling.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:59.040]   So I don't know if it actually showed up or not, but I assume that the discs when I get
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:03.800]   home will be will be there, you know, and then I'll be able to now now have the software
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.120]   that I need to actually run it.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:09.280]   Now it turns out I talked to some folks that are, you know, a little bit into hacking and
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:14.160]   they they said that there's you know, this is the part that really is frustrating is they
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:19.960]   said that if you if you do the discs and then go in and look, there's a package that actually
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:23.280]   looks for what version looks for what version it's installing on.
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:27.640]   And if it's a laptop, it won't, you know, if it's, you know, it like literally they,
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:32.600]   you know, it could be two different laptops released in the same week of the same type
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:36.280]   in it, you know, it's very, very specific about whether it's a black MacBook or a white
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.640]   MacBook or a MacBook Pro.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.920]   And it has to come with those discs.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:43.280]   And if you don't have that, it won't install.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:47.120]   Now it turns out if you take that package and you delete it, I've been told that it'll
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.200]   just install on anything to universal.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:50.200]   So here's the question.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.480]   Different about the operating system.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:52.480]   That's what's frustrating.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.000]   There's nothing different about the operating system.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.160]   It's another iPhone thing.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:57.920]   It's a form of copy protection.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:58.920]   Here's the question.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:02.880]   What I'm surprised that the shrink wrap box didn't work though.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:04.360]   And what will happen when leopard comes along?
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:09.520]   Will we be forced to do an upgrade instead of a, you know, wipe the disc and install?
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:12.640]   Well, that's the, that's the, that's the going to be the big question, which I'll be
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.040]   able to tell you soon enough.
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:15.920]   Well, all of us will.
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:18.320]   I mean, I, yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm planning a part of everything.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:21.120]   Well, a lot of people don't notice this because what they do is they do, they do what's called
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:25.040]   a clean install, but that's not really, I mean, it's when I'm talking about clean install,
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:29.520]   I'm talking about formatting it's blank drive, you know, you know, and then build up from
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:30.520]   scratch.
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:32.040]   Well, that's what I've always recommended, frankly.
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:33.040]   Right.
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:37.440]   So it's, it's going to be, it's going to be interesting to see how that turns out.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:43.040]   So anyway, that's the, it's, it's, it's another one of those things that you, you know, in
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.840]   my head, it was just like, what are people thinking?
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:46.240]   And I know what they're thinking.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.600]   They're thinking that they're going to, you know, keep people from copying, I guess the
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:50.800]   discs from one friend to another.
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:55.880]   But you know, when you can't, when you can't, for a shrink, for a shrink wrap, when not
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:59.600]   to work, that's, that sounds kind of like something like almost like it needs to be
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:04.000]   blessed or something like some bit needs to be flipped on the drive.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.600]   Cause I've installed shrink wrapped clean on laptop.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:09.600]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.600]   On MacBook Pro.
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:12.600]   Not on, not on, not on that recent, recent of a laptop.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:13.600]   Right.
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:14.600]   Right.
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:15.600]   I have to.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:16.600]   I've done it before.
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:19.240]   But that's how I put, that's how I put tiger on all my old panthering machines.
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:21.360]   I always, I was a format install.
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:23.560]   Although, I mean, the, the, the, this, what is it?
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:24.560]   Save and upgrade?
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:26.400]   What is the one where they copy it over to the sales?
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:32.120]   It's fine, I guess, but I think that's what most, I'm assuming that that would work.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.560]   It's just that, you know, that's not what I want.
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:37.640]   I mean, I, what I had sitting there was a blank drive and what I wanted to put on it was,
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.440]   you know, was, was always 10.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:44.440]   Well, maybe I can clear a fragile that knows why this happened.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:48.000]   At least you didn't have your pants set on fire by your nano.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.400]   Oh, were there pictures?
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:51.960]   I didn't see any pictures.
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:52.960]   I want pictures.
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:54.680]   I've seen a picture of the nano.
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:56.240]   Pictures of our pictures that didn't happen.
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:58.160]   Remember that's the, that's the, that's the big thing.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:02.320]   And Atlanta man says his iPod nano caught fire in his pants.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:05.480]   Two year old iPod.
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:09.920]   He was oddly enough at the airport where he is employed.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.600]   Now that's got to be a little scary.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:14.280]   Is that a burn around on fire at the airport?
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.480]   That would be very bomb in your pants.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:17.880]   Um, no, I don't know.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:19.480]   Was it badly?
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:25.320]   Uh, didn't say it didn't really talk about a lot of the, get this glossy paper in his
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:29.200]   pocket may have shielded him from getting burned by the fire.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:30.360]   Interesting.
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:32.760]   So carry more glossy paper.
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:34.280]   Mm hmm.
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:36.640]   What I want to know is what song was playing at the time.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:38.440]   Because that would be enough for one download.
[00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:40.080]   It's got to be James Brown.
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:42.080]   God.
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:43.080]   Hot pants.
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:45.080]   I was going to find the pants.
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:46.840]   Oh, I get hot pants.
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:47.840]   Hot pants.
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:48.840]   Right.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:51.280]   Or Hendricks's fire.
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:52.880]   It could have been the, yeah.
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:55.120]   I'm riding in your car.
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:58.680]   I'm sitting in your pants.
[00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:02.560]   Turn on the nano when we kiss.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:05.080]   So what's the, what's the follow up on that?
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.080]   What the hell happened?
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.920]   I think they're trying to drive upgrades for these things really.
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.520]   And so they say, come on.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.520]   It's about time.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:16.800]   Actually, actually, sir, you had, you'd read the, read the, the, you would understand
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:21.960]   that it's a clause, a small clause that will cause your pants to be on fire in two years.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:26.240]   My theory is that the impossible missions for us as to switch to distributing their instructions
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.240]   via podcast.
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.240]   Now this is not all little self-districting.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:33.960]   Hey, you know, I didn't, didn't, didn't he, what did he use in MI three?
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.400]   Didn't he have like something like that?
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.080]   It was an iPhone that burst into flames or something.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:43.920]   We want to thank Jay Lanters, by the way, for submitting this suggestion, a couch created
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.840]   out of old Apple Mac to computers.
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:51.880]   Oh, so this goes right with that backpack out of the, I don't know if you guys are
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:52.880]   tired about this.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:57.920]   There's a guy who made a backpack out of an SC.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.840]   This is in this case, we have pictures.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:04.440]   Pick since I it's 20 Mac, Mac, touch two computers.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.280]   A guy had him lying around at a Mac store.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:13.080]   They turned it into a, I think probably got to be a fairly firm couch.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:15.560]   I think he just doesn't like overnight guests.
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:16.560]   Sure.
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.680]   You could sleep on my couch.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:19.680]   Sure.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.760]   In the store, you can actually see it in the store, which is, I think, a great, really
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.320]   great idea.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.520]   Think about it though, and they point this out in the, in the, in the website where they
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.040]   talk about it.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.160]   These, these were very expensive.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.600]   These Mac twos were five grand each.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.200]   So he's got a hundred thousand dollar couch there.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:39.120]   Oh, isn't it good furniture doesn't depreciate faster than computers.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.760]   Well, the cushions will certainly never get mushy.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:42.760]   You can.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.280]   It looks really, really uncomfortable.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.480]   Yeah, it's pretty hard.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.240]   And it's a lot of computers.
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:48.240]   Oh my gosh.
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.240]   20 to Apple twos.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:53.960]   All right, let's get our, let's anyway has other stories that they would like to talk
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:54.960]   about.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.120]   I want to thank you, by the way, Merlin, for spanning sink.
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:59.960]   It's been, I just love the fact that I can use Google Calendar now and have it automatically
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:00.960]   sync to my I-Cal.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:01.960]   That was a great pick.
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.400]   Oh, I'm glad that's working for you.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:10.080]   Yeah, I have to say ever since I've switched over, I, I don't open I-Cal so much anymore.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.280]   I, I do pretty much everything.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.000]   It's all in Google Calendar, huh?
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.880]   But yeah, then it gets synced up to my phone and, you know, life is good.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.880]   Wow.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.400]   Well, it works nicely with my Blackberry too, I want to say.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.000]   I just want to point that out.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   Nice.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   Nice.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.840]   So let's get to our, well, actually before we do picks, I do want to mention our good
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.640]   friends at, now you know what I'm not going to mention them.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:34.800]   No longer your good friends are what?
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:39.040]   No, they're still my good friends, but I'm just thinking, they know why.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.080]   They know why.
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.080]   They know why.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.720]   They know how to put this right, but they're just too stubborn.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.800]   Well, Leo could be just as stubborn.
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:51.360]   I can just show you.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.880]   Go get their butts, Leo.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.400]   Your real friends support you in this.
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:00.080]   You know, the, the real issue is we have a contract, but it's unclear on how many episodes
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.080]   it's supposed to be in.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:05.040]   And so I don't want to over, over, over to let's do it, but really half acid.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.040]   Okay.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:13.080]   So, you know, there's a, there's a book about this dude who has a car.
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.640]   And he drives a car to like this state where there's this restaurant, he meets this other
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.640]   guy.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.120]   It's an awesome story.
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.440]   Plus the guy who reads it.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:24.760]   He was in that movie like last year with a thing and man, it's awesome.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:25.760]   You should definitely go get this.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.120]   He's that English guy that was in that other movie.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.120]   With the wizard.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.120]   With the wizard.
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:33.480]   Hey, you do have a book actually.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.560]   Do you want to mention a book?
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:37.480]   Cause I think you saved this from last week, Andy.
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:43.000]   That's because this is one of those things where I was enjoying the paper book so much
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.120]   that I needed to multitask my way through it.
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:50.240]   It's a classic, one of the great American novels called All the Kings Men.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.920]   Oh, I have a read that in ages.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.320]   I'd love to read that again.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:58.000]   It's one of those books that you read it years ago or you heard about it, but you know the
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.320]   title, but you haven't really done anything.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.360]   All Robert Penn Warren, who wrote that?
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.360]   Robert, Robert Penn Warren.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:07.960]   It is the classic tale of American government.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.360]   Isn't it like a fake Huey long?
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.360]   Exactly.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.480]   It's loosely based on the career of Huey long.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:19.360]   Someone who starts off as sort of an idealistic person who gets into politics and finds himself
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.960]   corrupted both from within and from without to become this huge, tight, tannic political
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:24.960]   figure.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.600]   But one of the greatest things about this book, especially as an audiobook, is that it's
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.760]   a first person book.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.680]   It's not written from the point of view of this political figure.
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:33.680]   It's written essentially.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:37.320]   It's the story that's being told by his, essentially his press advisor.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:41.480]   So when you're in the car or when you're taking a walk and you hear this voice that's simply
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:44.920]   telling you this story, it feels so much more intimate.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:49.800]   And on top of everything else, it's just one of the most intricate and compelling stories
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.600]   I have read.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.880]   You sit with a book, I was sitting down at like seven o'clock.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:57.480]   So, well, I need to get going on work at eight or something, but I'll read a little bit.
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.800]   And then it's like 10 o'clock.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:01.200]   And I'm like, oh, I look for books.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.120]   One of the reasons I love doing these book recommendations is because if you find a book
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.840]   like that, I mean, that is a gift to give some.
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.840]   I'll come in advance.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:08.840]   Yeah, I just bought it.
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:12.120]   I just, that's now on my, it's going to be on my iPod in an hour.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.120]   Thank you for the suggestion.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:18.560]   And let's give them the plug audible.com/macbreak and get a free book by going there.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:19.560]   Could be this book.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:20.560]   In fact, it should be this book.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.560]   It sounds like it's one credit.
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.960]   You went more than halfway, Leo.
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:24.960]   I did.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:25.960]   You brought it.
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:26.960]   You did what you needed.
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:29.320]   You got a big heart though, a big heart.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.680]   Everybody should have a friend like you.
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:31.680]   I don't know.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.960]   I don't want people to think there's any problem with Audible.
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:33.960]   We love Audible.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:34.960]   There's no problem at all.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.560]   Oh, I better not start downloading all the Kingsmen.
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.800]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is a 20 hour book.
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.800]   Holy cow.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.200]   I better pause that.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.200]   Skype will just go.
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.560]   You are getting all the Kingsmen.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:45.560]   Not just some of them.
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.960]   You get every one of the Kingsmen.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:52.560]   But anyway, audible.com/macbreak still gets you free chapter at audible.com/freechaptor
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:57.800]   of the Chopin manuscript and whether or not they're supporting this podcast, we thank them.
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.000]   We support Audible with our Kingsmen.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   We support them.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.800]   And if no, it's just that we overproduced last time and I don't want to anyway.
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.880]   I heard a really good Huey Long story.
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:13.680]   I don't know if this is true, but I was in a cab in, well, I guess Baton Rouge.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:18.720]   And a few years ago, the cab driver said, "Hey, you see that big stadium over there?"
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.200]   He was like, " Huey Long."
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:24.240]   He really wanted to build a new stadium for the football team.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:27.840]   The only money that was available was for a college football team.
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:30.040]   The only money that was available was dorm money.
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:33.680]   But basically, he built dorms on the first floor of the stadium.
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:36.280]   And he used the rest of the money to build a stadium.
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.280]   So awesome.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.680]   That's the Kingfisher talking.
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.680]   We need politicians like that nowadays.
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.720]   You knew how to get stuff done.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.520]   He knew how to bring it to the people.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.520]   He was beloved.
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.520]   Anyway.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.520]   He was kind of like a Louisiana Stalin in some ways.
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.520]   Wasn't he?
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:51.400]   But the trains were all on time.
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.320]   I would put that bumper sticker on my car.
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.960]   Vote for Thomas Menino.
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.400]   He's the Stalin of Boston.
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.400]   Did you need a Stalin to get things done?
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.480]   Merlin, man, you have a software pick for us today.
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.480]   You know what?
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.640]   You like to pick Merlin, your last pick.
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:09.600]   You're going to make me cry.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:13.040]   My pick, I'm pretty sure I've done this before, this app.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.720]   But I'm going to say it again because I like it a lot and because I have a tip related.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.520]   And that's speed download.
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:22.520]   And if you do anything with downloading stuff from the internet, speed download makes that
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.520]   a lot easier.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.680]   It's a for pay app.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:28.720]   But what it does is it gives you a plug-in that integrates it with whatever browser you're
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:33.000]   using, such that if you go to a page and you start to download something like a zip file
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.920]   or a movie or what have you, you can configure speed download to then take over the downloading
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:43.880]   of that, which sounds like you wouldn't really need it except it's great at resumable downloads,
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.960]   which Safari is not so great at.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.320]   And it also can also open up multiple connections.
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:51.320]   So you can do things like say, which is, you know, you want to make sure you're doing
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:53.080]   this on a server that can handle it.
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:57.120]   But for example, if you're downloading, you know, from a really robust site, you can open
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:00.800]   10 or 15 different threads and download multiple things at once.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.000]   It's really smart.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.720]   But the reason I'm mentioning it today is something I can't believe I never knew it did
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.280]   until now and I'm loving.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:10.960]   I'm a big fan of, you know, occasionally browsing MP3 blogs where people will put up
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:14.400]   like somebody just put up this amazing Ramones concert from 1979.
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.400]   Oh, wow.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.400]   I don't have the link here.
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:19.560]   Really good live show New Year's Eve, 1979.
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:23.880]   And so of course it's hosted on one of those squirly services, free services.
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:27.200]   And it's a big old, you know, list of MP3s.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:32.040]   You can tell speed download, go to this URL and download everything on this page that
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.440]   links to the following media type.
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:37.160]   And so you can go in and say, basically go download everything on this page that's an
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:41.000]   MP3 and put it in this folder and my downloads folder.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.320]   This sounds really trivial unless you do this all the time.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.880]   My downloads folder was a mess before I started doing this.
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:46.840]   And now it's a lot easier.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:48.760]   And so it's just a really great app.
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:49.760]   I don't know.
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:52.280]   I think it's in like the typical kind of $30 range.
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:57.120]   It's Yazzsoft, Y-A-Z-S-O-F-T, I believe.com.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.400]   And I like it a lot.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.240]   I think if you're going to be serious about downloading stuff, it's nice to have an app
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:02.240]   like this.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.240]   You can schedule things.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.600]   So you can say, do my scheduling over, do my downloading overnight.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:10.880]   You can do things like say this server or this particular domain is a sensitive server.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.520]   Don't bang on it too hard.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.760]   It remembers authentication.
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:18.360]   Great app speed download for Yazzsoft.com.
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.880]   Very, very good.
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:26.680]   Let's see here next on the list in alphabetical order, Alex Lindsey.
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:32.280]   So my pick is actually, most people already have it.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:34.360]   They just don't know that they have it.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:39.240]   I was talking to someone about wanting to get into, I was fiddling with some coding.
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:43.600]   And they were like, I don't know how to get into coding on a Mac.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.080]   And I realized that a lot of people don't know that when they get their operating system,
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:47.080]   so this is a free one.
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:51.560]   But when you get your operating system disk, hidden on there is Xcode.
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:56.440]   And Xcode is a fully featured, it is what people are writing all these software.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.800]   You know, all the new software.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:03.760]   So you have this incredible programming environment that is sitting, that comes with your operating
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:04.760]   system.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:08.400]   And so it is something that you have to choose to install it.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.960]   And you have to, it's not something that just automatically on your computer.
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:14.800]   But if you, it's worth going back and getting those disks.
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:19.040]   And we're hoping to do some stuff in the near future, but that will make it more fun for
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:20.040]   you to get started.
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.840]   You know, that's something we're kind of playing with.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:22.840]   Oh, really?
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:23.840]   Like, yeah, we have stuff.
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:28.400]   Well, we're going to start, we're working right now on a new, on a new podcast just for
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.360]   people who want to develop stuff.
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:31.760]   So not just not just not.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.360]   Not Mac tech, something in addition to that.
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:38.160]   Yeah, I know it's, it's another Mac break show, but, but, and it's probably another month
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:39.160]   away.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:44.680]   But it's, what it is, is it's really dealing with whether it's playing with Xcode or Automator
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:49.160]   or Apple script or, you know, things that people who want to get, you know, beaky about
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.160]   it.
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.280]   And we just feel like that's a, that's a niche area.
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:56.720]   Mac break tech was a lot more, a lot more to listen to than we expected.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.960]   It was kind of like something we had some fun with.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:02.560]   And so what we want to do is there's a lot of people that just don't know where to start.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:03.920]   And so we're going to kind of play with that.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:08.160]   But the, but as we start to get ready for that, and as I started talking about it, I suddenly
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.720]   realized that a lot of people didn't even know that Xcode, what, you know, came with
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:14.480]   their computer and they thought that it was something else they'd have to go get.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:18.680]   So when you install those tools, you, it creates a directory through call developer that you
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:20.000]   may not even know is there.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.360]   And there are so many great applications in there for stuff you'd never imagine you would
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.840]   need.
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.120]   And those are real handy.
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.400]   P list editor and there's the great courts, the stuff.
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:29.400]   He list editors.
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.400]   Awesome.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:33.400]   That's amazing.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:35.400]   It's really, really fun.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.640]   And so, so I, you know, highly suggest people go back and find their discs and throw
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:40.440]   that on and just start playing, especially just doing what Merlin said, it just play
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.320]   with some of the apps that come with it.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:45.640]   Find your discs wherever they may be.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:50.840]   Assuming, assuming that you can, you know, install on your, I'm assuming the Xcode stuff
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:51.840]   will work on that.
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.000]   That's why I'm guessing the Xcode stuff will work.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.280]   You can get the offer to the paint, not actually install, but.
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.200]   Let's, I'm going to actually throw mine in here.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:05.960]   A couple of weeks ago, I mentioned a program that was allowing me to get aperture photos
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:12.760]   into, into Flickr very easily, just in the same way that I was able to do from iPhone
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.600]   on it's, I couldn't remember the name.
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:21.280]   It is picture sync, Windows and Mac, and really useful, not just for Flickr, but for all of
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.120]   the photosites, and they have to support a ton of them.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:28.880]   And not just for not aperture, Lightroom, which is what I was using, but not just for
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:34.000]   Lightroom, but for a lot of other programs, you get iPhoto Media Pro, aperture, Lightroom,
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.440]   all of them.
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:38.200]   So it's a really useful little plugin.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:42.320]   And then I, you know, I've been in the past used the great Flickr exporter, and I'm sure
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:45.560]   that's what probably Andy uses and most people doing it.
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.920]   And I noticed now that they support Lightroom.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.920]   So I'm really, want to actually give you both of them.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:53.840]   There's picture sync, but there's also Flickr X support, which I've been using for iPhoto
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.840]   for a long time.
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:55.840]   I'm sorry, not Lightroom, aperture.
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:00.320]   They have Flickr export for aperture, both a free and a paid version.
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.240]   So these are both of these programs.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:06.880]   This one's from ConnectedFlow, the other one, PictureSync, is from picturesync.net.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:12.280]   Are really handy plugins you add to your photo management software that makes it easy to
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.960]   get them onto a website.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:17.120]   So what do you use, Andy, because you put a lot of stuff up on Flickr.
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.520]   I use either that Flickr plugin that you--
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.280]   Flickr export, yeah.
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:22.360]   Flickr export.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.880]   Or believe it or not, I just do straight exports.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:30.040]   The new Flickr uploader that's web-based is actually fairly good.
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:34.800]   So because I don't have that-- believe it or not, I have two other computers that I upload
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:37.680]   from that I don't have Flickr exporter on.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:41.240]   And the times when I'm uploading, I've sort of stopped doing the cheap thing where I've
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.040]   forced people to look at 100 photos that I've blasted up there.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.320]   I tried to space them out.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.320]   OK, here are eight.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:47.320]   Right.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.960]   Tomorrow, here are seven more.
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:50.720]   So it's not quite so difficult.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:56.640]   But yeah, Flickr, the first time I tried it to do it directly with Flickr and realized just
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:57.640]   how sophisticated, how--
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:58.640]   It's not so bad.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:13:59.640]   You're right.
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:00.640]   I hate these in this term.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.640]   How web 2.0?
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:02.640]   It is.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.800]   It's actually very, very nice.
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.480]   Yes, some good pictures from your trip to New York, including stuff in water.
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:12.200]   Are you going to keep doing that CBS thing?
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.200]   Once a month now.
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:14.200]   That's great.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.400]   That's great.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.840]   It's really a lot of fun because they just let me do what I want to do.
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:18.840]   So--
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:19.840]   So you've changed, man.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:20.840]   You've really changed.
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:21.840]   It used to be about the music.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.880]   Now it's about a bigger card, dude.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:24.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:28.120]   See if you'll enjoy it sometime soon.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:29.120]   Chris, really?
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:32.480]   Chris Breen, what's your Mac pick?
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:37.600]   My Mac pick was inspired by the release of Popcorn 3 from Roxio because one of the things
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:41.560]   that Popcorn does is it incorporates a bunch of stuff from Toast Titanium 8.
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:46.880]   One of those things is the Tivo to go service where you can get to a series 2 Tivo and download
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:47.880]   content from it.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:52.360]   The problem with Popcorn and Toast Titanium is that the versions that they download from
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:53.920]   Tivo are crippled.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:54.920]   So they give you 320 by 240.
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:57.840]   They don't give you the full res version of it.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:02.960]   So I looked back into the archives and I realized that Tivo to code manager still works.
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:07.600]   It's a free AppleScript Studio interface for the Tivo to code program.
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:12.600]   And it essentially automates the process of downloading programs from your series 2
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:15.560]   Tivo, brings it right to your computer, and then it converts them.
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.560]   You can convert it.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:21.280]   You can have it go into MPEG-2 or you can have it converted to MPEG-4 files and then automatically
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.680]   dropped into your iTunes library.
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:27.280]   It's available at tdm.sourceforge.net.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.680]   It's free.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:31.680]   It's a little slow, but all this stuff is.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:35.520]   Getting programming off the Tivo is not a fast way to go.
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:38.920]   There are other ways to do it, either the pay for versions from Roxy or you can certainly
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.680]   do it from a browser.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:42.720]   But it's a very nice utility.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:46.720]   Run it over a night, grab three or four programs from it, and next morning your stuff's in
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:47.720]   your iTunes.
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:48.720]   That's cool.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.640]   Try having a direct Tivo.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.640]   It's like having a Betamax.
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.560]   You can't do anything with it.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:57.040]   It's too bad, isn't it?
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.040]   It is.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:59.520]   See, though, this is how the man gets you.
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:00.720]   He shows you what you can do.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:01.720]   And then withdraw.
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:02.720]   Takes it away.
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:03.720]   Takes it away.
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:04.720]   I'm loving my Apple TV.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:05.720]   I use it all the time.
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:08.600]   I download shows, put them on there, and it works great.
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:15.080]   I'm sad that the office isn't on iTunes, but still a great way to do it.
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:16.080]   Let's see.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:18.600]   We've done, and do we do you, Andy?
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:19.600]   We just did you, Andy?
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:20.600]   No, we did not.
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:21.600]   Well, then it's Andy's turn.
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:22.600]   So, that's right.
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:26.040]   We were talking about pictures, but we didn't talk about a pic.
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.000]   Yes.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   Excuse me.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.320]   I'm just choking back on this rejection that you just handed.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:34.320]   Air ball.
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.680]   It's because you're so rich and successful now.
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:37.160]   You're eating all those starchy foods.
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.160]   Air ball.
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.160]   Aren't I, though?
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.040]   Thank you for pointing that out, because it would make me look really, really like
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.040]   egotistical five points.
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.040]   They're so successful.
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:44.040]   That's right.
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:48.040]   The CPS is taking me to New York City on a train.
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:49.040]   All right.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:52.840]   I was just burning a $100 bill, and some of the fumes got it in my nose.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:53.840]   Don't worry.
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:55.480]   I'll stamp it on this diamond ash tray.
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:56.480]   I don't even smoke.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:59.280]   I just like the incense smell.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:00.280]   Okay.
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:05.480]   Let's go with something that's actually a little bit cheaper, because we've been all
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:10.160]   been talking about this really, really wonderful Panasonic HD camcorder that records on flash
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.160]   memory.
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.440]   It really is a wonderful device.
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:17.520]   I've been referring to it as the ultimate capture device, because it'll capture five
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:18.720]   megapixel photos.
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:20.480]   It's really the high-def video.
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:21.960]   It's really, really great.
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:24.880]   But it is like a $700, $900 thing.
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:30.040]   I came across another device, another solid state device in Panasonic's camcorder line,
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:37.080]   the Panasonic SDR, S10, which doesn't try to be the ultimate high-def camcorder.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:43.840]   It tries to be a version of the basic home camcorder that records onto SD cards.
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:48.880]   So feature number one, you can buy for 270, 280 bucks.
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:52.240]   Feature number two, it does record onto SDHC cards.
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:56.160]   You can get four, five, six, seven hours of video on each card.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:00.200]   And you get the same advantage when you're editing, which is that you just pop this card
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:05.400]   into a card reader, and it takes minutes for an hour hours worth of video to land into
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:06.400]   iMovie.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:10.760]   The files that it creates, if you're using the latest version of iMovie, it will import
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:13.520]   directly, no conversion necessary.
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:18.480]   It mounts as a standard USB device, so that if you're using a previous edition of iMovie,
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:23.760]   you just have to take those .mod video files and just change the name to .mov.
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:27.000]   And quick time will see, and quick time will be able to deal with them.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.400]   But it's so wonderful because it's about the size of a trio, so I don't like camcorders
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:36.680]   because I'm kind of okay with looking like such a big tourist that I'm carrying like
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.160]   a big SLR around with me.
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:42.840]   I can't get my head around the concept of carrying this big camcorder with me, but this is small
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:44.800]   enough you can just toss it inside a pocket.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:48.440]   The video quality, it's not as good as what you're going to get if you, even if you bought
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:51.080]   like an $800 conventional camcorder.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:56.040]   But it's definitely within this range of quality that you get for a $300 or $400 camcorder.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:59.840]   Mostly it's because the image chip is so small because it's such a compact thing.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:03.800]   But on top of all those other benefits, it's completely weatherproof.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:08.560]   You can't dunk it under water, but if you're on a jet ski with your kids and it gets splashed
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:12.200]   who cares, you can drop it three or four feet, no problem.
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:15.440]   Because again, the only moving part is the motor for the zoom.
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:20.720]   And believe me, one of the great things about my job is that people are foolish enough to
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.240]   lend me things.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:25.880]   So Panasonic, so I had absolutely no motivation to take good care of it.
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:29.960]   And I was first tentatively just dropping it on the carpet floor in my office.
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:32.280]   And I was dropping on the wood floor.
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:40.560]   And by the time I was actually, I was actually, I was actually, I was tossing it around.
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:44.240]   Most people, they don't like to take out their camcorders in certain events because they don't
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:47.120]   want it to get lost, they don't want to get damaged.
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:50.800]   If you're worried about a camcorder that you can hand off to your kids and say, yeah,
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:52.880]   why don't you take the camcorder and shoot some stuff?
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:53.880]   No problem.
[01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:57.680]   This is the darn near the most indestructible camcorder you can get for less than a thousand
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:58.680]   bucks.
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:19:59.680]   And it's not less than a thousand bucks.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.520]   It's like 280 bucks right now on Amazon.
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.520]   You can get it for 285.
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:03.520]   Wow.
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:04.880]   But I'm really happy with the quality.
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:05.880]   Again, I'm not a video.
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:08.120]   You prefer this to the SD one that you had?
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:09.120]   Excuse me?
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:12.320]   You prefer this to the SD one you had?
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:16.840]   I prefer it in the sense that it's smaller, it's more compact and it's cheaper.
[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:21.320]   I probably would not buy, again, that high definition camcorder because I just don't
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:23.640]   have a need for an $800 camcorder.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:29.440]   However, for $275 camcorder, especially one that's small enough that I'm actually liable
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:33.720]   to take it with me to San Francisco and on these cruises and on these places where,
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:37.400]   again, I'm not liable to really think that I would want to do that, but it's nice to
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.840]   have a decent camcorder with you.
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:43.920]   This definitely would be more useful to me personally than that HD camcorder.
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:44.920]   Cool.
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:45.920]   Cool, cool, cool.
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:46.920]   Model number again is...
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:48.560]   SD isn't David.
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:51.360]   R as in Reginald, S10.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.360]   S-D-R, S10.
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:55.360]   And that is it.
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:59.520]   Now, we didn't do the wines this week because I wanted to give you a chance to prepare for
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:02.160]   wines, but next week maybe we'll get some Mac wines back.
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:03.800]   We haven't wine in a while.
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:04.800]   I got my own.
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.320]   Wait until leopard gets real cool.
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.800]   I'm planning a wine event.
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:08.800]   I have a few quarter.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:09.800]   I will.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:15.160]   We could invite Gruber and Mac-a-lope together and they could just wine about us.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.160]   That would be good.
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:17.160]   Good luck with Waffles.
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.400]   Maybe we'll do that.
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:19.560]   Merlin, come back soon.
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:22.920]   I know this is probably your last Mac break weekly for a little while.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:23.920]   I'll be back.
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:24.920]   Don't worry about that.
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:25.920]   If you'll have me back, I will be back.
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:26.920]   Well, I'll have you back.
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:28.560]   Dude, it's your show.
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.840]   So we'll look for you soon.
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:30.840]   Good luck.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:33.840]   And we'll let everybody know when the blessed event happens.
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:34.840]   Oh, thank you.
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:35.840]   Yeah, born again.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:39.200]   Merlin Mann is of course at 43folders.com.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.920]   By the way, loving the redesign.
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:45.160]   In fact, I want to contact your designers because I think they're very good.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:51.480]   You know, the actual design, the design, visual guy is pretty busy with other stuff.
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:55.080]   But I think he's crazy not to talk to people.
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:22:00.240]   But I also really want to recommend the guy who did the Drupal theme from the actual.
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:02.960]   I think actually he's did you an email intro with him.
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.320]   It's his group called Drupal Theme.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:10.080]   That's just, I mean, like turning that into hopefully having it not look too much like
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:11.880]   a Drupal site was gorgeous.
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:12.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:13.880]   But thank you.
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:14.880]   I appreciate that.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:15.880]   And very practical, very useful.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:16.880]   I really like it.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:18.560]   And I should mention I'm not one to hopefully I'm not one to pimp stuff too much.
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:19.560]   I finally updated five.
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:20.560]   I see that.
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.080]   I put a few new fives up.
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.280]   So there's, you know, you can see the rejected.
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:26.280]   Spice girl.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.280]   Spice girl.
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:29.080]   Emotionally unavailable spice.
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.080]   That's number five.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.080]   It's number five.
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:34.080]   I V E S dot com.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.040]   I'm glad to see that fives is back.
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:40.160]   Also hoping that some congressmen and representatives will start a law firm so that someday there
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:43.280]   will be letterhead that says Dingell Boehner Sanchez, Frank and Craig.
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:47.320]   That's so it's fun to say Dingell Boehner Sanchez, Frank and Craig.
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:50.760]   There are five senators or representatives whom I wish would become partners in a law
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:52.520]   firm just for the letterhead.
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.880]   That by the way is one of the five.
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:55.880]   Merlin, thank you.
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:58.960]   43 folders.com and five IVES dot com.
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:00.360]   Chris Breen is Mr.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:03.480]   Mac 911 at Mac.
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:04.480]   World magazine.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.120]   I keep wanting to say Mac week.
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:09.480]   Yeah, that was that was a long time ago.
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:10.480]   The good old.
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:12.680]   Ah, those good old guys.
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:14.800]   And any and any books you want to plug?
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:15.800]   You have so many.
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:16.800]   I don't know what you start.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.240]   Well, the iPhone pocket guy just came out.
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:24.560]   I'm working on the iPod and iTunes pocket guy that should be out next month, I think,
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.280]   update for the new iPods.
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:27.280]   And that's enough.
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:30.640]   I gave up writing books when I saw Chris Breen's books at the airport bookstore.
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:31.960]   I thought that's it.
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:32.960]   It's.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:33.960]   I can't compare.
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:37.240]   Except they don't put them in your pocket because they burst into flames.
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:42.360]   No, actually the glossy paper provides an excellent barrier to flaming manos.
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.360]   Talk to the police.
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:46.160]   Please know Chris Breen's books may cause you to have puffy hair.
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:49.120]   He is the Buffont of knowledge.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:51.680]   Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Lindsey from pixel core.com.
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:53.240]   Thank you for being here, Alex.
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:54.240]   We're working on.
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:57.960]   Can I mention that we're working on something for Mac world Expo?
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:59.520]   Yes, it's going to be.
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:02.640]   We're still knocking out some of the details, but it could be pretty big.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.080]   We're pretty excited about that.
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:07.400]   And if you have occasion to go to Mac world export, if you're thinking about going to
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:09.680]   Mac world Expo, do because it's going to be.
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:12.800]   You're going to want to play on a lot of fun.
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:15.600]   And you can meet the guy in the hat because you'll be there, right?
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:16.840]   Annie and I go.
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.080]   I will be all over the place.
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:21.520]   As my fat type, I've got a brand new game show that we're debuting.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:27.360]   Well, that took me about 20 seconds to come up with and 10 seconds to pitch and five seconds
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.440]   to accept.
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:31.160]   And now it's going to take me about two months to actually write it.
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:32.160]   Good.
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:33.160]   That's fine.
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:34.160]   That'll be fun.
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:35.160]   That'll be a Mac world.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.160]   That'll be great.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.160]   Can't wait to see that.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.160]   That will be a matter of.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.160]   And you can still catch him, of course, in the Chicago Sun times and his website is C.W.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.160]   Oh, W.W.W.W.
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:45.280]   dot C.W.O.B dot com.
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.600]   The colossal waste of bandwidth.
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:50.840]   My new website still continues to slouch towards Jerusalem to be born.
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:52.440]   I did decide on a name for it.
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:53.440]   That was the biggest product.
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.440]   The biggest product of the bar.
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.440]   The rough beast dot com.
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:56.440]   The rough beast dot com.
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:57.440]   What?
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:59.720]   I had a new name for it.
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:03.560]   Andy Naut goes celestial house of binary.
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:08.080]   Which just seemed like exactly the right sort of combination of pretentiousness and
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.080]   everything else.
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:14.800]   But then someone on the demo blog that it's on the left and I'm working on it.
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:16.280]   I have not hidden it from anybody.
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:19.480]   If you can figure out what the URL is, you're welcome to read it as long as you realize
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:23.800]   that the bookmarks might not work and the RSS feed may not be stable for the next couple
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:24.800]   months.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:27.400]   And someone pointed out to me, oh, well, you know that you're only one letter.
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:32.720]   You're off from retaining C.W.O.B. if you can find a W instead of the house.
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:35.120]   And so I downloaded a Scrabble dictionary like last night.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:41.400]   I was looking through all the W's by the time that I got to a myory religious word for spirituality.
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:45.800]   I think, yes, the celestial Wabai.
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:49.640]   I realized that, well, what if I just made it the celestial waste of bandwidth instead?
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:53.320]   Yeah, that was easy.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:56.960]   Instead of colossal is celestial, but it's still heavenly.
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:57.960]   Still Andy.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:58.960]   It will be a waste of bandwidth.
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:25:59.960]   I promise.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:00.960]   I promise this.
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:03.320]   See, again, I don't keep changing the feature set with updates.
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:07.160]   I will consider those of you who are relying on a product that has absolutely nothing that
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:10.400]   will benefit your life or personal personal goals.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:11.840]   I will deliver that.
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.840]   Dear in Europe since 1992.
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.240]   Don't you dare try to unlock it.
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:16.880]   God bless you, Andy and I go.
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:22.840]   Oh, Merlin, by the way, before before you do go, when you get a when your wife get a big,
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:26.640]   big bouquet in the hospital that doesn't have a name card on it, that one looks for me.
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.640]   Oh, my God.
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:28.640]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:29.640]   That is so nice.
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:30.640]   I appreciate it.
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:31.640]   Well, I didn't see it.
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:32.640]   It wasn't about me.
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:33.640]   I want to just enjoy the display.
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:35.320]   I was not I was not I don't know what to say.
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.760]   I wasn't expecting that at all.
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:37.760]   Thank you.
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:38.760]   Thank you so much.
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:40.960]   And it's actually there's a lot of things I've been getting that didn't have cards.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:42.960]   Are those all all from you?
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:43.960]   Only the good ones.
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:44.960]   They're really expensive ones.
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:45.960]   The tap the cheap tap.
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.520]   Oh, that's not for me.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:49.720]   I promised myself I wasn't going to cry.
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:51.200]   Little naughty dog.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:53.200]   So that's the piece with I don't know.
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.200]   That's not my.
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.120]   And other back break is broke.
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:07.120]   [MUSIC]
