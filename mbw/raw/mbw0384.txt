[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, our CES edition.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.200]   No, I know.
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.760]   There's not much from CES to talk about involving Mac and Tasha's or iOS.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.760]   Or is there?
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.440]   Serenity called well and Adam Christensen will join us.

[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.160]   This time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers the Macintosh world in obsessive detail,
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.160]   joining us.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.240]   Nobody from the regular Mac Break Weekly team, they're all tied up with CES and Vegas.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.000]   But fortunately, we've got great people anyway from Mac World Magazine.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.280]   Serenity Caldwell, she's an associate editor there, has joined us before.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.280]   Hi, Serenity.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.280]   Great to see you.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.280]   Hi, Leo.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.280]   Thanks for having me on again.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.280]   You got out of CES.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.280]   I did, somehow.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.280]   I'm very grateful.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.280]   Snells down there.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.280]   Snells down there.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.400]   Maybe because you're on the East Coast.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   It's possible.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.040]   Yeah, although we did send one, we sent Caitlin McGarry, I think, out to Vegas.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.640]   But she's from Vegas, so she's probably biting at the chance to let me go visit people.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.640]   Well, you know, we were, let me introduce to Adam, and I'll talk a little bit more about
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.640]   this.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.000]   But Adam Christensen is also here from MacCast.com.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Great to see you.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Nice to have you back.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   It's for you again, too.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Yay!
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.800]   We, of course, I was there yesterday just for the new media Expo and then got out of there
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.480]   before the big crush from CES.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.480]   We do have people down there.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.200]   But the snow back east was really killing the transportation.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.160]   We had lots of problems with people trying to get there.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.720]   I think one of our editors, Caitlin McGarry, she was delayed three or four days.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.320]   And finally, I think, managed to get out there Sunday night or Monday morning.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.600]   I can't remember if she...
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   Holy cow.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   Yeah, it was pretty ridiculous.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.960]   Between the snow and then the very, very cold temperatures.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.960]   Not so much fun on the east coast.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.080]   You both are probably snowed in right now, though, right?
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.320]   Actually no.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.520]   All the snow disappeared because yesterday it was 50 degrees and morning instead of the
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.520]   day.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.680]   So our, you know, foot and a half of snow all went down.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.000]   And Donald Trump thinks there's no global warming.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I ask you.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.200]   This weather's been weird, yeah.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.920]   It's been up and down.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.800]   You're in, we're in New Hampshire?
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.640]   No, I'm in San Diego.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.720]   So it's not snowing in San Diego, right?
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.280]   I didn't say I work with Jim Cameron from the Mac, from the Mac Observer.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.080]   And he actually got holed up in Denver.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.800]   So I know he was still stuck there trying to get to CES.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.920]   I don't know if he got out this morning or not, but travel's been weird.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.120]   It's kind of a mixed blessing.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.040]   Not to be able to make it to CES.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.040]   Do you guys...
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.120]   I don't know what's better.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.960]   So the three of us, the reason we're here, Renee Richie and Imore, along with Callie Lewis
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.600]   and Geekbeat, they have what we used to do, which is the Old South Hall, big booth there
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.200]   and the wall-to-wall coverage of CES.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.400]   We decided a couple of years ago to stop doing that.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   We didn't do it last year.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.400]   We're not doing it this year.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.960]   Partly because it's very expensive, but mostly because I feel like CES is more than well-covered
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.640]   by everybody else.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.760]   And frankly, it's easier to see what's going on at CES from a distance.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.000]   They're CES live.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.240]   I know the Verge is doing live coverage.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.240]   That's CES.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.240]   Yes.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.240]   This is from Imore.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.240]   This is Imore.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.240]   This is the CES live.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.240]   This is Imore stuff.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.440]   I just feel like everybody's doing a great job.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.440]   We've got...
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.400]   Actually, I'm really proud of what we've decided to do, which is to pick, say, the top 20 or
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.080]   30 products, really narrow and hone in on those and just kind of let the rest go by.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.280]   Although Robert Ballisare has really been giving us just kind of a dump of all sorts
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.600]   of stuff.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.040]   And it's fun because if it's 30 seconds per item, it's boom, boom, boom.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.040]   And it's more like...
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.040]   I don't know.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.520]   It's an industry side show.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.480]   I don't know how much of this stuff will ever make in the market.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.240]   I don't know how much it was even worth worrying about.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.320]   It's just crazy.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.720]   And there's no Mac news there, really, is there?
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.720]   Not really.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.320]   I went once.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.680]   I've been thankful to only have gone once.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.280]   And I enjoy the side show part of it because it does kind of feel like walking through
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.400]   the hall of tomorrow and to see all of these crazy products that may or may not ever make
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.400]   it in the back.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.400]   The hall of never.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.400]   Exactly.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.400]   The hall of alternate reality, alternate futures.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:54.480]   But the coolest thing that I saw at CES two years ago was a stylus in Mac news.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.200]   And granted, it was a very cool stylus.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   And I like styluses.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   But...
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.840]   Really great stuff.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.840]   So let me just show you.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.520]   This is to me the only reason I'm sorry I wasn't at CES.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.440]   Samsung's big event, they brought director Michael Bay.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.640]   This is actually a little bit painful to watch.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.520]   To show off the 105 inch Samsung TV, curved TV.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.440]   How is everyone today?
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.440]   My job.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.440]   Okay.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.080]   So Michael Bay has since posted what happened here.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.880]   He skipped over the introduction.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.800]   And the prompter operator, this is all heavily rehearsed, right?
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.640]   And Michael Bay, who's a director, he's not a performer, got nervous and skipped part
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.760]   of the whole chunk.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.920]   And the prompter operator, I've seen this happen, goes ha ha ha and scrolls ahead.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.360]   As a director, I get to dream for a living.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.800]   Michael, you know, you're no unbelievable action.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.800]   What inspires you?
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.880]   How do you come up with these ugly ideas?
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.760]   This heavily scripted thing, the script is gone.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.760]   Right.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.680]   And Michael Bay, who's not a performer, well, watch.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.120]   Great visual worlds that are so beyond everyone's normal life experiences.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:19.760]   And Hollywood is a place that creates a viewer escape.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:28.920]   And what I try to do is, as a director, I try to, the type is all off, sorry, but I'll
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.920]   just wing this.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.320]   Tell us what you think.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.400]   We'll wing it right now.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.760]   I try to take people on on the most of this ride.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:47.120]   Samsung, once again, setting the bar for crappy presentations.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.800]   How have you experienced your movies?
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.800]   Excuse me.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.800]   He just walks off.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.800]   He leaves.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.440]   Now, I'm trying to think, I'm thinking about this.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.640]   Why, first of all, does Michael Bay?
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.640]   He was a great director.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.640]   Why is he doing?
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.640]   Why is he doing this?
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.640]   And I realize what it is.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.640]   He wants.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.240]   I'm sure they said, Michael, you do this, we'll give you this 105 inch curved Samsung
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.480]   Ultra HD TV.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.800]   And Michael says, yeah, okay, I'll do it.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.480]   Does it, I mean, to a guy like that, though, I mean, he can afford how many of them, probably,
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.480]   right?
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.480]   Is that the dealer?
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.600]   Because I was reading a reading report that he just really likes the technology.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.280]   And so I was trying to get at that.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.280]   Here's his blog post.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.600]   Technology, it's like a screen.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.800]   Here's his, like a big team.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.520]   It's a silly, silly technology.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.720]   Here's his blog post.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.040]   Wow, I just embarrassed myself at CES.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:41.120]   I was about to speak for Samsung for this awesome curved 105 inch UHD TV.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.840]   I rarely lend my name to any products, but this one is just stellar.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.280]   I got so excited to talk that I skipped over the exec VP's intro line and then the teleprompter
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.320]   got lost, then the prompter went up and down and then I walked off.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.760]   I guess live shows aren't my thing.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.480]   But I'm doing a special curved screen experience with Samsung.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.760]   So there's a larger event here at Transformers 4 footage that will be traveling around the
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.760]   world.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.760]   I don't know why he did this.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.760]   I, you're right.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.320]   He must have been your, Adam, that he loved this screen.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.840]   Is it an OLED or is it an LCD?
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.160]   I don't know if they can make OLEDs at 105 inches.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.840]   I think it must be a curved LCD.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.880]   Yeah, I'm not, I'm not a huge TV guy.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.160]   I don't, I don't get all this stuff.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.240]   You know, the 3D thing went and came and went and I was happy for that.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.280]   This curved screen thing is interesting.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.520]   I mean, we, every week now we get the, you know, Apple's going to do a TV, which I don't
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.080]   buy into at all.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:41.360]   So here's a, here's my favorite comment on the Verge blog from, I rule the world.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.800]   Tim Cook laughing hysterically.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:54.280]   If Apple must feel good when they see Samsung attempt to, to do Apple quality presentations
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.840]   and just continually crash and burn.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.360]   I don't even think they care.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.360]   Do they?
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.360]   They get the attention.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.360]   Really?
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.360]   I just Apple pay attention to what Samsung is doing.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.360]   No.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.880]   I, I never picked Apple to be that kind of company.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.880]   I think it's the other way around.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.680]   I think Samsung pays a lot of attention to what Apple does and tries to emulate what they
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.400]   do in these presentations and obviously comes up really short.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.520]   But you know, the other way around it, I just don't think it happens.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.240]   Yeah, you probably have some PR intern at Apple laughing.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.240]   They don't even.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.960]   The higher ups in the company, they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.760]   Was, was Samsung doing something this week?
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.720]   Is probably more what Tim Cook is saying.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.960]   In the past, Apple has always, has, I mean, Apple hasn't been at CES and I can't even
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.960]   remember when more than a decade, right?
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.920]   Well, it always overlapped with Expo.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.400]   Right.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:50.200]   And yet I can remember many CES that the whole, everything was happening at CES was overshadowed
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.440]   by Apple with the iPhone announcement, the iPad announcement.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.040]   It's all anybody was talking about.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:05.760]   And I see, as Apple has often had a, a kind of a secret presence at CES.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.360]   It's always looming.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.360]   It's looming.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.360]   Overseas.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.080]   It's still, and what's weird is it still is.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.720]   I mean, you mentioned they've been out for so long, but I'm reading through my tech feeds
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.480]   and it's not just the Apple focused ones, but even a lot of the other ones where we're
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.440]   seeing wearables and we're seeing television stuff come out of CES.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.440]   Absolutely.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.640]   Everybody's trying to do an eye watch before Apple kills the market.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.040]   The line is after it is always, well, you know, let's see what Apple does.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.480]   It's like, these poor guys can't win.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.760]   I know I was talking with someone about the new Pebble offering and we were all saying,
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.280]   well, it's okay.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.440]   It looks a little cheap, but if we're going to spend $250 on something, it's going to
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.280]   wait and see whatever Apple does in the space, not, you know, Pebble's a great company, but
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.680]   it's just not not something that you're willing to throw that much money at.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.000]   Everybody seems to give Pebble a free pass for reasons.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   I'm not sure.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.080]   Maybe because Miriam's wars because representing them and everybody loves Miriam, but so they're
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:15.600]   new, $250, Pebble is steel and it's got Gorilla Glass and they have an all new Pebble App Store
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.800]   for new watch functions coming later this month.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:25.800]   I find if this is all a watch can be, it's not compelling.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.800]   I'm the same way.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.880]   I bought a Pebble to try and figure this whole thing out and I've used it and, you know,
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:37.360]   I like it on occasion, but really it's just, it's a notification system on my wrist more
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.680]   than anything else and it doesn't add a lot of functionality.
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.200]   So it just seems like none of these companies are asking, but it's the classic thing.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.240]   You know, none of these companies ask why are trying to figure this stuff out ahead of
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.560]   time other than Apple and that's why I think everybody kind of, they're trying to push
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.200]   this stuff out, but they don't know what they're doing.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.880]   Then Apple's going to bring out whatever they're going to do in the wearable space and I have
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.040]   no clue what it is.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.560]   I, you know, they're working on something, but they're not going to do it like they do
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.560]   until they figure out where the market is and what this thing's supposed to be and how
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.160]   it actually is going to enhance a consumer's experience in life.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.000]   And then when Apple does that, then everybody's going to scramble and rest to sort of copy
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   that thing.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.880]   And it just, it baffles me and I've talked about this a few times.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.560]   It just continues to baffle me that I don't think what Apple's doing is necessarily rocket
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:26.560]   science, but none of these other companies seem to have, I think it's that cultural DNA.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.000]   You know, I'm rereading, I just reread what I was and I'm rereading the Steve Jobs biography.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.240]   And it's just, it's an ingrained deep philosophy that I think if your company didn't start
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:42.240]   that way, you have a hard time replicating that.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:48.720]   >> Pebble says they're doing deals with ESPN Yelp GoPro four square Pandora and eye control.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.680]   I don't know if I want, okay.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:58.560]   >> I can see, I guess, I can sort of see the appeal of having limited functionality apps
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.160]   on your phone, but reading through their pitch for the app store, which is all one word lower
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.280]   case, which I think is funny, getting around the potential.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.440]   >> Is that how you get around the lawsuit?
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.440]   >> I guess.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:15.920]   I thought that that was overruled anyway, but besides the point, they're talking about
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.240]   primitive games.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.960]   Play snake on your black and white, LED.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:26.200]   >> Yeah, I don't want to go back to the smartphones of the 1990s with limited text display.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.480]   That's basically what it feels like right now to me is I think what Pebble's doing is neat
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.000]   and I applaud them for it, but it's just right now, it is definitely not something that fits
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   into my use case.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.920]   It's another device to charge and bring along and maybe use once or twice.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.800]   >> I already had a Pac-Man watch in '85.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:44.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.040]   >> I, you know, in what's interesting, I'm watching the chat room and there are a number
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:51.400]   of people in terms of, "No, Pebble's great, I love Pebble."
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.520]   I really try to understand what it is that makes people love the Pebble so much.
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.920]   I was a Kickstarter supporter and I got an early Pebble and I just award for a while.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.760]   Yeah, it's got good battery life.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.760]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.280]   >> That's not something that makes me want something.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.960]   >> It's not life-changing.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:15.880]   It doesn't change what I do or impact sort of my daily life in any really significant
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.880]   way.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.000]   It's got some niceties.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.720]   I'm not not to dog on the Pebble.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:24.000]   I mean, as far as any other smartwatch out there, I guess it's kind of, probably the
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.040]   reason most people like it is it seems to be the one that one has the most traction and
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.960]   kind of is the most useful, at least from what I can tell.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.440]   I haven't tried the gear so maybe I don't have a good perspective on it.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.160]   But again, it's just, it's notifications on my wrist.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.320]   So it avoids me having to take my phone out of my pocket once in a while.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.520]   But beyond that, it doesn't add a lot of daily utility.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:51.240]   So, as usual, everybody's saying, well, let's see what Mappled us.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.040]   This is there doing the market research.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.760]   Samsung races ahead against rumors of an Apple iPad Pro.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.320]   >> Let's see.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.920]   >> Again, it's rumors.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:08.080]   The iPad Pro would be a 12-inch iPad with a, perhaps with a keyboard.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.840]   So Samsung does a 12-inch Galaxy Note.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:19.720]   >> A 12-point, and I don't, maybe it's the Apple Insider who's saying that Samsung's
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.960]   responding to a rumor of an iPad Pro.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:27.560]   But I think a lot of companies are saying, hmm, maybe a bigger iPad is in the offering.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.560]   >> That's what everybody's doing.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:34.120]   I mean, that's kind of what prompted the larger phones, smaller phones, larger tablets, tablets.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.960]   Just trying to fit into any niche that they can control or take over before Apple has a
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.840]   chance to enter the marketplace or to try and preempt.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.480]   It unfortunately doesn't work so well.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:50.320]   Also, if Apple decides to do a 12-inch tablet, I think it's going to be a very different
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.600]   tablet than what any of the other manufacturers are thinking.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.600]   >> Not just a blown up air.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.600]   >> I just make it big, yeah.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.360]   >> Right here with the touch.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.840]   >> I was actually, yeah.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:05.880]   I was talking to my friend, my friend, Rich Stevens, who does an online comic called Diesel
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.000]   Sweeties.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.600]   And he and I were speculating over, you know, what could this possibly, this 12-inch Pro?
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.040]   And he had a really interesting idea where he's like, maybe the Pro part is not that it's
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:21.280]   a fancier iPad or a bigger iPad, but that it interacts with your desktop in some way,
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.360]   like, say, a whack-um-sintique only without, you know, not necessarily with a precious
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:31.160]   vestiby, but turning it into a giant interactive touchscreen device that works.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.600]   You know, I was like, that's a really cool idea, right?
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.760]   >> Maybe that's- >> Because he draws comics that also
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.000]   might make sense for anybody who's an artist.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.840]   I mean, I was just trying out whack-um came out with these new sort of hybrids-sintiques
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:55.720]   that work, you know, as a desktop, just as a second screen, basically, you can draw on.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.960]   But in addition, when you disconnect it from the computer, it works as an Android tablet
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.760]   or a Windows 8 laptop tablet.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.700]   And I tested out the Android one and I found it, you know, it's a little clunky and it
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.180]   doesn't quite work the way I would want it to.
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.340]   But I could see something like that in the Apple space.
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:19.140]   Like I'd be really excited to see what Apple could do, especially with the integration that
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.900]   they already have between their devices.
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:27.540]   >> One analyst, Patrick Wang, in his predictions for 2014 at Evercore Partners, said that an
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:32.940]   app, he thought there would be a 12-inch hybrid iPad Pro, and it would be part of a
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.740]   renewed focus on the enterprise market.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.420]   But it's a business product.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:44.500]   >> Yeah, that I'm a little less wowed by.
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.500]   >> To compete or respond to the surface, I guess, I don't know.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.380]   >> The surface has been doing very well on the enterprise market.
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.700]   >> So A, we've already established.
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.380]   Apple doesn't give a damn when anybody else is doing.
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.820]   And B, is Apple the kind of company that does things like Samsung does?
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.380]   It's tri-all different sizes.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.420]   Doesn't seem like Apple's that kind of company.
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.420]   >> Not publicly.
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.420]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.060]   >> They do it in the lab.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.060]   >> Yeah, we do it in the lab.
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.780]   >> Yeah, we have a huge lab where we're playing around with all kinds of stuff.
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:19.380]   >> And then Johnny Ive comes in and says, this is the worst iPad we've ever made.
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.380]   No.
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.380]   >> Terrible down.
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.380]   >> Terrible.
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.380]   Get rid of it.
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:29.860]   >> Yeah, Apple doesn't seem to me to be the kind of company that would do a bigger one
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.180]   just to have more choices.
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.180]   >> No.
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.180]   >> Choice is not a word that Apple really embraces.
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:39.140]   >> You are making the choices for you.
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.140]   >> Yes.
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:44.100]   >> We have decided that these are the proper sizes and then you will use them accordingly.
[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:48.380]   >> We choose so you don't have to.
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.900]   Choices, choices is scary.
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.180]   Actually, that goes way back.
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.180]   I remember in fact it was one of the things I really loved about the very first Mac.
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:20:01.260]   If you got the Macintosh user interface guidelines, they called it monotony and they said it's
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.260]   a good thing.
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.260]   This I think goes back to Jeff Raskin who was very early on.
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:12.540]   He was eventually booted from the Mac team by Steve Jobs but really the original Mac proponent.
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:17.020]   He said there should be one and only one way to do anything because if you have two ways
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.820]   it's the human brain is going to learn a pathway.
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.940]   Give it a pathway.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.940]   Let it learn.
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.700]   If you have two ways it's too confusing.
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.620]   That's where the one button mouse comes from.
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.620]   >> It's interesting.
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.380]   >> Talk about their DNA.
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.420]   That's really in their DNA.
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:32.420]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.420]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.420]   >> All right.
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.300]   We're talking about the dearth of products at CES.
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.300]   Let's find out.
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:44.540]   There are a couple of things at CES that we're worth paying attention to for Apple users including
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.220]   a new Mophie that I think is very interesting.
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.940]   We'll talk about that in just a bit from IDG and Mac world.
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.220]   You also do a little for PC world.
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.220]   Don't you, Serenity?
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.220]   >> More for TechHive actually.
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.220]   >> Okay.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.220]   >> I love TechHive.
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.740]   >> Oh, TechHive is a lot of fun.
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.380]   I'm really glad with how that's progressing.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.380]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.380]   Jad was kind of Jason's baby, wasn't it?
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.380]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.380]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:10.260]   We really wanted to find some way to cover the smartphones and the whatever the wearable
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.980]   industry in a way that wasn't just we're going to post things on PC world and Mac world
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.220]   that don't quite fit into those categories.
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.220]   >> Right.
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.780]   >> So, I'm- >> In fact, a good place for a CES
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.820]   coverage because there's a lot of stuff that doesn't fit in any category at CES.
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.820]   >> Absolutely.
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.700]   We have a large amount of it going on right now.
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.060]   I have the chat room going on in the background and there's editors constantly being like,
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.060]   "Oh, I'm going here.
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.060]   I'm going here.
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.540]   You should take a video crew over here."
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.180]   So much nicer stepped away.
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:44.140]   >> Also, it's great to have you, Serenity Caldwell, associate editor at Mac world magazine and
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:50.380]   also, of course, from the great Mac cast on the original Mac podcasters, Adam Christensen.
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.980]   >> You're- >> Certainly, 10th year.
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:57.660]   >> Have you been looking back at Nick and seeing your old employer?
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.660]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.660]   >> What do you think?
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.500]   >> Well, I don't know.
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.500]   It's Google.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.260]   >> Yeah, kind of acquired by Google.
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.260]   >> And they rolled it in.
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.900]   I knew exactly what they were planning with it.
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.780]   I mean, they're rolling that technology into the Google+ stuff.
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.460]   They had a huge photographer community going on on Google+.
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.700]   I don't know if it's still there.
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.020]   I've been following it that close.
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.020]   >> Oh, they do.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.020]   Absolutely.
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.020]   Photographers are- >> Yeah.
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.140]   >> And I love for that reason, mostly, Google+.
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.300]   But I'm really pleased.
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.140]   They kept the Nick collection alive.
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.620]   They reduced the price considerably.
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:28.620]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:32.980]   >> I thought that- I was worried a little that they bought it for Snapstream.
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:33.980]   The app.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:34.980]   >> Yeah, Snap Seed.
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:35.980]   >> Snap Seed.
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:36.980]   Sorry.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:37.980]   The app.
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.500]   And certainly, they're giving that away for free now, which is nice.
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.700]   They're keeping the Nick collection alive, which is really, really good.
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.260]   >> Yeah, they're great filters.
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:46.900]   I hope they continue developing them.
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.940]   That's just the question is, how long- >> Right.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:54.020]   >> How dedicated are they to that space and are they going to stick with the whole plugin
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:58.220]   thing, especially when it's going into other products.
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.220]   >> Right.
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.660]   >> Google's got a few engineers.
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:05.020]   They could probably dedicate a few people over to the next time.
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.300]   >> Yeah, I mean, that was the key is they got those engineers.
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.420]   I think they got most of those engineers from Nick and those guys were brilliant.
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.420]   >> Right.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.420]   >> Right.
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.420]   >> Right.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.660]   >> And they do seem to show a surprising interest in the photography field, especially with
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:18.660]   that.
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:23.820]   And with Google+'s sort of renewed interest in photos and, oh, you should try and upload
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.060]   all of your photos to us.
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.060]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.260]   >> We can replace Flickr, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.660]   >> I think that's Larry.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:34.020]   I think Larry actually is a photographer, you know, as a hobbyist.
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.020]   I have to think that's where it's coming from.
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:41.260]   Larry just says, you know, it was brilliant because it's nice to have one group of people
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.780]   that say, this is our place to gather.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.220]   And then that can inform the rest of it as a social network.
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.620]   And I have to say, just, you know, they did a 2013 movie of all my pictures on Google+
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.380]   and it was awesome.
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.860]   And I just, I think, and the auto awesome that they've been doing, I think they were
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.300]   actually doing really great stuff.
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:04.300]   So I know this is not the Google show, but I say all that because we're moving into a
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:08.100]   little commercial break for 99 designs.
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:09.820]   And, you know, design is everything.
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:13.100]   If you're an Apple fan, you're, you air into design.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:17.660]   And it's, I, do you have this feeling because I get this feeling.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:23.660]   I look at the great designers like Johnny Ive and I go, gosh, I wish I had a design
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.660]   sense.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.620]   I know what I like, but I wish I could do it.
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.420]   Well most of us can't.
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:34.020]   But it doesn't mean you don't have a can't have great designs in your website.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.780]   If you're a restaurant in your menu, in your app, maybe you've got a great idea for an
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:38.780]   app.
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:39.780]   Maybe you're a great programmer.
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.380]   You can write a great app, but you got to have a good look.
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:44.380]   99 designs makes it possible for you.
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:53.700]   Visit 99desing.com/mbw and you can get a little look at what 99 designs is up to.
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.020]   It's a design marketplace.
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:01.300]   So it brings together a community of now more than a quarter of a million designers,
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:06.700]   72,274 designers with people who need design.
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.700]   So you'll go on there and you'll create what they call a contest.
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:13.620]   There are currently at 1,715 open contests.
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:14.620]   Designers go to the contest.
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.620]   They look at it.
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.620]   They think, hey, that's what I could do.
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:17.820]   Give you some ideas.
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.820]   You can refine it.
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:21.660]   You could go back and forth with the designers, pick the designer you want.
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:25.020]   They get paid and you get a great design.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:32.420]   And by the way, in many cases, very affordable prices.
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:36.620]   We're talking $299 starting price for landing pages.
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:41.380]   If you're a business online and you don't have a great landing page, you're not projecting
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.620]   the image you want, but maybe you're not a designer.
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.620]   99designs.com.
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:51.420]   99designs.com for logo design, web page design, business card design.
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:52.660]   You need a business card.
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.660]   Don't do it yourself.
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.540]   It was such a big mistake.
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.100]   It was so ugly.
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:02.100]   But it's funny because we don't -- the things that designers just know, like, you know,
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.500]   how to use fonts, it's not my brain.
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.500]   I don't understand how they know that, but they do.
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.500]   T-shirt design.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.500]   We got some great designs from 99design.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.020]   Banner ad design book covers.
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.580]   Nowadays, everybody's self-publishing.
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:15.820]   It makes sense.
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:21.540]   The thing that the publisher used to bring to you were things like editors, copy editors,
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:25.340]   you know, index editors, cover design.
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.740]   We do ourselves.
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.860]   We spec it out.
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.940]   99designs.com for your design.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.700]   Illustrations for your new books.

[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.620]   Well, it doesn't guarantee.
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.220]   It usually gets you more than twice as many designs.

[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:03.740]   We thank them so much for their support and their designs.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.740]   Serenity Caldwell, Macworld.com.
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.500]   Adam Christensen, I'm getting over my cold.
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:13.460]   I'm the first person ever to go to Vegas and to get better.
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.780]   Everybody will be coming back from CES.
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:15.780]   Sick as a dog.
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.540]   Oh, that's not a place to be.
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.020]   Well, I realized that I was patient zero.
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.220]   I brought the cold to CES that everybody would be coming back with.
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.460]   You've doomed them all.
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:30.260]   I made sure to cough on everything.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.460]   No, I didn't.
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:34.020]   I didn't wear a mask, but I really tried not.
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.180]   I didn't shake hands.
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:39.380]   I fist bumped and tried not to infect people.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:45.020]   So Mophie, there are a few little Mac stories from CES.
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:48.260]   Mophie, which I really like the Mophie cases for the iPhone 5.
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:52.940]   And I frankly think that the iPhone needs a little help.
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.860]   Frankly, they've come up with a new Mophie case.
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.500]   It's a battery case that also has storage.
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:02.620]   It's a battery case with built-in storage made for iPhone 5 and 5S.
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:06.420]   I mean, if you're going to add this big honking case to your iPhone,
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:07.700]   why not get some storage?
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.740]   1632 gigs.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.460]   So this is really-- you know, one of the things I like that I don't like
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.300]   about the iPhone I like about some of the other phones I use
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:19.060]   is the idea that I can remove a battery and I can put an SD card in.
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:22.500]   Well, now you can do that with iPhone, but an external case.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.460]   It's called the Mophie Space Pack.
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:34.300]   Be available in March, $150 for the 16 gig, $180 for the 32 gig model.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.820]   Do you guys use external battery packs for your iPhones?
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:38.620]   I do, actually.
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:39.340]   I use a Mophie.
[00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.580]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:41.820]   I use Mophies for years.
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.460]   I haven't been with my 5S.
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.820]   I haven't gotten a new one.
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.620]   That was the only problem with the Mophie is every time I got a new phone,
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:49.180]   pretty good.
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:49.180]   Right.
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.340]   Take your case.
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.980]   Yeah.
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:52.620]   But I love it.
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:53.620]   I mean, I love the product.
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.620]   And I was going to ask you about the storage thing,
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.380]   because that's very intriguing to me, too.
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.180]   I mean, I have a bunch of storage products.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.500]   The key to that is going to be how they integrate it.
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.220]   And that's the struggle I've had with some of these solutions.
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.420]   And it's not necessarily the manufacturer's problem,
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.140]   the developer's problem.
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:10.740]   It's a little bit of the whole iOS sandboxing thing, right?
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.300]   But sort of getting that information on and off photos and videos,
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.260]   though, it's not too hard.
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:18.540]   So mainly about being able to shoot more photos,
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:19.980]   it's probably going to work really, really well.
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:22.700]   Yeah, how could it work, actually, trying to think?
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.020]   It must look like it's--
[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:25.980]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.780]   Yeah, just like the camera.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.460]   I'm sure it looks just like the camera adapter.
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.420]   A lot of the solutions use WebDav.
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.820]   They'll set up a little WebDav service
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.820]   so that you can actually transfer stuff back and forth
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.500]   and then have an app that sort of ties into that.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.820]   And it uses, I think, like Bonjour Zero Config
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.660]   to kind of figure out how to connect to the storage device.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.620]   I've used-- my favorite one is actually the--
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:52.860]   for storage is the little Mac cell blanking on the name.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.220]   You put an SD card in it.
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.260]   And it's a USB thing that has power.
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.700]   And it sets up a little Wi-Fi.
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.100]   So it's very similar, then?
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:00.780]   Yeah.
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.740]   But Mophie, since this is direct connected,
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.300]   I would imagine it's going to work more like Apple's camera adapter,
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.620]   USB camera adapter, I think.
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.020]   Off the lightning.
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.620]   HyperShop has had a few products like that,
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:12.620]   as well.
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:13.420]   Yeah.
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:17.300]   Yeah, I think I saw one of theirs last year at Expo at Macworld
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.620]   iWorld that worked pretty well.
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.620]   Although this is the first one that I've really seen
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.700]   as kind of an integrated--
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:26.740]   not just connecting, but actually encompassing the phone.
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.020]   And by the looks of the pictures,
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.860]   I haven't gotten a chance to see any of our hands-on pictures
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:31.540]   of it yet.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.220]   But it really doesn't look that much thicker
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:36.180]   than a name for your other cases, which is, I mean,
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.900]   splash storage, I guess, is miniscule.
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:38.900]   So it doesn't really matter.
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.580]   MicroSD card is so tiny.
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.420]   There's plenty.
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:43.020]   That's the point.
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.940]   You're putting a honking big case on your iPhone.
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.420]   Might as well throw some extra crap in there.
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:47.780]   It's a real--
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.100]   It's a bunch of microSDs.
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.420]   Yeah, you could have-- I mean, why not have 128 gigs?
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.820]   You could probably have as much as you want.
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.180]   The issue is exactly this, is how you connect it.
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:00.220]   There is a dedicated app called Space, which
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:04.140]   lets you organize local files without offloading them.
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.060]   See, that tends to be the problem for them.
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.900]   That's usually where these solutions fall down,
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.100]   is that the app isn't thought out or as well integrated
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:11.900]   as I would like.
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.060]   And what's nice about the whole web dev thing,
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.380]   if they're going to do that and have it be a little more open,
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:20.500]   you can save pages, documents through web dev,
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.900]   and you can save other things.
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.620]   Again, this is the sandboxing thing, right?
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.980]   So it's great if I can put stuff on there.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:28.540]   But if I have to use their app every single time,
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.060]   it limits the functionality.
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:32.420]   But again, if you're focusing on photos and videos,
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.820]   most of that stuff's pretty easy to do.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.020]   And that's probably what about 90% of people
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.540]   are going to want to offload anyway, right?
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.620]   You take that nice HD video and it's
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.380]   eating up all those internal storage
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.020]   so to be able to offload that quickly
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.860]   and then free up your storage is a nice thing.
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:47.220]   Well, I could see this sort of being
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.700]   a replacement to what I use GoodReader for in a way.
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.220]   And because GoodReader is kind of my general all purpose
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.100]   storage area for things that aren't photos or video that I'm
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.260]   going to need to access in other apps.
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.820]   It just is the question of, yeah,
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:03.060]   whether it hooks into web dev, whether it hooks into any kind
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:06.420]   of way that you can get online files down,
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:09.300]   or whether you can transfer your photos in your video.
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.540]   Or if they make an API available to other apps,
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:14.140]   I mean, that's another way some companies have been able to handle
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.580]   this, right, is you make an API available that works
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.140]   like a MoFI API and then all of that,
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.140]   you can put that into GoodReader and then GoodReader
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.340]   can save right into your internal storage.
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.220]   So--
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.700]   I mean, by the way, it's not MoFI's fault.
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.700]   It's just this Apple doesn't allow this stuff.
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:31.300]   This is the sandboxing problem.
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.780]   And I have to point out that SD storage on Windows Phone
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:40.020]   and Android Phone is not ever an exact peer
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.500]   with internal storage.
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.180]   There's stuff you can do and there's stuff you cannot do.
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:45.780]   And I don't know why, but there's something
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.940]   about mobile operating systems that external storage devices
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.540]   are never an equal to the internal storage devices.
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.140]   There's always a little bit of Cluji,
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.580]   although you have more access, of course, on those phones
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:59.380]   than you do on an iPhone.
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:00.900]   What else at CES do we see?
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.780]   Anything else of interest?
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.820]   By the way, people who are saying, where's your Mac Pro?
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.940]   I was hoping to have a Mac Pro delivered today.
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:12.700]   Very kindly, one of our viewers had sent me a note saying,
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.260]   I bought a Mac Pro one hour in because if you didn't buy it
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.860]   right away, you weren't going to get it till February.
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.980]   If you try now, it's not till February.
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.380]   But he said, I ordered it right away when they went on--
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.980]   he said, I was asleep.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.660]   I would have ordered it right away.
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.340]   By the time I woke up, it was February.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.780]   So then we thought, well, what should we do?
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:28.780]   Should we order one?
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:31.260]   Or should we hope we can get one in the store on December 31?
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.020]   We said, well, we'll see.
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:36.260]   And there weren't any in store either on December 31.
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.300]   So Ed, thank you.
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:41.420]   Unfortunately, he was hoping he could change the delivery
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:45.340]   to our studios.
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:49.940]   So he's going to reship it, and it'll come tomorrow.
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.420]   But who did he send says his Mac Pro is out for delivery?
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:53.620]   Yay.
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:56.940]   Those of you who were just up late, what was it?
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.180]   Like the day after Christmas or something,
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.900]   those of you who were up a little late got a chance.
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.900]   Do you either of you have a Mac Pro?
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:05.860]   It's way more than I need.
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:06.460]   I wish.
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.180]   You know, I dream.
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.180]   Yeah.
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:13.620]   I got a G5 tower, and that lasted me many years very well
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:14.900]   when I was doing film editing.
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.740]   But once I sort of changed careers,
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:19.420]   it became a little too much.
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:19.740]   That's right.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:22.220]   I forgot you were a film editor.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:22.980]   It was very briefly.
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.100]   Yeah, briefly.
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.340]   That's what the Mac Pro's for.
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:32.300]   It's for people who, especially who are working in 4K.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.820]   The feedback that I've gotten from some of my friends who
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:40.380]   are in the film industry is they're really excited.
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.620]   It's still a little ridiculous.
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.540]   And I know some people are frustrated about the lack of PCI.
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:48.900]   But in general, they're really--
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:52.540]   they're still waiting on really good 4K displays,
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.020]   because right now the compatibility issues
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:56.300]   are still kind of so-so.
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.220]   And they're really only a couple of 4K displays
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.820]   that properly work with the Pro.
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:00.820]   That's interesting.
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:01.420]   I hope they prefer like--
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:05.220]   Apple offers one, not by Apple, but by Sharp, I think, right?
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.740]   Yes, correct.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.540]   I think they're supported 4K displays are relatively limited.
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.660]   I don't know them off the top of the head.
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:13.180]   Why?
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.180]   Why?
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:15.180]   Why?
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:18.780]   We were all hoping.
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:19.980]   Yeah.
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:23.300]   And meanwhile, one of the things we saw a lot of at CES,
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:28.420]   or we'll see a lot of at CES, is giant, beautiful 4K displays
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.820]   that don't work with the Mac Pro.
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:34.340]   In fact, Lenovo had a-- what was it?
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.020]   What did they say?
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:40.300]   It was 30 inches for $800.
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:44.900]   A new era of inexpensive 4K-- inexpensive 4K monitors.
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:49.260]   ASUS Lenovo Seiki.
[00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:51.980]   But so you're saying that, surrounded there may be an issue,
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.700]   a compatibility issue.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:59.980]   ASUS is going to do a 28-inch 4K, 3840 by 2160,
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:08.940]   DisplayPort, HDMI, Seiki, a 28-inch monitor,
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.460]   even cheaper than its 39-inch.
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:13.620]   It'll be $500.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:17.660]   Lenovo has a 4K monitor, $28, $800, all of these
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.740]   ship in the spring.
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:22.060]   What was it, compatibility issues?
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.700]   I mean, in other words, you shouldn't buy this yet.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:24.780]   I believe it's refresh rate.
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.220]   I believe it's refresh rate.
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:31.020]   These displays are coming in at 30 Hertz and Apple wants 60.
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.100]   Oh, it's the main issue.
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:35.300]   But 30 is way slow.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.460]   No, no, no.
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:40.340]   Yeah, and that's because it's hard to refresh that many dots.
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.140]   Right.
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.700]   60 times a second.
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:43.980]   They just don't have the horsepower.
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.980]   Yeah.
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:46.500]   So--
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.620]   And there's something about resolution as well,
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.540]   that itty issue with building incompatible
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.340]   multiple resolutions and support for high DPI,
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.580]   which seems crazy.
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.180]   If you have a 4K monitor, you should
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:01.300]   be able to support high DPI, but not so much.
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.380]   What, they don't support high DPI?
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.940]   Yeah, it's the quality of the displays.
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:05.940]   I think those two displays are not--
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.180]   Oh, that's why they're cheap.
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.820]   Yeah.
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:11.020]   Yeah, not up to Apple's quality standards.
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:14.580]   So if you have a Mac Pro on its way,
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.420]   don't rush out and get one of these displays.
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:18.700]   You've got to make sure that it's going to be compatible
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.260]   before you do.
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:25.340]   And to date, as far as I know, Apple's only selling one.
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.340]   That's also-- it's like $3,000 as much as the--
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:29.420]   I'm not going to check now.
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:29.940]   Exactly.
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.820]   Yes, it's as much as the Mac Pro.
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.900]   Something ridiculous.
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.580]   I think all of us are just collectively crossing our fingers
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:39.420]   and hoping that Apple will decide to figure out
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:43.140]   some way to make their own display that's relatively
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:48.820]   priced, maybe not $800, but at least potentially a good
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:49.860]   thing that-- Somewhere in the middle.
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:53.580]   I think this explains, frankly, why Apple's not doing this,
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:59.820]   is it's hard to find displays that are compatible-- $3,595.
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.140]   Now, it's 32 inches, so it's nice and big.
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.540]   As an editor writes, serenity, you would have loved this.
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:09.220]   But see, editors always have at least two displays.
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.300]   Yep.
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:17.420]   We had a 24 of one of the old Apple displays,
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.820]   and then a 32.
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:23.300]   And then we hooked up a television as well,
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.300]   whenever we wanted to see it looking.
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.220]   Yeah, because you have to look on a TV
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.300]   to see what it's going to look like.
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.180]   Proper color, balance, and everything else.
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.740]   Well, you can have 632s.
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:36.900]   I mean, what will that cost you?
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.140]   Plus the Mac Pro.
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:38.900]   Well, that's one thing.
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.500]   Editors are unusual because normally most of us
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:45.460]   would like identical screens, like two identical screens.
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.060]   Editors often have different sizes.
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:48.460]   Different ones, yeah.
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:51.060]   And the TV, of course, is this little tiny one
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.980]   compared to the rest of them.
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:57.540]   Wow, $3,500, plus the minimum cost on a Mac Pro is $3,000.
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:58.460]   You're talking $65,000.
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:03.140]   But see, $6,500 for a Pro is probably not out of reach.
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:03.660]   Yeah.
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:05.540]   I keep pulling out of my back pocket the fact
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:10.380]   that the Mac 2FX was $11,000 when it was launched.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.780]   That's why it stood for two freaking expensive.
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:14.540]   Something like that.
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:15.460]   I mean, that was a great machine.
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.860]   It had tons of slots in everybody's really excited about.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.940]   But I mean, you take the test of time.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:23.060]   I mean, in today's dollars, what would that machine cost?
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.100]   Right.
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.900]   But there was a market for it.
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:26.900]   Right, yeah.
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.380]   And there's a market for the Mac Pro, too.
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:28.900]   I mean--
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.780]   Paralleys, you can't get one to February.
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:31.500]   What does that mean?
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.340]   Does that mean that they made five of them?
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.820]   Or does that mean--
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.620]   I mean, I presume that they've got a factory that
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:40.260]   can crank them out at some decent rate, even a 100 a day
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.780]   or something, right?
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:42.380]   They must have sold--
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:46.500]   We saw their very beautiful assembly line process.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.140]   Yeah.
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:50.140]   All the robots going, eh, eh, eh.
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:54.300]   So I mean, they must be able to do, let's say, a thousand a day.
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.220]   And if they're saying it's 60 days before you can get one,
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.460]   that must mean they've sold $60,000 at least, right?
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:01.460]   Well, is it the chips?
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:05.620]   I mean, those Intel chips are pretty--
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:07.220]   Are they insured commodity, too?
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:07.860]   Yeah.
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.740]   God, you'd hate to see all those robots just sitting
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.220]   around smoking, waiting for a chip.
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.180]   Well, I don't know.
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:16.740]   But I mean, they are using a chip that I don't think is generally
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.860]   available, although OWC, I think,
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.940]   figured out that they upgraded one already.
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:22.620]   Already?
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.120]   Yes.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.180]   See, that was the question.
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.620]   We saw right away that they're socketed,
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.900]   although all the Z-ons in that class are socketed.
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:31.740]   They're not surface-mounted.
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.420]   So that's not unusual.
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:36.220]   But my question was, could you just take it out
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:36.860]   and put another one in?
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:39.260]   So other world computing has figured out that you can.
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:40.060]   They did it, yeah.
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.460]   It's in their interest, because, of course,
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.740]   who are you going to buy them from?
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.340]   The world's computing, right?
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:46.980]   Macsales.com, I like to give them a plug,
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:49.820]   even though they're not an advertiser, because I really love--
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:52.900]   I buy all their SSDs and stuff.
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:53.260]   Look at this.
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:54.020]   So beautiful.
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:55.780]   We're just watching the video.
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.220]   Since you can't have a Mac Pro, at least you
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.060]   can watch it being made.
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:03.300]   Was it one of all these guys in buddy suits just sitting around?
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:03.740]   I don't know.
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:04.620]   I was just eluding.
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:06.060]   I mean, is it a--
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:06.700]   I'm like you.
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.460]   I don't know what the holdup is.
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:11.460]   It's a new facility, and they're still kind of ramping up
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.740]   their production rates, or is it a component issue?
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.180]   I don't think we've really heard.
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:19.980]   Or I haven't seen any reports on exactly why they can't
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:20.780]   keep up with demand.
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.020]   But Apple can never seem to keep up with demand.
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:23.900]   I know.
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:24.700]   It's true.
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.460]   It's a good problem to have, I guess.
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:29.580]   I'm sure we'll hear Peter or Tim talk about it at some point
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.620]   in the financial call that's coming up in the next couple
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.460]   of weeks.
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:34.940]   Yeah.
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:38.220]   They'll say-- what will they say, though?
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:41.620]   Knowing them, we are at Channel Inventory.
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:45.380]   So Craig--
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:46.540]   Stop in the channel.
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:50.940]   Craig Molaney ordered his at 301 in the morning.
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.260]   And he's got his--
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:53.020]   he said it's coming today.
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.660]   Craig, will you call us?
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:55.580]   Will you Skype us?
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:42:00.140]   And just hold it up and let us look at it and adore it.
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:00.940]   Touch it.
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:03.300]   If I get mine tomorrow, and I'm supposedly going to--
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:06.140]   we'll do an unboxing and play with it and everything.
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.300]   I mean, it really does look gorgeous.
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:09.980]   In fact, watching that video, I could watch that video of them
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.860]   making that over and over again.
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.020]   It's really beautiful.
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:16.980]   I know Dan Frakes, he got a review model from Apple.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:19.220]   And the first day when he got it,
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:22.100]   he was just putting it in random places on his desk
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.980]   and putting random objects next to it.
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.180]   And he was like, this is so delightful.
[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.540]   He did the best-- it was the best review of it
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:32.220]   because he showed it in situ in the way it--
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:36.700]   or in vivo, whatever the way it is in real life.
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.060]   Thank you, Dan, for doing that.
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.980]   Because it's really tiny.
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:40.820]   It is.
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:41.700]   It is.
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.900]   We did very jokingly, he said, to our reviews editor.
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.500]   He's like, you know, I was kind of thinking maybe I'll
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.700]   do a silly slideshow about things that
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.660]   are bigger than the Mac Pro.
[00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:54.060]   And that slideshow just blew up.
[00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:57.100]   Where it's just like, here's a banana next to the Mac Pro.
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.460]   It was great.
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:04.860]   It was literally my favorite Mac Pro review anywhere.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:05.300]   Just like--
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.140]   You'll be happy to hear that.
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.220]   Yeah, thank Dan for that because it was really great.
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:10.460]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.540]   We can show it too.
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:18.460]   As we continue to-- 12 things that show how small the Mac Pro
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.380]   really is.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:23.220]   So there's the Mac Pro next to a crystal geyser
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.020]   bottle of water.
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.220]   It's smaller than a basketball.
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:32.420]   That's kind of telling when you put it next to an iPad.
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:33.460]   Yeah.
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:37.780]   It's not really much bigger than an iPad on its side.
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:40.540]   Or a hiking boot.
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:42.140]   I have those audio engine speakers,
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:45.940]   so that actually gives me a pretty good idea of how this
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:46.300]   is garbage.
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:48.460]   Not actually a trash can.
[00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:51.340]   It isn't because that's a trash can in the left, you could tell.
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:52.340]   Yeah.
[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:53.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.620]   I like the bread.
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:56.820]   It just whimsical.
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.020]   Here's a half-eaten loaf of bread.
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:01.060]   And if you take a slice and put it above it,
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:02.740]   you could probably toast it quite nicely.
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.220]   Yes.
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:05.980]   Well, yeah, but it's very quiet, right?
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:07.820]   Jason said it was really quiet.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:08.820]   It's very quiet.
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:09.380]   Yeah.
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:11.820]   Freakishly quiet.
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:12.980]   Next to a curring.
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.860]   Next to a doll.
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.460]   Does that Dan's American Girl doll?
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:18.820]   I think it is.
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:19.500]   He's a big fan.
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:20.420]   He has a collection.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:21.780]   He collects them.
[00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:24.260]   And the banana-- the banana was user requested.
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.660]   That's the thing that really amuses me.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:27.940]   Someone took the time.
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:30.180]   Multiple people took the time to ask for it
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.100]   to be next to a banana.
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.860]   How big is it compared to a banana?
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.540]   Well, it's about the same height as a banana,
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:38.300]   believe it or not, unless it's a freakishly large banana.
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:39.500]   That is a good question.
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:40.580]   He does live in California.
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:41.900]   They do have giant bananas.
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:42.300]   It's an--
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.740]   Yeah, it looks like a standard chiquita.
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.780]   That's the one that really says something.
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.820]   There it is next to the Cheesegrader Mac Pro,
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:50.180]   the last generation Mac Pro.
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:53.820]   I think you could fit probably like six inside a Mac Pro case.
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.740]   I'm looking forward to some of the turning on Mac Pro.
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:56.740]   Especially to put them on their side.
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:58.140]   Yeah, and into a rack, put them on their side.
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:03.820]   I know it's expensive, but I'm really glad I'm getting one.
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:07.020]   And I'm writing it off because I'm doing it for the show.
[00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:08.260]   It's got-- we got to show it.
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:09.540]   So we'll do it-- I think we're going
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:11.380]   to end up doing an unboxing on Windows Weekly,
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:13.260]   which will be very painful.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:14.020]   That's interesting.
[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:16.020]   [SIGH]
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:21.140]   You can apparently use it on its side.
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.700]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:26.060]   Apple says, wouldn't it roll away?
[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:28.820]   You got to have-- I'm imagining someone's going to do--
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:30.900]   it's probably going to be the Mac Mini Colo guys,
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.900]   but someone's going to do a rack system where it looks just
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:34.940]   like wine barrels.
[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:36.580]   Like, you know, why can't you a wine cellar
[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:38.180]   and you just got chiqued.
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:39.100]   You know, where I'm thinking--
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:40.100]   That makes sense.
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.740]   Another cool accessory would be sort
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:45.180]   of a hanging bandolier style rack.
[00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:46.780]   You know, I have in my office--
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:49.940]   I have a wine cellar closet.
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:54.100]   And actually, very conveniently, right at the--
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:57.260]   in the door there is all the magnums, the big slots.
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:58.900]   I bet it would fit in a magnum.
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:45:59.860]   Yep.
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:00.500]   So I could--
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.500]   You're going to be surprised.
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.740]   I could put a dozen Mac pros right there.
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:06.940]   Talk about conspicuous consumption.
[00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:09.180]   So Apple says, make sure you provide enough space
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:11.300]   at each end for air flow.
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:14.980]   Because the fan is at the top, but it draws from the bottom,
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:15.500]   right?
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:16.500]   It's like a jet engine, right?
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.180]   Yeah.
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:19.100]   Yeah, it is, isn't it?
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:23.860]   When using multiple Mac Pro computers in your dreams,
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.700]   do not direct the exhaust at the top of one Mac Pro
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.660]   towards the intake of another one.
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:30.460]   Then you're happy, Dad.
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:32.100]   Yeah, you're just compounding the heat issue.
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:34.460]   No.
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:36.820]   Placing computers side by side with a gap of several inches
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:37.940]   between them.
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.980]   Oh, so there is some heat on the sides as well.
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:42.940]   When on its side, make sure it doesn't roll.
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:44.380]   This is Apple's tech note.
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:46.260]   Yeah, it says-- make sure it does it roll.
[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:48.860]   Place the case-- it says make sure it doesn't roll.
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:50.700]   Place the computer in a protective service that will not
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.620]   scratch or damage the enclosure.
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:54.460]   And by the way, the Apple limited warranty
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:58.060]   does not cover cosmetic damage to the enclosure.
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:58.500]   And then--
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.300]   It's going to roll it down some stairs.
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:02.740]   So look at this.
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:03.300]   Who is this?
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.500]   It's going to offer Mac Pro colos.
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:06.220]   And there it is.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.860]   There's the wine rack.
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.140]   Pretty much.
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:11.940]   Holy komoly.
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:14.940]   Mac Stadium.
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:17.460]   The writing of that reminds me a little bit of that one,
[00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:20.540]   six services support updates.
[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:22.180]   As if it were just swarm of bees,
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:25.300]   you could stay away from the sink services folder.
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.500]   Has that kind of feeling?
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:28.780]   Do not put the Mac Pro in a wine cellar.
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:31.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:33.380]   Now Mac Stadium, I have to point out,
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:38.220]   posted that article June 17.
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.420]   Like the day after the Mac Pro was announced.
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:41.620]   So they don't know, really.
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.620]   But Mac says, we'll be here soon.
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:45.500]   Well, maybe not.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:46.620]   That's how you'd have to do it.
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.460]   I mean, I would imagine that's exactly what it's going
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:50.380]   to look like in a server room.
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:52.660]   I mean, that's a really efficient use of storage.
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.660]   You can cram a lot of those in a really small space.
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.180]   Well, because they're so small, I mean, admittedly,
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.940]   the cylinder is not the ideal for packing.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:02.500]   But that's fine, because they're so small, it doesn't matter.
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:11.180]   They said they can get 240 Mac minis per 8 square feet.
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:16.220]   So-- and they're already doing it with Mac minis.
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:19.140]   So with Mac Pros--
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:26.060]   I'm trying to find if they have 1,200 Mac minis at Mac Stadium.
[00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:28.940]   So I don't know what the density will be,
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:30.620]   but I guess it will be as dense.
[00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:32.340]   Not as good as Mac minis, but I mean,
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:34.740]   you've got a lot more server power in a pro.
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:39.140]   That's-- they say with the Mac minis,
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:40.860]   it's 1/6 of the space and power used
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.700]   by traditional one-year rack servers.
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:47.460]   So maybe it's not-- maybe it is a good thing.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:53.780]   Apple probably considered that in all.
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:54.940]   Let's talk-- we're going to take a break.
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:58.420]   Let's talk about Walt Mossberg, who, of course,
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:02.860]   Walt and Cara launched their new site, Re/code.
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:06.820]   And the very first article he published--
[00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:07.220]   I don't know.
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:09.180]   Maybe he's trying to say, I'm not a Mac fan, boy.
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.460]   Honest, I'm not.
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:14.620]   He says, it's not a church, it's just an Apple store.
[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:16.860]   Let's talk about your thoughts on that in just a bit.
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:19.780]   First a word from our sponsor, freshbooks.com.
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:21.260]   They're back, and we love fresh books.
[00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:26.780]   I used fresh books when I was a freelancer for many, many years.
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:28.220]   And I am a big fan of fresh books.
[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:30.180]   It was Amber MacArthur that told me about freshbooks
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:34.740]   way back when I was going to Toronto to do the TV show up there.
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:38.580]   And I had to bill Rogers in Canada and Canadian dollars.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:39.580]   I had local clients.
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.260]   I had a bill in the US dollars.
[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:42.260]   It was driving me crazy.
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:45.260]   I was using, I think, Excel to figure out what they owed me.
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:47.660]   And then word to make an invoice.
[00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:48.540]   It was just crazy.
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.620]   Then I found fresh books.
[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:53.700]   And it just changed my life.
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.100]   Save time and get paid faster with fresh books.
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:50:00.500]   It's the easiest way to send invoices, but also to manage expenses
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.780]   to track your time.
[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:07.140]   It's really become much more than it was when I was first using it.
[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:11.340]   It is really now a simple cloud-based accounting solution.
[00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:14.220]   If you're a new entrepreneur, a small business owner,
[00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:16.700]   you could save time billing, get paid faster,
[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:20.420]   create invoices online, capture and track expenses on the go,
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:24.980]   get real-time business reports with a few simple clicks.
[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:26.380]   It's really great.
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:27.140]   Easy to use.
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.740]   You can work anywhere.
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:33.860]   And because they make it easy for your clients to pay,
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:36.540]   even the invoice that in the email actually has a pay me
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:38.500]   button that makes it so easy to pay,
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.740]   you actually get paid faster.
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:41.940]   Try it free right now.
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:47.260]   For 30 days, getfreshbooks.com.
[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:50.460]   And if you want to get in there drawing for a birthday cake,
[00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:51.860]   they're still doing this and I love it.
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.300]   Every day, they give away a birthday cake for somebody
[00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.140]   who signs up from our Mac break audience.
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:00.220]   But in order to get that cake to be in that drawing,
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:03.100]   you have to say, I heard about it on Mac break weekly
[00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:04.780]   when they-- in the section where it says,
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:05.700]   how did you hear about us?
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:07.620]   Just write Mac break or Mac break weekly.
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:08.740]   That's fine.
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:13.020]   Getfreshbooks.com and maybe even get a birthday cake.
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:14.700]   You doesn't have to be your birthday.
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:16.860]   Just a birthday cake for you.
[00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:18.780]   Every day could be your birthday.
[00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:22.020]   Getfreshbooks.com really is a great way to send--
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:23.900]   it just transformed my life.
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:25.820]   I remember the time I sent an invoice to Rogers
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.420]   six months after the fact.
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:29.460]   And they said, no.
[00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:32.260]   Do we have to-- we don't have to pay you six months later?
[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:33.540]   Yes, well, maybe I don't know.
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:35.380]   It would be nice.
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:37.020]   Whoa.
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:39.980]   Getfreshbooks.com.
[00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:41.900]   Are you a freelancer now, Adam?
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:42.420]   Yeah.
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:44.900]   Yeah, anything that-- I've used freshbooks as well,
[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:45.740]   and it's great.
[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:48.620]   And anything that can make invoice things easier is--
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:49.500]   It's so funny.
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.460]   It's like, I don't know why, but at the end of the month,
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:53.140]   I just dreaded it.
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:54.140]   Yeah.
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:55.820]   It's the part about it that I hate the most,
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:57.620]   is the whole billing and tracking.
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:00.820]   And so again, you use products to make the--
[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:03.740]   They even-- Freshbooks lets you set up recurring--
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.940]   if you've got a client that'll do this, it's really great.
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:09.740]   Recurring, invoicing, and payment automatically.
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:12.260]   So it's just like, we don't have to do this anymore.
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:13.100]   I'm going to work for you.
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:14.220]   You're going to pay me.
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:15.780]   Let's just forget the rest.
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:17.300]   That's so great.
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.700]   Just great.
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.060]   It's not a church.
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:20.900]   It's an Apple Store.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:24.220]   Attention fanboys and fan girls right Walt Mossberg.
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:26.540]   Your favorite tech hardware, software, and services
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:28.740]   are not religious objects.
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:31.900]   And the companies that make them aren't cults or faiths.
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:34.820]   Their capitalist enterprises out to make a profit,
[00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:37.940]   grab market share, and if they can, make products you will buy.
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:42.940]   I think this is Walt grabbing links, grabbing clicks here.
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.420]   Because everybody knows this.
[00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:48.180]   I'm really not sure why the story, A,
[00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:49.900]   needed to be written in the first place,
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:53.900]   or B, why he decided that this was going to be the first article
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.940]   on his brand new site.
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:58.140]   Maybe it's a, you know, I'm putting my flag on the ground
[00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:01.900]   and telling you proudly that I no longer
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:04.140]   or I no longer worship at the church of Apple.
[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:07.180]   In fact, I think that all churches are wrong
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:10.540]   and I am going to strive to not be partisan.
[00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:13.700]   It feels very much like a statement of purpose.
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:15.900]   Yes, and at the same time, it feels defensive.
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:18.340]   Like he feels like he, and I think he has been accused
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.420]   of Apple fandom.
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:23.980]   He says, "Once I was accused of being corrupt and lazy
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:27.460]   "for writing a positive review of a new iPad,
[00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:30.220]   "but having the temerity to list some of its downsides,
[00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:33.020]   "when Apple fansite immediately called for me to resign."
[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:33.940]   (laughs)
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:36.740]   I call, but we've all experienced that.
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:40.100]   I mean, say one negative thing about Apple
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:42.620]   or one positive thing about Apple,
[00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:44.980]   there's somebody who will hate you.
[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:47.260]   So why go to the trouble of defending yourself
[00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:48.100]   in the first place?
[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:50.780]   That's the thing that sort of strikes me as odd,
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:53.020]   is Mossberg has been in the community for years
[00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:54.540]   and years and years.
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:57.620]   And obviously every time someone makes a comment like that,
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:59.740]   it stings a little bit and it hurts a little bit.
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:03.300]   But in total, by now, I would kind of assume
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:05.380]   that he's like, "You know what?
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:06.540]   "Not listening to those guys.
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:09.460]   "Wall up, working on, I'm gonna do what I love
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:11.940]   "and do what I do best and they can think
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:12.940]   "whatever they're gonna think."
[00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:15.460]   And to put out a post like this on a brand new site,
[00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:17.460]   it's very odd to me.
[00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:18.660]   It called too much attention.
[00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:21.900]   It, me think the pundit doth protest too much.
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:22.740]   Exactly.
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:24.140]   It's like someone had a gun to his back.
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:25.820]   It's like, "Okay, you're gonna be partisan.
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:28.460]   "You hear, or non-partisan, yeah."
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:29.300]   It remains to be seen.
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:33.180]   I think you, we have to, in this era, unfortunately,
[00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.460]   actually not unfortunately.
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:35.980]   I think this is a good thing.
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:37.700]   You have to judge each person
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:41.700]   because it is no longer the case
[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:43.180]   that you could assume that,
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:47.340]   you know, well, and see, I think it was always an illusion,
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:48.540]   but there was the illusion that,
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:49.940]   well, if it's in the Wall Street Journal
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:51.020]   of the New York Times,
[00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:56.020]   it's completely unbiased and objective.
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:55:00.140]   And you know, it's just the facts, man.
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:01.860]   And I think that we now know, looking back,
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:04.820]   that that never was the case, really.
[00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:09.220]   But it's certainly the case now that everybody,
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:12.380]   there's all these conflicting interests and so forth.
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:16.060]   And one hopes that the audience
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:20.460]   has enough critical thinking in their noggin
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:21.500]   to make the decision.
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:26.260]   And it's not even permanently, like it's almost continually.
[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:27.940]   Is this a fair and objective review?
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:31.700]   Is this a, and so I don't think anybody gets a free pass anymore.
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:34.820]   But I think the audience is smart enough to know the difference.
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:36.460]   - That's the key is so many people
[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:37.980]   don't give enough credit to the audience.
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:39.620]   And I guess it's because there are a lot of people
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:41.740]   in the audience that just wanna be told, you know,
[00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:44.300]   what to buy and what to do and things like that.
[00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:46.580]   But the thing that I'm constantly trying to bring
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:48.260]   and the thing that, you know,
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:50.300]   I wish he would have maybe focused on more
[00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:52.980]   is just, you know, reminding consumers
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:55.660]   that they need to be doing the thinking
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:58.420]   and need to sort of get all angles
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:00.300]   and make the choices for themselves.
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:02.820]   But some people are perfectly happy too to just,
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:05.340]   hey, just tell me what I'm supposed to think.
[00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:06.420]   And that's fine, but I don't think
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:07.620]   that's the vast majority of people.
[00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:09.820]   And I think with more and more information out
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:13.180]   and readily available, I think that's really changing a lot too.
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:15.860]   Right, we have a lot more access to a lot more sources
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:17.860]   to kind of ferret the stuff out for ourselves,
[00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:19.060]   which I think is a really good thing.
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.460]   I think that's a great point.
[00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:24.220]   - You, I think Mac world and IDG in general
[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:27.780]   still hues to the idea of even though we're Mac world
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:30.620]   or PC world, and I think this is one of the reasons
[00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:33.500]   it's kind of good that Jason now heads both,
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:36.820]   we are independent and we will tell the truth.
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:39.700]   - Absolutely. - Yeah.
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.780]   Now David Pogue, who you might say
[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:44.220]   was quite the Apple fan boy,
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:46.300]   anyway, he's no longer the New York Times,
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:50.380]   he's making his debut, I think, at Yahoo,
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:55.380]   because I noticed he's filing from CES at Yahoo.
[00:56:55.380 --> 00:57:00.940]   And along with our friend Becky Worley
[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:04.500]   has been writing a number of stories from CES.
[00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:07.380]   So, I guess that's a related story.
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:10.340]   David often came under fire,
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:12.100]   even from the time zone ombudsman
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:16.020]   for not being sufficiently critical of Apple.
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:19.420]   - It's interesting things happening at Yahoo right now.
[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:20.260]   It's just to me. - Yeah.
[00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:21.620]   I don't know what it means.
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:23.620]   Katie Quirks now, they're anchor.
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:28.820]   And I haven't, is it news.yahoo.com?
[00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:29.700]   Where is?
[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:33.460]   - Well, you know, much to probably the chagrin of Google,
[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:35.700]   them killing the, I always used to my Google page
[00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:37.860]   and maybe I was one of the last people to do that,
[00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:41.500]   but when they killed it, I went over to Yahoo
[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.940]   and I was pleasantly surprised to find that
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:46.500]   it linked right into my Gmail and stuff too.
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:47.340]   So, hey.
[00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:52.540]   - My Yahoo, I used to use, for years I used my.yahoo.com, right?
[00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:53.380]   - Yeah.
[00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:55.500]   - I'm not crazy about the giant ad for--
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:57.180]   - Yeah, it's not great.
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:58:00.660]   But where else was I gonna go?
[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:03.300]   And I'm looking at more Yahoo content now, which--
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:04.140]   - That's good.
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:05.340]   - I'm saying there's some interesting things going on
[00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:07.580]   at Yahoo and I'm finding myself using some of their services
[00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:09.740]   a little bit more and, you know, their search
[00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:10.940]   what uses Bing, right?
[00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:11.820]   So--
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:12.660]   - Ew.
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:13.820]   - Or there's some sort of relationship, right?
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:15.060]   - Yeah, no, it is his Bing.
[00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:16.900]   - I'm actually surprised that it's, you know,
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.500]   I've been okay with it.
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:20.420]   It hasn't been awful.
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:21.260]   - No, Bing's not, you know.
[00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:24.660]   - Bing is not terrible, it's just not outstanding.
[00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:25.980]   - Yeah.
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:27.580]   - Search is search.
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:28.420]   I think-- - Exactly.
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:29.820]   - I think we may be in a world,
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:30.940]   I think Google's recognized this,
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.220]   which is why they emphasize Google
[00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:33.860]   plus and other stuff so much now,
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:35.480]   where search is a commodity.
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:38.340]   You know, if you find the page you want,
[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:39.900]   do you really care who you used?
[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:46.700]   Yeah, actually I'm looking at my Yahoo right now
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:49.820]   and it, you know, it does the job.
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:53.540]   So, actually in a way, I think Yahoo's answering the question,
[00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:55.780]   are you a service company or a content company
[00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:57.860]   that they're gonna be both?
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:00.180]   And what you will see a lot of is their content
[00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:02.620]   in their services.
[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:06.740]   - Yeah, I'll be interested to see it, how they can balance that
[00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:07.580]   in the future.
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:09.540]   - They don't have unlike you guys,
[00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:12.180]   unlike, you know, Tech Hive or The Verge or Engadget,
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:16.860]   a big CES page, like Yahoo at CES.
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:17.940]   - Yeah.
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:20.020]   - They sh-- well, maybe they do.
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:21.340]   - I think maybe they're not.
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:22.780]   Again, it seems like they're rebuilding,
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:24.980]   I guess is the thing that I was sort of alluding to.
[00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:28.060]   They're bringing on some people like Pogue and Katie Couric
[00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:30.340]   and they're focusing on more on their content,
[00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:32.180]   which I think is maybe a good thing in the long run,
[00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:33.420]   but it's gonna take a while.
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:36.980]   I mean, the others obviously have a big lead,
[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:39.620]   but it's interesting 'cause I had really counted Yahoo out
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:41.500]   a long time ago and it seems like maybe
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:42.740]   they're not quite out yet.
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:43.580]   - Right.
[00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:45.500]   I don't know how I got into this.
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:46.940]   Oh, we were talking about Mossberg in there.
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:47.780]   - Yeah, sorry.
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:48.620]   - I mentioned Pogue.
[00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:50.740]   - The Mossberg, Pogue, too.
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:55.260]   - Yes, John Siracusa has issued his Apple 2013 scorecard.
[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:57.700]   I'd pay attention to what John says.
[00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:01.180]   Very few people who are as smart about Apple as John,
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:06.180]   his voluminous reviews of OS X releases are a must-read
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:08.900]   on Ars Technica.
[01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:10.460]   And at the beginning of last year,
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:13.540]   he posted a list of things Apple should do during 2013
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.460]   and he says, "It's time to settle up."
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:21.860]   He says A- they shipped OS X Mavericks and iOS 7.
[01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:27.660]   I think not an A+ only because iOS 7 is so horrendously buggy.
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:29.700]   - And Mavericks, too.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:30.540]   Let's not forget about the game.
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:31.380]   - Yeah, Mavericks, too.
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.220]   What am I thinking?
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.460]   - I still can't use mail.
[01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:38.180]   - Is it a win to get out an operating system
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:39.480]   if it doesn't work fully?
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:45.140]   - I am not so sold on that idea.
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:47.740]   Having used all of the betas,
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:51.100]   I really wish that they had taken an extra month
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:52.220]   on both of them.
[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:54.620]   There are just, there's some really bad bugs,
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:57.580]   even right now, even with 7.1 and with, you know,
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.780]   with Mavericks and 10.9.1,
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:02.260]   they're just, mail still doesn't work.
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:04.340]   There are still hard reboots.
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:06.500]   I got two hard reboots yesterday on my phone,
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.020]   just doing random things, opening a webpage.
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:09.940]   - I get, yeah, it was,
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:11.700]   did you get a reboot or a springboard reboot?
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:12.700]   You got a hard reboot?
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:14.620]   - I got a hard reboot and a springboard reboot.
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:16.300]   - Oh, MG.
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:17.140]   - Yeah.
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:20.060]   - Now that seems very, it seems,
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.060]   now I talk to people who say,
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:23.660]   oh, springboard never crashes on me.
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:26.940]   I get at least one or two a day on my iPad.
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:30.980]   - Yeah, I was getting them up until this latest,
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:33.860]   the, what was it, 7.04.
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:34.700]   - And now it's better.
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:38.020]   - It seems, I can see why it's hard for Apple
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:40.580]   to fix this because it doesn't seem consistent.
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:46.140]   MG Seagler, who is an undoubtedly an Apple fan point,
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:46.980]   right?
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:48.700]   Is it safe to say that?
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:49.540]   I don't know.
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:53.340]   Says, finally, he's done,
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:56.000]   he's like pissed that iOS 7 is so crappy.
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:00.780]   - Boy, when you've pissed off MG Seagler.
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:02.500]   - I mean, I've had issues with iOS 7,
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.980]   but again, not huge, a huge number of them,
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:05.820]   but I'm with you.
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:07.540]   I mean, do you get springboard crashes?
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:08.380]   - Yeah.
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:09.980]   - That should not be happening.
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:12.820]   - Well, I think that-
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:13.820]   - I think that what we were used to,
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:14.860]   if it never happening,
[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:17.060]   I mean, you used to never happen to know it does, right?
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:18.100]   So.
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.700]   - I mean, the engineers are stretched way too thin
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:21.700]   across the board right now.
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:24.100]   And you can see that with Apple basically trying
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:27.100]   to hire everyone under the sun
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:29.420]   and a couple of prominent engineers have been leaving
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:32.180]   for other companies because they're offering bigger bonuses
[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:33.540]   or et cetera, et cetera.
[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:38.740]   But even with stretched resources,
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:42.220]   it's really tough to kind of continue giving passes and say,
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:45.380]   "Yes, these operating systems show great leaps,
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:48.140]   except for when they don't work in places."
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:48.980]   - Right.
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:52.460]   - And then you start to feel wrapping background here
[01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:55.140]   to like an Apple apologist where you're like,
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:57.940]   "This is so great, except for XYZ."
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.740]   - Well, that's exactly what MG says.
[01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:01.820]   He says, "I embraced the God in neon
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:04.100]   and I entered our newly flat world excited
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:07.420]   and I remain convinced that in just about every way iOS 7
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:09.740]   is a huge upgrade over the previous iterations,
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:11.500]   except one and it's a big one.
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:15.980]   The software is so inexplicably and inexcusably buggy.
[01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:20.100]   It was really buggy in the developer builds.
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:23.500]   In fact, somebody I won't say who,
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:24.780]   who showed me the developer build.
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:28.060]   I was thinking about putting it on my iPhone and my iPad said,
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:28.900]   "Don't."
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:29.980]   (laughing)
[01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:31.100]   - Yeah, this was the first one,
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:32.140]   'cause I'm in the developer program.
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:33.620]   This was the first one until I waited
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:37.380]   until it was almost at the release build before I even tried,
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:40.620]   'cause I had read and heard a number of issues
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:41.620]   that people were having.
[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:45.620]   Surprisingly, for me, it was actually better
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:47.340]   before the release version
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:50.220]   than the release version was when I started seeing the crashes
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:52.980]   and then it slowly got better to this latest build.
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:54.900]   - Are you, the latest one's been better for me.
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:56.940]   - And you're not talking 7-1,
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:58.660]   'cause 7-1's in testing right now, right?
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:04.020]   - Yeah, 7-0-3-4. - Yeah, that's what I think
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.100]   all my devices are on.
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:05.940]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.140]   - And my iPad seemed to be, for some reason,
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:10.860]   more stable than my iPhone, but I don't know.
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:11.700]   That's just me.
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.660]   - Different devices have different,
[01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:15.780]   it seems inexplicable, to be honest,
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:18.220]   because I was sitting across from somebody
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:20.420]   and they're never having any problems
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:21.740]   and I'm having continuous problems
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:24.780]   and then it just seems, is it the apps we're using?
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:26.180]   I don't know what it is.
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:28.300]   - I've gotta assume that it has to do partially
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:29.700]   with how you're using your phone
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:32.100]   and how many apps you're running with your phone,
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.180]   whether or not I know when I was testing iOS 7
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:36.660]   earlier on in the build process,
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:38.900]   it was having a lot of problem with multitasking switcher
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:40.780]   and I've gotta wonder if there are still
[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:43.380]   some root problems there where it involves
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.100]   with either switching too quickly
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.060]   or triggering springboard crashes
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:49.780]   by going one to the other to back.
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:52.020]   Like I can't pinpoint it down either,
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:55.620]   but I assume that a whole of Apple's teams
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:57.020]   are pretty much working.
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:58.060]   - They're gonna be focused.
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:58.900]   - No, they've been brainstormed.
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:02.580]   - They worked over Christmas break, I would guess.
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:05.740]   7-1 is in beta now and some say it's better.
[01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:08.780]   MG says that he's heard that maybe it's the 64 bit chip
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:11.820]   that's causing conipsions, that could be.
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:13.620]   That could be.
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:14.780]   - I would explain why I'm seeing it
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:15.940]   maybe more on my phone than--
[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:16.780]   - Right.
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:17.620]   - Then you're on that.
[01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:18.620]   - I've had. - Right.
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:23.780]   - Continuing the Syracuse report card,
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.620]   another thing he said they should do,
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:29.140]   diversify the iPhone product line, they did,
[01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:30.260]   but he says I'm a little disappointed
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.460]   that the 5C is really just basically a 5
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:34.460]   with a slightly larger battery.
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:37.620]   He says I'm still anxiously waiting a larger screen,
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:39.060]   B plus.
[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:42.700]   Keep the iPad on track, A minus, I agree.
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:47.220]   I think the iPad Air and the Mini are great.
[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:51.220]   And I really like the retina display on my Mini,
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.620]   I use it all the time.
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.020]   - I was really impressed that they came out
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:57.100]   with the Bull's of Retina and the A7 this year.
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.060]   I was expecting one or the other, but not both.
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:02.020]   - Yeah, that's a lot to do.
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:04.060]   For a tiny little company in Cupertino.
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:07.660]   Introduce more better Retina Max, he says.
[01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:12.660]   B minus on that, I do think the Mac Book Pro
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:15.580]   with Retina and the improved graphics is great
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.980]   and they've solved the lag.
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:20.820]   In fact, that's what I'm using in front of me right now.
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:25.580]   But he says even, he says the MacBook Air and iMac
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:26.940]   are still excluded from the Retina club
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:29.740]   and even the Mighty Mac Pro has extremely limited
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.980]   high DPI options, we talked about that.
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:36.220]   B minus, make messages work correctly, no.
[01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:38.380]   - He gives that.
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:39.980]   - Don't we all wish.
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:42.460]   - He says hope is fading D.
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:43.460]   - Yeah, there you go.
[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:46.740]   - You get D minus on that one.
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:50.260]   Make iCloud better, C.
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:55.260]   They are making some steps, but it doesn't yet just work.
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:58.620]   - The behind the scenes support is promising,
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:01.300]   but of course your average consumer has no idea
[01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:02.660]   that all of that has happened,
[01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:04.460]   that it's slightly better for developers.
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:07.540]   All they know is my documents are still disappearing
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:10.260]   or I got this from three different people
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:11.700]   over the holiday break.
[01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:13.940]   So I was sending a message to somebody
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:15.740]   and then all of a sudden their name disappeared
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:17.620]   and only their number appeared
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:19.380]   and all of my contacts were gone.
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:23.100]   - So maybe some of the problems with messages
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:24.860]   are with iCloud.
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:25.900]   - It might be.
[01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:26.980]   - Very likely, yeah.
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:30.900]   - Apple's just never really been great at web services.
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.060]   - No.
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:33.660]   - Never have.
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:36.420]   - I think they try and take on too much too fast.
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:38.460]   I mean, I'll say what I, you know,
[01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:40.580]   there's plenty to be said about the beta tag
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:43.100]   and about limited signups and things like that,
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:46.700]   but especially like you look at iCloud's initial promise
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:51.380]   of here to everyone free, let's go
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:54.540]   and trying to ramp it up from the relatively little,
[01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:56.660]   even when, you know, .Mac was paid
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:59.740]   and then switching it over to sort of a free service,
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:02.580]   that's a huge load problem.
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.500]   You're dealing with massive scaling.
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.500]   I just, I think they're trying to be very ambitious
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.980]   about what they want to do for their community
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:14.300]   and for their customers and the actual output
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:17.620]   doesn't always result in what they would like.
[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:18.460]   - Yeah.
[01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:20.700]   - The idealized version of the reality.
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:22.940]   - I'm constantly, 'cause we've heard a lot in the past weeks
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:25.100]   of all these companies that they're acquiring and mapping
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.980]   and all these other places, but you're not hearing much
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:30.420]   about them acquiring, you know, services companies
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.780]   and you think they'd want to start doing some of those
[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:34.740]   acquisitions as well.
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:36.060]   And maybe it's happening behind the scenes
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:37.380]   and we're just not hearing about it,
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:40.540]   but yeah, they could use some help in that area.
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:41.860]   And I think it's gonna be a big part
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:42.900]   of their business moving forward.
[01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:45.380]   So you would have to imagine that they know that
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:47.300]   and they're focused on it.
[01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:48.780]   - You know, it's really interesting to watch the chat room
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:51.780]   because in every respect when we've said,
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:54.780]   "Yeah, there's problems with iOS 7, with Mavericks,
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:57.900]   with iCloud, with messages," a number of people pipe up
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:59.820]   and say, "No, it works great for me."
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:03.940]   And that's part of the problem is that probably for 90%
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:08.260]   or maybe 80% of the consumers, it's fine.
[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:10.380]   But that doesn't mean it's fine.
[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.020]   It just means that they're not challenging it
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:14.100]   in the ways that break it.
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:16.780]   - Well, there's also a respective thing that goes on
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:18.700]   because I'll say for me, you know,
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:20.780]   I don't have that many issues with iCloud.
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:23.020]   But I do have issues and see that's the difference.
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:25.060]   Is our we talking about is 80% good enough?
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.620]   Is a B good enough?
[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:28.100]   Or do we want A-level service?
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:30.260]   And I think most of us who are real Apple fans
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:32.900]   and enjoy what Apple does, we have come to expect
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:35.780]   and really want A-level quality and everything,
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:37.980]   not B and C-level quality.
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:39.460]   And a lot of people are perfectly fine.
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:42.140]   Like it works most of the time, okay, great.
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:44.340]   - Well, you look at something like Dropbox, right?
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:47.060]   Where Dropbox has made a huge name for itself
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:49.460]   by just being stellar all of the time.
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:51.060]   Like I cannot think of a point
[01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:54.220]   where I was using Dropbox and had any issues with it.
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:57.380]   Like, files are always there when you want them.
[01:09:57.380 --> 01:09:59.380]   And you compare a service like Dropbox
[01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:01.820]   to a service like iCloud where, you know,
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:04.900]   you put your files and then most of the time they'll show up
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:07.220]   and sometimes they won't or most of the time
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:08.860]   you'll get syncs and then occasionally
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:09.900]   you'll have an error.
[01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:12.260]   I mostly have, you know, no problems with iCloud
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:15.940]   but still that one problem gets you a little bit set off
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:17.380]   and you get you frustrated.
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.940]   And if it's one, you know, very crucial piece
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:21.620]   of information you needed,
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:23.740]   then that can be the sort of the make or break
[01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:25.540]   feeling for you.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:29.300]   - Catrasse this to Evernote's problems.
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:34.300]   Jason Kincaid wrote a very critical,
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:36.780]   loving but critical kind of like,
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:39.660]   I think Evernote is like Apple in some respects.
[01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:42.860]   I certainly am an Evernote fan boy,
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:44.780]   adopted it very early on,
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:45.940]   have been with it ever since,
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:48.580]   used it 100% on all my devices.
[01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:52.940]   Jason, same way, he calls it the bug ridden elephant.
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:59.140]   He says it should, he is losing data for him.
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:00.740]   There's privacy issues.
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:04.620]   He wanted to, you know, apparently he's been losing
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:09.260]   some audio and a sketch images in the sync process.
[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:13.140]   An engineer asked him to send over the activity log.
[01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:15.460]   Each Evernote application records everything
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:17.740]   going behind the scenes.
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:19.900]   And fortunately for him, he reviewed the log
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:23.940]   before he sent it and he noted that it had,
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:26.620]   in the log, some of the more personal things
[01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:28.820]   that he had started to write about his,
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:30.380]   I guess about his sex life,
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:34.980]   a stray thought about sex in a text note.
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:39.980]   And he says that would have been sent to the engineers.
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:42.620]   Anyway, some significant complaints.
[01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:47.740]   And contrast, now complaints like the kinds we have
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:48.820]   with Apple.
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:52.940]   Evernote's response, Phil Lyman, the CEO, immediately,
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:55.860]   writes an extensive blog post responding directly
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:12:00.860]   to Jason's criticism, by name, even linking to Jason's post.
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:05.180]   And talking about whatever note's going to do about it.
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:08.260]   Admitting to some problems, not admitting to others,
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:12.380]   but saying, look, we understand this is an effort.
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:15.040]   And we're going to take care of this.
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:18.500]   And so I think this is the kind of thing
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.340]   I'd love to see from Apple.
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:25.540]   - Yeah, I wish that that was in the company's DNA.
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:27.140]   - Yeah, really isn't.
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:30.140]   - Well, you have on one hand, you have the Apple stores
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:32.140]   and the idea of if you're having a problem,
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:34.420]   just come to a genius or come to a specialist
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:36.780]   and we'll handle anything that you need to know about.
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:40.540]   And then on the other, you have this horrible gaping maw
[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:43.260]   of customer service issues online and on the web
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:45.420]   where Apple is essentially very tight-mouthed.
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:48.100]   You have the support forums where no one says anything.
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:51.280]   You have the executive team, which will only respond
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:53.100]   for life or death crises.
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:56.860]   And even then, you may only get an absolute person said.
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:58.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:00.260]   Like, I mean, don't get me wrong.
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:03.060]   Some things just don't need to be responded to.
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:04.380]   Some things are ridiculous.
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:07.820]   And you can ignore them and they will successfully go away.
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:11.340]   But when you're talking about serious consumer problems
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:13.820]   or even just repeated consumer problems,
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:16.500]   things like with maps, which they did come out finally
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.700]   and say something about.
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:22.100]   It just annoys me so much that Apple isn't willing
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:23.380]   to take a stronger stance.
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:26.980]   And even if it's just, we stand behind our products
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:28.820]   and our products will only get better.
[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:31.180]   And we are committed to making the say products
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:35.060]   that you use every day of the year from here on out.
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:36.620]   We know it has initial problems.
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:38.500]   Even just making a stand like that,
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:41.620]   I think would be a huge improvement
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:43.060]   in their communication strategies.
[01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:47.260]   But Apple has always been very close to the chest.
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:49.300]   We don't play our cards except when we decide
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:50.460]   that it's right.
[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:51.500]   It's frustrating.
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:54.260]   - I think, Adam, you also nailed it.
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:56.140]   We expect more from Apple.
[01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:59.980]   We have been used to such great stuff that when they don't,
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:01.500]   and you know what, every, look,
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.580]   there's nothing perfect in this technology world of ours.
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:07.380]   It's hard to do everything perfectly.
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:08.900]   - Well, into your point earlier,
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:11.060]   we're trying to also, we're in a position
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:12.780]   where we have to try to be balanced.
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:16.180]   We cannot just give them a pass on everything.
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:18.740]   And I think it's hard for a lot of our fans
[01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:21.300]   and the people who are really diehard Apple fans
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:24.660]   to kind of see when we point out the warts.
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:26.220]   I mean, there's warts and they'll like you said,
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:27.740]   it's everything, it's not just Apple.
[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:29.460]   We just happen to be focused on that.
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:31.100]   And I don't feel I'm doing my job
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:33.220]   if I don't try and step back
[01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:36.300]   and take my personal fandom out of that.
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:37.740]   Going back to Walt's thing,
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:39.260]   it's very easy to get caught up in that.
[01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:41.100]   And that's one good thing about Walt's piece
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:43.380]   is at least reminding the fanboys out there,
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:47.620]   "Hey, you gotta gain some perspective at some point too."
[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:49.620]   And look at this objectively.
[01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:53.900]   - It's hard being a fanboy.
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:55.980]   - It is. - It's not easy.
[01:14:55.980 --> 01:15:00.660]   Sir Kuzah also says, "Resurrect iLife and iWork."
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:03.340]   He says, "Be careful what you wish for."
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:05.500]   'Cause yes, they did.
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:09.060]   At least iWork, but then they took out all the features.
[01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:12.420]   - You know, this is one that Apple took a lot of flack for,
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:15.300]   but I see the point in doing this
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:17.420]   and they've done it with several products over the years.
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:20.020]   And I think iWork and iLife needed to have this happen.
[01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:22.300]   They sort of have to tear it down to build it back up.
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:23.540]   This is what they did with iMovie.
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:25.220]   And i think iMovie is a better product for it.
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.740]   It's what they did with Final Cut
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:29.460]   and Final Cut's improving and improving.
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:31.300]   And sometimes you just gotta throw everything out
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:33.060]   and kinda start over and it's painful.
[01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:35.780]   It's really painful to the consumer.
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:38.060]   But I kinda actually more admire Apple
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:41.820]   for being willing to sort of take the hits and do that.
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:43.220]   - Well, you look at the contrast, right?
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:45.940]   You look at a program like Photoshop
[01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:49.620]   that's just had, "Oh, we're gonna try and change things."
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:51.820]   Well, keeping everything exactly the same
[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:53.380]   that you remember it and just,
[01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:56.820]   it becomes just a huge bloated piece of software.
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:16:00.180]   I don't think that, you know, what Apple did to iWork
[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.740]   is perfect and that, you know,
[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:04.140]   there are definitely improvements that need to be made.
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:09.140]   But gosh, I'm so glad that they had sort of the drive
[01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:11.980]   to say, "No, you know what?
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:14.300]   We're not standing for this piece of technology
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:15.340]   that's now a couple of years old.
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:17.500]   We're gonna tear it down, we're gonna start over,
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.580]   we're gonna make it something that will last again.
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:22.100]   A roadmap for the next 10, 20, 30 years
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:24.100]   rather than for the next two or three.
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:26.860]   But that comes with downsides,
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:29.140]   that comes with caveats and that comes with lots
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:31.260]   and lots of people being mad at you.
[01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:33.740]   - And I think this is a case to give Apple credit
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:35.260]   where their corporate communications
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:37.100]   were actually pretty good, where they said,
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.220]   "You know what, this was a 32-bit app.
[01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:41.140]   It had to be completely rewritten from scratch
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:45.940]   to give you the support that we want across all 64-bit platforms."
[01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:47.980]   And yes, we know we took features out
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:50.780]   and in the very first update, they added features back
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:51.580]   and they will continue.
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:53.460]   I think they communicated this pretty well.
[01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:57.540]   - Yeah, but Apple didn't have iPhones and tablets
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:59.180]   when they buy work way back in the day.
[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:00.780]   - This is an old piece of software.
[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:02.580]   - Right, and now they've got new platforms
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:04.420]   and they want everything to be seamless and integrated.
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:07.540]   And again, you contrast that with something like
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.860]   the Windows tablets and what they had to do with Office
[01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:12.580]   and you see how that strategy does not work.
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:14.340]   You know, we can't just sort of,
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:17.420]   we gotta have a foundation that we can build on moving forward
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:20.340]   that's gonna work for how we're computing now.
[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:22.140]   We're computing differently now than we were.
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:24.780]   And people want all of their pages
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:28.260]   and their iWork documents on across all their devices.
[01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:30.300]   And that has to work really, really well.
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:31.660]   And I don't think they could have done that
[01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:34.220]   with the foundation that they have, so.
[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:36.940]   - And let's see some new aperture updates, Apple.
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:38.420]   Come on. (laughs)
[01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:39.740]   Just as long as you've done that.
[01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:41.740]   - I think that's another thing,
[01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:44.100]   like Serenity said earlier, I think Apple's resources,
[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:45.740]   that's their big problem right now.
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:47.460]   - Yeah. - Yeah, their program
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:49.820]   and resources are just so stretched so thin.
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:52.900]   - Well, that Pro Apps team has, you know,
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:55.100]   always been very, very small.
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:57.940]   And you really have to think about what they were working on.
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:01.260]   Like Pro Apps first was working on the revamp of iLife
[01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:04.460]   and the all new, you know, GarageBand iMovie in '08.
[01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:07.540]   And then they moved over to the giant Final Cut project
[01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:10.140]   and then they went to the new Logic project.
[01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:13.980]   So one can only hope that their next big project is aperture,
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:15.340]   but you never know.
[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:17.500]   It's hard to do.
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:21.300]   He's huge, big, sweeping upgrades and do them properly
[01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:24.260]   when you really have a team of, you know, under 100 people.
[01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:26.660]   - Yeah, and you're a hardware company.
[01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:27.540]   Not a software company.
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:30.780]   I mean, Adobe has updated Lightroom like four times
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:32.460]   since aperture came out.
[01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:34.100]   And I continue to use Lightroom.
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:37.260]   But I would love to use aperture.
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:41.780]   I just, you know, Apple's a hardware company.
[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:43.420]   They did do, according to Syracuse,
[01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:45.740]   an important thing, they reassured Mac Pro lovers.
[01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.300]   Thank you.
[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:48.700]   And A on that one.
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:53.020]   And finally, an F for do something about TV.
[01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:54.820]   I don't, you know, I feel bad for Apple.
[01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:57.740]   That whole thing comes from that one line
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:19:01.060]   in the Steve Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson.
[01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:04.260]   And someone analyst who picked up on it.
[01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:06.460]   And I don't know if Apple ever intimated
[01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:09.500]   that they were doing anything about TV besides Apple TV.
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.140]   - They've said nothing except it's a hobby.
[01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:12.180]   It's a hobby, it's a hobby.
[01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:14.220]   - And also, I love John.
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:17.020]   And I'll give him grief for this the next time I see him.
[01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:22.020]   But I think they deserve at least like a CD plus here.
[01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:24.300]   Because I do think that the stuff that they've been doing
[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:27.780]   with their current hobby box with the Apple TV is interesting.
[01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:29.540]   I think that the channels they've been adding,
[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:32.020]   I think that they pseudo-customize apps
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:33.620]   are an interesting way.
[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:34.460]   - What are those?
[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:36.460]   What are pseudo-c, I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:39.740]   - So apps like the Disney Go app
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:41.860]   that they released a couple months ago
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:45.740]   that have not quite the standard Apple TV interface
[01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:48.540]   that have some live streaming options.
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:52.940]   Those are apps that they have to work in concert
[01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:54.740]   with developers to kind of build
[01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:56.860]   because there's no open API.
[01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:00.260]   But it signals that there might be a shift down the line
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:03.460]   where we might start seeing more of these apps.
[01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:05.820]   And the other big thing that actually
[01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:07.460]   really impresses me about the Apple TV
[01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:09.740]   is how much Apple has been going to try
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:12.060]   and make it easier and easier to set up
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:15.140]   with a sort of tap to set up with your phone
[01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:17.780]   and being able to pair it with a Bluetooth keyboard.
[01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:20.060]   Like they're really, they're trying out
[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:22.500]   and experimenting with a lot of things.
[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:25.660]   In advance of what we do not know, you know,
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:28.700]   for all we know Apple could be set to do nothing
[01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:30.780]   except release these little tiny set boxes.
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:32.420]   And honestly, I think I'd prefer that
[01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:36.220]   to a full-size Apple TV because I'm far more likely
[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:37.980]   to buy a small box or something
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:40.020]   that I can integrate quickly into a television
[01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:41.740]   I already own than to try and pay, you know,
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:45.220]   $2,000, $3,000 for a hulking smart TV.
[01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:48.980]   But either way, it's interested to see them playing
[01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:49.820]   in this space.
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:52.700]   It's not like they were absolutely silent this year.
[01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:56.500]   - I feel like we really do overdo
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:59.060]   for an Apple TV, like a massive Apple TV upgrade,
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:01.100]   like the next Apple TV.
[01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:03.420]   I gotta think Apple's doing that
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:04.700]   and that's where their focus is.
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:07.500]   Just the fact that the Apple TV grid of apps
[01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:09.860]   has now gotten unwieldily big,
[01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:14.060]   tells me they're about to do something big, right?
[01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:15.420]   - Yeah.
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:18.380]   I think Apple's having an industry problem though,
[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:21.100]   is like I think for Apple that the issue is
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:23.940]   is that what the consumers want,
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:25.700]   which is what Apple wants to deliver
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:28.660]   and what the studios and the networks
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:31.380]   and the cable companies all this, it's a mess.
[01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:32.780]   I mean, it's just an absolute mess
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:34.620]   and I don't think they can make any end roads
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:38.300]   in sort of changing the game with how TV is right now.
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:40.660]   And I just see it getting more and more fragmented.
[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:42.460]   I was talking to my wife about this earlier.
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:45.420]   It's like we're seeing these encampments form up now
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:49.620]   between Google TV and Roku and even Netflix.
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:50.940]   You look at the amount of content
[01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.820]   that's getting pulled away from Netflix
[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:53.900]   and they can't get deals
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:56.780]   and the content's becoming more and more fragmented.
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:59.380]   And I'm thinking of like, having one TV
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:01.940]   with one sort of limited amount of services,
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:04.340]   you're gonna buy a smart TV that has something integrated.
[01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:06.660]   Let's say Roku and then still gonna want to hook up
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:08.540]   your Apple TV and some other box
[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:10.380]   so that you can get all the services and channels
[01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:11.220]   that you want.
[01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:14.140]   So it's just a mess and that's not what Apple wants.
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:16.460]   So until that gets figured out,
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:17.700]   I don't know how they can move forward
[01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:20.340]   with any kind of innovative TV product.
[01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:22.300]   And you look at what's coming out of CS right now
[01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:26.020]   and it's just nothing really earth shattering.
[01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:28.340]   If any, in my opinion, if anything's happening,
[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:32.420]   it's just becoming more fragmented and more of a mess.
[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:35.380]   It's a whole lot of different ideas
[01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:37.740]   about how the future of TV should go.
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:39.740]   It's very frustrating.
[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:43.700]   I mean, I think it's very similar to the iTunes issue,
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:46.900]   to iTunes radio, to match.
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:50.740]   Until Apple has the content providers either in their pocket
[01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:52.100]   or enough on their side,
[01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:54.340]   they can have some leverage and insist,
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:56.140]   like, we want these kind of deals
[01:22:56.140 --> 01:22:58.860]   and we don't want you to have to have a cable subscription
[01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:02.140]   to be able to watch the content that we're offering.
[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:04.300]   Until they can really get some more leverage,
[01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:06.180]   I don't think they really can move forward
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:08.500]   into the next step because, again,
[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:10.420]   they want what's best for the consumer
[01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:13.060]   and to build something that the consumer will really like
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:15.740]   and be hassle free for them.
[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:18.820]   And right now, the Apple TV isn't quite there
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:20.940]   and I don't think that they can really get it there
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:25.140]   without some more leeway from those folks in Hollywood.
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:29.220]   Maybe what's going on is the Apple engineers
[01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:30.900]   are too busy doing things like this.
[01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:32.980]   They're building, Apple engineer builds
[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:36.420]   programmable drawing machine out of Legos.
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:38.900]   Andrew Carroll
[01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:46.500]   has apparently built a machine that can draw stuff.
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:51.900]   You think Legos, I'm sure he's doing this in his--
[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:52.900]   - Thank you, so machine.
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:53.860]   - In his free time.
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:55.660]   I hope he's doing this in his free time.
[01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:57.020]   Yeah, it's inspired by Hugo.
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:23:57.860]   That's right.
[01:23:57.860 --> 01:24:01.740]   Wow, all you have to do is turn a crank.
[01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:03.060]   What?
[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:06.540]   - That's the guy, he's on the aperture team, right?
[01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:10.060]   - Oh no, tell me that, tell me that ain't the case.
[01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:10.900]   - I'm joking, I'm joking.
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:12.940]   - You're hoping you're joking.
[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:15.020]   - Completely joking, I have no idea.
[01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:19.380]   Now you know, why?
[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:23.180]   It says 20% time, oh no, that's Google, nevermind.
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:26.420]   - Oh, that's cute though, look at the little Reddit guy.
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:28.940]   - Yeah, that's pretty impressive.
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:31.580]   That's pretty cool.
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:34.380]   Engineers have to have some doubt time.
[01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:36.300]   Everybody has to have some doubt time.
[01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:40.580]   Let's see, a couple of other quick stories
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:42.340]   before we go to break.
[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:46.740]   Ibeacon, this is an example of a technology that Apple owns.
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:48.820]   Bluetooth LE is of course not Apple specific,
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:51.060]   but they just knocked it out of the park with Ibeacon.
[01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:52.860]   And I hope it's not another one of those things
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:54.860]   where Apple just has this brilliant thing
[01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:58.180]   that never, and then he never capitalized on it.
[01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:01.780]   CES is doing an Ibeacon scavenger hunt.
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:06.700]   Now this would be one reason I think to go to CES.
[01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:11.660]   Using Apple's Ibeacon, you'd have to use the CES mobile app.
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:14.420]   I guess it says you could use it on Android
[01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:17.660]   and then they're using the Ibeacon development kit
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:22.380]   from Radius Networks and Texas Instruments SensorTags.
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:25.140]   And then you wander around the floor
[01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:28.860]   and I guess you'll be notified as you get closer
[01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:33.860]   and you'll add to your book of stamps or something.
[01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:38.460]   Macy's has already got plans for Ibeacon's Qualcomm
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:41.540]   is doing their own Ibeacon like thing.
[01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:44.340]   They're calling it, I don't know what they're calling it,
[01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:46.580]   something else, not Ibeacon.
[01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:49.460]   Apple owns this though because every Apple device
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:53.820]   since the 4S is a beakener as well as a beak and E.
[01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:57.820]   - Yes, so the beak and technology,
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:59.740]   I did a lot of research on it when I saw it
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:03.500]   on sort of Apple's slide when they were previewing iOS 7
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:06.060]   and it's based off of something that's been built
[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:10.020]   into Bluetooth Smart and is available to I think
[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:14.220]   quite a lot of devices that are using sort of the LE technology.
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:16.980]   And what Apple's really done is kind of build a framework
[01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:21.980]   for it that allows developers to tap into that technology
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:25.940]   and use LE devices as basically as Ibeacons.
[01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:30.340]   It's very hard to kind of explain the technology
[01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:33.660]   'cause it's still so, it's in vitro almost,
[01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:36.780]   it's very new and people aren't really sure
[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:39.820]   what to use it for other than, oh, well, maybe we'll put it
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:43.420]   in malls and it'll allow people to find their favorite stores
[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:45.500]   or get a prized of deals.
[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:48.820]   Kind of like what Passbook does for like Starbucks
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:50.300]   or something like that.
[01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:53.540]   But there could be, there are a lot of,
[01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:57.180]   a lot more ways to use this, I think,
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:01.660]   rather than just your average, put it in a store window
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:04.580]   and hope that it attracts new customers.
[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:08.220]   - Company called In Markets using it for coupons
[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:12.820]   so that you, so this guy said, I wanna get pasta sauce.
[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:14.500]   Oops, (laughs)
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:19.180]   I mean, he did, but he goes by a rack in a store
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:21.820]   and it says, hey, here's a coupon.
[01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:25.020]   It's for something that's already on your shopping list
[01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:28.220]   if you use their shopping list app, things like that.
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:32.500]   I think that's, I agree, and of course you're gonna first
[01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:34.980]   see the e-commerce or the, not e-commerce,
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:37.140]   real world commerce applications this,
[01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:40.540]   but there's so much potential here
[01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:43.100]   and I just hope Apple can capitalize on this frankly.
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:45.860]   - You know, the problem is is that this is a technology
[01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:49.180]   that ultimately isn't in Apple's hands in my opinion.
[01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:51.580]   The problem here is this is in the hands of developers
[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:53.380]   and marketers and the people implementing it.
[01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:56.980]   It's an execution problem and we've seen this issue
[01:27:56.980 --> 01:28:01.980]   with QR codes and NFC on other devices and things like that.
[01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:04.660]   And so I think those technologies live and die
[01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:07.980]   by how they are used by people
[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:10.620]   and it can be either really useful and great
[01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:13.620]   in life changing or it can end up being really annoying
[01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:15.260]   and just turn consumers off.
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:19.460]   So the next, this year is gonna prove whether or not
[01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:21.020]   this is a technology that's gonna fly
[01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:23.020]   with end users and consumers.
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:24.300]   So far there's been good buzz,
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:26.700]   but I think it's 'cause it's the new whiz-bang thing.
[01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:29.860]   We had a lot of that with NFC a year, a few years ago
[01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:31.220]   and that, where did that end up?
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:33.540]   It really didn't go very far.
[01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:37.420]   - Well, Apple though does have some control of it
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:40.700]   because they can be the market maker in effect,
[01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:43.220]   but they have to reach out to all these people
[01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:46.220]   and create alliances and create deals.
[01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:48.460]   - Yeah, and unfortunately for me,
[01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:51.220]   I was not impressed by Apple's first own foray
[01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:53.020]   into IB Kins if you've been it to
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:54.460]   'cause they have them in the Apple retail stores
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:55.780]   and if you've gone into use that system,
[01:28:55.780 --> 01:28:57.100]   I went to try it out.
[01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:58.500]   I think the Friday after it was released,
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.540]   I haven't been back to see if they've improved things,
[01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:03.580]   but I was generally not impressed
[01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:05.020]   with the application of it.
[01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:07.260]   It wasn't that the technology wasn't cool.
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:09.980]   It's just that they only had it in the accessories area.
[01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:12.140]   It kind of alerted me multiple times
[01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:13.780]   when I had already seen the same alert,
[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:15.620]   got a little bit annoying.
[01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:18.060]   They have to be smarter about how they implement it
[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:19.700]   and especially in their own retail stores,
[01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:21.100]   if they're showing off the technology
[01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:22.500]   and trying to get others to buy into it
[01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:25.300]   and trying to get consumers to accept it,
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:26.660]   they have a real opportunity
[01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:29.220]   and I don't think they fully execute it on that.
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:31.700]   Again, I don't know if they were just rushing it out
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:34.500]   to get out there for the holiday season or what,
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:37.820]   but I think time's going to tell them on the whole Ibikin thing.
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:41.340]   - Surrounding, I'm impressed because we all saw that slide
[01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:44.500]   and you picked up on it and you said, "Hey."
[01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:49.380]   - So one of my hobbies at Macworld
[01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:51.420]   is going through those little tiny slides
[01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:54.580]   and figuring out what every single thing relates to
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:56.420]   that's public knowledge
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:30:00.580]   and then whipping them up into articles on 27 things
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:04.460]   that Apple may have noted very smally in the keynote.
[01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:06.680]   that are actually potentially really cool.
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:09.880]   - Good hobby. - So yeah, it's really fun.
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:13.980]   It gets me away from just having to re-roll the clips.
[01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:17.420]   - It's called reporting, it's called enterprise journalism.
[01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:18.680]   - Nah.
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:19.960]   - I'm impressed.
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:22.680]   - But yeah.
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:27.160]   - So what's your conclusion, is Apple doing what it needs
[01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:30.980]   to do to make eye beacon, what it could be or will they?
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:32.400]   - TBD I think.
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:35.840]   Honestly, we, as you were saying,
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:39.000]   we really just haven't seen a lot of it yet.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.200]   And I would really, I would like to see more
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:44.440]   of what Apple's planning beyond sort of limited retail
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:45.680]   integration.
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:49.520]   It's like past books early days in, what's that, as iOS?
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:50.520]   - But there's an example of something
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:52.440]   that just really hasn't gone anywhere.
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:54.440]   - Yeah, it's, I mean, there are some nice things.
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:56.520]   You know what, I really enjoy being able to fly
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:59.080]   Virgin America and not take out a boarding pass.
[01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:00.800]   Like it's little simple pleasures like that,
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:03.280]   but the Starbucks card, I don't really find myself
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:04.480]   using that all that much.
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:08.480]   And the other integrations I'm kind of bored by.
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:12.080]   So again, does Apple have enough time to be pursuing
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:13.360]   all of these little things?
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.640]   And will they give it the time that it deserves?
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:16.680]   We just don't know.
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:21.400]   - I think we can guess.
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:22.760]   (laughing)
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:23.680]   It's sad to say.
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:27.280]   - Unfortunately history sort of dictates.
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:28.520]   - I don't wanna think that way.
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:30.760]   - Wasn't FaceTime supposed to be an open standard?
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:31.600]   - I don't wanna think that way.
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.160]   - I don't wanna think that way.
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:34.000]   (laughing)
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:34.840]   - Really bad.
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:36.560]   - Hey, we're having some fun.
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:37.400]   It's so nice to have you.
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:38.960]   Serenity Caldwell, great to talk to you again.
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:40.080]   Every time you're on, I'm thinking,
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:41.600]   God, I should have it on more often.
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:42.800]   Please come back more often.
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:46.040]   Are you, you're on the incomparable a lot on a five by five?
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:48.520]   I know, but you're not a automatic regular on that.
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:49.360]   Or is that?
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.200]   - I'm one of the first, yeah.
[01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:54.480]   So I think I rate slightly lower than Dan Morin
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:56.120]   and Scott McNulty.
[01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:57.440]   (laughing)
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:58.800]   But a lot of that is just time.
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:00.040]   I do a lot of different things.
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.400]   So it's hard to kind of fit my schedules
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:03.240]   so I can be on everything.
[01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:06.280]   But we just did a radio play episode, which I directed.
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.280]   - No, you directed that, yeah.
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.120]   - I did.
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:10.880]   With help from Jason and David,
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:12.080]   they did a couple of skits.
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:13.160]   But that's sort of--
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.000]   - That was the Christmas thing you did, yeah?
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.440]   - It was, yeah.
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:17.200]   It was a lot of fun.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:20.800]   - Everybody must go to fivebyfive.tv
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:23.320]   incomparable, is it slash incomparable or?
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:24.720]   - The incomparable, I believe.
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:25.560]   - The incomparable.
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:26.400]   - Yes.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:28.800]   - And listen to the radio play.
[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:29.920]   Pretty impressive.
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:34.760]   Jason, what am I saying?
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:36.040]   Adam, what's your name?
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:37.920]   Adam, Adam Christensen.
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:38.760]   I don't know why.
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:39.600]   - And not angst.
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.440]   - Not angst.
[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:42.440]   'Cause I call you Adam angst.
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:44.080]   Say I didn't do that.
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:44.920]   - Man.
[01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:45.760]   - Slap me around.
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:48.360]   - That would not be a bad person to be called.
[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:49.840]   - I love Adam angst.
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:50.840]   - He's a great guy.
[01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:51.680]   - I do.
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:54.200]   There's two big atoms in the Mac world.
[01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:55.720]   You and angst.
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:57.400]   Christensen and angst.
[01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:58.240]   It's great to have you.
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:59.240]   - It's great to take a break when we come back.
[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.760]   If you guys have pics, I would love to hear them.
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:03.440]   And one thing we definitely wanna know
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:06.600]   is what the hell is that clock behind you?
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:08.000]   - Yeah, everybody asks about that clock.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.480]   I don't know, it was a gift from my mom
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:10.960]   for Mother's Day.
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:11.800]   The thing is--
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:13.600]   - It's totally awesome.
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:14.720]   - Yeah, everybody loves it.
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:16.280]   I think you can find it on Amazon,
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:17.320]   it's some obscure thing.
[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:19.520]   I mean, it's not, you know, it's something like,
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:21.400]   came out of like a Spencer's or something.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:23.040]   I have no idea where she got it.
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:25.440]   But the funny thing is, is that it's totally fake.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.960]   The pendulum is actually controlled
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:30.120]   by a separate battery from the clock.
[01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:33.480]   So it probably doesn't even, a lot of people have asked,
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:35.080]   and I think people have even timed it
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:37.880]   to see if it actually is keeping true time.
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:38.720]   It probably is not.
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:39.560]   - It's not doing anything.
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:41.080]   It's just waggling, huh?
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:43.160]   - Yeah, it's a kinetic sculpture.
[01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:44.920]   - That's beautiful.
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:45.760]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:48.160]   When we come back, our pics of the week,
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:50.120]   as we wrap up this week's Mac Break Weekly,
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:53.160]   our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.com.
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:56.040]   If you're looking for high quality,
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:34:00.000]   stock photo royalty free images, not just images,
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.120]   vectors, vector illustrations, video clips,
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:05.960]   you gotta go to Shutterstock.com.
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:10.600]   Shutterstock is an incredible place
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:12.440]   for finding that perfect image
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:14.480]   for your next creative project,
[01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:17.480]   whether it's for your website, a publication,
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:20.820]   an advertisement, a video, any other kind of project.
[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:24.040]   One of the things I love about Shutterstock
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.320]   is their incredible search engine.
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:29.200]   This is, it's funny, I guess this is something hard to do.
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:31.000]   A lot of websites, the search ain't so great.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.400]   Shutterstock, not only can you search for nouns, you know,
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:37.360]   like, what did you search for?
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:41.240]   Not only can you search for nouns like iPad,
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:43.960]   you can search for a noun modified by a verb,
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:46.840]   like mad iPads, and you can get an image
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:48.800]   of somebody who's mad at her iPad.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.560]   See, you need that.
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:52.040]   If you're looking for just the right image,
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:54.080]   the ability to search through these images,
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:56.240]   and frankly you have to, with 20,
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:57.880]   let me, it's more than 28 million,
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:02.880]   now it's over 30 million, 32 million, 389,654,
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:05.040]   royalty free stock images.
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:09.880]   They're adding now 170,000 images every week.
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:13.480]   So every time you visit, there's something new.
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:15.600]   Most of the contributors are professional photographers
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:19.560]   and artists, every image is curated for content and quality.
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:21.000]   You could choose individual image packs
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.160]   or get a monthly subscription.
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:26.000]   A lot of publications, including us, do subscriptions.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.800]   We have a 25 image a day subscription,
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:29.160]   which is fantastic.
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:32.760]   You could download images in any size,
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:35.520]   pay only one price, any image at all.
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:36.880]   The light boxes are great too,
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:39.080]   and by the way, you could create a free shutter stock account
[01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:41.280]   which allows you to save images to your light box,
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:43.880]   share them with colleagues or friends,
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:47.400]   but also keep them around for inspiration or later use.
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.240]   The iPad app is just gorgeous,
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:51.440]   I want a Webby Award for what a,
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:54.200]   I mean it is spectacularly beautiful.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:55.240]   I just could go on and on.
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:57.440]   I do go on and on about shutterstock.com.
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:58.840]   We use them, we encourage you to do them.
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:01.960]   In fact, here's an opportunity for you.
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:04.920]   Here's the shutter, let me just pull up the,
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:06.400]   shutter stock app.
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:09.000]   It's actually such a good app that it's almost like
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.400]   using, you could use this for,
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:15.360]   for just like one of those great photo apps.
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:17.040]   I mean, just gorgeous,
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:19.360]   just gorgeous stuff.
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.680]   These are all lights like featured light boxes,
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:26.680]   Fright and Light, spooky images from shutterstock.com.
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:31.320]   Spiced world, these are all spices, unbelievable.

[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:24.000]   Dino Might.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.040]   We usually end this show, the back of the book,
[01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:29.920]   I like to think of it with our picks of the week.
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:32.120]   I don't know if Serenity, if anybody told you
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:33.840]   that we wanted a pick.
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:34.680]   - That's okay.
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:36.280]   - I'll let you, I remember it.
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:38.520]   - You remembered, I'll let you think.
[01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:39.560]   We'll start with Adam.
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:42.240]   I just wanted to warn you, you're next.
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:43.080]   - All right.
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:45.240]   - Adam, Adam, Adam Anksd.
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:47.440]   Adam Christensen has his pick of the week.
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:48.840]   See, now I did do it.
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:49.680]   - Yeah, you did it.
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:50.520]   That's okay.
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:51.360]   - I'm just teasing you.
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:52.200]   - It's good.
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.040]   (laughs)
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:54.720]   What's your pick this week?
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:56.600]   - I am actually, so we talked about earlier
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:58.560]   the Apple TV and sort of this, you know,
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:01.560]   my opinion that this whole video thing is kind of a mess.
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:05.080]   Well, I have Apple TVs, they're my set top box.
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:08.360]   And I've been in this sort of quasi project
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:10.440]   to try and convert my DVD collection
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:12.200]   into something digital I can get into iTunes.
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:13.600]   I've been putting it into iTunes,
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:14.520]   but everybody kept telling me,
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:16.040]   "Oh, you should try out Plex."
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:19.080]   And then, you know, I saw that Chromecast added Plex support
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:21.800]   and Roku's have Plex and it's this more open system.
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:23.440]   So I started playing around with Plex,
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:27.520]   but my pick isn't Plex because I wanted to get support
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:31.080]   on my Apple TV and there's a great project called Plex Connect
[01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:34.600]   that basically takes over your trailer's app.
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:38.840]   It's a non-Gailbreak sort of hack that you do
[01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:40.200]   for your Apple TV.
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:42.440]   The problem is is that it's really kind of tricky
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:45.200]   to set up, especially because Apple recently changed things
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:48.120]   and made all of the requests coming from your Apple TV
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:49.520]   go over SSL.
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:52.200]   So you need to have like a certificate and you need to create it
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:54.280]   and you got to get it installed on your Apple TV.
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:57.680]   I'm a web developer, so it wasn't too hard for me to do that.
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:00.440]   But I also found a project over on the Plex forums
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:03.760]   called Plexify, which is a little app that you can install
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:06.520]   that basically does the whole process for you.
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:11.040]   So I'm picking Plexify for Plex Connect and it's a little
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.200]   menu bar app and it takes care of generating the SSL
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:17.120]   certificate for you, getting it installed on your Apple TV,
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:20.520]   walks you through the steps of reconfiguring your Apple TV.
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:24.000]   Basically what you do is you proxy the Apple trailers
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.800]   requests through your Mac or through some other computer
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:30.040]   and then what it does is it hijacks those
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:33.000]   and sends back to the Apple TV rather than the trailer data,
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.560]   your Plex media server data.
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:37.800]   So you can browse your Plex media server and access all of your
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:41.280]   Plex content from your Apple TV and it actually works surprisingly
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:41.920]   well.
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:45.040]   So it's Plex, Plex Connect and then you need Plexify is just
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:47.880]   for configuring, setting it up and also starting, you have to
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:50.080]   start the Plex Connect server software.
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.840]   So it'll handle starting and stopping that for you too.
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:54.520]   So you don't have to get in and use command line.
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:58.040]   It's basically a GUI for using Plex Connect.
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:01.920]   So pretty geeky and technical, but it's pretty cool to see how
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:06.400]   it all works out and that makes it much simpler for those people
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:08.920]   who aren't like me and don't want to live life in the command
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:12.280]   line with Python scripts.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:14.040]   >> No jailbreak required.
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:15.800]   >> No jailbreak required, which is amazing.
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:16.920]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:18.160]   >> Yeah, I love Plex.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:21.120]   I think it is a great piece of software.
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:26.120]   >> I think there's pretty much universal support for Plex.
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:29.560]   >> Yeah, it's showing up everywhere, which is what private
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:33.000]   media want to move things over to that because now I don't
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:33.920]   have to worry.
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:34.920]   I can get out on my--
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:37.120]   and what's great is the Plex app on your iOS device.
[01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:39.800]   If you connect it to their service so that they can have
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:43.240]   the phone home, find your server thing, I can access all
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:46.680]   of my media content from any place that I have in internet
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:47.120]   connection.
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:48.000]   I can stream it.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.200]   And if you pay for their--
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:51.640]   they have a little upgrade service, you can actually pay
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:53.040]   to sync it over to your devices.
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:56.160]   So you can sync directly from your Plex server and download
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:56.840]   a local copy.
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:58.800]   So if I'm in the airport, I'm going to get on a plane.
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:02.560]   If I want to grab a movie, I can do that right out of my
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.960]   Plex server at home, which is really cool.
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:06.240]   So I just started playing around with it.
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:08.400]   I know people are huge fans of this.
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:10.920]   I'm just starting the fandom.
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:12.880]   I had tried Plex way back when and it was kind of
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:15.880]   complicated and clunky, but it's come a really long way.
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:17.080]   >> It's gotten much better.
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:18.120]   I'm really happy.
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:21.080]   My personal favorite feature is not only do you have this
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:24.840]   lovely server, but you can share it to other people.
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:29.520]   So I have some British friends who will download all of their
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:32.920]   British television from their DVR and say, all right, you want
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:35.320]   to see Downton Abbey a full year before it's ever going to
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:36.960]   show up on the DCA?
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:38.120]   Here you go.
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:39.760]   >> Oh, that's just not right.
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:41.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:42.920]   >> I know.
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:44.600]   >> You're cheating.
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:47.680]   Well, but something that I've always loved about having my
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:50.920]   physical DVD collection is I share DVDs with friends all
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:51.760]   the time, right?
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:53.640]   And you really don't have any capacity to do this.
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:56.800]   Well, Plex kind of makes that experience available too.
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:00.480]   I was buying more and more stuff on iTunes and I think
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:02.440]   that's really convenient and easy for me because I live in
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:06.040]   that ecosystem, but I started to realize, yeah, you know what?
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:08.120]   I can't share my content anymore with people.
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:11.200]   And that's kind of something we as humans want to do, right?
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.320]   Hey, have you seen this movie?
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:13.400]   It's really great.
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:17.600]   Oh, I can't let you borrow it because it's locked down.
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:20.040]   >> Every once in a while there's a technology that just seems
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:22.360]   like everybody I know agrees on.
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:23.360]   And Plex is one of them.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:25.480]   Just everybody says, yeah, that's it.
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:27.480]   And you're right, it's a little complex at first, but you
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:30.360]   put your dip your toe in the water and you get deeper and
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:31.440]   deeper into the Plex.
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:35.000]   >> Well, and things like Plexify make this setup process a
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.120]   lot easier for people.
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:37.400]   >> So cool.
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:39.280]   >> And the only reason I wouldn't do that down nabby
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:41.200]   thing is I don't know if I could keep my lips sealed for a
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:42.200]   year.
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:43.200]   How do you do that?
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:44.200]   >> It's been very hard.
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:45.000]   >> Yeah.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.320]   >> You just, I watch it with Dan Morin, so we have somebody
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.000]   to talk to about things.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.120]   And then when all of my friends started watching this
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:56.200]   season of Dan Nabby, I've had to be very good on this.
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:57.200]   >> Don't know this.
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:05.000]   >> And you cannot say anything.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.440]   >> What's your pick, serenity?
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:10.920]   >> My pick is a great little iOS app that I found I think a
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:14.960]   week or two ago because Apple was featuring it called Sky Guide.
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:19.640]   So I'd use Starwalk a lot for Star Gazing and things like that.
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:22.720]   And then I downloaded Sky Guide instinctually because the
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:27.440]   visuals just looked insanely beautiful from the screenshots.
[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:29.760]   And I'm like, all right, you know what, even if the data in
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:33.680]   this isn't this good, I'm gonna, I'll go for it.
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:38.200]   And not only is the data excellent, but the visuals and the
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:43.360]   combination of the time delay and being able to, it has, it's
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:45.640]   integrated with your compass so you can find, you know, of
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:50.280]   course, where you are in the sky and it has a HDR setting where
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:54.120]   you take two fingers, you can scroll up and down to increase or
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:56.360]   decrease the amount of stars in your area.
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:59.840]   So you can get an accurate position of what you're actually
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:01.480]   looking at, you know, I'm in Boston.
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:04.960]   So I don't see that many stars as presented in the app, but I
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:05.600]   can change it.
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:08.120]   So it's like, okay, maybe you're only gonna see this many.
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:11.160]   It's a really, really nice app.
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:15.520]   I have just been enjoying it so much even when, you know,
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:18.560]   not actually going outside, just sitting in my room at night
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:22.040]   and being like, he, you know, I can't see any stars, but if I
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:25.720]   could, there's the big dipper up there.
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:29.440]   -Finally, somebody who says room right, by the way, room.
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:31.280]   That is the right-- -I blame it on my Canadian hair.
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:33.000]   -That is the right way to say it.
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000]   I say it that way too.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.720]   I'm from Rhode Island.
[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:37.400]   Room, it's room.
[01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:40.560]   -It is room. -Room.
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:42.520]   -I used to have people who made fun of me about that.
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:45.920]   And the time you see room is physically--
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:47.120]   -It's hard work.
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:48.640]   -Room.
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:49.880]   -Room.
[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:50.320]   It's room.
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:52.880]   -I'll go for the lazy way.
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:54.960]   -Yeah, Star Guy, Sky Guy, rather.
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:57.480]   A Buck 99 boy, does that look gorgeous?
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:58.880]   I can't wait to try that.
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:01.160]   In fact, I just put it on my iPad.
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:01.840]   Very nice.
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:03.000]   And you don't have to go outside.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.440]   You can stay in your room.
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:09.000]   -Exactly, because it's far too chilly outside.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.160]   -Really cool.
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:14.040]   I like the ability to zoom in and more stars or fewer stars,
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:16.240]   because those of us who live in urban areas,
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:18.880]   we don't see all that stuff.
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:21.320]   You've got to be in some middle of nowhere to do that.
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:23.280]   Hey, my pick is something that they just sent me.
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:25.120]   They're selling it at CEF.
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:27.920]   They have a special CES deal on their website,
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:29.680]   which is Hello, Nomad.
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:31.120]   My kids drive me crazy.
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:33.800]   They're always saying, "Dad, you have a lightning cable?
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:36.360]   Can I take a-- my son broke into my house
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:39.520]   and stole my lightning cable the other day."
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:41.800]   He said, "You left the back door open, so I just took it."
[01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:45.200]   -I was like, "I can never find mine."
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:46.400]   -I'm like, "Yes!"
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:48.320]   -I ordered a bunch of Amazon ones, you know,
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:49.760]   and just like, "I get it."
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:51.640]   -So here's one you could put on your key chain.
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:52.640]   How about this?
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:53.520]   Now, it's a little pricey.
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:54.640]   I gotta say that's a disadvantage,
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:56.880]   although they're offering 20% off during CES.
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:58.880]   This is called the Charge Key.
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:00.680]   It has a little thing for your key chain.
[01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:01.440]   There's the lightning.
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:04.040]   It's a real full Apple-approved lightning cable.
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:05.480]   There's the USB plug.
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:07.160]   You will never be without your lightning cable
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:08.920]   if you put that on your key chain.
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:11.160]   So I wish they'd had these for Christmas.
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:12.040]   I would have given them my kids.
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:13.320]   Never again will you--
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:15.280]   Will people steal your lightning cables?
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:19.120]   Or if they do, at least you'll have one.
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:20.840]   -Yeah, you gotta clip that to their backpack
[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:22.320]   or something like that. -Yeah.
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:23.160]   Isn't that great?
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:25.240]   They also make a charge card you could put in your wallet,
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:26.840]   although this seems like a--
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:29.600]   This seems like a-- and it's very compact, very small.
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:31.600]   Literally not bigger than the key.
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:33.440]   Charge Key, they say 25 bucks.
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:36.720]   They also have a micro-USB version for those of you
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:42.120]   who are, for some reason, not using iOS.
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:43.360]   -What's the price? -Huh?
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:44.840]   25 bucks. That's too much.
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:45.720]   I know.
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:47.840]   Although-- -That's not bad at all.
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:48.880]   They gotta pay Apple.
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:50.400]   They're a little Apple-fig. -I can't even know.
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:51.720]   Yeah.
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:54.320]   And I think it's 20% off right now.
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:56.520]   If you go to their website, you have to like them.
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:59.000]   You know what I did is I followed them on Tumblr.
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.200]   Nobody cares about that.
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:02.200]   Some follow.
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:04.000]   I'm not gonna like them, 'cause you like something
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.560]   on Facebook, you never hear the end of it.
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:11.600]   But I tumbled them, and I get 20% off.
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:13.080]   Boy, what fun.
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:15.400]   I don't know why we don't have you on every week's serenity.
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:18.080]   It's really-- probably 'cause you do so many things.
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:19.280]   Such a-- -You're too kind.
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:21.120]   Such an impressive person.
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:22.320]   But it's so good to have you on.
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:23.000]   Thank you so much.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.800]   You could follow serenity, of course, at macworld.com,
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:27.480]   where she's an associate editor.
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:28.520]   Anything else you wanna plug?
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:32.040]   You got any movies coming out, or TV shows,
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:35.120]   new radio plays you'd like to tell people about?
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:36.800]   Maybe radio plays come in soon.
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:39.640]   I would definitely tell people to go take a gander
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:41.320]   at the Christmas episode, 'cause I think that's some
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:43.400]   of our finest work that we've been--
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:45.120]   We're hoping to do more soon.
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:47.160]   You know, it's funny, I share the same interest.
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:49.800]   I-- I-- when we got this studio, I thought, gosh,
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:52.680]   I would like to do a Friday table read every--
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:53.960]   every Friday.
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:55.080]   It'd be so much fun, wouldn't it?
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:57.720]   The issue is scripts.
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:47:59.040]   We are very, very lucky.
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:03.720]   David Lour, who started as just a fan of "The Encomparable,"
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:05.480]   and we just started talking to him a lot,
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:08.880]   'cause we have mutual friends in the theater industry.
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:13.080]   He just is prolific, insanely prolific.
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:16.480]   Sent as-- I mean, the Christmas special was 95 pages,
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:19.200]   and he turned that a lot, I'd say, in a month and a half.
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:21.920]   He's just-- he's so good at writing these crazy scripts
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:25.520]   that are not quite parodies, and not quite completely original
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:29.000]   works, but these-- this wonderful mesh of, like, things--
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.640]   scripts that are true-hearted, and you really enjoy both reading
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:36.640]   and listening to, but also have a bit of, you know,
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:39.160]   nod to the Twilight Zone, or nod to Doctor Who,
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:42.760]   nod to Old Westerns, and nod to Indiana Jones.
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:44.920]   It's just-- it's very-- so much fun.
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:45.920]   He's such a good writer.
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:47.960]   We're very, very lucky to have him.
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:51.160]   It's called "The Encomparable," Jason Snell hosts.
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:53.440]   Serenity's a regular along with Dan Morin and others
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:58.920]   from the Macworld and-- and Life, winner of the 2012 Parsek
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:00.160]   Award.
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:01.600]   That's true.
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:06.160]   I have a little tiny statue on my mantle to prove it.
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:08.760]   And just-- we should have you back soon.
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:10.440]   Somebody suggested our next show is coming up
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:11.440]   in a minute, "Security Now."
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:14.520]   We should do a show with Serenity called Serenity Now.
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:17.440]   I think that would be a good show.
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:18.000]   Anyway, sorry.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000]   This as long as I get to be.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.080]   You could be-- you don't have to be Seren.
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:24.240]   The rest of us will be.
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:25.200]   Thank you, Serenity.
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:28.280]   And thank you also, Adam Christensen, MacCast.com,
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:31.880]   one of the longest standing and still the best Mac podcasts.
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:34.920]   If you like Mac Breakly Weekly, you must listen to MacCast.
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:35.480]   Thank you.
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:37.240]   Macreciatecast.com.
[01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:38.640]   Always a pleasure.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:39.160]   You and your--
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:40.000]   Thanks for having me.
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.200]   --wobbly clock that doesn't tell the time.
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:44.560]   Can I plug one other thing real quick?
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:45.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:48.480]   Because I have a side project I worked on with a friend.
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:50.080]   And I hesitate to do it because I'm
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:51.440]   afraid you're going to bring down our server
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:53.480]   because I'm doing the surfacing.
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:56.680]   But we did a social-- a social iPhone discovery
[01:49:56.680 --> 01:49:59.760]   app called Appler at getappler.com.
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:01.240]   If people want to check that out.
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:05.320]   And the idea was we were both frustrated by trying to find apps.
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:07.800]   And the way we all find apps is through our friends.
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:08.440]   What did you get?
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:08.960]   What did you get?
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:09.600]   What do you think?
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:12.400]   And so we can see the ability to go on.
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:15.000]   It will scan your purchase library
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.840]   and pull in all your apps for you.
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:19.520]   And then you can rate and say, yeah, this one's good.
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:21.280]   This one's so, so no, I don't like this one.
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:23.680]   And then you can comment and you can have threaded conversations
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:24.400]   around your apps.
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:26.160]   But with your friends--
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:28.560]   this is really sweet.
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:29.680]   So it's not an app.
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:30.920]   It's a website.
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:31.600]   It's a website.
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:33.920]   And it's optimized for iOS.
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:35.720]   He just went through a process of optimizing it
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:36.920]   for mobile devices.
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.120]   So it is mobile optimized.
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:40.720]   You can save it to your home screen, all that fun stuff.
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:42.840]   But a little side project and we're
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:43.960]   trying to get it going.
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:46.360]   And I find it incredibly useful.
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:48.920]   I find a lot of my apps now through that
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:50.760]   because I can look and see what my friends bought.
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:52.240]   And they don't even have to have to tell me.
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:53.480]   And if I have a question about it,
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:56.120]   I can shoot them a little message, hey, why do you like this?
[01:50:56.120 --> 01:51:00.120]   That's definitely the best way to do it.
[01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:04.120]   Because mechanical app recommendation engines just suck.
[01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:04.600]   Yep.
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:07.520]   And humans don't.
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:09.640]   Humans suck less.
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:14.760]   So getapplerapplr.com.
[01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:15.000]   You know what?
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.440]   The other one worked too.
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:17.920]   The web 2.0 spelling.
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:19.040]   Yeah.
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:19.880]   There's no e in applet.
[01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:20.720]   No vowels.
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:21.800]   No vowels.
[01:51:21.800 --> 01:51:22.360]   Just the--
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:23.200]   Except for the a.
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:23.680]   Yeah.
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:25.720]   That's why the rule doesn't work.
[01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:29.120]   Actually, they cleverly registered both versions.
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:31.040]   Smart move.
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:31.720]   Thank you, Adam.
[01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:32.800]   I like it.
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:33.920]   That should have been your pick.
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:36.640]   You're allowed to pick your own thing.
[01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:37.880]   Well, this isn't really mine.
[01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:38.560]   This is a friend of mine.
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:40.720]   I've helped out a little bit with some of the programming
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:41.720]   and stuff like that.
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:43.800]   So now we'll see how the server holds up.
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:46.240]   It's been training a little bit already.
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:49.080]   It's impressive because usually we just kill servers,
[01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:50.360]   like instantly.
[01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:51.920]   Instantly.
[01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:53.360]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:54.280]   We do Mac break weekly.
[01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:58.000]   This is still at Tuesdays at 11 a.m. Pacific.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.080]   A lot of the shows are moving, but not Mac break weekly, baby.
[01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:03.760]   Tuesdays, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time,
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:05.120]   1900 UTC.
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:07.840]   If you want to watch live, we love it if you do.
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:08.840]   You can be in the chat room.
[01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:11.440]   We obviously pay a lot of attention to the chat room.
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:13.760]   But if you can't watch live on-demand versions
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:16.560]   of all of our shows, always available after the fact
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:18.720]   that our website, twit.tv--
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:21.520]   in this case, twit.tv/mbw.
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:22.200]   You've got audio.
[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:24.240]   You've got video.
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:26.880]   Or just go to iTunes or wherever you get your podcast,
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:29.920]   your netcasts, and subscribe so you get every episode.
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:32.640]   I think Andy and Renee will be back next week.
[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:35.000]   They might be a little tired.
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000]   They might sound a little bit like this.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.160]   But they will be here.
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:40.160]   And we will have Serenity and Adam back real soon,
[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:41.400]   because you guys are great.
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:42.360]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:43.000]   We'll see you next time.
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.200]   Now back to work 'cause break time is over.
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:49.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:52.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:55.500]   (upbeat music)
[01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:57.500]   You
