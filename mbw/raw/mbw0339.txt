[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.700]   Joining me right now from Baston, the Chicago Sun
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.700]   Times, that's confusing.
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.200]   Mr. Andy and Akko of the celestial waste of ban with hello,
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.600]   Andy.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.000]   Hello and the mighty Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.500]   Let's let's do buzz marketing wherever we can mighty Chicago
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.200]   Sun Times, the bright one.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.400]   I don't know if there's losing less.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.900]   That's slow.
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.700]   Is that the slogan?
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.900]   That was the slogan.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.100]   It sounds like a radio station, the bright one.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.700]   Also good one for toothpaste.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.500]   It's I think that you if you if you go from the dollar bin
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.600]   for for slogan, so you have a lot to pick from there.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.000]   I got my I got my slogans at the dollar bin also with this
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.700]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.100]   Nice to see you with a picture of a you and a goat.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.300]   Have you ever heard the goats?
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.700]   Is this the human voice?
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.700]   Yeah, the go screening goats.
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.000]   I was going to I was there was a something before I'm sure
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Chad could insert that at some point.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.900]   Yeah, we had just yeah.
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.900]   We had just as a new.
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.500]   We're thinking of doing a and and then welcome.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.700]   Nice to see you.
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.000]   Renee Richie from i'm more.com.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.700]   Good to see you from snowy Montreal.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.700]   Absolutely.
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.200]   I have no son nor no goats.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.200]   It's just snow everywhere.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.100]   I have a vault.
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.300]   You might have goats that could be buried under the snow.
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.900]   You hear an occasional muffled by and that's a lot of spring
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.100]   comes and there's goats.
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.600]   So it was a sound effect for when Andy was talking about
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.700]   beard and and I didn't get it up.
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.900]   I didn't get it up in system.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.100]   I know I was going to show it to you and then have you play it.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.100]   It's a it was all been always screaming goats on YouTube.
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.800]   It all made sense before the show started.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.100]   I wasn't going to talk about it.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.700]   Is that it?
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.200]   You want to anyone talking about neighbors complaining about the
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.800]   sound.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:58.600]   Do not buy that goat.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   Whatever that is.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.800]   What kind of goat is that?
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.800]   What are those kids doing down there?
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.300]   A lot of go.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.600]   Oh, you know, unless you're trying to fabricate an ironclad
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.000]   alibi for something absolutely horrible you're planning for
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.100]   six weeks in the future.
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.900]   It's the goats.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.200]   It's like there's a goat in my basement.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.600]   That was my thought of the sound of someone trying to pull all your
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.200]   facial hair.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.000]   You just you just don't want to be like.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.400]   Apparently there's many of these.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.400]   Yeah, there's a whole like there's like a whole long thing of them.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.200]   And then someone mixed it into a Taylor Swift song.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.100]   Yes.
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.400]   Oh, now that I've been intrigued by now.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.100]   You got to play it.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.300]   Dad, yeah, let me play it.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.300]   Is it Taylor Swift?
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.600]   I just say it's a Swift song.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.500]   Is they making it sound like Taylor's?
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.600]   No, it's kind of no.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.000]   I don't know.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.600]   It got posted.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.200]   I don't know.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.000]   I don't know what a Taylor Swift.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.500]   Taylor Swift goat scream.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.100]   That's the.
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.600]   That's the.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.600]   I know that sounds really bad.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.300]   I know that sounds really bad.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.500]   But apparently there's a we'll be the weezer goat scream as well.
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.200]   The weezer one is really funny.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.500]   That's the one that I know about.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.900]   Of course, you know, we're thinking of doing it now.
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.100]   I increasingly want to do this and Chad, I think you have to be a part of it.
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.400]   A YouTube like, you know, talk soup for YouTube.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.800]   Some people must do that, right?
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.300]   Yeah.
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.600]   I just think it'd be fun to have like in between.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.300]   You guys see the video.
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:37.100]   I don't know why that's funny.
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.400]   Yeah, here's all I can say is that we work hard on this show.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.200]   We work hard on the show.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.900]   And how many years do we get on YouTube?
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.700]   Like, you know, thousands, you know, but two thousand three thousand.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.200]   Kind of barely.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.700]   There's fun.
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.200]   Jovi.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.900]   There's like whoever's got the screaming goat just is sticking it everywhere.
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.600]   Oh, and we're not even talking about the whole.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.600]   I knew you were a goat when you walked in.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.400]   Actually, the goat screams better than I do.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.200]   I think that's the new that's the new.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.600]   Well, what?
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.000]   That's the new Wilhelm scream.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.500]   Yep.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.600]   What's Wilhelm scream?
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.500]   I'm going to I'm going to use that.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.800]   Oh, you know, oh, okay.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.900]   Oh, the Wilhelm scream.
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.100]   Right.
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.400]   Right.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.900]   So that's going to be.
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.400]   The screen that's used to movies everywhere.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.000]   From now on, like when I do a movie from now on, it's going to be that goat.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.500]   Yeah.
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.500]   Anyway, sorry.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.900]   Well, Harlem shake.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.900]   We need to do a Harlem shake.
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:19.600]   We did one.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.300]   Oh, you did one.
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.300]   That's so over.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.800]   Get with it.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.800]   See, you get you.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.900]   We need to do a traveling shows so he knows what means.
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.700]   We're still handling a Harlem shake is so two weeks ago.
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.400]   There's an amazing race team that are like they're like YouTube celebrities.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.900]   Maybe they didn't make their living on YouTube.
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.800]   And as soon as they were announced on the premiere, like a week ago, I'm thinking, if they're on the amazing race for like 30 days.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:46.100]   By the time they come back, they're not going to know anything about anything happening on YouTube because almost like nine memes in a row.
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.500]   See, that's why we need this show.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.100]   We're taking a Mar weem track it with me and Chad and we'll do it right before.
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.100]   Toy every Sunday.
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.300]   This is the last Harlem shake.
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.800]   You'll ever know this was the best one.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.800]   The washing machine.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.700]   This was awesome.
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.800]   The washing machine is starting to steam.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.600]   It's starting to smoke.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.600]   Somebody's breaking it.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.900]   That's the best.
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:08.700]   Okay.
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.600]   That is the best.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.100]   He throws a brick into the machine's self destructs.
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.800]   You went to Harlem shake.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.100]   That's clever because he how did he know that that would do that?
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.140]   He had to go through my
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.900]   vigorous testing.
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.900]   Several machines gave their lives to make that video.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.200]   That's the problem for production for me is that I'm gone for like two weeks.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.700]   I'm in the hole.
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.100]   You don't even know that I broke the table.
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.300]   Do you?
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.600]   I did.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.200]   I saw the movie.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.300]   Well, that was the Harlem shake.
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.300]   I was getting up.
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:31.800]   I didn't.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.400]   That wasn't to do the Harlem shake.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.100]   And anyway.
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.400]   So.
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.300]   I don't know where to begin here.
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.400]   Apple gets hacked, but it turns out that happened a while ago, like a month ago.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.300]   And and Apple didn't report it till after Facebook and Twitter admitted they got the same act.
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.600]   It was from a.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.500]   Is it Hungarian?
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:57.400]   Easter European site called the iPhone, Deb, Deb esque decaysite.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.100]   Not that that site was a bad site by any means.
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.500]   I thought that we've decided that all the hacking is going on from China.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.600]   Aha.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.100]   One would think.
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.100]   But it turns out this is more like industrial espionage.
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.900]   And while there is some going on from China, it's a mistake.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.900]   You would be mistaken to assume it's all from China.
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.300]   There you have it.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.900]   It's apparently happening all over the place.
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:16.600]   So plays from.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.200]   Because that that site is very popular in search results.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.500]   If you're looking for an iOS problem, it will get that site quite often quite highly ranked.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:30.300]   Now there's a kind of banner on iPhone, Deb, SDK that says iPhone SDK is learned.
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.000]   It was used as part of an attack whose victims included large Internet companies,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Apple, Facebook, Twitter and many others.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.700]   We have no reason to believe user data was compromised,
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.200]   but to be safe, we've reset all passwords.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.400]   So this is very common.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.300]   It's happened to us.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:47.700]   If you have if you're running a content management system or software of any kind on your website,
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:53.100]   that they're an exploit crops up and because there's so many different, you know, modules and things in the.
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:59.800]   We were using some third party Drupal modules that had been exploited and we didn't know we hadn't patched it in time.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.700]   If you don't patch them right away, then somebody gets in and what they do is they don't they're not interest is not in hacking.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.100]   So we have the next one, which one is actually the right one.
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.300]   And they're doing a lot of things.
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.500]   So they're doing a lot of things.
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.500]   So they're doing a lot of things.

[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:07.260]   But nearly 80% of the people that I see on a day-to-day basis doing that stuff, what
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260]   they're doing with it could totally be done on a tablet.
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:13.260]   It goes back to that power versus empowered users where a lot of people who just can't
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.780]   figure out a computer can do incredible things with a tablet because it's so much more accessible.
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.620]   And yes, the applications themselves aren't as powerful, but in some they can get much
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.460]   more out of a device like that.
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:27.180]   It's almost counterintuitive, but the simpler thing lets them do more.
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:30.580]   Well, this is the time on the show when I point out that the iPads and all that secure either.
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:38.540]   The Apple just released iOS 6.1.3 beta 2 to developers to fix a damn lock screen flaw is
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.540]   back.
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.540]   Maps for Japan.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.540]   You got you.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.540]   You got a map for Japan and lock screen fix.
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.780]   The maps for Japan seems to me to be a little misdirection.
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.980]   Oh, yeah, we had to release this to update maps for Japan.
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:50.980]   That's it.
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:51.980]   That's why we updated that.
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:16:02.940]   They drive on the right hand side of the road.
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.780]   So we're this is not out yet.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.780]   You don't have this fix.
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:11.140]   I should point out if you're using an iPhone or an iPad, you don't have this fix and anybody
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:18.980]   can get into it with a not so easy to use apparently a hack from the lock screen.
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.460]   If you use that's if you use the four digit lock.
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:25.660]   If you use the longer lock, you're okay, right?
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:26.660]   Developers can get it now.
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.100]   So if you're if you have a developed a paid developer account with Apple and you're worried
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.100]   about it, you can install beta 2.
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.020]   But what it basically does is puts the and it's the wrong word for it, but it puts the
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:39.020]   iPhone or iPad into a little stroke situation, trying to screenshot and make an emergency
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.460]   call and do so many things at once that it crashes the phone.
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.700]   So the phone is accessible because you have to make emergency calls.
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.060]   So that part of the system is exposed.
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:53.780]   It's not secure and by doing this strange combination of button pushes at the right
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.220]   time in the right sequence, you just create a situation where it's not coping.
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.500]   So it's just dumping you into and it's not everything.
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.300]   You can't access anything beyond the contacts or the phone dialer.
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:08.340]   So nothing that's exposed beyond the emergency calling system anyway, but it is an exploit.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.900]   So and it doesn't affect iPads because there's no dialer on it and yet, but they are offering
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:12.900]   this update for iPad.
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:13.900]   So that was my confusion.
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:18.540]   So you're so there was a confusing article yesterday that said that it would a second
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.940]   there was two versions of this exploit.
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.420]   There are slightly different key combinations.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.420]   Yeah, they said there was another one.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.420]   Same thing.
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.420]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.340]   But and people thought that the second one would give you access to the file system, but
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.100]   it looks like the guy just plugged it into his version of iTunes.
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.380]   And if you've ever authorized an iPhone on iTunes, you have access to the file system.
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.900]   You don't need to put in your passcode.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:36.900]   Stupid.
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:37.900]   Yeah.
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.180]   So that was a bit of a scare.
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:46.100]   But and you I'm sure right about this because you've been doing a lot of evasion coverage.
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:52.620]   It also may be that this 613 breaks evasion, the jailbreak.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.460]   It breaks at least so far one of the five exploits.
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:59.500]   It's getting really complicated to get into iOS devices because they're becoming more
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.500]   and more secure.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.140]   And I believe they needed five different exploits to get evasion working.
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.700]   And this looks like so far it breaks at least one of those.
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.820]   So whether they can code around it or whether they have to think of something else we'll
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.700]   have to see, but that's not the current version.
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.740]   That's the one kind of becoming next.
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:19.580]   He says if this in all in the Forbes, they're talking to Andy Greenberg is talking to David
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:25.140]   Wang, the creator of evasion, he says, if one of the vulnerabilities doesn't work, evasion
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.140]   doesn't work.
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.980]   So it needs them all to work.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:32.380]   He said we could replace that part with a different vulnerability, but Apple will probably
[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.460]   fix most, if not all of the bugs we've used in 613.
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.980]   So Apple is actively it now.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.980]   Okay.
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:39.980]   So here's the question.
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.780]   What's the interesting bugs, whereas Apple actively trying to stop evasion?
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:48.180]   Well, the thing is that evasion is, and you talk with this on security now all the time,
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:51.660]   they're a good guys and they're a bad guys and any exploit that a good guy can use to
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:56.220]   give you a jailbreak and access to the root of your device to do things that you want to
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.940]   do, a bad guy could use to get access to your device and do things you really don't want
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:00.940]   them to do.
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:04.980]   So the minute that these exploits are discovered, it's absolutely Apple's responsibility to patch
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:11.100]   them so that nobody can do anything badly intention or evil with the device.
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:15.580]   The side effect of that is that jailbreak goes away or they have to look for another one.
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:21.740]   In fact, Andy points out that Apple did not move very quickly to blocked evasion because
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:26.260]   it was a relatively low security risk that the tool poses.
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:30.660]   But of course, they're going to fix it, as you said, because it's a security flaw.
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.780]   How do you think, but Apple doesn't like jailbreaking, right?
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:38.020]   It's like a 50, I don't know what they feel about it now, but there was a sense a couple
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.940]   of years ago that it was almost like a playground because Apple doesn't have a, they don't have
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.180]   an open developer beta sort of community.
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:48.020]   You get what Apple's going to release and you can test it, but it's not a two way street.
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:51.740]   And jailbreak let people try out all these different ideas for multitasking and all these
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:56.780]   different ideas for system enhancements that Apple could then, if you look at iOS 4 and
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:02.140]   iOS 5 and iOS 6, there's direct correlations to new features and jailbreak extensions that
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.300]   had done that and tried that first.
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.920]   So maybe on an engineering level, a lot of them, and a lot of jailbreak people have worked
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.540]   at Apple and have left Apple and gone back to Apple.
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:14.540]   So I think there's a respect in the engineering level, but I'm sure from the security standpoint
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.540]   is not their favorite thing.
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.380]   Okay, there it is.
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.380]   There's the story.
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.980]   You should 612 just came out.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.860]   I just got it a couple of days ago, right?
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:25.420]   And now we're waiting for 613.
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.060]   612 does not fix the jailbreak.
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.060]   I mean, don't lose your time.
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.060]   Lock.
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.060]   And it doesn't block the jailbreak.
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.060]   Don't lose your phone.
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.060]   No.
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:37.980]   And if you, but if you said it, if you were worried about that, you can use the more complicated
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.580]   pass phrase, right?
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:44.180]   And that will, that while it's a pain in the ass to unlock it, at least it will protect
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.180]   your phone.
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.180]   Is that right?
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.820]   They need physical access to your phone, which is the other thing.
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:48.820]   Right.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.860]   Yeah, don't lose your phone as Alex said.
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.660]   Don't leave it in a bar.
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:57.580]   Like avoid consumption along which quantity these alcohol in general.
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.580]   That'd be my advice to you.
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:02.460]   Because all Twitter bad things from your account if they find it anyway.
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.860]   All right.
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.340]   Let's, let's take a break.
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.340]   We've got a great panel.
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:11.820]   We're talking about Apple on Mac break weekly with Andy and not go Alex Lindsey Renee Richie
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.460]   or show today brought to you by legal zoom.com.
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.460]   It's not a law firm.
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.460]   Don't confuse this.
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:23.080]   What legal zoom does is it provides self help services so you can do the legal work you
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.580]   need to do at a much reduced cost.
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.660]   I want you to visit legal zoom.com and take a look.
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.300]   They can do, for instance, a will.
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.100]   They can do a trust.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.100]   I love this.
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.100]   In fact, I used it.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:44.300]   They can do an LLC, trademarks, patents, NDAs, protect yourself.
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.860]   If you're a blogger, you shouldn't, you shouldn't forget that, you know, that you're
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:52.420]   investing a lot of time and energy into your name or the name of your blog.
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.420]   Should you protect that?
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.900]   I'd say so.
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:02.260]   If you have a company and you don't have an LLC or a corporation, you should absolutely
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.260]   do that.
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.260]   You know, you could start an LLC at $99.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.340]   I mean, it's not expensive.
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.660]   If as you, and it's just, if you go through the legal zoom check boxes one by one, you
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.980]   if it asks you questions, you answer them and then it actually creates generates a form.
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.900]   But if at any point you go, gosh, I'd like to talk to a lawyer.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.460]   For instance, I did.
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.700]   I said Delaware or California corporation.
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:27.780]   Now I had to pay a lot of money to go out and talk to my lawyer with legal zoom.
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.300]   They now have, they didn't have this at the time.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.540]   An extensive network of attorneys, they have a legal plan.
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.060]   It's available in most states.
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:38.540]   They've got reviews for the attorneys, profiles, unedited customer reviews.
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.740]   So you can pick the attorney at a fixed price.
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.180]   So you could say, California or Delaware, what is the pro and con on that?
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.740]   And get that kind of legal advice as well.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.580]   It's really kind of the ideal best of both worlds.
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:53.540]   In the past 12 years, 2 million Americans have used legal zoom for LLCs, wills, trusts,
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.780]   trademarks and more.
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:55.940]   I invite you to try it.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:01.020]   Visit legal zoom.com and bring your dreams to life.
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.020]   That's their slogan.
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.060]   Good, good fences make good neighbors.
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.060]   Yeah.
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.580]   You know, I try a lot of them.
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.820]   I'm a trusting person, but it's always good to have a document.
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.540]   So it just spells it out.
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.540]   Then there's no question.
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.540]   You know, handshakes fine.
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.980]   I do a lot of handshake deals, but we try to have written documents.
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:20.300]   Then you go, well, let's refer to the document here.
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.380]   Legal zoom will do it for you for much less than you might think.
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.740]   Put your business, protect your family.
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.020]   You do have a will.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.300]   You need one through legal zoom.com.
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.700]   Legal zoom is not a law firm.
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.700]   You can get self help services at your specific direction or speak to a legal plan attorney
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.980]   to get your questions answered and get ongoing advice for a special.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.420]   Thank you for using legal zoom through Mac break weekly.
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:46.060]   Make sure you use MBW in the offer code at checkout and we'll just, we'll just cut $10
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.060]   off.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.700]   It's, I know it's not a huge deal, but it's just a little something to thank you for saying
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:56.380]   MBW when you use legal zoom.com, but it is my strong advice that you, that you check
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:00.260]   out legal zoom and think about what you want to protect.
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:06.620]   Because I hate to say it, but we live in a land where you need this kind of stuff.
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.780]   Legal zoom.com, we thank them for their support.
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:10.820]   I love these touch screens.
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.100]   I can't wait till everybody can get a MacBook with a touch screen.
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.100]   It's just so great.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.340]   You just scroll up and down and touch things and golly.
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.340]   It's so cool.
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:23.500]   Did you see that band yesterday, the myo where it reads the electrical impulses in your arm
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.460]   and uses that to control the elements on the screen?
[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:30.340]   It'll be a great pairing with Google Glass, so then you'll be going.
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.340]   Elbow.
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:32.340]   Elbow.
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:33.340]   Elbow.
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.340]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.340]   That's just what I want.
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:39.460]   People, you're already thinking crazy talking into your Bluetooth headset.
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:42.980]   Now you're touching your glasses, you're lifting your elbow.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.180]   You'll look like a nut ball walking down the street.
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:46.180]   Oh, it's okay.
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.380]   It's just the Google Glass.
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:50.980]   Well, whatever you're going to move your elbow, just make sure you have your Nike fuel man.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.820]   Right, then you get a little extra points.
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:53.820]   You actually get points.
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.740]   Actually, your hands are cheating.
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.180]   Sergey Brin and his wife, what's her name?
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:03.620]   Ann Wojcicki, which I never know how to pronounce it, were at the Vanity Fair Oscars party wearing
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.060]   their Google Glass.
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.060]   And you know what they're trying to do.
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.020]   They're trying to make it cool.
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.300]   Like we're not dorks.
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.300]   It is cool.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.300]   Yeah.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.300]   Is it?
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.300]   Also, they have that.
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:22.980]   They have a program where an application thing where you can lobby them for the gift of being
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.700]   able to purchase Google Glass early for $1,500.
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.340]   You tweet them, but it's fine.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.340]   But it's cost and purchase it.
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:30.340]   Right.
[00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:34.420]   But it's funny because you see, oh, I wonder if I'm going to get it before like Adam Savage
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:38.840]   of Mythbusters who says that I want to wear them on the show and like have Buster's perspective
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.300]   as I'm working on him or.
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:44.100]   Well, I wonder if I wonder if like, you know, if I'm going to get them before like doogie
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:48.340]   how's her gets his because he says you must aware him on his number one rated networks
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.340]   sitcom.
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:54.900]   Like, OK, maybe maybe my idea that I would probably look into a mirror and really nice
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:57.540]   really enjoy having that sort of like infinite mirror.
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.180]   That's not quite as cool for Google marketing purposes.
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.660]   The best one was LeVar Burton, where he put the hashtag and said, for me, it would be
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:05.660]   a downgrade.
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:06.660]   Jordy Lefan.
[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.500]   LeVar is getting one.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.740]   I promise you that.
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:13.900]   Well, the thing is, is that my litmus test is my wife, you know, because, you know, she's
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.700]   not necessarily that techie about.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:16.820]   She wears glasses.
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:17.820]   She does not wear glasses.
[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.300]   So here's a person who doesn't have to wear glasses.
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.820]   She's angry that she did have five years ago.
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:28.420]   Because for her having them kids, for her being able to go, you know, say record this
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:33.780]   and what I'll be really interested to know is what really will blow up with Google Glass
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.940]   is if they put a buffer like a two minute buffer into the into Google Glass where you
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.860]   could turn on a buffer mode, it'll burn the battery up, it'll turn on the buffer mode.
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.740]   So it's recording the last two minutes of your life.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:46.660]   And anytime you say save that, that is that would be good.
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:47.660]   That would be outrageous.
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.820]   Because then you want to wear them all the time because you're sitting there.
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.100]   You don't want to like anytime you're going to something interesting.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.940]   Is there is a big battery right in the back here?
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:56.940]   You have plenty of battery.
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.260]   The battery could go around your head if it wanted to.
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:03.180]   But if you fire it up and have it recorded all the time, it'll be much it won't not through
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.180]   it.
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.180]   Last is that.
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:09.180]   I thought you were saying that have a two minute buffer so that if you say, all right, I'm
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.980]   going to totally murder this half plan.
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:14.020]   And then the guy's going to keep on the cross.
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.220]   Okay, destroy that last two minutes.
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.220]   Please don't.
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.860]   Well, you know, a lot of a lot of make sure that ever goes out.
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.020]   Those Russian car cameras.
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.700]   Yes, Russian dashboard cams.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:23.700]   That's how they work.
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.780]   But just imagine how many if you had a two minute buffer or even a one minute, but really
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.460]   a two minute buffer, just imagine how many things would get captured that you didn't
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:34.700]   think about going up to get and how often you I don't I'm weird all the time.
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:38.340]   It's on the cell phones in the locker rooms here because people were taking and uploading
[00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.340]   illicit pictures.
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.660]   I can't imagine what's going to happen when glass is popular.
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.540]   Yeah, with that little brother thing all over.
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.540]   Good news.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.620]   It's never going to be popular.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.020]   So you don't have to worry.
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.580]   In fact, I love tech crunches article.
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:54.100]   That at least for the first year, it's going to be the one percenters videos of their
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.100]   marvelous life.
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.500]   Here I am in hot air ballooning.
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:02.140]   Oh, yes, we're back at Davos once again, skiing the Alps.
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.140]   What do you think?
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.780]   Because that's who's going to have this thing.
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.100]   It's like iPhone users.
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:13.260]   It's going to be fun when like every attendee of Ted gets that and they're gift bag.
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:17.580]   So Apple's response or Apple's let's not say response.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:20.900]   Let's say their parallel project is the watch, right?
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.420]   Which will be awesome too.
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.100]   Will it be better than glasses?
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.940]   I think it'll be more prevalent.
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:29.860]   Mark, it won't be in your face, which is a huge advantage because some people literally
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:30.860]   how good it is.
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.620]   They don't want something stuck between them in the world all the time.
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:34.620]   Right.
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:40.740]   They'll also likely be let's be cautious, say less than a thousand dollars, certainly less
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:41.740]   than five hundred dollars.
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:46.180]   I bet they're going to aim for something like iPhone like in pricing and that in itself
[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:47.980]   is going to make it more accessible.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.100]   But it's going to be interesting.
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:54.500]   If both of these we know the Google Glass is coming out, we'll have the Apple watch is
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.340]   still just an if just a speculation, speculative product right now.
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:03.460]   But it's interesting if Apple can sell the idea of this as a functional practical item
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:08.220]   as opposed to a stylish Apple gadget because you're still going to have to tell people,
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:12.420]   yeah, well, I know that you don't wear a watch or that you have a watch that you actually
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.700]   like and you buy it because you bought this watch because you like it style.
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:20.620]   But we're telling you that you want to have our watch because otherwise you have to use
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:24.740]   the thing that you already paid a lot of money for and get the same information from there.
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:28.060]   So they would have to, they would really have to do the same thing that like Google's done
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:33.060]   with that video of selling the idea of, look, this is, we know that you can wear a go pro
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.060]   cam.
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.940]   We know that there are even eyeglass cams out there.
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:36.940]   This is better than that.
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.260]   This is a totally different way of interacting with technology.
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.940]   So Apple would really have to sell that.
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:45.220]   They could have a huge success just by saying, hi, this is a cool Apple gadget that's going
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.240]   to, we're going to make you want it because we'll coat it with a special sort of microfiber
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.140]   coating that makes you want things that attacks your brain stem.
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:56.900]   But to make it something that actually changes the way people use technology, that's a huge
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.900]   leap even for Apple.
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:58.900]   But that's what they do.
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:02.660]   I mean, they, people were paying $700 for a Motorola razor and I'm like, it wasn't didn't
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:05.660]   Scott born throw his trio on the ground and stomp on it the minute they introduced the
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:06.660]   iPhone.
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.500]   They are, they are usually very good at telling you why their thing is so much better than
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.460]   even the expensive things you just want.
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.620]   They actually had an idea with the iPhone.
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:18.300]   So I'm sure that I'm sure that every time I say something positive about Apple now, I
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.860]   have to remember this is 2012, not 2009, I'm trying to qualify things.
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.460]   But I am at least reasonably confident that Apple wouldn't do a watch unless they could
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:26.860]   do something unique with it.
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:31.020]   It wouldn't be just be an iPod nana with Bluetooth and a strap on it.
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:35.300]   But it would be, it would be a hill from the crime would be a very impressive achievement
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.500]   if they were to make an actual use case for a digital watch.
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.820]   My watch tells me that there's going to be a full moon tomorrow.
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.720]   How about that?
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:49.780]   How would you feel now, Andy, if I tell you that Apple patented the slap bracelet two
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.780]   years ago?
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.460]   Now, how do you feel?
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:56.480]   I would feel like a lot of girls I went to junior high with are going to have to start
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.980]   ending up money to Apple.
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:58.980]   That's prior.
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:07.380]   There's this long patent about how a watch could have a slap bracelet.
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:14.340]   That's the steel band that has two states, a straight state, or when you hit it on your
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:15.340]   wrist, everybody knows this, right?
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.180]   And it goes around your wrist.
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.180]   I don't know.
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.180]   First of all, know how they could patent it.
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.140]   In Santa Fe, I don't know why they would want it.
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:23.980]   Well, the slap aspect is not what they're patenting.
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.180]   It's like usual, there's a whole bunch of different technology.
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:30.100]   There's stuff, something they did to the slap bracelet to make it more effective.
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:34.620]   Unique communications are facilitated through wireless protocols, though the proposed unit
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:39.300]   also contains wired connectors for sinking and recharging the internal battery.
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.300]   That's what I want.
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.700]   Oh, yeah, yeah, I got on.
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.860]   And again, this is like they applied for this years ago.
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.660]   This was just a show when they're thinking along.
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.660]   I pay no attention.
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.660]   Here's this.
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:49.660]   What Tony's got one.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.060]   Oh, Tony, where'd you get this?
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.060]   This is it's a gazelle.
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.660]   Oh, it's from Gazelle.
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.020]   It's a Gazelle slap bracelet.
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.180]   I will now demonstrate the slap bracelet.
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.660]   Here you see it is in its erect state.
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:01.660]   What?
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.660]   It's not your--
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:04.660]   Ow!
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:10.740]   You slap it, and now it's in a curved, lesser erect state.
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:15.020]   It's always a flaccid, but it's not straight.
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.060]   Now, how do you take it off?
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.060]   You just do that?
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:19.060]   Ow.
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.860]   This could hurt you.
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.460]   Maybe I should ask a teenage girl.
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:28.740]   Go outside of the schoolyardin with your van.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.180]   In my van.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.180]   Great.
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.780]   Anyway, I didn't know Gazelle made these.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:38.340]   Is this part of the deal if you sell something through Gazelle, you get a slap bracelet?
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.340]   Huh?
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.340]   It is?
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.340]   No, CES.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.340]   No, it's CES.
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.340]   Oh, they were handing that to CES.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.340]   Don't do it to your head.
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.340]   Slap headband.
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.340]   Not headband.
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.580]   No, no, Leo, let's put a warning on that.
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.580]   This is not a--
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.580]   This is a big deal.
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:52.780]   They better have used the legal people.
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:57.420]   This is sort of an interesting peek into how exposure to new technology has just broken
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:58.420]   you.
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:01.020]   How many times do you think, ow, it really hurts when I do that, and then you did that
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.020]   again?
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.020]   I keep doing it.
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.020]   Three times, four times in a row?
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:05.020]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.020]   Google blast, baby.
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.780]   Oh, here's a new Windows laptop.
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:09.780]   Ow, wow.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:10.780]   I'm kicking them out to work.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:11.780]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:12.780]   Here's a new Windows tablet.
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:13.780]   Ow.
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:16.500]   I can't tap the touch zones on it.
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.500]   So true.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.500]   So true.
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:22.140]   Apple is-- well, let's-- okay, we'll do a couple more.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:28.140]   Apple's rejecting apps using cookie tracking methods because it wants you to use its cookie
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:33.500]   tracking method, presumably.
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.900]   Mobile app developers using a technology called cookie tracking, sometimes called the
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:44.540]   Safari flip flop or HTML first party cookies are starting to have their apps rejected by
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:50.340]   the app review team, according to tech crunch, Sarah Perez writing yesterday.
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.700]   It's part of a process.
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:55.500]   People were tracking us with UDIDs and then Apple banned that process, and they created
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:59.020]   their own little token that you can use, and that users can turn on and off right in
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:00.020]   the settings of the phone universally.
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.300]   So you don't have to worry about every little app.
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.780]   You can just go in there and they actually assigned an engineer to make this, and you
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:06.780]   can flip it off.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.860]   Apple does have its ad identifier technology, which would be for the same purpose, but
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:10.860]   you can turn it off.
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.220]   Yeah, and it universally.
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:15.380]   So it's much easier to control than if everyone's using a different technology.
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:19.860]   And then they switch to using because Safari has always been good about-- I think for 10
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.220]   years it's been good about blocking third party cookies.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.580]   And now Firefox is doing it as well, so we're making progress.
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:27.700]   But they were using first party cookies to try to get around it.
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:30.060]   And that's sort of violating the spirit of the law, if not the letter.
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.700]   So Apple changed the letter of the law to better reflect it.
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.620]   Slove it, I can pinch to zoom and everything.
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:36.620]   Look at that.
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.620]   Zoom right in on that.
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.620]   Love that.
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:45.500]   And I think Apple obviously has A, a business reason to do that, and B, A, you know, again,
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:49.580]   they're able to-- it's amazing what people are doing with cookie tracking.
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:50.580]   I think this is the right thing.
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.860]   Yeah, I think you have-- you can look at the business case for Apple, but you can also
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:57.620]   just look at-- we just have no idea when you go to a web page.
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:59.820]   You have no idea what they're doing.
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:03.060]   I mean, I'm regularly clearing out my cash because it's just--
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.940]   No, they're doing the right thing, for sure.
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:05.940]   Yeah.
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.900]   There's a thing where you-- all you need is a unique identifier for somebody.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.740]   And a mobile phone number works great as a unique identifier.
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:17.180]   But you-- people start doing customer analytics and consumer analytics based on these things.
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.500]   So if Alex buys diapers and beer, that goes into a database.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.900]   And if he goes to a store and he buys Coke, well, Coke doesn't know he bought it, but the
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.220]   store knows he bought it now.
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.380]   And they can sell that information back to Coke.
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:30.260]   They can sell it to Pepsi as competitive information.
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:33.820]   They can sell it to Lays, you know, to help them market their chips.
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.820]   And it becomes this huge secondary economy.
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:38.140]   And a lot of big companies are moving into that.
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:41.140]   And Apple makes absolutely no money off that kind of data yet.
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:44.380]   So it-- you know, it helps them and hurts their competition at the same time.
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:48.460]   And again, as a user, I just want to be able to know that I could turn one switch and say,
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.700]   "Okay, I don't really want anyone to pass that."
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:51.700]   I like that part.
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:52.700]   I've come around to this.
[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:53.700]   It's the same thing.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:59.380]   And I was very critical of Apple when they blocked 500 PX's apps because-- but now I understand
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.260]   it was a very simple thing.
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:09.220]   500 PX didn't tell Apple in the, you know, code that it was possible to see adult stuff.
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:13.620]   By doing so, they just make it easy for an apparent to go into the settings and say,
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.260]   "Bloc anything that is 17 and over."
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:21.060]   And so it's just a great thing to have a single setting that you could say, "Look, you know,
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:24.540]   I want to see adult stuff, but I don't want my kids to, so I want to be able to turn that
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.540]   off."
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.620]   I do have to point out, though, that that is a kind of a failed system because we've been
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:35.060]   trying to block adult stuff on an iPad that Lisa's 10-year-old uses.
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:41.020]   And you can turn that on, but Google Search still will find-- I mean, it's really hard
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:46.900]   to prevent anybody from entering in sites and going to wild sites.
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:51.700]   So I like the fact that Apple puts this switch in, but I think people should understand.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:52.700]   It's far from perfect.
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:54.340]   Right, there's lots of loopholes.
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.140]   As you'll learn soon when Malachi gets just a--
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.140]   Oh, I've already learned--
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.500]   The third YouTube video is always inappropriate.
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:00.500]   It's the--
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.500]   Exactly right.
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.140]   The third one's always wrong.
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:07.260]   It's the Angry Birds Hole for us because Malachi watches the Angry Birds movies, and
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:11.300]   then he goes from the movies to the YouTube, and then he goes from YouTube to the third
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.300]   one.
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.300]   But YouTube isn't that-- I mean, there's nothing on YouTube that's really awful, is there?
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.620]   No, it's just a lot of swearing.
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.580]   You know, it's mostly that you have a four-year-old who is--
[00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:23.660]   Listen to people screaming obscenities, and then your wife is looking at you like, "Does
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.260]   he really need to use that iPad?"
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.260]   That's the--
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:29.700]   But you must be happy about the fact that-- Go ahead.
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.620]   And even then, it's like, "Yeah, but can you turn off the comments?"
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.060]   Because that's where even the worst of it is.
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:35.060]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.580]   Yeah, you can't read those yet.
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:37.580]   That's important.
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:38.860]   So he's not admitting to it anyway.
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:44.500]   And so I guess the question is Apple's clearly doing the best it can, but is it giving people
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:48.300]   the wrong impression that you can actually control this stuff?
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:52.900]   Shouldn't they just say, "Look, an unsupervised kid using a computer is a bad idea."
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.700]   Why do you keep on tightening that?
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.900]   I mean, I think that there's a lot of places a lot of people would like to go.
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.900]   You know, with that--
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:37:59.900]   It's hard.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:03.940]   It's hard to make a device that's both an adult and a kid could use.
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:04.940]   Right.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:07.500]   I don't really-- I think a lot of people-- I don't really look at it like a device that
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:08.500]   I want.
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.780]   I just want to-- I'm bad that only my kid can use.
[00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:11.780]   You know, that is--
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:12.780]   Exactly.
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:13.780]   That's locked, locked, locked.
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:14.780]   Yeah, that's like, I can just lock it completely down.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.220]   I don't care about it going back and forth.
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:17.220]   I just want to--
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.100]   This is a classic problem, though.
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.700]   As kids get older, Chris, they learn ways around.
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.260]   But in privacy, yeah, you can turn off Safari.
[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.860]   You can't turn off Safari, right?
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.820]   Because my son doesn't need to surf the web right now.
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:29.820]   So I turn off Safari, and then you close that stuff down.
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:30.820]   And there's holes--
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.820]   It's pretty good.
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:33.780]   It's not at five.
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.340]   He's not hacking through that yet.
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:38.860]   So it's enough to-- I think as a parent, you're not looking at a perfect solution.
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.820]   You're looking at eliminating 95, 98%.
[00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:41.820]   They have guided access.
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.300]   You can lock it to one app if you want to.
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.300]   See, that's good.
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:45.300]   Just give them the game and lock it to that one.
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:46.300]   That's what you want.
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.300]   You don't want blocking.
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.740]   You want affirmative action.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.660]   They can only use these sites.
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:57.820]   And when my kids were younger, I used OpenDNS, and that was also a way to do it on the router.
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.740]   And then kind of block it globally from a lot of stuff.
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:01.740]   And that was useful as well.
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.460]   When you keep your kids safe, or you create super intelligent hacking kids.
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:05.460]   So it's when--
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:06.460]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:07.460]   Which I did.
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:09.460]   So I'm proud of that.
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:12.380]   Apple did settle the lawsuit over Kid Apps.
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.180]   You're going to get a $5 iTunes credit.
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.900]   Congratulations, or cash.
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.900]   A fin coming your way, baby.
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:18.900]   Nice.
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:19.900]   This is the case--
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:20.900]   I have a lot of accounts.
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.540]   So it might turn into more than five.
[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:23.540]   Could be 20.
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:24.540]   Yeah.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:29.980]   A settlement offers a $5 iTunes credit or cash if the account was more than $30.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:33.100]   This is a case of kids racking up charges on the App Store.
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:43.300]   So one of the guys that works for me, his daughter racked up $400 charges in like half
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.300]   an hour.
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:45.300]   Yeah.
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:46.660]   You know, just what he wasn't looking.
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:48.340]   So we've had that problem too.
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:52.500]   And of course, what you do is you turn that feature off in App Purchasing.
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.260]   Now, it took a couple of years ago, Apple turned that off.
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.460]   In App Purchasing is turned off without a password.
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:00.140]   And then there is a period of time the password is good for you.
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.020]   It's short and that sort of the shortest possible time.
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.900]   And then the kid just harasses you saying, please give me the password.
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:05.900]   Please give me the password.
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:06.900]   No.
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:07.900]   No.
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:08.900]   No.
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:09.900]   No.
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:12.340]   So I think Apple did the right thing a while ago.
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:17.700]   Remember there was a lawsuit a couple of years ago.
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.020]   Tapfish.
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.020]   That was the one.
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:21.020]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.020]   Tapfish.
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:27.300]   Kevin Tofel of Gigah Oames, kid spent $375 on Frixual Fish.
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.300]   Yes.
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.460]   I actually think that might have been the same one.
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.180]   Somebody's got to stop me from buying donuts.
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.180]   Please.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:33.180]   I beg of you.
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.180]   Please.
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:35.180]   Please.
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.180]   You got to sue first, Leo.
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:37.180]   I need help.
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.180]   I admit it.
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.820]   I am out of control.
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.020]   I'm powerless.
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:46.140]   Anyway, I'm surprised that Apple settled on this one.
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.620]   But I guess it's not going to cost a huge amount of money.
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:52.820]   Settlements still have to receive approval from a federal judge, although it's not unusual
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:57.660]   if both cases agree to that have that go through.
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:03.860]   Early 2014, before you get your $5, just waiting with the bread.
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:04.860]   Don't spend it.
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:05.860]   Yeah.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.100]   I was thinking about saying get a coffee and get a cookie.
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.580]   Don't run out and spend it now.
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:10.900]   Get it in that purchase.
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:11.900]   Yes.
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:15.140]   I always check my iTunes emails and it's fun because I'm reading along.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.780]   Oh yeah, I bought that for iPad today.
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:17.780]   Oh yeah.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:19.700]   Who the hell bought $300 worth of donuts?
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.020]   Oh, never mind.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:24.660]   But no, then there's like swords and infinity blade.
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:28.140]   There's all sorts of crap that I don't zombie stuff.
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:29.140]   I didn't buy that.
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:35.100]   I wonder if this will lead to just an overall bad consumer experience because I sometimes
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.740]   get a bad taste in my mouth when I pay a buck 99 for it.
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:42.940]   I just matter of fact, just the other day, I bought the Usogeo Jimbo game and I think
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:44.380]   it was like something like a buck 99.
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:46.620]   It's a fun game and I'm enjoying it.
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:49.900]   But there comes a point where, okay, I got killed at the boss level the first time and
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:52.940]   now it's asking, do you want to, if you want, you can buy extra armor.
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.820]   If you want, you can buy this if you want, you can buy that.
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:59.380]   And isn't that the same reason why you hate going to certain events because you know that
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.580]   the ticket, the ticket alone cost you 45 bucks and now they're going to try to sell you
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:03.580]   the t-shirt.
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:06.180]   Now they're going to try to charge you the for the sweatshirt.
[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:10.940]   It's like at what point can you say, I want you to promise me that I can, I'll give you
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:11.940]   10 bucks, not two 99.
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:12.940]   Everybody does it now.
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:16.220]   But promise me that you'll give me a complete self contained wonderful experience with this
[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.220]   amount of money.
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:21.980]   John, I think that that, but I think that the other side of that is the, I think there's,
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:22.980]   there is a fine line there.
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:28.820]   I mean, because I think that you get into a situation where you don't also want the
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:33.620]   amusement park to charge you an extra $80 so that they can then give you the t-shirt
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.460]   and give you like, you know, you give you all that stuff.
[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:36.540]   I didn't want all that stuff.
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:37.540]   You know, and so, right.
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:42.140]   Well, like the paper app, I think that, I think there's a great way to get around Apple's
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.460]   refusal to let people try apps.
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.860]   You can get the basic experience and environment of the app for free.
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:51.540]   If you want the cool extra brushes, which I would say that a lot, those are actually
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:55.180]   the brushes you really, really want, then you start incrementally making purchases.
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:58.260]   And if you buy everything, it's like 10 bucks, which isn't a whole lot of money.
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:03.300]   It's just, there are times when I encounter a game where it's kind of an, it's kind of
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:07.980]   a trivial amusement unless you start putting more coins into the slot machine and keep
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:09.780]   pulling the lever.
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.980]   And it seems, you get the impression sometimes that some of these games, the whole intention
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:16.500]   is just to keep it at the slot machine, keep you smoking, keep giving you a free drink.
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:17.500]   Absolutely.
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:18.900]   So you just keep putting money in and keep pulling that lever.
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:19.900]   Right.
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:23.700]   And we told them to do this to us because, you know, Super Monkey Ball came out when the
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:26.660]   app store launched at $10 and people complained.
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:29.340]   And we wouldn't buy games that were just outright purchase.
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.140]   And now Real Racing 3 is coming out and it's free to play.
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:36.540]   So you play it, but then if you want to repair your car or get back on the truck, track faster,
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:37.860]   you got to purchase it.
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.180]   We told them we would not pay a fair price for the game.
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:44.300]   So using Apple system, they've now figured out a way to make way more money using games
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.500]   that are far more annoying.
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.340]   And we all end up doing it.
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:52.100]   Which is much, much better than not allowing people to have a trial mode.
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:54.180]   So yeah, I wish they had trial mode.
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.180]   I do.
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:56.180]   Yeah.
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:59.620]   Or at least refunds like on Windows Phone or Android where you have a few seconds or
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:00.620]   a few minutes.
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:01.620]   That's the problem.
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:05.260]   It used to be what on Android used to be a, it was a day and then it was shorter and
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:08.100]   then it was shorter again and a minute or something.
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:10.100]   It's ridiculously short.
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:11.700]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:12.860]   Come back with more.
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:16.380]   We're talking Macintosh iOS.
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:17.620]   There is some Mac news.
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:24.540]   I'm happy to say with the Rene Richie of iMore.com, the king of Apple rumors.
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.300]   Any hot rumors?
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:27.300]   Maybe.
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.540]   Maybe we'll find out.
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:33.820]   And Mr. Alex Lindsey, where you been lately?
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.820]   I was in LA yesterday.
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:36.820]   Yeah.
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:39.740]   And otherwise in Seattle last week with your travel schedule.
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.100]   LA is like, oh, that's like, it's nothing.
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.100]   It's like, oh, yeah, that's.
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.100]   Get there in an hour.
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:45.100]   Big deal.
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.100]   I'm in New York tomorrow.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.100]   Yeah, that's a little more.
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:48.820]   And then I'm pondering London on Thursday.
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:49.820]   I don't know.
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.420]   I might go to London on Thursday.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:52.420]   I don't know.
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:55.180]   Well, I'm trying to get out of it because I'm, we have a team.
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:56.980]   I know it's so tedious going on.
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:57.980]   I'm not sure.
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:01.980]   Well, after you've done one red eye to New York, it's a, it may sound luxurious, but
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:05.500]   once you've done one red eye to New York, looking at doing another red, red eye to London
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.420]   the next night is just something I'm just thinking.
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:08.420]   I'm like looking at it.
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:09.420]   Well, it's awesome.
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:11.380]   You're telling your supermodel telling people that you work hard.
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:12.380]   That's what's happening.
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:13.380]   Yes.
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:14.380]   Yeah.
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:15.380]   Oh my god.
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:16.380]   That's a run west.
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.180]   I drop by and fix their iPod again.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:20.180]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:26.940]   And Andy and that go from the Chicago Sun times a ink stained, rich in person.
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.740]   The last of his breed.
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:31.540]   Do you still use ink?
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:33.940]   Oh, me personally.
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:37.060]   Fortunately, I renegotiate my contracts, so I don't have to work the press room.
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:42.060]   I just do the home delivery for a for the Northeast region.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:45.700]   I don't really understand how this thing works.
[00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:46.700]   Thank you for being here guys.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:50.580]   We're going to talk some more in just a bit, but first a word from squarespace.com, the
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:54.220]   secret behind the best websites in the world.
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:58.940]   Everything you need to create a great website hosting best hosting ever hosting that never
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:00.060]   goes down.
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.260]   And we try all the time to kill squarespace sites.
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:03.260]   We kill sites.
[00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:07.180]   You know, I should make this a sign out front.
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.180]   Welcome to Twit.
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:11.500]   We kill websites because if I point you to a website, boom, it's down.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.380]   And sometimes big, big sites, not if they're running on squarespace.
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:17.380]   And that's what I love about squarespace.
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:22.540]   But one of the reasons it's such good hosting is because they also provide and support the
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:27.220]   software on top of it for your content management system, which means you're going to be able
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:29.740]   to design a beautiful mobile responsive site.
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.820]   It looks great no matter what size screen.
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:33.300]   You could try it free for two weeks.
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:38.140]   Just click that get started button right at the squarespace.com site.
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.860]   And you've got two weeks, no credit card needed.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:41.180]   You don't even need our offer code.
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:42.900]   Just play with it, import your content.
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:48.660]   It has importers for all the major blog APIs, all the SEO, all the bookmarks, all the images,
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.740]   even all the comments are preserved and moved into squarespace.
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:55.100]   So you can really see what it would look like for a full blown site.
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:58.580]   15 minutes after you set up the site, you're going to have all the content in there.
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:00.060]   And now you can play with the templates.
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:01.580]   And it's just really great.
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:04.740]   There is something new I want to tell you about at Squarespace.
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:08.660]   Once you play with it for a little while, go check out the pricing.
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:11.580]   Ah, used to be two pricing plans.
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.980]   Now there's three because they've just added e-commerce.
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:19.100]   This is really good news for anybody that wants to sell physical goods or digital goods
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:20.340]   online.
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:23.180]   They do it all from soup to nuts and they do it at a very affordable price.
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:25.500]   They do not take a cut of your sales.
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:30.860]   It's simply $24 a month when you buy an annual plan, $30 if you go month to month.
[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:32.740]   That includes everything.
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:37.100]   Fully integrated e-commerce, unlimited physical products, unlimited digital products, a mobile
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:40.060]   store as well as a fully integrated e-commerce.
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.060]   That's new.
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:42.060]   Yes.
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.060]   It's fully integrated.
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.700]   They just started this.
[00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:50.740]   Inventory tracking, they do tax, they do shipping, they do coupons if you want.
[00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.380]   And by the way, that's the unlimited plan too.
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:56.980]   So you have unlimited pages, galleries, blogs, bandwidth, storage, contributors, everything,
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:57.980]   $24.
[00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:00.860]   Do they have everybody running scared?
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:02.860]   They got to.
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:09.100]   The other e-commerce sites, I won't name the names, but they can't offer anything like
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:10.100]   this.
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:11.100]   And by the way, they'll say you love the marginal.
[00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:15.820]   Let me tell you how painful generally e-commerce is.
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.820]   I've been doing this since 2000.
[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:22.500]   Well, you know what's happened is this is the maturity of this, right?
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.780]   After a while at all, and they've figured it out.
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.740]   And so for instance, you don't have to have a merchant account.
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:27.740]   They'll set you up with that.
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:28.740]   Sorry.
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:29.740]   Take credit cards and debit cards.
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:30.740]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:35.340]   It's got a simple interface for you to manage the orders, tracking orders, providing customer
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:39.980]   email updates, printing shipping labels, adding coupons.
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.260]   All of this is part of the business plan and you've got to take a look.
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:44.900]   So just go set it up.
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:46.620]   Two weeks absolutely free.
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:50.620]   If you decide to buy, get the biggest, longest subscription you can because when you use the
[00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:54.340]   offer code MACBRAKE2, you'll take 10% off that.
[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.540]   MACBRAKE and the number two.
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:01.420]   They also, when you buy a year or more, will give you a domain name registration.
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:04.900]   I already have freepants.org, but there are others.
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:07.900]   You know, I realize I can't sell freepants.
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:08.900]   You can't.
[00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:09.900]   And let's make it like you.
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:10.900]   You crazy.
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:13.740]   Maybe I could do in-pant add-ons.
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:14.740]   You know, I don't know.
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:15.740]   I don't know.
[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:16.740]   We should talk about that.
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.540]   Oh, you want pockets?
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:20.540]   That'll be a dollar.
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:21.540]   In-pant.
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.540]   What's that?
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:23.540]   Freepants.org.
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:24.540]   I'm much of cargo pockets.
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:25.540]   Hey, look, I haven't set it up yet.
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:27.300]   Give me a break, okay?
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:28.860]   Those pants are free.
[00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:29.860]   Like the airline.
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:30.860]   Oh, you want a seat.
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:34.740]   Oh, you want a bag.
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:35.740]   Belt loops?
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:36.740]   Just a dollar.
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:37.740]   No big deal.
[00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:40.300]   How much are they charged for the safety belt on the seat?
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:41.300]   No bottoms.
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:42.300]   That's extra.
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:43.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:44.300]   No, no, no.
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:45.860]   If you want cuffs, bell bottoms, any sort of treatment at the end of the pant.
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:48.700]   In fact, if you want a hole for your leg, that's extra.
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:52.460]   Because, hey, the pants are sewn up when you first go.
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:53.460]   You want a zipper?
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:54.460]   Oh, zipper.
[00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:55.460]   Both legs.
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:56.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:57.460]   Two dollars a leg.
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:58.460]   No, no.
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:00.380]   That's what square space doesn't do to you.
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:01.980]   It's 24 bucks a month.
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:05.140]   The whole thing, you got to try it.
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:06.140]   Squarespace.com.
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:11.020]   Do user offer code MACBreak2 to get 10% off your first purchase on new accounts.
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:15.220]   And do check out the-- if you've been looking at it for a set and up of business, the whole
[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:17.300]   landscape just changed.
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:18.780]   It's so easy to put this stuff together, too.
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:20.780]   I mean, it's just square space.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:21.780]   Yeah.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:25.420]   And the reason I don't love Windows now, restart your PC to upgrade the latest version
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:27.420]   of Macaphy Internet Security Suite.
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:30.020]   I consider Macaphy actually a bit of a virus.
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:31.020]   Yeah.
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:33.420]   I didn't uninstall it fast enough.
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:34.420]   Right.
[00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:35.420]   Dang.
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:36.820]   Every Windows install we do is like really--
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:38.020]   First thing you take on--
[00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:39.020]   It's like, oh, no.
[00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:40.820]   --you're a Karumba.
[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:44.900]   People may ask, Leo, this is MacBreak Weekly, what are you doing?
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.660]   Why are you using a Windows machine?
[00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:49.260]   Well, I just thought I should try it.
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:54.700]   It's a more accurate view of the Mac world if you are exposing yourself to all the pain
[00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:56.900]   that is Windows 8.
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.660]   Actually I hate to say it, but this is--
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.660]   I got to like it.
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:01.660]   Yeah, you like it for now.
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:02.660]   This is great.
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.660]   And then a week later, you'll be like this.
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:05.660]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:06.660]   You're right.
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:07.660]   Pop check back with this.
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:08.660]   This is all a mistake.
[00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.660]   This is the Acer.
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:10.660]   This is an S7.
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:11.900]   It is an I7 with four gigs of RAM.
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:12.900]   They did something weird.
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:20.100]   Dual 128 gig hard SSDs that they've RAID 0ed to make 1, 256 gig.
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.100]   That doesn't seem like a good idea.
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.300]   Does it have a VGA port?
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:23.460]   That's all we need to know.
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:24.460]   It does.
[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:28.860]   It comes with-- because as many HDMI 2 VGA adapter just for you.
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:29.860]   Nice.
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:31.940]   Yeah, now how much would you pay?
[00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:35.580]   Leo, you should download iTunes and Safari.
[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:36.580]   No.
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:38.940]   There's some limits.
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:42.140]   I've done that before with Windows machines.
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:44.820]   I will not put the Apple crap on my Windows machine.
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:47.380]   I say that with all due respect to Mac break.
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:52.980]   I think it's actually a secret plan by Apple to make the computer experience in general
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:56.460]   so bad on the PC that when you test the Mac, you're like, "It's so much faster.
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:57.660]   They work so much better."
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:00.500]   I know they're not doing that, but it does feel that way.
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:01.740]   It does feel that way.
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:04.620]   iTunes on Windows is horrible.
[00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:05.620]   So I don't really--
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:07.460]   And on the Mac, it's just bad.
[00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:08.460]   Oh, shit.
[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:10.620]   Maybe that's it.
[00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:11.620]   I don't know.
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:13.700]   Anyway, moving along.
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:16.220]   I just wanted to explain, for those of you who are a little confused, why I keep reaching
[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:21.980]   out to touch my screen on my MacBook, that that's not what's going on.
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:31.380]   There are new prices on the MacBook Pro, the Retina, and that's the 13-inch, and they
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:37.460]   bumped the processors for the rest, but Mac rumor has taken a look at the benchmarks,
[00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:40.300]   and it's not-- it's 3% to 5%.
[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:41.300]   Faster.
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:42.980]   Actually, this comes from Geekbench.
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:47.260]   When people run Geekbench, they can turn on the ability to upload those benchmarks to
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:49.660]   the Geekbench servers anonymously, and people do that.
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:51.460]   So they get a lot of information.
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:52.460]   That's a great sample.
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:54.780]   That is fantastic.
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.140]   So you can see the bump.
[00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:01.100]   5% is, in my opinion, the smallest amount you'd notice.
[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:02.300]   I don't even know if you'd noticed that.
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.780]   I think the average person would not notice that probably 5%.
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:06.620]   I mean, I don't think you really start noticing it.
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:13.780]   I mean, what you really notice, in my opinion, still is storage, whether that's RAM or SSD.
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:15.540]   Those are the things that really change.
[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:16.540]   I think processor speed.
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:18.460]   That's because the processors are so fast now.
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:19.460]   Right.
[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:21.380]   It does make it difficult to be less important, but not anymore.
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:29.820]   I would definitely consider an i7 or i5 a requirement, and an i7 for what I do.
[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:34.020]   But once you get into that, whether it's incremental changes really make very--
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:35.740]   I don't even think more RAM these days makes--
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:36.740]   SSDs.
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:37.740]   It's the SSDs.
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:38.740]   It makes the biggest difference.
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:39.740]   Yeah.
[00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:43.500]   We have a bunch of machines with SSDs and a bunch without, and it's just amazing.
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:49.060]   So recommendation, if you already-- you certainly, if you already have a late model MacBook
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:51.220]   Pro, there'd be no point in upgrading.
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:52.220]   Right.
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:54.540]   It wouldn't hurt if you don't have one now.
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:55.540]   Okay.
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:56.540]   This is the first time.
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:00.420]   I still believe, as we talked about last week, that we're going to see Haswell processors
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:04.580]   in September that will be better battery life and better performance.
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:07.980]   And you have to decide if you can wait until September, because then by September you'll
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:12.620]   be hearing about January, and you'll be wondering, "Wow, all right, all right."
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:13.620]   Hey, you know what?
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:15.700]   If you've been waiting for an iMac, good news.
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:19.020]   It looks like the iMacs are now starting to flood into the market.
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:24.340]   Apple's Macs sales are up 31% in January, and Tim Cook says it's because we could make
[00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:26.940]   enough iMacs to fulfill the demand.
[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:28.940]   That's when I got mine.
[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:29.940]   They're so such great.
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:30.940]   I mean, they are.
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:31.940]   I like that.
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:33.580]   I got a 27-inch.
[00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:35.020]   It is a work of art.
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:36.020]   Yeah.
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.580]   10 pounds lighter than my old iMac.
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:44.460]   Yeah, I got the 21 for my parents, and it is just like it was just upscales the whole
[00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:45.460]   room.
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:46.460]   Yeah.
[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:47.460]   It's just beautiful.
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:48.460]   Yeah.
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:54.140]   How much of the percentage of the Mac market share is constrained simply by the fact that
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:59.020]   Apple is the only manufacturer to suit the entire world demand, and that Apple keeps
[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:02.060]   trying even harder and harder to push into new markets.
[00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:03.060]   They can't.
[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:05.580]   Yeah, that's part of it, isn't it?
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:08.020]   It's not merely making them for the US anymore.
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.020]   Yeah.
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:12.700]   And there were some, I remember reading a few months ago some reports from people who
[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:17.140]   were saying, "We were looking at what looked to be kind of soft Mac sales for the desktop
[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:22.260]   component," and saying, "Well, this must indicate a trend that people are switching
[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:26.820]   to Windows or the Microsoft setting a clearer message than Apple is."
[00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:29.940]   And no, it's that there were a lot of people who wanted to buy them, but Apple could not
[00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:31.860]   put devices in their hands.
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:35.780]   Now they swap devices for money, which is the best position for tech company like Apple
[00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:36.780]   to be in.
[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:41.380]   Tim Cook said at the Elastic Quarterly call a couple of weeks ago, "We left the quarter
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:44.860]   with significant constraints on the iMac, and we believe that our sales would have been
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:47.740]   materially higher if those constraints weren't there."
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:55.340]   NPD reporting, actually it was from Piper Jaffrey's famous, "The infamous Gene Munster,
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:56:00.940]   Herman's brother, that Mac sales rose 31% year over year, month of January."
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:06.940]   I love this, Apple stock goes down because they simply can't make enough of what they're
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:07.940]   selling.
[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:09.580]   Well, but that's legitimate.
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:10.580]   It is.
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:11.740]   It impacts the bottom line.
[00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:12.740]   It does.
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:13.740]   They're making the right products.
[00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:15.300]   They can't make them fast enough.
[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:16.300]   Right.
[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:18.900]   It's not for a future thinking of investors though.
[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:19.900]   Right.
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:22.660]   Because in fact- Because investors actually- A couple of months later.
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:23.660]   Yeah, they're terrible at that.
[00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:24.660]   A couple of months later.
[00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:29.220]   Suddenly, there's plenty of iMacs out there.
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:32.580]   In fact, he predicted that he said on the iMac, "We're confident we're going to significantly
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:36.540]   increase the supply, but demand is very strong and we're not certainly when we'll achieve
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:38.260]   a supply-demand balance."
[00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:40.420]   Well, it sounds like they've got there.
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:41.940]   Watch watch some people could play that.
[00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:44.540]   Yeah, you know, interest in the iMac is just falling off.
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:49.260]   You used to have to wait like four weeks to get an iMac now, as many as you want.
[00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:50.420]   You can just get them next day.
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:51.420]   It's really quite sad.
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:54.780]   It is the spit, isn't it?
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:57.860]   But try and get a Surface Pro.
[00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:04.780]   They're selling hotcakes.
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:10.540]   Plants vs. Zombies, is it still free on the iPhone and the iPad if it is, get it.
[00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:11.540]   The most game ever.
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:12.540]   Yeah.
[00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:15.020]   Are we getting closer to the second one?
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:16.020]   That's why, right?
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:17.020]   Yeah.
[00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:18.700]   Like when April soon?
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:19.700]   I hope.
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:21.540]   Things will be nice.
[00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:24.540]   I'm just like, "We both."
[00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:26.540]   Alex, Alex, Alex.
[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:32.140]   And he thinks it'll get me from Simpson's tapped out as my vote.
[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:33.140]   My vote.
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:34.140]   Yep, still free.
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:37.380]   That means that's just because I think it's a lot of fun playing Plants vs. Zombies with
[00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:38.380]   my son.
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:39.820]   I'm sad that I finished the game.
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:43.260]   I want to, you know, I actually finished it like 12 times.
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:45.620]   I was like, "I was like, "I was like, "I was like, "I was like, "I'm going to finish it."
[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:47.820]   I mean, you can play that like eight times in a row.
[00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:48.820]   Oh, wow.
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:49.820]   Yes, exactly.
[00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:51.820]   There's a new one that comes out today.
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:54.620]   Somebody sent me an email called, "I've Retower Defense."
[00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:57.220]   It's from an Ivy League dropout.
[00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:02.180]   Anyway, I haven't seen it yet, but I'm going to, it might be my pick.
[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:05.900]   I think we're doing iPad today early this week because Sarah might have jury duties.
[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:11.020]   So if you're watching live on a Tuesday when we do Mac Break Weekly, stay tuned for iPad
[00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:17.620]   today about five o'clock, four or five Pacific, seven PM Eastern later today.
[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:27.660]   And if ivory tower comes out, I would probably make that my app cap just because I love that.
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:28.660]   Look at it.
[00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:29.660]   What's that?
[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:32.420]   I thought it was an article about it, but it took so long to load it.
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:33.940]   Yeah, it's not out yet.
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:34.940]   I think it's today.
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:35.940]   It's not just when it's supposed to come out.
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:38.140]   They sent me an press release.
[00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:39.140]   I just like the name.
[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:40.140]   I've retowered.
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:41.340]   And you like tower defense games.
[00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:42.340]   So I just, that's why I noticed that.
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:44.340]   Crazy about tower defense games.
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:47.140]   In fact, I was playing one on the way in.
[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:48.140]   Which one?
[00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:49.140]   I just played field runners.
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:51.140]   Field runners too is still pretty damn good.
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:54.660]   And I cannot finish that left level last level to save my life.
[00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:56.620]   I have trouble with all the indoor levels.
[00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:59.940]   The fire, you know, those are very hard.
[00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:04.860]   I can't do, I've finished them, but I can't do them all at three stars at heroic.
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:06.580]   I've run all the other ones at heroic.
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:07.580]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:08.580]   Just a couple of the last ones that I've been throwing.
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:10.900]   I'm just sitting there on that one.
[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:15.220]   If you're in Australia, you may be interested to learn that Apple and Samsung, their two
[00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:24.140]   year legal battle has taken according to the financial review and unprecedented twist.
[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:25.780]   The case resumed in federal court this week.
[00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:28.860]   Each company is consolidating its arguments.
[00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:30.860]   They're now two judges.
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:32.500]   And judges are...
[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:33.500]   Is that the twist?
[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:34.500]   That's the twist.
[00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:36.940]   It's the first time in the history of the court, the two judges...
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:37.940]   The twist is.
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:43.220]   The twist is that they're married and they're trying to balance work and the relationship.
[00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:45.220]   I mean, it's an episode of Heart to Heart.
[00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:49.020]   You know, if we just worked on the same case at the same time, we'd see each other all day.
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:51.700]   And we know it's two and together.
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:52.700]   They're swapping...
[00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:53.700]   We can't tell which ones which anymore.
[00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:56.860]   They're objecting to each other.
[00:59:56.860 --> 01:00:01.940]   The court typically relies on a single judge and then panels of an odd number of judges in
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:02.940]   case of disagreements.
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:05.220]   You'd have a tiebreaker.
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:09.620]   But they introduced a second judge because Judge Bennett, the one who's been...
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:13.140]   Annabelle Bennett, who's been hearing the case, said it's so damn complicated she needs
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:20.220]   help to understand the complex patents and mountains of documents.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.220]   You read that box.
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.540]   I'll read this box.
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:24.540]   Apple claims Samsung.
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:25.540]   No, that's going to work.
[01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:26.540]   No.
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:30.140]   19 patents, 120 grams, nine smartphones, two tablets.
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:31.460]   No wonder she's overwhelmed.
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:32.460]   Crazy.
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:33.460]   Crazy.
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:38.260]   Not enough video in the demonstrative evidence.
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:39.260]   That's what I say.
[01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:40.260]   What does that even mean?
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:41.260]   That's what I used to do.
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:42.260]   That's what I used to do.
[01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:43.260]   It's a good thing.
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:44.660]   Another life ago, that's what I used to do.
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:46.940]   You made video for demonstrative evidence?
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:47.940]   Yeah.
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:48.940]   So when people would...
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:50.900]   I know an enormous amount about oil plumes.
[01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:53.100]   Let me tell you.
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:56.740]   So what you do is you take a complex...
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:02.140]   In a patent case, you would take a complex concept and animate it.
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:07.260]   So the jury and the judge would understand actually what the technology is all about.
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:12.860]   On the cases that I worked on, the budget for the stuff would be between $1 and $2 million.
[01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:14.980]   This is in the '90s.
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:18.380]   But we would build really good animations.
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:20.540]   Not that evidence is always boring.
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:24.900]   Nautilus stuff you see on TV because you have to prove every little pixel that you put up
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:25.900]   there.
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:26.900]   You do.
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:30.700]   But when you're just trying to describe a concept, it's actually much easier.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.180]   You make it look pretty.
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:35.340]   That's actually what I did before I got to Lucasfilm.
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:36.340]   Oh.
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:41.780]   That sounds like a job that will always have something to do.
[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:42.780]   It was actually...
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:43.780]   It's not going up.
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:46.220]   If you're the person that liked to do research papers, it was awesome.
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:48.140]   Because literally, it was like...
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:49.140]   One day I was...
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:52.300]   Well, I mean, but for me, it was just fascinating because it was like...
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:55.860]   I've always dreamt of working for the Discovery Channel because I grew up watching PBS.
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:56.860]   And Discovery Channel.
[01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:01.060]   And the idea of sitting there and building how something works.
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:05.580]   So I get to work with the world expert in genetics and then the world expert in chip
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:06.580]   design.
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:09.300]   And you said, I mean, like literally the world expert would be sitting there and talking
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.740]   to you for two days so that you could animate it.
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:13.740]   So it's awesome.
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:20.260]   From that bastion of journalistic verisimilitude, the New York Post comes this exclusive.
[01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:24.860]   NYPD forms dedicated team to catch thieves who steal iPhones and iPads.
[01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:27.580]   At least you can find how to do that.
[01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:33.380]   The theft of Apple devices is so rampant in New York that according to this story that
[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:38.220]   a team of cops has been assigned to work with a tech giant to get stolen gadgets back.
[01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:40.900]   The Post has learned.
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:41.900]   Dick Wolf to produce.
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:42.900]   Stay beautiful.
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:45.380]   The Post has learned.
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:53.460]   Every time an Apple device is stolen, detectives attempt to get tracking numbers from the victim
[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:54.460]   or online records.
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:56.060]   I don't know what they're talking about.
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:57.060]   They're talking about it.
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:00.460]   Then they say, can you turn on find my eye?
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:05.140]   That number known as the International Mobile Station Equipment Identity or IMEI.
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:06.140]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:08.980]   Do you know your IMEI kids?
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:12.940]   Maybe you want to write that down so the detective in New York can help you.
[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:18.420]   Is then shared with the officers and police headquarters who pass it on to Apple.
[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:23.340]   The company based in California, it notes.
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:27.460]   That informs the NYPD at a device's current location.
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:32.780]   And it can track it even if it was re-registered with a different wireless provider.
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:34.700]   Wow.
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:36.700]   Wow.
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:39.700]   We're looking for, I think my phone is trying to find it to a home.
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:40.700]   It's tracking you right now, Leo.
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:41.700]   Stop it.
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:45.420]   We're looking for ways to find individuals who have stolen Apple products and returning
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:46.420]   to products today.
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:49.740]   Original owners said NYPD spokesman Paul Brown.
[01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:53.100]   It's being done to learn to patent who is stealing.
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.500]   It turns out it's everyone.
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:56.500]   It's thieves.
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.500]   They're thieves.
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.620]   They discovered it.
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:03.300]   Cops also hoped a partnership helps catch the crooks who had taken and resettled the
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:07.780]   devices.
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:13.820]   One stolen iPad was tracked to the Dominican Republic and recovered with the help of an
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:17.580]   NYPD intelligence cop assigned to Santo Domingo.
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:18.580]   Really?
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:19.580]   They, NYPD?
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:20.580]   There's a long hand.
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:21.580]   This is a long trip.
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:22.580]   I'm the post.
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:25.420]   This is the long hand of the NYPD.
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:31.580]   I mean, you know, in another case, it busted a man suspected of selling stolen iPads at
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:36.020]   a city bus stop by tracking them with Apple's help.
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:37.020]   So there.
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.020]   We staked out.
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.020]   How are you?
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:42.020]   I'm not going to be able to find it.
[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.020]   Hey, it is.
[01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:44.020]   Shut your hole.
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.020]   We staked out the bus stop.
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:46.020]   ID to suspect it arrested him.
[01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.020]   We recovered the iPad.
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:59.860]   Many of the confiscated devices are being bought at a second hand market, but people who don't
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:02.220]   even know they was stolen.
[01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:03.220]   Yeah.
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:05.220]   They just stopped for an iPad.
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.220]   It was down to $39.
[01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:10.580]   It's a flash of hair attached to it.
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:11.580]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.940]   I thought I was from my kid.
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:19.260]   Okay, they asked an actual expert, Ken Mahaffey, founder of cell phone security form Lookout.
[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:23.660]   He said, yeah, this technique of identifying stolen phones by the unique identifiers.
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:25.180]   It's been around for a couple of years.
[01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:28.180]   It's technically rather simple.
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:29.180]   Yay.
[01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.180]   Yay.
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:31.180]   YPD.
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:34.580]   Tells Sipowitz is thrilled to be on this beat.
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:35.580]   Say Sipowitz.
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.500]   There's a whole show here.
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:38.500]   Yeah.
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.500]   Just great.
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:43.820]   But the great thing about being on that outline, the chalk outlines of an iPad.
[01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:44.820]   Very easy.
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:45.820]   Easy to draw.
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:46.820]   Easy to draw.
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:48.580]   That's how they break in the new police artists.
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:49.580]   Okay.
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:53.180]   Can you sketch the iPad for me so we could find it?
[01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:54.180]   This show brought to you.
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:55.940]   No, but you could have it though.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:56.940]   You could have this whole thing.
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:06:01.980]   It'd be like the beginning of CSI or CSI or or or or in law and order where you see some
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:06.100]   guy partying drinking with his friends and then you know, and work on his iPhone and
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:10.100]   then he walks away to the bathroom and he comes back and it's gone and then it don't
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.100]   go.
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.100]   So we're you.
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:13.100]   Yeah.
[01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:14.100]   We have a sketchy.
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.100]   Is this your iPad?
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:16.100]   I did.
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:18.260]   Two distinct forms of law enforcement.
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:21.700]   The IMM numbers, they tracked down the thing and the police who apprehend the assailant law
[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:22.700]   and order.
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:27.980]   IP ID and the goons that beat them up when once they've got it CSI.
[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:31.580]   Looks like the purple double clicked.
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:41.340]   And then Caruso puts on his Google glasses and looks into the sun.
[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:44.220]   Thank God for the New York coast.
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:47.940]   Actually, Castle Bravo is saying in our chair room.
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:48.940]   Amazingly enough.
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:54.500]   This has not been my experience, but he says NYPD cops do follow up on iPhone thefts.
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.340]   It's evidently a rampant.
[01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:57.420]   I have a whole team.
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:00.900]   My experience was a general wall of disinterest.
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:04.380]   What do you want me to do about it?
[01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:05.380]   Yeah.
[01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:06.860]   You lost your first car now.
[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:08.700]   We'll never find that.
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:10.900]   I lost my iPad got stolen from the back of my car.
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:11.900]   The window was smashed.
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:14.500]   The iPad was taken and the cops were like, talk to your insurance.
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:15.500]   Yeah, what?
[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:18.140]   It's not worth it.
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:23.860]   How much how much does it cost for all that police time and to have a guy in Santa Domingo?
[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:27.220]   I know, but I got the guy in Santa Domingo is not complaining.
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:28.220]   He's got a good job.
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.860]   He's got a good tan.
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:31.980]   He's drinking rum and coca, coca.
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:33.460]   Oh, another IME.
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:34.700]   I just came and wait a minute.
[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:36.060]   I wonder if they have an app for that.
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.060]   It's over there.
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:38.700]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.300]   Come back with more.
[01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:45.900]   Our show today brought to you by Citrix, the powerfully simple way to meet with clients
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:46.900]   and colleagues anywhere.
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:47.900]   You know what it's called?
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:48.900]   Go to meeting.
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:49.900]   Have you tried it yet?
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.540]   Oh, my golly, I love go to meeting.
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:54.980]   It is a very, in fact, now that I got this new Windows machine, I'm going to put it on
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:55.980]   here.
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:59.140]   Very easy way to create a meeting.
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:02.380]   If you have Outlook, you just click a button.
[01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:03.780]   You can do it at any email.
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.740]   And the nice thing is even if the person doesn't have the software installed, they just click
[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:08.340]   the link, the software installs.
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:09.580]   They don't need to make a phone call.
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:16.020]   They can use the screen, the computers, speakers, and the computers microphone.
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:20.060]   And if they've got a webcam, they can even use that, in fact, on an iPad as well.
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:25.460]   So you can not only present from an iPad, you can actually join a meeting and send the
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.300]   video, which is awesome.
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:31.060]   I used to sit out in the backyard over at the old Twitcottage with my iPad and go to
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:33.260]   meeting and I would attend these meetings and do this whole thing.
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:34.260]   It was great.
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:35.260]   We need a backyard here.
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:36.700]   I do it in the basement here.
[01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:37.700]   It's not the same.
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:40.060]   I have a little lawn chair, a green carpet.
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:41.980]   I used to hit as a tally.
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:42.980]   A tally?
[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:43.980]   Yeah.
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:47.180]   When we're doing live events and you have people all over the world that you're trying
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:50.180]   to tie in, and you want to tell them all the same thing at the same time.
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:51.180]   Oh.
[01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:55.700]   So we have all these little iPod touches and we have some sign in to go to meeting and
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:59.860]   then you put them underneath the camera and then I can sit there and do like a full screen
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:02.860]   keynote and sit there and change what I want to tell them.
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:04.260]   And then boom, it just appears everywhere.
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:06.020]   It's awesome at the same time.
[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:09.500]   It's the easiest thing to use because the big thing is with a lot of these other things,
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.620]   we're trying to teach people how to install something or how to put this in.
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:13.620]   Model it.
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:14.620]   It doesn't stand everybody a link.
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:15.620]   It doesn't stand automatically.
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:16.620]   It doesn't automatically.
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:22.060]   And with the iPad and iPhone app and Android app, which are free, all you do is it gives
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:23.060]   you an identifier.
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:24.580]   You type the number in and boom, you're in.
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:25.580]   Very simple.

[01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:58.620]   We thank Citrix.
[01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:05.340]   It was such a great supporter of everything we do here at Twitch and of Mac break weekly.
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:12.740]   So the big shareholder meeting is went tomorrow, the next day soon.
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:15.300]   There's going to be a proxy battle or some einhorn.
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:16.300]   There's lawsuits.
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:19.060]   This is although they're not going to mention the einhorn lawsuit.
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:23.460]   I just think that after 2008, hedge fund operators should not, hedge fund guys should
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:25.260]   not be a lot of talk in public.
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.420]   We bailed them out.
[01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:27.420]   So they should just shut the shut up.
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:28.420]   I agree.
[01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:31.020]   They should stop squeezing people.
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:36.780]   What they want is, Apple was going to offer preferred stock and they said, no, no, no,
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:39.780]   you don't.
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:40.780]   And there's a lawsuit.
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:41.780]   I don't, you know what?
[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:42.780]   I don't even follow in this stuff.
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.340]   Well, they didn't want to bundle together.
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.380]   There were three initiatives all in one ballot and they wanted them separated so people
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:49.700]   could vote individually on each one of the people.
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:51.340]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:56.620]   This little lizard is trying to squeeze Apple for more money because he doesn't want it.
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:57.620]   Yeah.
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:59.460]   So you make money in that business.
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:00.460]   Yeah.
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:03.700]   People, I mean, I think that we have to get to a point when we start to think about these
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:09.340]   things that the real problem in real problem in America is not the 1%.
[01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:10.980]   It is the banks and the hedge funds.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:14.900]   They're the ones that are, you know, and all the stuff that we're seeing is just a perfect
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:17.060]   example of no one safe from these guys.
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:18.700]   And that nobody got punished.
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:24.300]   It's like they just kind of went on, kept on doing it.
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.460]   So einhorn says Apple's next product.
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:30.380]   He's not giving them advice.
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:40.380]   Should be called I preface a perpetual preferred stock that einhorn argues should be Apple's
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:43.220]   next product.
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:45.020]   Shares that pay dividends forever.
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:49.660]   Two dollars a year for the rest of your life.
[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:50.660]   The end of eternity.
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:52.300]   I don't even understand this.
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:54.300]   This is all beyond me.
[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:58.780]   It's a it's a it's a real issue is Apple's got a ton of cash, right?
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:01.620]   And I want some of it and I should get some because I'm a hedge fund.
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.820]   I work at a hedge fund and we get everybody's cash.
[01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:07.460]   We should we if someone has cash that we don't have the cash.
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:08.940]   We're allowed to sit on our cash.
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:12.700]   But if but if someone else is sitting on cash, well, that cash should belong to us.
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:13.700]   That's exactly.
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:18.580]   There's never enough money.
[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:20.900]   By the way, I remember I've been the one who says an iPad mini.
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:24.220]   The next Apple next product should be the iPad mini phone.
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:26.540]   Samsung is doing that now in Europe.
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:29.700]   They don't think you're going to do it here, but they're maybe not an eight inch Samsung
[01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:31.580]   tablet with the phone software.
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:34.060]   It's got SIM card slot phone software.
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:35.420]   So you eight inch note.
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:36.620]   It's an eight inch note.
[01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:40.700]   I still think that if Apple just gets into it, you know, just gets to a point where Apple
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:44.340]   or Android or whatever gets to a point where you're just you're calling people internally
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:48.380]   and it's using their cell or their iMessage or whatever it is.
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:49.900]   And it's just a seamless experience.
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:54.060]   I want to call, you know, I want to call Leo and it just calls them and it uses that.
[01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:55.220]   You know, all of this goes away.
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:57.620]   We don't think about whether they're phones or not phones.
[01:12:57.620 --> 01:12:59.460]   They all have cellular service and they all call each other.
[01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:00.460]   Yeah.
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:03.180]   And I can call someone's laptop or I can call their phone or I can call their iPad, you
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:05.180]   know, and I can decide how it's going to go.
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:06.180]   I don't understand.
[01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:09.900]   I mean, it's just I'm just this is one of the few technologies.
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:10.900]   That's the future.
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:14.580]   Well, I just it's one of these few technologies that I'm surprised that it's taken us this
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:18.020]   long to get there, especially when you see iMessage and FaceTime and I mean, everything
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:19.020]   is almost there.
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:24.060]   It's just I'm sure that there's some legal agreement that's slowing it down, but I'm
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.140]   trying to describe the whole thing is horrible.
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:28.780]   We need to reinvent it.
[01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:31.540]   Go ahead, Danny.
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:35.060]   It's I'm sure it's the legal agreement with carriers, but that's the real fault.
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:36.060]   Not even a legal agreement.
[01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:37.060]   It's just a market pressure.
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:39.940]   It's so hard to get these things actually working correctly.
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:45.780]   It's terrible how if you start iMessage on one device and you try to carry it over onto
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:47.540]   multiple devices.
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:52.820]   I message the message app and the iMessage service just has a horrible, horrible time,
[01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:55.260]   understanding that you've actually moved one place to another.
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:59.620]   There are times when I really feel as though I need to carry two devices with me because
[01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:00.940]   I start out a conversation.
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:04.820]   I'm not sure if someone said this to me as a text message or an iMessage, but it's important
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:09.300]   that if he decides to follow up on me today, that I'd be able to actually receive that.
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:14.420]   It's like, oh, man, I'm really going to be bringing my iPad with me just on the off chance
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:15.420]   I'm going to miss.
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:16.420]   Oh, man.
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:17.420]   This is a pain point.
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:18.420]   This is a friction point.
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:21.220]   Apple's supposed to be good at eliminating those things.
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:24.940]   The biggest thing though is every at Mobile World Congress, everybody is trying to make
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:27.700]   a seven or eight inch tablet now.
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:33.060]   They're all priced to really just make people hopefully ask themselves why they were going
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:38.260]   to spend another extra $100 to $200 on an iPad Mini.
[01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:42.060]   I don't know if that's going to be a pressure point for Apple in the coming year.
[01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:46.620]   I still think that $300 and somewhat dollars is not a great price for the iPad Mini given
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:53.620]   what it's delivering and given what so many other manufacturers are delivering in its place.
[01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:58.860]   What else?
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:05.460]   Qualcomm's got a chip that could put 40 bands into one phone, but with the Rolling Stones
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:08.460]   and not that kind of band.
[01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:11.020]   Hey, you'll hold on one phone.
[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:15.580]   So basically one phone would work on every LTE frequency everywhere.
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:16.580]   One phone to rule them all.
[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:18.140]   Of course, that's what you want.
[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:20.980]   Not just Apple, but everybody wants that because we shouldn't have to build different
[01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:22.220]   phones for different countries.
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:23.220]   We have three.
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:24.740]   There's three iPhone models now.
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:29.060]   One CDMA and then two GSM because there's 35 I think distinct LTE bands.
[01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:30.060]   Holy cow.
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:33.420]   And it's the LTE bands are the problem, not the cell bands.
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:34.420]   It's the LTE bands.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:39.020]   Yeah, because they're all using sometimes using similar spectrum, but different slight
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:42.940]   different categories of bands within that spectrum, like higher or lower parts of it.
[01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:44.540]   It's just it's a bit of a nightmare.
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.980]   Everyone was hoping that LTE would be this big giant leap in compatibility, but everyone
[01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:52.660]   like the train tracks in Europe, everyone did them slightly differently.
[01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:57.780]   So last week, we covered the PlayStation four announcement coming later this year.
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:00.020]   There'll be a new Xbox announcement of nothing.
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:01.580]   It was like the worst announcement ever.
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:06.460]   We're not going to actually show you a controller and they showed some games in development
[01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:09.060]   and they showed the head of an old man.
[01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:10.060]   Right.
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:11.060]   But now wait a minute.
[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:12.060]   Now this is your business.
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:13.060]   Watch the video.
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:14.060]   Did you see?
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:15.060]   I mean, it's pretty cool.
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:16.060]   I didn't watch it.
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:17.060]   You should look.
[01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:19.180]   I mean, the ways he pictures of something that was actually existed.
[01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:22.180]   Well, they were they were talking about the game developers are going to have.
[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:26.460]   They talked about they said it'll be an x86 chip with they talked a little bit about the
[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:27.460]   specs.
[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:28.460]   They showed the controller.
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:30.140]   There's going to be a share button on the controller.
[01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:33.020]   Did you call it wasn't bad, but the content was horrible.
[01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:34.860]   Yeah, it was long to.
[01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:35.860]   Yeah.
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:38.380]   Some people were saying by the time this is over, it'll be out.
[01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:41.580]   The reporters in the press room were trying to chew their legs off to get out of there.
[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:44.820]   I'm so glad I think we covered it.
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:49.660]   Brian Brushwood and Anthony Carboni from Vision 3 and I just sat here and we actually had fun
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:51.700]   doing the coverage and it was pretty pictures.
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:56.860]   But Chad, what was the game where you could was it from the people who did Little Big Planet
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:17:02.060]   where you could build like stuff and they showed how you could make puppets and control
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:03.060]   them with the move.
[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:04.060]   That was media molecule.
[01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:09.140]   And so you could use the move controller to to sort of create play creation.
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:13.020]   So you would create 3D things that you could then animate.
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:19.540]   Yeah, you could bring into a world and they were showing what looked like basically a
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:22.060]   band game.
[01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:23.060]   What do they call those?
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:24.060]   Guitar hero.
[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:25.060]   Guitar hero.
[01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:28.700]   But yeah, but you're instead you make your player and you have the instruments and you
[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:29.700]   go like this.
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:32.100]   Yeah, you just kind of rock out.
[01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:35.740]   I know, it just it was just kind of like just like just why bother?
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:37.900]   I mean, if you're going to just wait until that's what they do.
[01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:38.900]   It's what the game is worth it.
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:39.900]   No, I guess more.
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:45.220]   If this were one day or cloud computing one day, you'll be able to download all your games
[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:47.540]   from PlayStation one to PlayStation three.
[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:51.300]   This is the future we're building towards, but it was it was like a speech of intent.
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:52.300]   There was no problem.
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:53.300]   Don't forget about us.
[01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:59.540]   Yeah, I think this is all about all the new sites that are doing live blogging coverage.
[01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:02.140]   This is a event that was tailored specifically for that.
[01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:07.580]   They really could have been released as probably spend four weeks releasing a video every single
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:11.980]   week highlighting a different part of that so that by the time you do have actual tooled
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:15.420]   up hardware to show off, people are really excited about everything they've heard about
[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:16.420]   it so far.
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:21.340]   But as it is, it feels as though you need to have the six major tech sites live blogging
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:23.540]   from this event and everybody following on Twitter.
[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:28.780]   But the problem is it's like the Oscars where you're putting on a huge show and you're
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:30.500]   hoping people talk about it.
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:32.060]   People might talk about how much it sucked.
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:34.340]   Yeah, which is what happened to the myth.
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:39.100]   If you do a Google on the news item, you get a little bit of information about the new
[01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.100]   console.
[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:43.180]   You get a lot of information about how cheese off the people were covering it.
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:46.380]   Well, here's the good or the Apple related news.
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:53.820]   They're going to make an app for the iPhone that will let you buy games for your PlayStation
[01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:54.980]   4.
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:59.300]   It's a second screen app for the PS4.
[01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:03.260]   It will let you use your smartphone or tablet as a companion device while playing.
[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:08.500]   You can watch your friends play if they have shared their games with an internet connection.
[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:17.100]   The PlayStation app, they showed exploring maps and all sorts of stuff.
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:20.900]   And the app will let you buy new games on the road and download them to the console.
[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:24.940]   So if you hear something like you're doing Mac break weekly and you hear about a game
[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:28.900]   that you want to play in your PS4 where you get home, you just do it on your phone and
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:31.140]   it'll start downloading on your PS4.
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:33.140]   So it'll be there when you get home.
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:36.780]   Interesting how they're all going back to x86 now after making the giant power PC leap
[01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:37.980]   in the last generation.
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:38.980]   Right.
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:40.500]   They had a cell processor.
[01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:41.500]   Amazing.
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:42.660]   But nobody's making the cell processor.
[01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:45.180]   So it's kind of like that was an IBM that made that.
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:46.180]   Yeah.
[01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:48.900]   And now they're talking about how easy it is to port PC games to it, which might be part
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:51.780]   of their pressure as well as they want to get all the big titles on there faster.
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:55.300]   And all the developers love it because that means they can write a game essentially once
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:59.900]   and it'll run on PC's Xbox and PlayStation 4.
[01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:01.380]   So all of that's good for developers.
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.380]   I guess good for gamers.
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:06.180]   Blizzard, that's probably why Blizzard was there saying, "Hey, we're going to have
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:07.180]   Diablo 3."
[01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:08.180]   Yeah.
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:10.980]   Remember that old game that you've already played?
[01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.860]   We're going to put that on the PlayStation, huh?
[01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:15.220]   How about that?
[01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:20.500]   Audible.com updated its iOS app to include, I should mention, they are a sponsor and
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:24.340]   this show and many of our shows to include an iPad version.
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:27.140]   Not, I got to be honest with you.
[01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:28.780]   Not great.
[01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:29.860]   It could be better.
[01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:30.860]   What happened?
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:31.860]   I'm not a lot of you.
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:32.860]   I just use it on my iPhone.
[01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:36.620]   I like it because I finally have a, you know, I used to use the iPhone version, but fine,
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:39.220]   you know, so it's using all the screen real estate.
[01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:42.500]   But well, like, it's like, I don't understand what they did.
[01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:46.180]   Like, for instance, there's, they showed they have the little news stuff that they have
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:47.180]   in the iPhone.
[01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:48.180]   They didn't reformat it for the iPad.
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:51.300]   So it's just these little blocks of text on the full screen.
[01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:52.460]   Little things like that.
[01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:54.300]   It's like, it felt like a little rushed.
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:58.220]   Is it better than just having the 2X?
[01:20:58.220 --> 01:20:59.220]   Yes.
[01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:00.220]   Right.
[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:03.820]   And you can control and you can, you know, it's easier to scrub and all that stuff.
[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:05.060]   And their iPhone app was updated.
[01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:07.580]   And now it's got this big, big finger friendly interface.
[01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:08.700]   So if you're driving as much easier.
[01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:11.860]   I use that big finger friendly interface all the time.
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:15.820]   It's great because I have big fingers.
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:16.900]   There it is.
[01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:20.780]   So there's the, there's the covers.
[01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:23.220]   You know, the one thing that I really dislike, see how light that is?
[01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:24.580]   That's great out text.
[01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:26.220]   That's because it's not on the device.
[01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:30.140]   So it's always like that until you download it, which is not ideal.
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:31.780]   You can barely, you can barely read it.
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:34.020]   But then once you download it, it gets, it gets heavier.
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.180]   There's the little blocks I was talking about.
[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:36.860]   Like they just wasted space.
[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:37.860]   They don't reformat it or anything.
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:38.860]   I don't know.
[01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:39.860]   I should have put at least some graphic under there.
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:40.860]   They look pretty.
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:41.860]   Something.
[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:44.300]   And then they took all of these windows and just jammed them.
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:45.300]   They're not live or anything.
[01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:48.300]   So there's a lot, it feels like there's a lot of stuff that should be live that just
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:49.700]   is a lot of room for improvement.
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:50.700]   Yeah, but that's fine.
[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:53.420]   I mean, at least it's there and you can download the books.
[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:56.820]   It's a better way to listen to Audible books because it keeps track of where you are.
[01:21:56.820 --> 01:22:00.780]   So if you go to your iPhone, then it'll know where you left off the camera.
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:01.780]   It's worth it.
[01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:02.780]   And it's free.
[01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:04.780]   I mean, I shouldn't really complain.
[01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:05.780]   But I will because that's my...
[01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:07.780]   I think I should pay half for that.
[01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:11.100]   Yeah, it should be half off.
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:16.020]   Any other stories you guys want to cover before we get to our picks of the week?
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:17.020]   InstaShare.
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:20.140]   Kind of an airdrop.
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:21.300]   Makes it easy to share between...
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:22.300]   I don't know.
[01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:23.300]   Maybe somebody makes that one of their picks.
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:24.300]   I don't know.
[01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:26.300]   Between your iPad and your desktop.
[01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:27.300]   What?
[01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:28.300]   Nothing.
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:29.300]   We're waiting for Springly.
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:30.300]   We're waiting for our new cycles.
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:31.300]   Our appers international retail strategy.
[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:34.300]   We're going to build stores and we're going to sell stuff.
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:35.300]   I guess.
[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:36.300]   I don't know.
[01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:37.300]   I'm guessing.
[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:38.300]   I'm going to make a lot of money.
[01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:39.300]   I'm guessing.
[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:40.300]   Any stores will have glass.
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:42.300]   Really expensive glass.
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:43.300]   All right.
[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:44.300]   Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:52.300]   Let's take a break and then we will get to our picks.
[01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:54.020]   Renee Ritchie from iMore.com.
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:55.300]   Oh, I didn't ask you.
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:56.300]   Rumor Mill.
[01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:57.300]   Anything?
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:58.300]   Yeah.
[01:22:58.300 --> 01:22:59.300]   Well, yeah.
[01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:01.060]   I was worried for a while that we would have a big empty period in the Spring because
[01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:03.100]   Apple did so many products in the fall.
[01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:06.300]   But now it sounds like we might have some stuff to look forward to this Spring and I'm
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:07.300]   trying to get more details.
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:10.100]   But I wouldn't find any big vacations yet.
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:13.740]   Really a Spring event.
[01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:15.740]   That's interesting.
[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:17.740]   What would they announce?
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:22.540]   Tell me they're not going to do an iPhone out of cycle again or an out of cycle iPad
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:23.540]   again.
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:28.140]   Well, I mean, that is interesting because people are learning to counter program apples.
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:32.540]   We mentioned the 1X and we mentioned the Samsung Galaxy S4 and those are coming out halfway
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:37.780]   through Apple's iPhone 5 cycle and those are going to be popular to get all the attention
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:41.740]   and Apple won't have anything to say until the iPhone 5S and that's typically a year
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:42.740]   away.
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:43.900]   And the same thing with the iPads.
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:48.060]   People are now talking about Galaxy notes and whatever else comes next, more Nexus devices.
[01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:52.220]   So if Apple ever does, like with the iPad Mini or with a large screen iPhone or a cheaper
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:56.900]   iPhone, create more products, then they can perhaps have a fuller year and they'll always
[01:23:56.900 --> 01:24:02.060]   be something next coming out and that sort of answers the consumer cycle problem.
[01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:06.420]   Yeah, but one of the things consumers like Apple for is not releasing too many products
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:10.900]   that too often that it's dagger them better.
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:14.780]   It used to be iPads in the Spring iPhones in the summer and iPod touch in the fall and
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:19.220]   now this year everything was in the fall and maybe too much of a good thing.
[01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:20.220]   Oh, interesting.
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:22.820]   I think they're going to get get into it back into a staggered schedule.
[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:23.820]   I hope so.
[01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:25.020]   Yeah, that's an interesting rumor.
[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:28.780]   So it would be if they do it normally be April.
[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:29.780]   March or April?
[01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:31.860]   Yeah, March I think it might be too soon.
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:32.860]   Interesting.
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:33.860]   I don't know.
[01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:34.860]   They used to have events.
[01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:38.940]   They used to have April used to be the SDK event for iOS and then that moved to summer
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:44.580]   and then the last two years they had the Verizon iPhone event, they had the education event
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:46.460]   and they had another small event.
[01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:51.660]   Well, Mountain Lion preview came out in February and this year there's been nothing so far
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:52.820]   so I think we're due.
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:57.060]   But they're going to have WWDC in June still.
[01:24:57.060 --> 01:24:58.060]   Presumably.
[01:24:58.060 --> 01:24:59.660]   That's why the SDK moved to the summer.
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:00.660]   Right?
[01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:04.660]   But that leaves that big hole in the Spring which I think they kind of have to fill now.
[01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:05.660]   Interesting.
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:08.380]   I'll be very curious what they do.
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:12.220]   Our show today brought to you by Pond 5.
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:18.220]   A great place to go if you are a media maker of any kind for a couple of reasons.
[01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:21.940]   One, media makers can sell their media at Pond 5 which is awesome.
[01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:23.100]   P-O-N-D5.com.
[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:30.220]   But of course if you do PowerPoint or if you're a podcaster, if you're creating content
[01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:35.620]   of any kind, it's really nice to have all of the different stuff you can get at Pond 5.
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:38.020]   All those pictures out there that you download when you Google.
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:39.020]   Then that's not.
[01:25:39.020 --> 01:25:40.020]   Google Mountains.
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:42.020]   You're not allowed to use those just in case you're wondering.
[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:46.740]   You could use them at home and then you have to do attribution.
[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:50.220]   But most of them out there that someone actually owns those and if you're going to put them
[01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:53.100]   on your ad, you pay for that.
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:55.300]   Pond5.com, it's called royalty free.
[01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:58.460]   That means you pay once and you can continue to use that media for you.
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:03.860]   And a lot of when it's not royalty free, you're paying literally per usage.
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:04.860]   Right.
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:09.220]   You know, $150 every time you use it and really the future is stuff.
[01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:17.900]   They have 1.4 million stock videos, 373,000 music and sound effects cuts, 8.2 million
[01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:18.900]   photos.
[01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:25.420]   They've got, I mean, 8.2 and then thousands of new ones every week and go through the browser.
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:26.980]   They're one of the things I really like about Pond5.
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:32.100]   If you go through the browser, it makes it really easy to see the photos and then to
[01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:34.700]   see the price.
[01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:38.580]   And here's a stock photo of a happy man with a laptop.
[01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:41.340]   It's just $6.25.
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:42.980]   There's a happy man with a laptop.
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:46.780]   You can imagine you're putting together a brochure and you want to talk about, you know,
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:48.060]   think about working at home.
[01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:49.060]   You know, then there's a guy.
[01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:50.060]   There's a happy guy.
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:52.460]   If you work for Yahoo, not so fast.
[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:55.260]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:56.260]   There's a free stock.
[01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:57.620]   Here's this free stock video clip every week.
[01:26:57.620 --> 01:26:58.740]   There's a free stock video clip.
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:02.140]   This one is ants running in a line.
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:05.020]   Let me just take a look at this one.
[01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:08.300]   And by the way, these are 1080p in most cases, high definition.
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:10.220]   Some of them are even higher definition.
[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:16.100]   Now that one, you see the watermark, but that's gone if you get the free copy, obviously,
[01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:18.780]   if you buy it, it's gone.
[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:19.780]   So here's the deal.
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:22.500]   We're going to do is we're going to set you up because we'd like you to get an experience
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:25.140]   of what it's like to buy a stock media from Pond5.
[01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:28.100]   So we're going to set you up with 50 free files.
[01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:29.420]   You'll create an account of Pond5.
[01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:33.860]   You'll use the browser, see the files, download them all, and what that does is it gets you
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:38.380]   used to using Pond5 so that the next time when you know I need some particle physics,
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:44.900]   I need an after effects of my text, you will know, oh, I should just run over to Pond5.
[01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:49.020]   I've already got the account and pick it up.
[01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:55.220]   So go to pond5.com/macbreak for 50 free stock media files.
[01:27:55.220 --> 01:27:56.220]   That's really unusual.
[01:27:56.220 --> 01:28:00.580]   And it is very unusual to have something built out all in after effects and other things.
[01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:03.740]   So when you're seeing those images there, that means you're going to open up that
[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:06.260]   after effects file and change the text.
[01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:09.020]   And so there's a very complex open.
[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:10.420]   And it also means you can customize it.
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:14.980]   So all these animations, that's a 3D camera move inside of after effects.
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:17.500]   You can go in and change it a little bit and adjust it typically.
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:18.500]   Full control, yeah.
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:21.020]   Well, and here's the other side, and I'll just mention this briefly.
[01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:24.820]   If you're the kind of person who does those kinds of things, you can sell them on Pond5.
[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:27.900]   They have the best royalty rate in the business and you set your own price.
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:31.260]   So you determine what you want for your stuff.
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:32.260]   That's really cool.
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:34.620]   You would ink in the water and all that.
[01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:36.180]   Anyway, Pond5.
[01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:37.180]   Seven dollars.
[01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:38.180]   Seven dollars.
[01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:39.180]   It's like what?
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:40.180]   I know.
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:44.020]   And the way we, a lot of times when we're thinking about stock photography, we're oftentimes
[01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:45.900]   just thinking about how long would it take us to do it.
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:51.460]   Like you go, oh, that might cost this, but thinking about it cost me more than $7.
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:55.820]   Like, think about going out and talking to someone to take that own photo.
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:29:00.460]   That photo represents, you're taking advantage of mass production because that photo represents
[01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:03.220]   a day of work or more.
[01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:05.020]   And that's going to be more than $7.
[01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:06.020]   Let's wrap this thing up.
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:07.020]   We've got to wrap it up.
[01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:08.020]   Pond5.com/Macbreak.
[01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:09.500]   Somebody's got to be out of here at 1U.
[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:10.500]   I have to leave.
[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:11.660]   What are you slowing us down for?
[01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:12.660]   I'm sorry.
[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:13.660]   I'm ready to do my pick.
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:14.660]   Let me do my pick.
[01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:15.660]   And then I'm going out of here.
[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:16.660]   Do your pick.
[01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:17.660]   Okay, here's the pick.
[01:29:17.660 --> 01:29:18.660]   And then I'll see Alex Linden pixel.
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:21.500]   So my pick for the week is Adam Wilt is incredible.
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.100]   He's the kind of guy that I read.
[01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:26.340]   I read his stuff to figure out how video should work.
[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:31.340]   And he has put out an app for the iPhone called the Cinimeter.
[01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:32.340]   So Cinimeter.
[01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:33.340]   Yeah.
[01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:38.540]   And it's what it is basically scopes for your iPhone.
[01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:43.520]   And so if you're trying to figure out a green screen or figure out how your exposure
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:52.100]   set up and or just have some good clean fun, you know, because I mean scopes to me is
[01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:55.340]   not quite as good as plans versus zombies, but just short.
[01:29:55.340 --> 01:30:00.540]   It's only $4.99 and you're able to do a lot of especially as I said, you know, really
[01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:05.300]   looking at a background, you know, checking out your lighting, whether it's even doing
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:09.060]   a lot of things that would technically, I mean, when I started using meters just to
[01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:13.140]   kind of scopes, just to make sure you're these were like $10,000 each.
[01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:14.740]   And now it's $4.99 on your iPhone.
[01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:15.740]   Wow.
[01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:17.140]   And so how do you get the video?
[01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:20.820]   Oh, you just use the built in camera and built in camera and that's good enough to do
[01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:21.820]   this.
[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:26.100]   It's part that's a little bit of a toy and things, but a lot of times what you can do
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:30.540]   with this is figure out evenness of lighting and so on and so forth.
[01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:33.980]   So especially if you're trying to get a really even green screen or something like that,
[01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:34.980]   it's qualitative.
[01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:39.540]   It doesn't really matter if it's if it's right on, but it does give you some ideas of
[01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:41.580]   what that exposure is going to look like.
[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:43.540]   It does have some really interesting controls of rise.
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:47.100]   So shutter so and so forth so that you could actually get an idea this.
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:50.140]   You still want to look at scopes through your actual camera to really know what's going
[01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:51.140]   on.
[01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:58.140]   But for evaluating qualitatively what you're looking at, it's a pretty interesting product.
[01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:01.820]   So and at $4.99 as I said, it's pretty pretty nifty.
[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:05.660]   So should we have the shooting again, if you're shooting with your iPhone, then this is very
[01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:06.660]   valuable.
[01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:08.980]   So if you're going to if you're going to do something, if you're going to do a little
[01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:13.820]   shoot with your iPhone and and you want to make sure that it you've locked it's you know,
[01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:17.500]   all of its little bits and pieces, then this is this is great.
[01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:22.500]   E-I-N-E meter is an I phone app.
[01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:26.900]   So you have to if you're in an iPad, you got to just click that iPhone tab to see it.
[01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:27.900]   Yes.
[01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:29.140]   There's great iPad version.
[01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:30.140]   It's cool.
[01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:31.140]   Wow.
[01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:32.180]   That's kind of amazing.
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:33.420]   Could we use that here?
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:34.420]   You could if you're using iPhones.
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:36.580]   I mean, for that kind of thing, if you're shooting with a light.
[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:39.820]   But like if just to look at a set to make sure that the lights right or you would typically
[01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:42.300]   go through your actual cameras and do that with your scopes.
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:45.340]   So you would right you would use something like scope box, you know, so scope box is
[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:47.540]   what we would use we would we would run on it.
[01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:49.420]   I was like 50 bucks or something like that.
[01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:52.700]   So it's you know, so you run it through scope box or for free you run it through.
[01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:53.700]   Condo, that's what we do.
[01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:54.700]   See, there's Chad show.
[01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:56.700]   Yeah, he's got he's got scopes built into it.
[01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:57.700]   That's in the yet you know, caster.
[01:31:57.700 --> 01:31:58.700]   Yep.
[01:31:58.700 --> 01:31:59.700]   So that's built in.
[01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:01.500]   We use that to I used to use that all the time to set the lighting.
[01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:05.460]   So he won you told me 80% right for your face your face.
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:09.380]   So I would move my head like this and say, okay, there's my face on the scope.
[01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:10.860]   Now let's make that 80%.
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:13.260]   Once you get once you're right there.
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:17.260]   Once you there you go, see you go and once you get once you get used to knowing what
[01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:20.380]   you're looking at on a scope, it really is very useful.
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:22.340]   Chad, do you know what you're looking at?
[01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:27.140]   Yeah, well, and luckily these scopes on these on this tricaster, a lot better than the old
[01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:28.140]   one.
[01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:29.540]   Yeah, you can see color.
[01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:31.260]   So so it's much it.
[01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:35.020]   Yeah, like in high school, it was black and white, right, like we were green.
[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:39.180]   Yeah, you have the 850 extreme and that really I have to say it is a lot better.
[01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:40.180]   Right.
[01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:41.940]   And so you can see skin tone in here.
[01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:44.140]   So I know that you know my head right here.
[01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:45.780]   This is actually my shirt.
[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:46.780]   Right.
[01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:49.740]   Well, that down there is your shirt, but that's your that's because I have a flesh color.
[01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:50.740]   Right.
[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:54.140]   Some people probably watching the show now think I'm not wearing clothing, but it's it's a
[01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:56.220]   flesh colored shirt.
[01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:58.580]   So you know, Rene rich.
[01:32:58.580 --> 01:32:59.580]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:00.580]   Thank you.
[01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:01.580]   I gotta go.
[01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:02.580]   All right.
[01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:03.580]   Thanks for everybody.
[01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:04.580]   Thank you very much.
[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:10.500]   We got two people in the studio audience and you almost broke the table again.
[01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:11.500]   Are they rich?
[01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:12.500]   You're pick of the week, sir.
[01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:16.780]   My pick of the week, it is not new, but it has got a whole new aspect to it.
[01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:18.580]   And that is app.net.
[01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:21.340]   They announced their free tier yesterday.
[01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:24.020]   So previously originally app.net was a platform.
[01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:28.500]   And then when Twitter became less developer friendly, they pivoted quickly and they made
[01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:32.820]   a Twitter like micro blogging service and you could do almost everything you could with
[01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:35.140]   Twitter, but they didn't stop with that.
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:40.260]   They made a messaging platform, which was kind of like DMS, but it's much more fully featured.
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:42.260]   It has groups and all these different things.
[01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:46.060]   And then they announced a files API, which is kind of sort of like cloud storage like
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:47.060]   Dropbox.
[01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:50.060]   So you get so many gigs of free storage with your account.
[01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:52.380]   And now as of yesterday, you can get a free account.
[01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:57.060]   You can only follow 40 people with it and you have limited storage and you have to be
[01:33:57.060 --> 01:33:58.060]   invited right now.
[01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:01.700]   They haven't opened the floodgates yet, but it gives people a chance to try it out.
[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:02.980]   And I like the audacity of them.
[01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:04.460]   They're a very young company.
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:07.380]   They're a very fast moving company.
[01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:11.740]   And it looks like they're trying to invent, not invent, but popularize this idea of a
[01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:18.740]   very personal, very flexible cloud platform that is both friendly for users and very open
[01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:20.020]   for developers.
[01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:22.540]   And you don't have to worry about advertising because they don't do it.
[01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:25.740]   You don't have to worry about any corporate interest.
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:28.820]   They've really aligned it for users and developers.
[01:34:28.820 --> 01:34:32.460]   And if you've ever tried app.net, it's very interesting.
[01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:36.940]   But that 50 and now $36 price eventually might have put you off.
[01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:40.620]   So if you can find an invitation now, you can get in for free and give it a shot.
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:45.100]   And I recommend the folks who do tap, what is it?
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:46.100]   Tapbot.
[01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:47.100]   Tapbot.
[01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:48.100]   Yeah.
[01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:50.100]   Have a app.net version of that, which is excellent.
[01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:51.100]   Next bot.
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:52.100]   And it's free now.
[01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:53.100]   Netbot.
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:56.300]   So, yeah, get the free, you know, if you can get the invitation of the free account,
[01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:57.700]   I paid 100 bucks for app.net.
[01:34:57.700 --> 01:34:59.300]   You know, I never use it.
[01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:05.020]   I think in a way, this is a, this is a last ditch effort to get it, get some users in.
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:06.020]   It's very geeky now.
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:09.700]   I still use Twitter because that's where the audience is, the people who read my writing,
[01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:11.140]   the mainstream people are on Twitter.
[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:15.100]   But a lot of the geeks, the developers, the programmers, all of that conversation has
[01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:16.660]   moved to app.net.
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:19.140]   So it's got its own identity now and that's really interesting.
[01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:20.140]   I should log in.
[01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:22.060]   I haven't used it in a while.
[01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:23.860]   Andy and not co.
[01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:25.820]   Here pick of the week.
[01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:30.340]   Mine is a really cool product that is, it's one of those perfect little products.
[01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:34.940]   I travel with like a $200 like little portable Bluetooth speaker.
[01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:37.740]   And it's great because if you're, you know, if you're in your hotel room, you want to
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:41.020]   be able to have a little bit of a better experience with your music and your movies,
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:46.260]   but you don't necessarily always want to travel with a brick that has cost you 200 bucks.
[01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:50.060]   You know, me really all you want is for, you want this speaker, but you just want it to
[01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:51.300]   be a little bit louder.
[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:54.740]   So simplest thing in the world, that's a product called Soundbender.
[01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:56.540]   And this is what it is.
[01:35:56.540 --> 01:36:02.740]   All it is, is a plastic, little plastic equivalent of just doing this with your hand.
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:08.980]   It's got a magnet, so it just simply clips right to a, any, to any iPad that will use
[01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:13.820]   a, the magnetic cover automatically aligns itself over the speaker port.
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:16.500]   And all it does is it does the spinal tap thing.
[01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:19.180]   It's, if you got it, it just makes it one louder.
[01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:23.260]   So I don't know if it's going to actually come across on the magic or radio, but so
[01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:27.260]   here's, here's, here's the iPad without it.
[01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:34.700]   And now it doesn't amplify it.
[01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:38.340]   It just folks, it just directs the audio directly toward you.
[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:41.180]   It's like a little ear for your iPad.
[01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:42.180]   Exactly.
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:43.180]   And that really is all it is.
[01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:47.660]   I mean, this is something that I do all the time, like when I'm trying to watch him watch
[01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:51.820]   something, I'll got my iPhone, I'll like cup my hand around it just to like redirect
[01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:54.820]   the audio, but this will do it for you.
[01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:59.160]   And as I said, it's a perfect little product because this, I'm sort of stealing myself
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:04.740]   as I'm, as someone is like recommending this to me as I'm saying, okay, is it a piece of
[01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:05.740]   crap?
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:09.020]   Like no, it's, I mean, it's plastic, but it's durable plastic.
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:10.020]   It's flexible.
[01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:11.020]   So you can put it inside your bag.
[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:14.380]   It's not going to, it's not screw up the magnet aligns itself automatically.
[01:37:14.380 --> 01:37:15.380]   So it's easy to use.
[01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:19.700]   And then the last thing I'm sort of stealing myself for is yeah, but then see decided to
[01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.620]   charge $40 for this piece of plastic.
[01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:22.620]   Nope.
[01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:23.620]   It's $12.99.
[01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:26.540]   You can easily afford just to grab one of these or grab a couple of these and just happen
[01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:27.900]   in your bag as you go.
[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:31.900]   So I mean, for $12.99, that's not a, that's not a whole lot of money for a, for a little
[01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:34.820]   gadget that does some pretty cool stuff.
[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:36.420]   You recommend it.
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:37.420]   I recommend it again.
[01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:39.660]   It's $12.99 for 20 bucks.
[01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:44.020]   I'd be like, I don't know, but for $12.99 for something you will probably buy and you'll
[01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:45.660]   toss it inside your bag.
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:48.940]   And then maybe you'll forget about it until you're in the coffee shop or in like you're
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:52.100]   waiting for a bus somewhere without your headphones or you're in your hotel room and
[01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:54.820]   you're like, Oh, wait a minute, I have that thing in my bag that I bought three weeks
[01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:55.820]   ago and forgot about.
[01:37:55.820 --> 01:37:56.820]   Oh, yes, this is perfect.
[01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:57.820]   This is wonderful.
[01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:00.940]   It's great for gaming and movies and anything you're using your iPad and your laptop.
[01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:02.420]   You have one too.
[01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:03.420]   And there's a lot of different kinds.
[01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:06.860]   I haven't tried that one, but at CES and Mac world, everyone was making those kinds
[01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:10.660]   of things for Mac, for iPhones and for iPads and they worked really well.
[01:38:10.660 --> 01:38:11.660]   Huh.
[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:12.660]   It's not an uncommon idea.
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:16.780]   There's, I've had, we've had things like this for like the original iPhone, like since
[01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:20.500]   the days, the original iPhone, what I like about it is that they didn't overthink it.
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:21.780]   They didn't try to make it so big.
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:23.340]   They don't want to carry it around.
[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:27.060]   And again, they didn't charge a stupid amount of money for it.
[01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:32.100]   But this is 1299 is roughly the roughly about what you, you know, for a nice, he made product.
[01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:33.500]   Okay, that'll work for me.
[01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:34.500]   Yeah.
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:35.500]   I'm 50 bucks.
[01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:36.500]   I've a little win.
[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:37.500]   Yeah.
[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:38.500]   Exactly.
[01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:39.500]   It was a Kickstarter.
[01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:43.100]   It's like you always be aware of those Kickstarter projects where someone like borrowed a white
[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:47.100]   bed sheet from their mom and hung up behind them and get and so they put themselves like
[01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:50.860]   off the kilter saying, it's not just redirecting sound.
[01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:57.780]   It doesn't compromise the battery and the design is CNC precision, C4 grade build aluminum.
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:01.380]   We really think it's the best audio enhancement that's ever been made for the iPad.
[01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:02.380]   I'll buy it.
[01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:04.380]   I'll buy anything on Kickstarter.
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:05.380]   Yeah.
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:07.860]   Still waiting for my business, but this is a Kickstarter.
[01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:10.020]   It's the rather more traditional direct.
[01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:11.860]   You give the money and they send you a thing.
[01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:13.180]   You can buy it now.
[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:14.180]   Exactly.
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:16.980]   No, it's it's a go to the soundbender.com.
[01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:17.980]   You give the money.
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:18.980]   They send you a thing.
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:19.980]   It's amazing.
[01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:23.060]   Is there an app that's written out with like a number of people that I can wait and I'm
[01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:24.900]   used to waiting in line for apps and for accessories.
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:27.540]   Now I need to be told that's 300,000 people ahead of me before.
[01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:28.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:29.540]   That's a fun.
[01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:30.540]   So I finally got mailbox boy.
[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:33.140]   It was a long time to do.
[01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:34.500]   But I finally got it.
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:37.660]   And now I got another one that's that's doing the same thing.
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:38.820]   Yeah, tempo.
[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:39.820]   Yeah.
[01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:44.900]   I was going to show some of these, but I can't because I'm on the list.
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:45.900]   Yeah.
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:47.820]   Have you gotten through to tempo yet?
[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:52.740]   One of our writers, they set up one of our writers with mailbox and I think with tempo.
[01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:53.740]   Mailbox is awesome.
[01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:55.580]   And I should actually next time I'll show it.
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:58.820]   Although I'm sure Sarah has showed it on i5 for the iPhone.
[01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:02.060]   It's an iPhone app that is a better way to do email and I have to agree it is.
[01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:04.340]   It's a much better way to do email.
[01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:06.820]   And then tempo is like a calendar app, right?
[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:07.820]   Yeah.
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:08.820]   And they're all server-side.
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:11.060]   So they've had some issues where they've gone down and they've come back up and they're
[01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:12.060]   trying to deal with the demand.
[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:13.060]   Right.
[01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:14.060]   No, I understand what they're doing.
[01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:15.060]   Gmail did that too.
[01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:16.580]   Where in fact it was a very hot invitation.
[01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:19.380]   Remember when they first launched Gmail to get in?
[01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:20.820]   Line up so that new invitations.
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:21.820]   Yeah.
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:22.820]   Yeah.
[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:25.940]   And it's cool because the app, what you do is you get a reservation code, you enter
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:32.340]   into the app and then it says, you know, there's 251,000 people ahead of you.
[01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:34.020]   There's 8 million people behind you.
[01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:35.100]   So that's where you are online.
[01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:39.340]   And then when you first launch the app each time it goes, the number goes down and eventually
[01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:40.340]   you get in.
[01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:41.900]   It's actually kind of a good idea.
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:43.620]   It's cool.
[01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:45.580]   But that's my story and I'm sticking with it.
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:46.580]   All right.
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:47.580]   Hey, thank you very much for being here.
[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:49.060]   I'm Moors Renee, Richie.
[01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:54.620]   I-M-O-R-E.com is a great place for Apple information of all kinds.
[01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:57.340]   I say rumors all the time, but it's really just one of the many things you do.
[01:40:57.340 --> 01:40:59.940]   It's a really good blog, really good app blog.
[01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:03.260]   Last night I had the pleasure of recording a team up show.
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:08.820]   We got Guy English and Mark Edwards from Bajango, Lauren Bricter who did Tweety and
[01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:12.540]   Letter Press and Sebastian DeWitch was with Apple and now Double Twist.
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:17.340]   And we spent an hour talking about future interfaces like the Connect and Siri and Google
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:18.340]   now.
[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:20.180]   Oh, I got to listen to that.
[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:21.180]   We just posted it.
[01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:22.740]   So it just went up on the site about an hour ago.
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:25.980]   So imore.com and then just look for the podcast?
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:27.620]   Yeah, it's in both feeds.
[01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:29.180]   It's in both debug and iterates.
[01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:30.780]   So you can try either of them.
[01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:31.780]   Oh, awesome.
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:32.780]   I really want it.
[01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:33.780]   That sounds really interesting.
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:36.380]   Yeah, there are some really smart guys.
[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:37.380]   Yeah.
[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:39.060]   All right.
[01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:43.260]   Thank you for being here, Renee and I, Andy Inacos of the Chicago Sun Times and the Solace
[01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:47.540]   Jill Wist of bandwidth, www.cwob.com and joins us every week.
[01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:49.060]   You were great on Twitch this week.
[01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:50.060]   Thank you for doing that.
[01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:51.060]   I appreciate it.
[01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:52.580]   It's nice to be there at the nighttime.
[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:53.580]   Yeah.
[01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:54.580]   It was really fun to have you.
[01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:56.060]   We got to do that more often.
[01:41:56.060 --> 01:41:57.300]   I would like to do that more often.
[01:41:57.300 --> 01:41:58.300]   A little cross-pollination.
[01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:00.260]   Well, I know, you know, I never know.
[01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:05.420]   Sometimes people, you know, are busy and it's the weekend.
[01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:07.820]   I don't want to take in, eat into your Sunday night.
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:11.700]   Sunday night has traditionally been like, there's always been good things on TV on Sunday night.
[01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:14.620]   And because I don't have to get kids ready for school, it's always been like, I'm going
[01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:15.620]   to be home.
[01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:18.220]   I'm going to be sitting down and be looking at a screen and be good school to begin that
[01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:21.460]   evening by sitting down looking at a screen and seeing your smiling face behind you.
[01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:23.820]   This Sunday, oh, it was the Academy Awards.
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:26.220]   I felt so what a waste of four hours.
[01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:27.220]   Oh my God.
[01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:29.860]   That was not pretty horrible.
[01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:32.740]   At the end of it, I'm thinking, God, why did I do this?
[01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:34.020]   I felt I only saw it on Twitter.
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:35.020]   I didn't actually watch it.
[01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:36.020]   Yeah.
[01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:37.020]   Well, it was a lot on Twitter.
[01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:41.140]   Yeah, this snark level of Twitter pegged.
[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:43.340]   I was hoping it would fail well, but no such luck.
[01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:47.780]   Yeah, no, it's handling that traffic pretty well now.
[01:42:47.780 --> 01:42:49.220]   I like Seth MacFarlane.
[01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:54.140]   I'm a family guy fan, but man, I like Captain Kirk.
[01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:59.460]   But the two together, not so much.
[01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:00.460]   I don't know.
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:02.940]   I think the, I don't know what's going on with that show.
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:08.180]   Also, I have to have some sympathy forum from that show because he likes singing.
[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:09.180]   He's very proud of his singing.
[01:43:09.180 --> 01:43:10.980]   He's released, produced with his own singing.
[01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:13.780]   And of course, he's going to open up the show with by seeing a couple numbers.
[01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:18.420]   But of course, at some point, the producers have to inform that, oh, by the way, also
[01:43:18.420 --> 01:43:22.860]   on the bill are going to be three of the most brilliant vocalists of the 20th century.
[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:26.260]   Oh, and by the way, we're going to have Barbara Streisand as a surprise guest.
[01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:30.500]   So if you're creating on the curve, you're not going to get a good New York.
[01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:32.860]   Good in a tuxedo though, very sharp in a tuxedo.
[01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:34.940]   That's a very expensive, nicely tailored.
[01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:36.260]   No one can fault his tuxedo.
[01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:38.180]   No one can fault his tuxedo.
[01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:41.020]   I'm sure that his friends will tell them that was a great, great tuxedo.
[01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:43.540]   I'm hearing the great buzz in the feedback.
[01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:46.940]   Well, and if you can find the moment your tuxedo back next year.
[01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:48.460]   Tuxedo subreddit.
[01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:52.020]   If you can find the moment where Shirley Bassey sings gold finger, it's probably worth fast
[01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:54.620]   forwarding to that as well.
[01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:55.620]   Because that was good.
[01:43:55.620 --> 01:43:58.100]   Fast forward past the first 20 seconds though.
[01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:02.900]   I think I wonder if the monitors were off a little bit because it seems so it took about
[01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:06.780]   20 seconds for her and the band to orchestra to get in sync with each other.
[01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:11.540]   Well, because the band was down the road in the Capitol Records building.
[01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:13.580]   Oh, oh, that's where they're cutting away.
[01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:14.820]   Oh, that was smart.
[01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:15.860]   No, no, she was.
[01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:17.700]   No, she was at the Dolby Theatre.
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:17.900]   Right.
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:20.100]   The band was down the road.
[01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:24.420]   I didn't I didn't know that the orchestra was not inside the orchestra was not in the same room.
[01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:25.020]   What?
[01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:26.820]   Yeah, what?
[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:29.020]   And oh, show on and on and on.
[01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:31.900]   And then the Abe Lincoln joke somebody mentioned that was it.
[01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:35.580]   That was the lowest point I've ever in my in history.
[01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:36.620]   And then goes too soon.
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:40.100]   Yes, as a matter of fact, might have been.
[01:44:40.100 --> 01:44:44.060]   And I'm not sure exactly why the first lady was giving the Oscar for best movie.
[01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:48.980]   But you know, whatever her advisors thought, no, that was a bad idea.
[01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:54.540]   Oh, anyway, I don't know why we got into that just because I know Andy, you're a fan.
[01:44:54.540 --> 01:44:56.340]   I'm a fan of the Oscars.
[01:44:56.340 --> 01:45:02.300]   Although without without turn this into another hour of the show, it's like I'm I'm amazed
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:07.460]   that we're asked like five years ago, I would be really the Oscars was like my super bowl.
[01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:08.820]   I'm really excited about it.
[01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:09.020]   Yeah.
[01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:10.180]   I have like my scorecards.
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:10.260]   Yeah.
[01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:10.540]   Right.
[01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:16.660]   All about this year it was we ended the show and 10 minutes 10 minutes before like the
[01:45:16.660 --> 01:45:17.700]   Oscars are going to start.
[01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:22.420]   And yet I sat here for about 50 minutes, just like fiddling with like hardware settings
[01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:24.220]   and then went back upstairs and then debated.
[01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:29.020]   Do I watch the first half hour of amazing race on DVR or do I join the Oscars in progress?
[01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:29.620]   Yeah.
[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:30.020]   Yeah.
[01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:31.180]   Here's what I'm saying.
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:35.140]   I'm watching the whole thing and and then I'm sorry I did.
[01:45:35.140 --> 01:45:36.140]   Yeah.
[01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:37.580]   I'm really hopeful.
[01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:38.180]   Oh, really?
[01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:40.500]   Four event Oscars, PlayStation for event.
[01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:40.940]   Oscar.
[01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:41.700]   Yeah.
[01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:41.980]   Yeah.
[01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:43.580]   No, that should.
[01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:46.180]   I think I would vote for the PlayStation for event.
[01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:50.740]   They should if the producers are fishing for who to book for next year, not not necessarily
[01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:52.100]   as host, but as producers.
[01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:56.380]   They should find out what team does Apple's keynote events and say you're doing the Oscars
[01:45:56.380 --> 01:45:56.980]   next year.
[01:45:56.980 --> 01:45:58.140]   Well, you know what I found out?
[01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:00.220]   I'm reading the snark column on deadline.
[01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:04.780]   And what I found out is the guys who produced the Oscars are the same guys who produced
[01:46:04.780 --> 01:46:10.900]   Chicago, which is why they kept having Chicago, which came out musical number and musical
[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:15.940]   tribute to the 10th anniversary of the race of Chicago and in our medley of great music
[01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:16.220]   songs.
[01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:17.740]   How about a number from Chicago?
[01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:18.260]   Chicago.
[01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:19.100]   It's like why?
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:21.540]   And then now I understand.
[01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:25.460]   And then I think Seth MacFarlane hit it on the or maybe it was Captain Kirk hit it on
[01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:27.500]   the head next year, Tina and Amy.
[01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:33.500]   OK, just anyway.
