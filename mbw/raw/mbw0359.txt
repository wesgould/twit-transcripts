[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.720]   Just came out right before the show.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.400]   We also have some rumors about Apple buying the company
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.520]   that makes Connect for Microsoft.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.240]   It's all next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.080]   Not just the Macintosh.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.120]   Oh, no.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.680]   iOS 7, the App Store, the Watch, the TV,
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.440]   all of the imaginary Apple products.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.600]   Here he is, Mr. Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun Times,
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.760]   our expert in the US, south of the 49th parallel.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.800]   Then up north of the 49th parallel from iMore.com
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.800]   and Montreal's very own Renee Ritchie.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.640]   Aylia, how are you?
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.720]   Good to see you both.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.080]   It's just the three of us today.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.640]   I thought Alex was going to have all this bandwidth somewhere.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.400]   He's in Mexico City at the moment.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.320]   And he said he had a lot of bandwidth where he was going.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.800]   I'm sure he does, but he also has a gig.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.560]   He's at working.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.920]   He's a working man.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.760]   How fun.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.520]   Man.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.880]   It's just fun to watch him.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.240]   It's like, where's Waldo?
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.480]   Apparently, the local merchants at Petaluma
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.720]   are doing a promotion to get you to shop local,
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.440]   where if you spot Waldo in the store, you get some deal.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.000]   And one of our interns has been co-opted as a Waldo,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.840]   was wandering around the studio in striped T-shirt and a cap.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.080]   Now, usually the thrust of the where's Waldo puzzle
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.680]   is that there are 1,000 people in the puzzle.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.720]   One of those Waldo.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.280]   This is the opposite.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.760]   Exactly.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.800]   If you're at a diner with a capacity of 10 people,
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   I'm sure it's kind of not--
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.240]   Waldo is a person, a person.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.040]   You don't need to have a CHP roadblock.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.520]   The words sore thumb leap to mind.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.720]   So Apple, Apple, Apple, you little devil dog, you,
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.480]   they released a new version of Logic, Logic Pro 10,
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.480]   with virtual drummer flex pitch, a free iPad component.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.240]   And it's $199.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.520]   It's in the App Store and there's no upgrade.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.120]   If you have the original.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.360]   Right.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.960]   Which I did.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.200]   And I bought it in the App Store.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.400]   So this is a little frustrating, because Henry uses
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.040]   this like crazy.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.680]   He loves making this.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.360]   I don't know.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.960]   He calls him his dubs.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.440]   I don't know what the hell he's doing.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.320]   But we bought the packaged version first.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.160]   And I actually bought Logic Express first.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.800]   Then I bought the Full Logic Pro package edition.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.680]   And then about a year ago, I bought it on the--
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.560]   I saw it was on the App Store.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.840]   I said, oh, good.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.760]   I'll buy it on the App Store.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.720]   That way it'll always be up to date.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.840]   It was until this morning, Leo.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.560]   I bought it two weeks ago on the Mac App Store.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.080]   No, you did not.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.960]   I did.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.760]   $199, two weeks ago.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.640]   And there's no upgrade route for you?
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.880]   I was on this show.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.400]   Jason Snow convinced me that it was a fantastic piece of software.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.800]   So I bought-- I mean, I could go to the iTunes receipt
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.040]   and hit Report a Problem and ask for a cheesy refund.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.360]   But this is the same thing that happened with Tweety.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.360]   Tweety-2 was a new app.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.160]   Versions of Twitter have been the same app.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.560]   There's no upgrade pricing in any of Apple's stores.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.640]   And everyone was waiting to see what Apple would do
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.840]   when one of their major pro apps got a new version.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.240]   And I worked with some of them were updated.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.760]   Yeah, because maybe they would do it for free.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.200]   And some people didn't like that idea,
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.760]   because it would devalue software further.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.360]   But Apple's-- they're not only not doing a sale
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.640]   to give everyone an upgrade price.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.640]   They're just putting out at $199 again.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.000]   So a new app is a new upgrade.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.440]   So it's probably worth one.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.360]   I mean, there's a lot of new stuff.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.280]   I just-- it seems like there should be a middle ground.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.880]   I understand Apple doesn't want to give this away.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.720]   But it seems like there should be a middle ground
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.440]   where you could offer an upgrade to existing users.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.920]   Is that-- why is that impossible in the app store?
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.480]   I don't understand.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.760]   We have computers now.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.320]   Surely they can figure this out.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.640]   Well, it might be difficult to do with the standard checkout
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.640]   process, but you're right.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.720]   It'd be nice if everybody who complained about it said
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.560]   had the ability to simply get a credit--
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.360]   not necessarily refund to their credit card,
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.920]   but fine, here is $x refunded to your iTunes account.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.520]   They've done that before, versus when
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.680]   they reduced the price of the iPhone.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.120]   They wouldn't refund the money that you spent too much of when
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.840]   they reduced the price.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.640]   But they said, well, we'll give you a gift card
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.960]   so you can spend some of that money at the back of the Apple
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.760]   store.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.880]   I mean, there's not much you can do about it.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.120]   At some point, you have to decide
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.680]   that this thing is important enough to you,
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.320]   the need on it right now.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.600]   But when you talk-- you're right.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.760]   When you talk about this is an Apple product sold
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.760]   on an Apple store, it seems as though there are solutions
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.000]   at hand that Apple could do if they want to do.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.480]   But perhaps they just don't think people can raise a big enough
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.000]   thing about it.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.080]   They will.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.320]   And not that it's not a good deal of $200.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.400]   But Renee is a perfect example.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.320]   If somebody bought it in the last six months,
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.200]   it's crazy to have to pay a full price for an upgrade.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.520]   The full price is crazy.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.560]   I mean, Apple's had language in the App Store
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.800]   to talk about upgrades since iOS 3, I think.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.240]   People get little pop-up saying you qualify for upgrade
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.720]   pricing.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.880]   And every time they'd write and send it to us and say,
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.080]   look, look, Apple's playing with upgrades.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.800]   But it looks like their policy is that low price software
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.040]   replaces upgrades.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.080]   The original final-- sorry, the original Logic Pro in the box
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.840]   was, I think, $500.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.520]   And $200 is an upgrade price for $500.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.920]   But Apple is saying, everything is low priced now.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.880]   There's no more upgrades.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.720]   But it's like those stores, right?
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.760]   Every day, low prices for software for everyone.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.440]   And you know how well that worked for JCPenney.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.960]   All right.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.240]   So I'm going to stop bitching.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.640]   I think it's pretty clear Apple needs to add some sort--
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.880]   if not for itself, for every developer who sells in the App Store,
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.280]   there needs to be some upgrade path
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.840]   so that they don't have to either create a whole new version,
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.840]   quote, and charge a full price for it.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.400]   Or it just seems like there needs
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.680]   to be a way to upgrade at a lower cost.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.680]   But--
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.200]   Go ahead.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.880]   What some developers do is they make a sale price.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.040]   So if the new app is $5, they give it to everyone for $2.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.040]   But then people who just bought it complain saying,
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.960]   well, that guy didn't buy it.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.960]   Why is he getting the same low price as me?
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.800]   You're not favoring me, you're a loyal customer.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.400]   So it's having to--
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:26.920]   You don't know.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.920]   --get it in.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.920]   It said all that.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.320]   It is a very good product for $200.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.120]   If you work in audio or music or whatever.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.320]   I mean, logic has always been a great program,
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:43.240]   not as heavily used, perhaps, as pro tools.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.480]   But-- and there are other good competitors to this,
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.280]   but none of them are anywhere near this price.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.960]   So it's a good price.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.120]   And you're getting a lot of stuff.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.400]   Plus, there's this main stage three
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.680]   is updated for $30, which gives you
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.720]   kind of a performance interface, which is pretty darn cool.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.320]   And then there's a free component for the iPad.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.560]   So all in all, I mean, I think it's
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.120]   a great solution for musicians.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.920]   I'm not knocking it in that respect.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.680]   It's clear they need to have some sort of upgrade path.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.520]   I tried the original Logic Pro when I bought it two weeks ago,
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.840]   because I wanted to switch from GarageBand to Logic Pro
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.840]   for editing.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.240]   And it looked old.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.640]   The interface didn't look updated.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.040]   It looked really complicated.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.160]   Jason Snell spent a lot of time explaining to me
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.600]   what he did, which was very kind of him.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.320]   But just approaching it, it was intimidating and off-putting
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.440]   to me because I have no audio skills.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.120]   And what I'm hoping is that Logic Pro X, or as you quote,
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.320]   X will do for audio what Final Cut Pro
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.520]   tended a couple weeks ago.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.800]   I explained how I have no experience.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.480]   I could do a three-camera edit in Final Cut Pro X
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.440]   in like an hour, which was incredibly empowering for me.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.680]   And my hope is when I get time to play with this,
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.600]   it'll do the same sort of thing.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.920]   My hope, too.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.880]   It looks pretty similar.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.480]   But you know who I have to ask is my son,
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.600]   because he really uses it a lot.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.960]   When I fortunately now have a team that does all
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.280]   the editing for me, but I used to use Audition,
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.440]   which is an Adobe product.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.160]   Audition 3 is a pretty nice product,
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.320]   because it was simpler.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.960]   It was really based on cutting, on editing.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.760]   This is really more based on layering instruments,
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.720]   using loops, that kind of thing.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.480]   And it is, it does have absolutely very capable
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.080]   recording capabilities as well.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.440]   Both of synths.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.200]   And Chris Breen posted reviews.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.480]   They had advanced copies and they had reviews up this morning.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.640]   And they both sounded very optimistic about it.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.720]   We tried to get Chris on, he was busy.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.360]   1500 instrument and effects patches.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.280]   800 sampled instruments.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.840]   30 urban and electronic drum-seam machine patches.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.680]   Plus 3600 Apple loops for 200 bucks.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.120]   And all of the other, you know, the software,
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.640]   the drum production, the bass and guitar.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.840]   I'll be very curious.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.800]   It has, yeah, it has Auto Save, which is nice.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.440]   Good on Apple for updating.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.120]   And actually, I'm very pleased that they're keeping it up to date.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.920]   There's been some question about how much they care about pro users.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.720]   Well, there you go.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.880]   I bought it and I'm downloading it.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.960]   And the important difference is that it's not so much
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.600]   that they care about pro users,
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.560]   but they care about is all the people that they gave GarageBand
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.360]   to a number of years ago,
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.920]   can now, through this nicer interface
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.760]   and the lower price, feel empowered to sound,
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.960]   I'm going to jump from GarageBand to this professional tool.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.720]   I really think that they're looking for more users like Renee,
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.280]   who, as opposed to users who grew up are professional editors,
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.560]   because this is another thing that keeps people wondering,
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.440]   well, why would I ever not have a Macintosh,
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.680]   given that I've used these things for 10 years,
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.320]   and I've always been able to grow with me.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.200]   Well, my son's a perfect example,
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.200]   'cause he started with GarageBand
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.720]   and now grew its capabilities.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.040]   So I said, well, you already know GarageBand.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.880]   I think Logic is a logical next step.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.160]   Actually, I went to Logic Express, as I mentioned.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.080]   Bought a few copies for his school, too.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.720]   They have a recording studio now,
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.600]   and they've moved to Logic, too.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.000]   And the interface, not flat.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.280]   Oh, is it skeuomorphic?
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.000]   It's the last bastion of rich design on--
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.840]   I like it.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.480]   Now the last bastion of rich design, yeah.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.960]   I don't mind it, I really don't.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.000]   I think it looks good.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.480]   You know, when you're doing music,
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.040]   Propellerheads does this with reason.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.520]   They make it look like the analog things,
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.000]   just 'cause people know how to use these things.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.440]   And so it's not, it's kind of helps you
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.520]   with the learning curve.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.400]   Other programs I've seen that don't do that
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.120]   are a little, I think a little more intimidating, at least.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.680]   - Great job by the Pro Apps team.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.800]   - I love it.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.880]   I mean, the look.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.160]   I'm downloading a Raza set.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.000]   I'm downloading it right now,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.720]   since it's installed all the fire--
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.040]   - And the interface is dark now,
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.080]   and as all developers know,
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.320]   when you make a good dark interface
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.000]   and can charge double for your app.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.480]   - Here's some bad news.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.080]   Ransomware has hit OS 10.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.080]   This has been a massive problem on the Windows side.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.680]   Not a weekend goes by that somebody doesn't call
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.720]   on a radio show saying,
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:10.720]   I have a notice on my computer that says the FBI
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.160]   has discovered I'm doing something illegal,
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.160]   pirating music or child pornography.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.800]   But they said I can get off for $300.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.200]   If I send them a money pack,
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.520]   I have to go down to the 7-Eleven and get a money pack.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.120]   Does that sound right to you?
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.760]   - Actually, it doesn't, obviously,
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.440]   anybody who reads that's not gonna do that,
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.880]   but our post 9/11 world, you know,
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.240]   FBI has to take over all the 7/11s,
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.480]   the convenience stores,
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.720]   everybody's under surveillance.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.160]   Why do you think the Twinkies went off the market
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.560]   so they could put more recording devices in them
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.320]   before they get to the back on the market?
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.800]   - Notice they're back and they're sweetened.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:13:00.280]   So if you suddenly get this page on your assistant
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.120]   and it says your browser has been blocked
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:08.120]   for illegal use, please send us $300, obviously, don't.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.200]   - Is it real malware-leo or just a social engineering attack?
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.520]   - It's just a webpage, ironically.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:20.520]   So it does load 150 iframes
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.080]   that you have to dismiss one after another.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.200]   And so that's what's one thing that's really different
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.320]   and it shows you that it isn't as easy to hijack a Mac,
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.680]   I believe, as it is to hijack Windows.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.920]   And Windows, it really does lock it
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.320]   and you can't do anything.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.320]   You know, you can get rid of it,
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.680]   but you have to know what you're doing.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.160]   On the Mac, it's just 150 iframes.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.160]   (laughs)
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.560]   They have to close and they're figuring
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.320]   well, people are just gonna give up and pay the ransom.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.320]   Of course, all you have to do is force close so far
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.160]   in your--
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.320]   - Yeah, and restart without Windows.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.520]   - Yeah, there you go. - Recopening.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.440]   - Yeah.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.000]   - So this is a Mac, rumors has a video
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.920]   that shows this whole process and what to do.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:09.600]   Reset Safari or just as everybody in the chat room was saying,
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.680]   hold down the shift key when you launch Safari,
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.920]   that prevents it from reopening the previous window
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.280]   and tab and now you're done.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.920]   And don't go back to that place.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.160]   Should I do it?
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.760]   I wonder if I can find a link.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.360]   - That completely legitimate website you're going to
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.400]   that doesn't have anything that's naughty or illegal.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.800]   - Oh God, they're gonna sue Apple over this.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.480]   - I wanna know what site, 'cause I'd like to go,
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.800]   there's the pop-up, see that?
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.880]   150 times.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.480]   It's not an ifram, that's a, or is it an ifram?
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.520]   - It's like a modal pop-up?
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.640]   - Yeah, it looks like a modal pop-up.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.960]   You can do that in JavaScript, not a big deal.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:49.320]   This is really pretty much, you know,
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.040]   depending on the stupidity of the people
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.600]   who get bit by this because I think everybody who watches
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.960]   this show would know enough to quit Safari,
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.360]   hold the safety down and re-track.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.440]   - Ignorance, rather than stupidity.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.280]   - Yes, bad word stupidity.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.160]   - Ignorance.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.640]   - Or just, you know, and this, as you say,
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:10.720]   it is social engineering because it plays upon your fear
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.040]   and people go, "Oh my God, what did I do?
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.160]   "Is it my kid?
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.000]   "What happened?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.480]   "Somebody did something."
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.680]   Malwarebytes says, "Reset Safari."
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.880]   That is not necessary.
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.880]   I don't recommend that because you're gonna have to go back
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.320]   and you're gonna lose all your stuff.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.840]   So just pull the shift key down when you restart Safari.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.680]   It's easy.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:34.360]   - And welcome to the wacky world of the internet.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:41.040]   - Yeah, it's interesting to compare the science fiction
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.200]   of the '50s and '60s and '70s about the utopia
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.720]   that really was very, very possible
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.320]   given all the technology we have today,
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.080]   given the technologies that Arthur C. Clarke
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.600]   and the rest of them were predicting,
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.520]   but they didn't factor in, realized that human beings,
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.640]   they're kind of jerks.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.960]   (laughing)
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.920]   There will be people who will figure out a way
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.320]   to basically jerk up the most perfect situation ever.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.160]   So.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.280]   - This is why we can't have a nice internet.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.360]   - I still, you know, you're right, Andy.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.160]   There was this kind of, when you read,
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.960]   there's dystopian and utopian fiction
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.040]   and you kind of hope it's gonna go to the utopian side,
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.600]   but I don't think we've fully gone to dystopia yet.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.680]   - But it does feel like it's a slick.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.360]   - It feels like we're starting to slide down the slope.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:28.360]   So folks, not yet, but you do agree that it's like,
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.080]   why is it that there's so many steps involved
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.320]   to like go pick up my mail?
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.560]   Well, because they used to be really, really easy,
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.720]   but then someone decided,
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.400]   hey, I bet I could figure out a way to get everybody's mail
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.520]   if I simply did this.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.200]   And now that's why you can't buy stamps without having ID,
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.600]   you wouldn't have to do all this sort of stuff.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.440]   It's like, there's a, there's a, you should Google,
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.920]   I think it's on, it's probably not on YouTube,
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.760]   it's I think it's on NBC.com.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.800]   A Saturday Night Live sketch where there was a talk show
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.640]   where all the guests were people who had ruined things
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.480]   for everybody and like the Jim Belushi is,
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.960]   but okay, hitchhiking.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.280]   Oh yes, that was the time when anybody,
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.120]   if you needed to ride,
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.800]   you can stand by the side of the road
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.440]   and stick out your thumb and someone pick you up.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.960]   Well, why don't we do this anymore?
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.760]   Well, you know, I was hitchhiking
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.600]   and this nice fellow picked me up.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.640]   And then I don't know why, but it just occurred to me.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.640]   He doesn't know me.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.200]   I don't know him, there's no connection.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.520]   I could just kill him and keep his car.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.320]   I don't want him to get through in it.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.320]   I'm a four long people stop picking people up.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.560]   And I mean, I, I'm the guy who thinks happened.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.560]   What are you going to do?
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.040]   What are you going to do?
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.040]   So the other thing I, just to go back,
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.240]   I'm downloading Logic Pro now.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.160]   And after you install it, which it is done now,
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.720]   you download the loops and all that stuff.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.600]   And there's, there's two gigabytes of stuff
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.800]   to continue to download.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.040]   But while downloading, you can choose,
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:43.960]   I'm new to Logic Pro,
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.160]   I've used Logic Pro before and you can see.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.560]   So I have to say,
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.680]   even though there should be an upgrade path
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.360]   for the App Store, 200 bucks for what you get,
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.200]   is pretty remarkable.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.040]   I mean, think about this.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.080]   This is turning your Mac into a production,
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.120]   into a music studio.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:05.240]   I think that the next time we meet each other next week,
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.200]   like you'll be in the gold motorcycle helmet
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.600]   or maybe in the pro, my motorcycle helmet.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.080]   And the ability to just simply,
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.200]   for the amount of money you would have spent for a basic tool,
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.520]   you essentially get every single tool.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.000]   You can be disappointed that they did the upgrade
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.080]   the way they did, but oh man, what a lot of value.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.080]   - Right. And as I trip, we're saying in the chat room,
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.760]   there is an actual cost to Apple
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.040]   for two gigabytes worth of downloads,
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.080]   let alone the R&D and all of that stuff.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.000]   I think 200 bucks, given what you get,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.520]   that would be an upgrade price for a lot of tools, frankly,
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.600]   or even less than an upgrade price for a lot of tools.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.400]   - And the iPad Compounding App looks pretty good too.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.200]   You can use it, control it from a distance.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.280]   - Isn't that amazing?
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.680]   - Yeah.
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.800]   - All right, we're gonna take a break, come back,
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.320]   'cause Apple, according to some,
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.680]   is considering buying something
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.360]   that Microsoft may not be too happy about.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.640]   We'll talk about that in just a second,
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.600]   but first a word from legalzoom.com.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.680]   It's not gonna help you with ransomware.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.400]   That's not what legalzoom is.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.160]   It's not a law firm.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:08.400]   Legalzoom lets you create legal documents you can trust
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.760]   easily and quickly at a far lower price than you'd pay
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.440]   if you went to a lawyer who would do exactly the same thing.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.480]   The LLC that runs this company created exactly this way,
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.600]   step by step online, checking boxes.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.920]   It's, that was in 2005.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.080]   It's the same LLC, even as we've grown.
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.880]   And that's only $99 plus the state filing fee.
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.400]   Incorporation, S-corp or C-corp, same thing.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.440]   How about trademark?
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.920]   Do you have a blog or a brand that you wanna protect?
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.240]   You know, if you just start out as a blogger
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.200]   and you've got a pretty clever name for your title,
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.320]   it might be worth protecting it.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.120]   It's only $169.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.040]   We trademarked Twit and the Twit logo.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.880]   And now when it comes to the home,
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.120]   there's certainly legal documents you must have
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.480]   like a last will.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.080]   If you don't have a will, you know,
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.720]   the government decides what your assets and to what happens
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.800]   to your kids, $69.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.720]   Now one thing they've added since I used legalzoom
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.960]   back in 2005, and by the way, I'm not,
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.480]   I wasn't a pioneer by any means.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.480]   Legalzoom has been around for quite some time
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:18.480]   doing a great job for hundreds of thousands of folks.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.960]   One thing they've got now is they've got a legal plan,
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.360]   which means you can actually ask an attorney.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.200]   But it's not open-ended.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.920]   It's a fixed flat rate, which is great.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.000]   They have attorneys in almost every state.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.920]   All of them have profiles online
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.120]   plus unedited customer reviews.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.480]   So you can get some good advice.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.160]   Legalzoom.com in the past 12 years,
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.840]   over 2 million Americans have used legalzoom
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.600]   for LLCs, wills, trusts, trademarks, and more you should too.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.240]   If you're starting a company, do it right.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.680]   Legalzoom.com.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.660]   As a little thank you, if you use the offer code
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:00.080]   M-B-W for Mac Break Weekly, when you check out,
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.180]   we'll take 10 bucks off.
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.760]   That means that will's only 59 bucks.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.240]   Legalzoom.com, use the offer code Mac Break Weekly,
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.240]   we thank you and we thank them
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.760]   for your support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.200]   It's just a rumor right now.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.960]   I don't think Apple's saying a thing about it,
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.160]   but I think it would be kind of interesting
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:22.000]   if Apple ends up buying the Israeli company
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.680]   that designed Connect.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.480]   Now, they're still independent of Microsoft.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.800]   Microsoft Connect, of course, a very high item
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.120]   for the Xbox 360 and will be built into the Xbox one.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.920]   There is a rumor going around,
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.960]   although it's now denied by PrimeSense
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.560]   that they are in acquisition talks
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.080]   somewhere in the $280 to $300 million range.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.040]   PrimeSense says it's not so.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.240]   Delegation of PrimeSense senior executives
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.980]   did visit Apple recently.
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.720]   What do you guys think?
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.880]   Is this, I mean, obviously any license agreement
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.960]   they had with Microsoft would continue.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.960]   - Yeah, and it's hard to imagine given that they've had
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.880]   such success with this client to begin with
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.600]   that they would try to sour that.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.200]   Also, has there been any indication
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.600]   that Apple has any interest in this technology at all?
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.240]   - That's the interesting question, isn't it?
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.240]   Do you think they want gesture?
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.440]   - No, because I think this is the same reason
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.520]   why they don't want keyboards that are smaller
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.720]   than a standard size keyboard.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.200]   I think that in the air gestures for now
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.840]   is the equivalent of what the way
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.160]   that Apple thinks of netbooks.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.320]   Good idea, good thinking,
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.680]   but absolutely the wrong solution to that problem.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.800]   I think that they do want to find a way to
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.960]   let people control a TV enabled device
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.360]   without necessarily having to have a keyboard in their lap.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.760]   But I don't think that they want to teach people
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.160]   how to do the butterfly call and other like yoga techniques
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.000]   or whatever, just to change channels on a TV set.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.400]   - Intel, according to TechCrunch, just acquired
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.360]   another Israeli company doing gesture based interfaces,
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.620]   OMEC Interactive.
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.400]   So Intel wants them.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.240]   Microsoft's got a license to PrimeSense.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.480]   PrimeSense, by the way, didn't just deny it.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.800]   They actually said the report was BS.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.800]   (laughing)
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.000]   - Well, you figure if they wanted to sell,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.800]   they could have sold, I'm sure Microsoft wants to own
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.360]   any core technology that's as important to any product.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.880]   Connect is a hugely important product to them,
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.800]   and them owning it, not owning it must be very annoying.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.040]   So if they were gonna sell,
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.360]   you'd think Microsoft would be in there
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.760]   with an offer very quickly.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:34.120]   - There's a great story about how Microsoft acquired Connect.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:39.120]   It was a demo on an airplane that was the kind of the,
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:43.320]   it's a fascinating story, but Connect itself
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.440]   in the Xbox 360 iteration is not very impressive.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.280]   It's low resolution, you have to be far back.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:52.040]   So reportedly the new Xbox One has a much better version
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.440]   of Connect with a lot more data points and so forth.
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:58.240]   Clearly the future is in this arena somehow.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.720]   So you think Andy that Apple has no interest at all
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.640]   in any kind of like, my ARRI report gesture based thing?
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.480]   - I don't, I don't think they have no interest at all.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.040]   I certainly don't think they have enough interest
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.120]   to buy a company that has that technology.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.320]   I think that if and when they were to actually use that,
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.440]   then they would wanna own it,
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.520]   just like for the reasons that Renee says.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.320]   But for now, the answer you need to provide
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.360]   is what product would they put this in
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.160]   and how would this be better than any other solution
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.240]   that Apple would have?
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.360]   I think that I could really see,
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.640]   sometimes when I'm evaluating a rumor like that,
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.920]   I imagine the keynote script.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.680]   And I imagine Tim Cook talking about,
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.020]   and there's other people have been doing interesting things
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.560]   within the air gestures, but it's labor some,
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.520]   we found our studies, besides,
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.800]   why would we, I'm looking for a key prop
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.960]   that I don't, oh there it is.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.320]   (laughing)
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.840]   Plus, why would anybody want to try
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.280]   to memorize these weird gestures
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.760]   when they have the best remote
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.440]   they could possibly have the iPad mini.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.040]   - Oh, yeah, good point.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.240]   - They would be saying that you have your iPad with you,
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.600]   you have your iPhone with you,
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.360]   we're creating a brand new infrastructure
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.000]   so that these two work with each other
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.920]   in a way that no two devices ever work before
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.720]   and if far exceeds, we think you'll agree.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.640]   And then they'll also put a remark about how,
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.400]   and you don't have to worry about that,
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.000]   unblinking eye on your TV said,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.720]   looking at you when you don't know that it's looking at you.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.560]   (laughing)
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.160]   - Which is actually, which is funny,
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.960]   but it's another issue.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.000]   There's so many people that it's falling
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.840]   into the Google Glass Effect
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.600]   where the fact that there is a lens
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.600]   and someone does not necessarily know
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.560]   when this lens is looking and when this lens is not looking,
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.720]   there is a serious creep factor to that.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.560]   And so I think that, especially a company like Apple
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.080]   that focuses so heavily on how humans interact
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.360]   with computers, that would be a very, very big thing
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.960]   for them to have to solve before they put that to market.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.520]   - Yeah, that is one thing people complained about
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.680]   in the Xbox One was an ask.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.600]   Do you mean that camera's always watching?
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.600]   - Yeah, and also the fact that it's always on
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.080]   and that it's always listening for a voice command
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.400]   to turn itself on, you would do it.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.760]   I mean, Microsoft has to do a lot of education to say,
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.560]   "Well, we're not gonna burn up 200 watts of power
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.640]   "to keep a CPU completely active
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.640]   "to listen for complete voice command.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.120]   "We actually have a much lower power system
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.000]   "that's doing nothing but listening for this one key phrase
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.560]   "so they're not really recording everything."
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.560]   - NSA subsidies, Andy.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.400]   (laughing)
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.480]   - NSA likes it.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.080]   - Well, you don't think the timing is bad.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.840]   If we hadn't, if Prism hadn't come out,
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.400]   people would not be so nervous about this stuff,
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.400]   but the timing is not good.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.240]   - There were nervous enough.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.200]   There were nervous before that.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.400]   I mean, again, look at the track for glass
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.320]   over the past couple of years.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.200]   Nobody, I do find that when,
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.280]   I'm sure that some people there are Twitch,
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.200]   at the brick house, have the same,
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.960]   have the same sort of reaction.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.760]   When people try it on, they feel a lot better about it.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.720]   When they get to ask those questions that,
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.080]   "Are you recording me now?"
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:50.920]   And you have to say,
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.000]   "No, because if I kept this recording things all the time,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.400]   "the battery would die in about 15 minutes,
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.040]   "and you would also see something happening,
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.560]   "I would have to, blah, blah, blah."
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.960]   The humans are not quite ready
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.440]   to simply trust a lens in their house quite yet.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.640]   Even I, I mean, like so many people,
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.040]   the chat camera on my notebook,
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.240]   all of them always have a piece of tape over the lens.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.080]   Not because--
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:15.920]   - Really?
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.840]   I was gonna ask you that.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.920]   - Yeah, because, I mean,
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.160]   not that I necessarily fear
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.600]   some malicious person getting into my computer
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.600]   and activating it,
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.720]   but because there are times when you activate the web browser
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.800]   and they didn't tell you that they're doing webex
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.200]   and the camera comes on and you don't know
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.440]   if anybody's seeing you,
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:37.320]   but it's not like I'm naked inside my office or anything,
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.760]   but it's like I would like to at least,
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.280]   you know, smooth down my eyebrows,
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.000]   you know, maybe fluff out my sideburns.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.360]   You like to have that level of control
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.560]   and the only thing that makes you absolutely damn sure
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.200]   that that lens is not seeing something
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.560]   is when you have something obscuring it.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.400]   - And it's Andy's point,
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.640]   it reminded me that Craig Federico,
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.280]   when he went around to WWDC and said,
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.000]   "With airdrop, you don't have to go and bump your phone."
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.080]   And it was similar when they did Passbook
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.280]   'cause people kept asking about NFC.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.200]   And there might be a world where Apple wants gestures,
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.280]   but in general, they haven't done abstract gestures.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.680]   You've never had to make a cast a spell
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.040]   on your device to get something to happen.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.040]   It's always been direct manipulation.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.760]   You touch something and you physically move it across the screen,
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.640]   whether it's a panel or anything else.
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:23.280]   And that's not as obvious when there's no physical contact
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.480]   when there's no fits law involved,
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.840]   you know, grabbing anything real.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.160]   And, you know, maybe they,
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.440]   I'm sure they must have gesture stuff in the lab
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.800]   and be playing around with it.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.640]   But before they did multi-touch on the iPhone,
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.720]   they bought finger works
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.320]   and they got access to all the finger works as technology.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.640]   And if they do do gestures,
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.320]   you'll probably see them buy somebody
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.920]   before they announce any products.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.560]   - That's an interesting observation though.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.040]   One of the nice things about NFC
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:49.080]   is that it has this beautifully elegant human interface
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.560]   and a level of control that the humans like to have.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.160]   That if I want to will somebody that I want,
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.440]   I want this someone to have this picture
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.640]   that I have on my phone,
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.240]   I know that all I have to do is go like this, touch,
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.280]   and that absolutely explicit gesture
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.600]   is what moves the picture from one to another.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.680]   As opposed to, now just turn this feature on, don't worry.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.280]   I know that technically, okay,
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.000]   I suppose technically this is a feature
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.920]   that lets wirelessly data to come off of your phone
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.200]   and move on another device.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.600]   But we totally promise you that will never happen
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.760]   unless you explicitly make that happen.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.200]   There's something very reassuring about this being,
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.680]   nope, it did not see it.
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.280]   No data left my phone
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.080]   because I was not within a half hour,
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.280]   a half an inch of your device.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.760]   So people get over it,
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.120]   but these are subtle things
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.240]   and it's going to take a number of years
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.480]   before we get that level of comfort.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.680]   I think we're already seeing too,
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.960]   the obscurity of gesture-based interfaces.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.960]   We're seeing more and more gesture-based interfaces.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.200]   Windows 8 is a good example
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.520]   and so much of it was just kind of,
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.960]   I don't, it's undiscoverable.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.800]   And so--
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.160]   - Blackberry 10 is usually gesture-based.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.800]   - And it's, did you find it intuitive?
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.480]   I don't find it intuitive.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.680]   I think that there's two different kinds of ease of use.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.040]   There's the kind that you,
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.160]   that help you learn something in the first 30 seconds.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.040]   And then there's the sort of thing
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.240]   that makes something easier to use,
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.120]   starting one week after you first try it
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.880]   and then going for the wife of the device.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.720]   Let's use things like examples
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.040]   like the four finger, three and four finger gestures
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.840]   on the iPad, where it was a long time
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:25.040]   before I got in the habit of expose the application doc,
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.880]   four fingers slide up,
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.520]   go back to home by all five fingers,
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.760]   pinch in, that's completely not intuitive.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:35.720]   It's not something you would simply discover on your own.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.360]   I think there was months and months before I even used it,
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.120]   but once that programming kind of hit my brain,
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.160]   now I almost, now it's almost as if I rarely used it,
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.000]   the home key anymore, because sliding upward
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.640]   is just the place where I can find it.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.720]   Well, it's like Renee said, it's tactile.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.400]   You're interacting directly with the device.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.920]   You are taking this window that's full of an application
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.760]   and sliding it up and up,
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.960]   and once you slide it up,
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.040]   you realize that underneath that screen
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.080]   were the application icons of running apps.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.840]   - I can never, I know it,
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.080]   but I can never remember to do it.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:06.920]   - I always--
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:07.760]   - And that's absolutely right.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.800]   It's not something that occurs to you.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.960]   That's why I make a note of the difference between
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.760]   there's something that makes things easy to use,
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.000]   30 seconds after you tried,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.880]   and then there's the thing where you're not gonna get it
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.640]   for a while, but once you get it,
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.840]   it'll make things easier forever.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.760]   - I mean, the analogy usually is that abstract gestures
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:23.960]   are more like keyboard shortcuts.
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.240]   They're there for power users
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.800]   and go through the mental gymnastics of remembering them,
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.320]   but the direct manipulations are easier,
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.360]   like pinch to zoom.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.240]   Most people took to that almost immediately,
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:36.040]   or just scrolling a list or moving a panel.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.440]   The thing where it becomes problematic
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.800]   is when they lack consistency,
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.000]   and even for example, what Apple has shown off of iOS 7
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.440]   in the Mail app and the Messages app,
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.800]   you can slide the panel over to peak it
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.600]   or to change navigation views and see your lists.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.600]   But if you go the other way,
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.880]   it's a way to delete individual messages,
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.800]   wherein Safari, you can go backwards and forwards
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.280]   in history by sliding,
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.360]   and in other apps that gesture doesn't exist at all.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.720]   And if you can't always depend on it being there,
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.880]   you start to not remember it,
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.040]   or you have to stop and think,
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.640]   I'm gonna own an app that supports it,
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.640]   and then it becomes more overhead.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.080]   - Absolutely, to this day,
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.840]   I use the Comicsology Comics Reader app
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.360]   several times a week,
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.480]   and that's been for a couple of years now.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.640]   And still, when I finish reading a comic,
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.200]   my natural inclination is I'll just zoom it,
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.440]   I'll just pinch, I'll just zoom it,
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.800]   I'll minimize it by zooming it all the way in
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.360]   with a multi-fingered gesture,
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.600]   expecting it will take me back to my comics collection,
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.200]   and it just never works that way.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.280]   That's not necessarily Comicsology's fault,
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.840]   but it does show you that once your brain
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.360]   gets wired up to think that this is how I completely
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.280]   dismiss what I'm looking at and go back to where I was
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:40.360]   before, the brain simply expects to see that more and more.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.080]   Again, going from what I've read online about iOS 7,
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.080]   there's the same thing going on with its new back feature,
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.080]   where you swipe from one side to the other,
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.560]   and that will take you back one step
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.080]   to where you were in a hierarchy.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.840]   So, perhaps partly because I'm so used to Android
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.240]   that there is a universal back button,
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.960]   I'm thinking, oh, I wanna step back to where I was,
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:00.040]   that'll always work, and, oh, no,
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.080]   I've just scrolled this thing sideways one way.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:02.960]   Okay, well, how about this one?
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.080]   Nope, that does nothing at all.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.200]   Is it because I didn't do it properly?
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.600]   No, it's because it just simply doesn't work that way at all.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:13.600]   So, yeah, I mean, you can't just have a good idea for one app.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.160]   It has to be a good idea that can be applied everywhere,
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.480]   and that's the challenge.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.480]   What about Leap Motion?
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.040]   Do you think that we're still waiting,
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.120]   I guess the hardware is delayed, but we're still waiting.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.560]   This is the little box you put in front of your,
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.400]   say, your iMac, and then you can do gestures on your iMac.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.640]   And everybody, it's funny every time we mention this.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.240]   People go, oh, Leap Motion, Leap Motion.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.760]   Do you think that's gonna be widely accepted,
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.880]   or is it another one of those geek things?
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.120]   Nah.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.280]   It's a...
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.280]   Nah.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.720]   No, especially because it's a special box you have to buy
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:47.080]   that there's no use case for it yet.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.080]   Right.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.880]   Also, it's not even just the problem of people being aware
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:54.160]   that it exists just as a consumer item is a huge problem.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.960]   So now, let's say you have figured it out.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.200]   You have found out it exists.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.480]   Yes, you do think it's worth the money,
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.120]   and yes, you do get one installed.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.360]   Now, you're facing the problem.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.160]   All the developers are trying to support it.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.160]   And so it's...
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:09.160]   It has to be Microsoft or Apple to make it...
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.840]   So it's only when you put it on something like the Xbox.
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:16.320]   Xbox One, when you say, no, every single product we make
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.800]   has this built in.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.440]   And I think you do also have to give people the option
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.080]   usually through, maybe through settings,
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.000]   of turning it off if they're scared of it.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.920]   But only when every developer knows that every box has this,
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.760]   where all those really brilliant ideas
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.120]   are gonna come to service.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.120]   Right.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.640]   I mean, Tandy's point also,
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.200]   a lot of this stuff has to be worked into the operating system
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.440]   in order for it to be consistent enough to use.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.200]   And we saw that with the iPad gestures,
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.560]   you started playing Fruit Ninja,
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.520]   and all of a sudden you were swiping into your mail app
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:48.960]   because Apple had co-opted what you used to do with the Ninja.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.960]   Did that happen?
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.960]   I just sliced the photo from mine.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:52.960]   Absolutely.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.920]   And now with the new hierarchical backwards gesture,
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.600]   people are complaining it interferes with...
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.840]   Or they're wondering what's gonna happen
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.600]   with all the apps that use hamburger buttons and basements
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:07.160]   because Facebook has those on both sides of their apps now.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.800]   And those don't look like they're gonna be compatible
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.880]   with what Apple showed off at WWDC.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.040]   Just for those of us who have no freakin' clue
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.480]   what you were talking about.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.480]   Hamburger buttons.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.720]   Those are those four lines that use Slite Swipeover.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.680]   Yeah, and Apple's not the kind of one.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.680]   And what's a basement?
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:23.680]   So these are...
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.280]   Mark Kano used to be Apple's developer evangelist,
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.560]   user interface evangelist coined that term.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.600]   It's when you have a sidebar that you throw everything
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.240]   into with no organization because you have no other idea
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.480]   where to put it.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.680]   And Facebook kind of started this because in Facebook
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.080]   you would swipe sideways and have this long list
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.160]   of every feature in Facebook and then you tap it
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.200]   and you'd go back to the main screen.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.520]   And they had that hamburger button on the top
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.160]   which is that three-line button.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.160]   And Apple's replacing those with backwards chevrons
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.160]   because they want it to look more like a back button.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.040]   But that is gonna be a universal thing in what do apps
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.520]   like Facebook and...
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.520]   Google does that now.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.240]   Yeah, all the Google apps do those.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.960]   I do think that's a great idea.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.480]   I mean, one of the few really bad ideas
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.240]   from even the first iOS was,
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.800]   "Okay, let's go into the settings for the SAP."
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.640]   Where are those?
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.560]   Oh, you have to leave the app
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.000]   and go into the master settings.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.560]   That was really bad.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.880]   Every time on Android or iOS app I find that
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.720]   if you swipe to the left often enough
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.760]   or touch this hamburger button, you will find,
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.480]   "Well, here's basically the master menu
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.280]   "that will not only give you..."
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.560]   It's barely because not only does it give you
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.720]   those settings and those master options,
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.640]   but just like in Windows Phone,
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.560]   it will keep that sliver of that screen
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.840]   you just left way, way off on the right
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.680]   so that you still have your orienteering on here
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.120]   where I am and what I'm doing.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.600]   Was it Facebook that invented that?
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.920]   Because I've got a brick to restart it
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.160]   with the Tweety for iPad.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.920]   Facebook made an adaption of it.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.000]   And Leo, another example, the Hue app for iPhone,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   which I use a ton, now you swipe up to get to the panel
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.080]   as you control all your lights,
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.920]   but now that's gonna be control center.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.600]   So am I gonna swipe up and get both that panel and control center?
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.120]   You have to swipe control center down again.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.720]   I have no idea what's gonna happen.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.360]   I have that problem sometimes on Android
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:08.320]   where a down swipe doesn't do what I think it's going to do.
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.600]   You've re-done the notifications.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.960]   So yeah, I can see that.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.240]   And it's multiple problems.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.200]   Like I said, I like the fact that
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.040]   Android has a universal back button so much
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.160]   so that when I get lost in an iOS app now,
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.920]   I just involuntarily touch the lower right corner
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.880]   of the glass of my iPad to get back to where it went.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.240]   But, you know, people, okay,
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.040]   I just wanna point out people have excoriated Android
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.120]   for the back button for years,
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.720]   but I always felt like that was something missing.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.040]   And once you get used to it, you do.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.880]   You wanna hit the back button.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.160]   Just wanna point that out.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.240]   - The Palm Bacc gesture was nice too.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.320]   - Exactly.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.120]   But even so, as much as I like it,
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.640]   there are times where it doesn't do exactly what I think it will do.
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.080]   - Yeah, more and more it does though, right?
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.760]   But it used to, it was a huge problem in 2.0.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.720]   Now, there are a lot of things that they solved in 4.0,
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.720]   chiefly just by essentially bringing all the Android developers
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.000]   into a room, closing and locking the doors.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:00.840]   - Spanking them.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.680]   - Yeah.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.440]   - Turning up the lights, showing everybody,
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.800]   okay, you realize that there are 50 gallon drums
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.320]   full of oily rags and I'm holding a lip torch.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.280]   Will you do what we tell you to do with it,
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.040]   with user interface or will we not
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:16.080]   and realize that I am in a glass lined vault
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.840]   with a trap door to safety and you are not?
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.480]   - Hey, it's seen from Avengers, right?
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.320]   - Yes.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.680]   - Thank you for that.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.920]   And basements, those are something I swiped up.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:25.760]   - That's the sidebar.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.600]   The basement is another name for the sidebar.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:31.320]   - Oh, so that thing you go to to the side is
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.600]   the name of something you go to.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.440]   - Basement too.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.520]   - The hamburger button opens the basement.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.040]   - The hamburger button opens the basement.
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.680]   - You know, I play that game on Atari 2600,
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.600]   after school, every single day.
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.280]   And then you can't get the key
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.360]   'cause ET has to hit exactly the right divot to find it.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.200]   Oh man.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.800]   - It sounds like a spy, you know, the moon.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.400]   - Wolf howls at the moon.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.760]   - The hamburger button opens the basement.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.840]   - It's a cold day for Pontius.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.880]   - It's designer jargon, but these things do propagate.
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.160]   - No, and I'm glad you explain them
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.320]   'cause now I mean, I can call, I've always, you know,
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.960]   I said that thing, you know, the lines that you swipe over,
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.160]   hamburger button.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.000]   - Yeah.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   - It's a relatively discreet thing.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.240]   - And they're probably gonna be replaced
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.120]   by the backwards Chevron when iOS 7 comes out.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.760]   - In iOS.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:14.600]   - Yeah.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:15.600]   We'll see what happens elsewhere.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.800]   - You know, when you talk about always on cameras,
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.680]   it looks as if, especially from what Google said at Google I/O,
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.680]   Google's moving to always on microphones, right?
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.440]   - Moto X, Moto 10, whatever's called Moto X.
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.480]   - And yet the rumor on Moto X is that
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.960]   that's gonna be listening all the time,
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.400]   but certainly in the search thing eventually,
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.280]   I think that that Chrome search is gonna be waiting
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:37.240]   for you to say, okay, Google.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.600]   So how do you, I don't know if people mind that so much
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.500]   or is there gonna be a big backlash?
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:46.400]   - I had this experience where I was--
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.760]   - I kinda like it.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.040]   - I was DMing somebody and they started sending back
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.960]   these really, really strange things.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.160]   And I didn't know what it was.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.880]   And then I wrote back saying what's happening.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.960]   And they said, oh, Google Glass was in my purse
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:59.720]   and it's been sending you my conversation.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.960]   And that's a generation one problem,
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.600]   but it does show you that.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.840]   When things are always listening,
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.360]   software's never bug free.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.720]   And when things are always listening,
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.400]   it just opens you up to those exact reasons
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.640]   why Andy is taping over his cameras.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.240]   - I only wish I could say something.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.560]   I don't know.
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.960]   This isn't, this is off topic,
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.880]   but I don't, from after three weeks with using Glass,
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:22.200]   I don't know how you could be sending a conversation
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:26.080]   by accidentally tapping something in your purse with Glass.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.080]   - They were having a conversation
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.680]   walking down the street and it was being DM'd to me.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:35.320]   - If, so the microphone comes on,
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:39.760]   it would have to be an unusual confluence of a tap,
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.200]   the right command.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.880]   - They so you can face the--
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.160]   - They'd fairly text out of your person.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.080]   - They would accidentally tap in the purse.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.360]   - They would accidentally start a hangout with you.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.200]   - Yeah, or something.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.040]   - Must have that happen.
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:49.880]   - Yeah.
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.240]   - I think that that, as you said,
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.040]   that's version one, I think it'll be something.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.160]   - Yeah, bye. - Again, but it really is,
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.120]   again, education.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.120]   I mean, I had a lot of really pleasant interactions
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.920]   with Glass and Philadelphia on Saturday.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.520]   One of them, a gentleman while his wife
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.880]   was totally mortified, like, 10 steps away, asked me,
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:10.960]   "Have you ever been shot at
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.520]   "for violating people's privacy with those?"
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.000]   And I had to say, "No, I have never been shot at
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.760]   "for violating people's privacy."
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.200]   Expecting him to say, "Well, you're about to be shot."
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.040]   - "You're about to be."
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.640]   (laughing)
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.960]   - Has anybody ever punched you in the nose?
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:28.200]   - I'm living the title song from the Fresh Prince of LA,
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.240]   my, a bellaire, my mom's gonna get scared,
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.240]   I'm gonna get shot, and I have to go back to Boston
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.320]   because I'm on a regularly scheduled Amtrak train
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.800]   later that day, but still.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.240]   But yeah, but as soon as you say that,
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.200]   "No, this is how it works."
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.480]   No, it doesn't just automatically capture everything.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.200]   I think that people have to get from it.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.760]   Science fiction usually gets ahead of science fact,
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.400]   and that's why people are afraid to be exposed
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.400]   to a micron of a tiny, tiny amount of radiation
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.760]   because they think that radiation gives you cancer.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:57.120]   Yeah, but not quite so much if it's like from 50 yards away
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:57.960]   and you're under the sun
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.400]   and getting much more radiation from the sun.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.200]   - Leo, you have the same conversations with Ford
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.280]   and people that I do, and at CES every year, they'd said,
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.320]   "You know, we can make a car that can do almost anything,
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.920]   "but it would scare the hell out of the general population."
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.000]   So we are forced to do what, now this car shows
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.440]   you rear view driving, this car will park for you.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.600]   It has to one thing at a time to acclimatize us
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.000]   so we don't freak out and think robots
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.400]   are taking over the earth.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:24.640]   - I, for some reason, I mean, Google now is another example
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.520]   of things that initially I thought people would find
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.960]   very creepy because Google uses what it knows about you
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.440]   to put up those cards.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.200]   And yet it's so hideously useful,
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.400]   I don't hear people complaining so much about it.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:39.080]   - I'm just wondering if always on microphones,
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.960]   always on cameras, will in the long run be so useful.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.640]   Remember, we all wanted the Hal 9000.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.160]   Well, Hal's camera was always on
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.880]   and his microphone was always on.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.000]   He could read lips too, but that was another story.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.960]   - Well, just don't harvest an Ironman.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.080]   Just don't give your phone access to the airlock
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.000]   and you'll be fine. - Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.760]   - I mean, it's when you talk about people
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:01.160]   of a raw hardware feature, that scares people.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:04.360]   When you tell people that essentially all of your travel
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:06.800]   information, as soon as you land in your city,
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.440]   will be organized and ready for you
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.440]   and anticipate your every need.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:13.760]   That's when Google now is simply a product demo, it's scary.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.200]   The first time you take out your phone
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.240]   and you see that, oh, the piece of information
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.720]   that I was gonna get is right here,
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.160]   along with all the other pieces of information
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.600]   I was gonna look for after that, all right then.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.680]   - Exactly.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.200]   - And it's illusion, for a long time,
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.160]   navigation companies would say that we can't leave
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.120]   the mic on all the time because it would drain your battery
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.600]   too fast and you'd have a bad experience and blame us.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.400]   And now we're solving, it wasn't a privacy issue,
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:38.200]   it was a battery issue and now we're solving that.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.640]   And we're giving, it starts to get creeped.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.440]   There's a disconnect between what we see
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.360]   and what we understand.
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.280]   There was a big story this week about Nordstrom
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.720]   using the Wi-Fi radios in our devices
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.280]   to track our movements through stores
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.240]   so they could optimize store flow
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.840]   and figure out what products we went to
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.440]   and where we spent the most time.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.360]   And this upset people when they notified them
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.480]   because they didn't like the idea of being quote unquote,
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:01.840]   "spied on" by video cameras and Wi-Fi receivers.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:03.920]   Meanwhile, every time you have a loyalty card
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.560]   or an email address or a phone number and you give it to them,
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.720]   that unique identifier is enough for them to track
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.200]   everything you ever buy anywhere.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.400]   Anyway, it's just we never thought about it.
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.320]   So the reality of the fear is different
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.800]   than the fantasy of the fear.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.000]   - But part of it is control and transaction.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.080]   If I'm giving, I have the choice of giving you a loyalty card
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.640]   or not giving you a loyalty card.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.160]   There's some businesses that keep asking me,
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.240]   "Oh, would you like a loyalty card?"
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.400]   And I say, "No, I really don't want to give you my zip code,
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.640]   "my personal information."
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.280]   And so I have that level of control.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.160]   The second thing is that the reason why I use a loyalty card
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:38.000]   at my local market is that I get really, really fantastic
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.680]   discounts without having to clip coupons individually.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.040]   So yes, I realize I'm giving up some personal information,
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:46.400]   but I'm getting something tangible in return.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.120]   When I'm in the middle of a store
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.200]   and they're collecting information about,
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.840]   this is the identity of this consumer.
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.400]   Here's how long he spent at this kiosk.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.280]   Oh, then he spent some time over here.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.720]   He walked right past this.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:00.440]   And so I feel as though they're taking something
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:01.560]   and I'm losing some privacy,
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.480]   I'm not getting anything in return for it.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.560]   So you have to really sell to people
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.680]   that this is not something we're simply taking from you.
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.720]   We're giving you a barter relationship
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.040]   where we get something from you,
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.760]   but we give you something in return.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.480]   That's really what Google is basing
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.520]   a lot of their business on,
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.840]   that if they were like Facebook,
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.360]   where we will give you a very mediocre social network,
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:25.080]   but we will absolutely hammer with a chisel,
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.800]   cold chisel and explosives,
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.880]   every piece of data we can possibly get out of you
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.960]   with or without your approval
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.480]   and give you pretty much nothing in return.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.560]   That's a bad relationship.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.600]   Google is saying we will take lots of information from you.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.800]   We will make lots of money off of that information,
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.240]   but we will give you a lot of free services
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:44.840]   that would have to pay a lot of money for otherwise.
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:45.680]   - We're gonna take a break.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.840]   I just wanna, I've completed the two gigabyte download
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:51.080]   of Essential Sounds and Instruments for Logic Pro.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.840]   And now it offers me an optional stuff,
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:58.680]   based drum kits, multi-output drum kits,
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:01.280]   producer patches, drum machine guitar,
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:05.800]   mallet, orchestral loops, piano, world sound loops.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.480]   These are the Apple loops you used to buy
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.360]   at individual DVDs,
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:14.360]   reverb, a total of 35 gigabytes,
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:18.600]   worth of additional stuff.
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.560]   - Good luck MacBook Air users.
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:22.760]   - Well, I'm gonna install it, what the hell.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:24.600]   But I gotta say, at that point,
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:28.120]   you know what, $199 doesn't sound so bad.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.000]   The Apple loops alone cost me more than that
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   when I bought them on individual discs.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   - Wait, there's more.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.880]   - But really, it's gonna take me forever
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.360]   to download all this stuff.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.680]   - Get a second tube of Mighty Putty.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.760]   - Just wait a minute, I'm not on a shopping cart.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:42.960]   - It's nice, and it's optional.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.520]   You don't have to download it.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.600]   But if you want all of the loops,
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:47.760]   all of the sounds and everything,
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:52.760]   here's the new UI at the chooser of the projects.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.080]   I could choose a new project, hip hop,
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:58.160]   electronics, songwriter, multi-track,
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.640]   and it shows me which of the loops I would be using in this
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:04.440]   that it's still downloading, as you can see.
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.520]   And then an empty project.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.520]   I have to say,
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:10.160]   in many ways, I think this feels like
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:14.520]   it's GarageBand, but plus, and you know, look at this.
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:17.000]   Use a musical grid, the tempo,
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.720]   key signature, C major, minor, time signature,
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.240]   audio, input, audio, output.
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:27.560]   This is great, I have to say, this is impressive.
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:31.520]   If you're, it seems as if for $199 you're getting
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:34.360]   essentially a music studio in your laptop,
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.160]   that's pretty impressive.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.680]   We'll see.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.760]   I just sent a text to my son saying,
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:42.040]   download the new logic.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.200]   You have my permission.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.840]   Our show today brought to you by our good friends
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:50.040]   at audible.com audio books galore.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:53.520]   It's the best bookstore of audio books ever anywhere,
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.200]   over 100,000 titles.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.200]   Pretty much everything is now out on Audible.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:03.200]   I'm a huge fan of audible.com, as you know, as is Andy.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:07.520]   They have something new, the top five lists
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:11.160]   from audio book listeners, from Audible listeners.
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.760]   So this is kind of a cool idea,
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.560]   and they're just people, this says Jordy's list.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.480]   I wonder if it's not that Jordy.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.840]   No, some other Jordy.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.360]   But that's kind of a neat idea, you know?
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:25.360]   And I hope that they get some famous people in here too,
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:26.480]   'cause that's really cool.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.160]   These are like the music lists
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.120]   that you see on Spotify and so forth.
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:33.400]   Audible is fantastic.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.560]   Here's my audible history.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.520]   And it says listeners with similar histories also bought.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:43.160]   This is just, the fun of Audible's browsing
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:48.200]   this incredible bookstore, fiction, nonfiction biography.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:51.160]   They've got, if you heard about JK Rowling,
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:54.560]   she wrote a mystery novel as a guy, Robert Galbraith,
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.560]   what we know, now it was her, 'cause of her tweets.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:02.000]   The Kugoo's calling has been on Audible since May.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.640]   It came out on Audible before we knew it was JK Rowling.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.880]   So the author of Harry Potter has a new mystery.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:10.360]   I haven't read it, I don't know if it's good or not.
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.120]   But you can get it on Audible.
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.040]   Think about Audible's, when you listen to these,
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.400]   they come alive, they get the greatest actors.
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:20.560]   Many of them, Broadway and Hollywood stars reading.
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:23.440]   It's a real art to read a book and bring it alive.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.520]   And they found the people who can do it.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:28.280]   And I'll tell you, I just love, I listen to Audible.
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.880]   Every moment I get.
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:32.000]   Andy, what are you listening to these days?
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.840]   - As a matter of fact, the Kugoo's calling.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:34.680]   - Really?
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:38.720]   - That story broke in the Sunday, London Times on Sunday.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:41.760]   And so I was reading about it like Sunday afternoon.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.440]   Again, just as you say, discover that,
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.280]   oh, it's actually an audio book, great.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.960]   I'm looking for a new book, I bought it.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:49.320]   And it was in chapter six and it's like, wow,
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:52.560]   this really is a very, very strong book.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.400]   - Great.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.640]   - And you have to, if JK Rowling does not require
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.960]   fruit baskets or anything from anybody,
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.360]   but you have to imagine that every person who reviewed
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:03.960]   this book when absolutely nobody knew
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.520]   that Robert Galbraith was actually JK Rowling,
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:08.440]   who gave it a glowing review and said,
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:11.080]   this is just a masterful debut novel.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:12.640]   I'm really excited about this.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.440]   I'm about this undiscovered talent who clearly has
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.200]   a gift for storytelling.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.800]   - She's surprisingly good for a first novel.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:22.800]   - Because a lot of these reviews are just like,
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.760]   I can't believe this is this person's first book.
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.760]   It's exceptionally, it's a great mystery.
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:29.000]   It's well told, it's gripping, it's compelling.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.240]   And now that all those reviewers who said that
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:34.240]   can now say, I didn't even know that it was JK Rowling.
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:37.440]   Even when you just give me, I don't have no idea
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:39.720]   what the identity is, that proves that I review
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.400]   the book and not the author.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.880]   But yeah, 50, but it is a little bit disappointing
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:48.640]   because I think that same piece said that only about
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:51.040]   1,500 copies had been sold.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.560]   - Oh wow.
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:55.240]   - And then the next day after the story broke,
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:59.240]   it actually sales increase on Amazon by 150,000%.
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.160]   - Yeah, not surprised.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.840]   - But you shouldn't care about that.
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:07.000]   What I love about it is such a richly textured,
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.280]   it's a very, very straightforward detective novel
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.040]   about a sort of a Paris Hilton,
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:15.640]   sort of like socialite celebrity jumps off
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.680]   of the roof of a building.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.400]   It's deemed a suicide, the wealthy,
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.080]   the adopted brother of that person,
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.400]   hires this scruffy down on his luck,
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:29.320]   former special forces detected with a rundown office
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:32.400]   and a brand new inexperienced, just hired today,
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:36.320]   receptionist to look into it.
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:38.080]   And it really is one of those.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.040]   I think I'll just keep listening to this
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.000]   just until I get to the end of this chapter stuff.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.080]   - Oh good.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:48.200]   - You really do see that with a gift of hindsight
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.320]   that this is somebody who has very experienced
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.200]   that laying out a story because every detail
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.640]   is just so nicely painted.
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:56.560]   - It's kind of cool because she doesn't,
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:58.600]   she never has to work a day in her life.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:01.360]   She's the richest woman in England now, more than the queen.
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.560]   And yet, so this, what this is,
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:05.760]   and she writes on her pen name,
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.920]   so this is an example of somebody who writes
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:10.040]   for the love of it, pure love of it.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.480]   And I'd be loved to hear what that sounds like.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:13.320]   (laughs)
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.160]   - You know?
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.920]   - And the reader is very good too because
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:19.160]   what I love about people who read,
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:22.040]   the best, my favorite audiobook narrators
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.080]   are the ones who will act a little,
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:26.400]   just enough so that you can easily discern
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.160]   different voices in a conversation,
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:30.120]   but they don't try to oversell it.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:32.840]   So, it's a detective, he talks a little bit,
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:35.520]   rough about this, he doesn't go full-jyson-sides
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.360]   and whatnot.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.480]   But you know that when there's a conversation
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.080]   through the posh one and the rough detective,
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.400]   you know who's who, and it just makes it flow
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.240]   that much better.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.240]   - He doesn't do this voice when the
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:49.080]   new female assistant is talking to you.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:52.280]   - Let's play, it's Robert Glenister does the narration.
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.160]   - Strike, absorb the impact,
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:57.840]   herd the high pitch scream and react it instinctively.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:00.360]   Throwing out a long arm, he seized a fistful
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:03.760]   of cloth and flesh, a second shriek of pain
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.560]   echoed around the stone walls and then--
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:07.120]   - You can say, it's dramatic, that's good,
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.360]   I wanna hear it now.
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:09.720]   - That's great.
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.280]   So, you wanna get this free, you can.
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:14.400]   It's called The Cuckoo's Calling by Robert Galbraith,
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:17.160]   aka JK Rowling, and it's right there
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.520]   on the front page of audible.com.
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:21.000]   So, here's what you do, go to audible.com/macbreak,
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.720]   you'll sign up for the gold account,
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:25.600]   that's a book a month, but your first month's free.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.200]   That means your first book is free,
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.000]   your first credit is free.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   Pick a book, download it, listen to it.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.360]   If after 30 days you say, yeah, it's not for me, no problem.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:36.040]   Cancel, you pay nothing, that book is yours
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:37.480]   to keep no matter what.
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.640]   I don't think you're gonna say that, I think.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:42.320]   I think anybody who listens to podcasts is probably
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.720]   a good candidate for audible.com.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:47.000]   I am like hooked, and I have been
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.960]   for more than 13 years now.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:53.440]   Audible.com/macbreak, give it a try.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:55.680]   And The Cuckoo's Calling might be a good one to start with.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:59.280]   If you like mysteries, it sounds like kind of a noir,
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:01.240]   almost a noir detective novel.
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:03.760]   - Not really, it's a modern story,
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:07.120]   there's not a lot of, the dame came at me in sections,
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.040]   like they say, the media.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:11.520]   - It really is, let's find out,
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:14.240]   it starts way earlier than it needs to about,
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:17.720]   here's how this woman came to be this person's secretary,
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:19.160]   the day that she had before that.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:22.040]   Here is the pressures that are influencing
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.440]   Cormoran's strike.
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:25.920]   Now, I will admit this was, this threw me,
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.200]   when I was reading the description before I bought it,
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.360]   that Cormoran's strike.
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.200]   - What a name.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.080]   - That's not as bad as Remington's steel, but it's close.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:37.560]   - It's a very, it's a very detectivey sort of name,
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:41.520]   but it's a very, very modern tale.
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:44.960]   I mean, the whole, you can, again, with hindsight,
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:47.240]   you can tell that this was written by somebody
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:50.600]   who has a great deal of experience with the British press,
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:54.680]   because the entire first chapter is about the press,
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:57.840]   the scene of the suicide and the presses,
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.240]   how the presses hang around and smoking cigarettes
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.000]   and waiting for something to happen.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.240]   And you can see this thinly veiled,
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:07.760]   just little tiny little orange seed of contempt
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:08.920]   that's inside them.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:10.280]   - I like it.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:11.840]   - By the way, so the chatroom's saying,
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:14.040]   thank God they don't have Gilbert Godfrey narrating any
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:17.320]   of these, but actually they do, he narrates his own book.
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.160]   - Oh God.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:20.880]   - I'm not gonna read the title.
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:24.720]   - How about, how about like a stage rating of love letters
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.520]   with Gilbert Godfrey and Fran Drescher?
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:27.800]   Let's just, I wanna play just this.
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:29.160]   - Now, now.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.800]   - Here's what Gilbert Godfrey sounds like.
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.520]   - In movie terms.
[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:36.560]   I was once at a party and overheard these Hollywood types
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:38.680]   discussing Tom Cruise.
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:41.680]   - You know, I would listen to that in the car.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:42.760]   I would listen, but anyway.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.200]   - It depends on the story.
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:47.760]   - No, no, if, I, I, you're in California,
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:50.280]   so I bet that that's a way to get points off your license.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:52.200]   (laughing)
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:54.720]   - No, but Godfrey, not all the books.
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.120]   - Do you know what I told you over?
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:56.960]   - Right.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:01.480]   - What do you do when you come to a red light?
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.080]   Do you slow down?
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:03.960]   - Do you stop?
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.400]   - Now I'm presuming that--
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.640]   - Let's take the points on my license.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:08.560]   (laughing)
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:13.400]   - I'm presuming that that is not his normal voice,
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.800]   but maybe it is, I don't know.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:19.440]   Here, there's a, on YouTube, you can,
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:22.160]   there's a video of him reading "50 Shades of Grey."
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.420]   (laughing)
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:27.000]   Now, Fran Drescher reading that.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.240]   Now that would be hot.
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:30.840]   - Ah!
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:33.080]   - Leo Le Porte, you definitely have a type.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:35.480]   (laughing)
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.160]   Here, just, look, get--
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:39.080]   - "50 Shades of Grey,"
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:44.080]   the erotic best-selling novel read by Gilbert Godfrey.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.880]   - My inner God--
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:46.960]   - Okay, we'll stop it.
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.920]   (laughing)
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:49.760]   - How you get the idea?
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:50.920]   - He's a romantic book ever.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:53.160]   (laughing)
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.160]   - Oh, thank you Audible,
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:59.080]   for giving us a good reason to laugh.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:01.760]   Moving on,
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:08.440]   Apple is warning, warning, warning,
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:13.440]   lowered expectations for Q3 2013.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:18.320]   In fact, all of the analysts are also talking
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:19.960]   about lowered expectations.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:24.320]   We will see, when do they announce their July 24th?
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.280]   - Yeah.
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:29.960]   - So, in about six days, before our next episode,
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:34.120]   a number of analysts are kind of downgrading
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:36.480]   what they think Apple will report.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.640]   Apple's traditionally sandbagged the analysts,
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.640]   always saying, "Oh, no, it's gonna be a bad quarter,"
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.440]   and then coming out better than anybody expected,
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.200]   because of course, the stock prices--
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.240]   - They've been honest, simply.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.520]   - They've been more honest?
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.360]   - Yeah, the last few, they changed the whole way,
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:52.440]   they do their expect, I forget what it's called
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:54.760]   when you set expectations for the next quarter,
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.560]   but they've been making those much closer
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:58.520]   to what actual expectations will be.
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:00.800]   - The analyst consensus is that Apple
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:05.120]   will have exactly the same result as this quarter last year.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:07.800]   In other words, zero revenue growth year over year.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:14.000]   - I don't know, would that be a reason to freak out?
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.600]   I don't know.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:16.600]   Doesn't mean they don't make money.
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:18.400]   - It's a different world, because they Apple
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:20.080]   released all their products last fall.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:22.120]   They've had no events until WWDC this year.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.560]   They're probably gonna wait until this fall
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.240]   to announce all their next products.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:28.720]   And that, usually they would have iPad event in the spring,
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:31.240]   and that would boost sales over the following quarter.
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:33.400]   And they've kind of gone at least for the last two years
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.760]   to these ginormous events in one part of the year,
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.960]   and that probably costs them some growth
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.560]   in the other parts of the year.
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:41.880]   - This is actually the first year
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:44.240]   that they have not introduced a new iPad
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.560]   during the spring, right?
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:47.280]   So this is definitely new territory
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.640]   for them in terms of reactions.
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:51.600]   So they gave an earnings revenue guidance,
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:55.000]   but they did not give out an earnings guidance.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.800]   They've only done that once before.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.120]   And so, analysts are also a little worried about that.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:03.400]   They're getting guidance as to what the overall revenues
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.960]   will be, but not have how much Apple would make.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:09.960]   As you probably remember, the earnings margin
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:12.680]   has been shrinking for Apple products as well.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:13.880]   Another cause for concern.
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:15.160]   Anyway, we'll know next week,
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.720]   and we'll talk about it the next Mac break weekly.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:20.640]   (mouse clicking)
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:25.560]   Let's see what else.
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:26.720]   Oh, did you see this?
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:28.960]   This is a Instagram added video, right?
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:31.400]   Now we realize the reason they added video
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:34.560]   was so that they could put ads in the Instagram stream.
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:35.800]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:36.920]   Thank you, Facebook.
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:42.920]   But one of the ads is a 15 second tease for Jobs the Film.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:43.800]   Which one is this?
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:46.160]   Is this the Aaron Sorkin jobs?
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:49.680]   Or is this the God awful Ashton Kutcher jobs?
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:51.200]   The God awful Ashton.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.600]   It's why they went 15 seconds too, right?
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:55.200]   Leo, 'cause six seconds is not a trailer make.
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.480]   Yes, right.
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:57.760]   Vine is six seconds.
[00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.440]   Vine is not gonna have this revenue opportunity.
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:00.640]   Let's watch.
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.680]   Yeah, anyone could take 15 seconds of this crap.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:04.080]   I mean, let's see.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:07.720]   Here's to the crazy ones.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:08.560]   It is Kutcher.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.840]   And this is the rebels.
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.800]   Because the people who are crazy enough
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.040]   to think they can change the world
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.080]   are the ones who do.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:20.560]   That's Hootzba.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:22.000]   To use that copy.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.680]   (laughs)
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.520]   Don't tell so.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:28.440]   Okay.
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:31.440]   That's again, he has a passion Kutcher.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:32.800]   He has a right to work.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.560]   A lot of like, you know,
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.880]   camera operators and lighting people
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.120]   and some guy got jobs.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.760]   Got jobs? Yeah, that's fine.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.920]   Maybe that's what the jobs in this movie title means.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.240]   Jobs for the movie industry, not Steve Jobs.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.080]   Let's.
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.360]   Here's to the show.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:47.800]   (laughs)
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:48.800]   What did they do to you, Lee?
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.800]   They were using this movie forever.
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.200]   Because the people grew up.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.640]   Yeah, 'cause it showed at Sundance
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.320]   and then they didn't release it.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.160]   Which, you know.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.960]   And Macworld, not this year,
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:59.680]   but last year they were showing parts of it.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:01.520]   Termina-pole.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.800]   Well, what it means is it's really bad.
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:05.080]   And they had to fix it.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.440]   Anyway, August 16th.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:10.400]   Or watch for it on Instagram feed near you.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.120]   Watch the whole thing in 15 second clips like this.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.040]   I think we just saw the best part right there.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:15.880]   (laughs)
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.080]   Apple, now this is interesting.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:18.360]   I don't know if this is true or not.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.920]   Jessica Lesson reporting.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.480]   And by the way, this is her,
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.920]   Jessica was at Wall Street Journal.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:28.160]   And she is starting a new enterprise.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.560]   And temporarily on her blog,
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.760]   she's breaking stories.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:33.000]   Which you gotta say, pretty good.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.920]   She says that Apple is trying to launch
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.800]   a television service that allows viewers
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.320]   to skip commercials,
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.360]   but pays the company for the skipped views.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.440]   This would be an interesting secret sauce
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.200]   that might make Apple a little more welcome
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.640]   in those big content company boardrooms.
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.960]   Apple told media executives
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.040]   it wants to offer a premium version of the service
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.440]   that would allow users to skip ads
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.520]   and would compensate television networks.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:05.240]   Now I'm not sure if that means you'll get a button to skip
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.160]   or if it'll be an ad free service.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.480]   It's not clear.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:14.480]   But that's not the point of advertising.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.280]   They don't care that you get paid,
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.240]   that they'll get paid for an ad that wasn't seen.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.080]   They want people to see CGI lemons
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.240]   floating out of the toilet bowl
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.080]   and you'd have, "Wow, I want lemons floating
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.320]   out of my toilet bowl as well.
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:26.880]   What is that product again?"
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:27.880]   So.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:30.680]   - Yeah, and they're paying the media companies,
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.480]   not the advertising companies.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.840]   - And so it's interesting.
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:35.680]   - It's interesting.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.600]   And might be why it's been going fairly slowly
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.680]   for Apple and making this deal.
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.440]   We've been hearing about this for more than a year.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:45.000]   - It would be interesting if the people who are invested
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.600]   in that were the people who are responsible for ad buys
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.600]   that they would get some,
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.120]   it's not as though it's a blanket.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.200]   It would be interesting if it were not a blanket service
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.880]   where you just simply get a version of the service
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:54.720]   without commercials.
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.480]   But if you pay an extra, let's say $3 or $4 a month,
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.640]   you have the ability to push a button
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.880]   and skip a commercial.
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.720]   Because if you're not in the business
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.800]   of selling furniture polish,
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.280]   but you're in the business of selling ads,
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.640]   the knowledge that, "Oh, that person,"
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.560]   here is an ad that absolutely nobody is sitting through
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:10.520]   to watch.
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.280]   That could be interesting and valuable information.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.120]   So maybe they'd go on that basis.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:17.760]   - I should point out that lesson was at Sun Valley
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:22.480]   at the very prestigious billionaire conference
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:23.520]   in Sun Valley.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.840]   But every content executive, Rupert Murdoch on down
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:27.680]   is there.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:30.480]   So it's not unlikely that she got the scoop
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.280]   from somebody there.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.200]   - She had good Apple sources at the Wall Street Journal too.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.960]   I mean, she basically took over from Kane
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.720]   when she took a sabbatical.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:38.960]   - And she's good, yeah.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:39.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:42.160]   So I'm not, I wouldn't throw this out.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.280]   I think that's probably the case.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.600]   The question is whether Apple can convince
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.200]   the contact companies to go along with this, right?
[01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.440]   - It doesn't sound like much has changed.
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.120]   I mean, Steve Jobs had that famous speech
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.560]   at all things digital years ago
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:54.240]   where he said that the go-to-market strategy
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.120]   for any of this stuff is incredibly difficult,
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.840]   much more so than a phone.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.360]   Because instead of several, you know,
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.200]   national cell phone companies,
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.840]   you have all these small regional cable monopolies
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.400]   and some of them like Comcast own studios
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.920]   or competitors like Sony own studios.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.000]   And making those deals isn't something
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.880]   that Apple's traditionally been good at.
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.360]   It's a piecemeal sort of approach.
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.000]   It's not a universal solution.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.680]   And none of this stuff sounds like it changes
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:18.920]   that basic equation.
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:20.960]   And maybe, you know, Tim Cook is more pragmatic
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:23.280]   than Steve Jobs is and he's willing to make more compromises
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.800]   or take a different path than Steve Jobs would have taken.
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:28.480]   But it still doesn't sound like an Apple, an Apple like--
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.520]   - I gotta say though, it's something consumers want.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.720]   I'm pay for HBO so I don't see ads.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.640]   I love Netflix, in fact,
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.520]   some of these Netflix originals now.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:39.920]   I mean, the new one, "Arng is the New Black"
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.080]   is great from the guy who created weeds.
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:43.600]   I loved "House of Cards."
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.320]   That was better than great.
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.920]   And it's ad-free, they're ad-free.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.440]   You're paying content creators directly
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:51.480]   to produce this stuff and getting it out of subscription fees.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.040]   I think that's a fine model.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.400]   The problem is going to NBC,
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.160]   which has sold ads onto these shows and saying,
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:00.280]   "Look at Hulu, they were not able to do ad-free versions
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.920]   even in the paid version of Hulu."
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.280]   - It's intercepting it at the box level
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.280]   instead of the company level
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.280]   and it sounds trickier to pull off.
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.040]   - Well, but I think that's why, frankly,
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.960]   in the long run commercial televisions doomed.
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.360]   - Yeah, I mean, that's one of the things
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:17.240]   I really like about Xbox One strategy,
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:21.440]   which is to say, the whole idea is that
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.720]   we will allow somebody else to get into the mess
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:26.560]   of broadcast television and even basic cable television.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.960]   We will simply give you a pass-through
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.920]   and an overlay that lets you use that stuff
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.720]   a lot more conveniently.
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:35.920]   Meanwhile, a lot of the people who are using our box
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:38.880]   for games are going to be more interested in HBO Go,
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.200]   can be more interested in the individual apps
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.160]   that some of the cable companies are putting out
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.560]   rather than simply sitting through a program guide
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.200]   and watching TV in the traditional way.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.840]   If there's a solution to the problem
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.080]   of getting all these different networks
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.480]   and all these different companies together
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:54.480]   to produce a digital television service
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:56.840]   that works for people, I have no clue what it is
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:59.000]   and I'm not even confident that any company, even Apple,
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.680]   can cut that Gordian knot.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:04.520]   - That's the wait for extension level event, Leo.
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.000]   - I mean, we're at supported content,
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.240]   so I shouldn't be dissing it,
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:11.440]   but broadcast television has gotten worse and worse.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.120]   - You're far more agile than any traditional media company
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:16.520]   and it sounds like the people at the top
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.480]   are just, they look at the music industry
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:20.880]   as a cautionary tale and not as a digital conversion
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:23.000]   success story and it sounds like nothing less
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   than an extinction level event at the top executives
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.520]   at those companies will let the new generation
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:29.360]   of people come in and make the kinds of deals
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.920]   and move into the digital era
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:33.080]   where their content is inevitably going anyway.
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.560]   - Asteroids on its way, guys.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:38.240]   - And the other thing is that you can advertise
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.080]   very effectively because you know exactly
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.860]   who your audience is for show to show to show.
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.480]   So when you're not gonna take an ad
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:45.600]   that you think is gonna honk off your listeners,
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.800]   that's the same, but the compare and contrast
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:52.600]   to cable TV where there are entire channels
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.240]   that I just won't watch anymore
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.400]   because the commercials are just so offensive to me.
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:02.400]   - Trying to watch a movie on an ad supported network,
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:05.800]   it's impossible because we've seen it without the ads
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.360]   and it's just chopped to hell and it's just,
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:09.760]   we're spoiled now.
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.600]   It was fine when that was your only choice.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.240]   You know, Monday night at the movies,
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:17.480]   I remember before VCRs, that was the way you watched movies
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.760]   but we got choices now and it's just not gonna fly anymore.
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.400]   - And then there was no regard for the movie either.
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.040]   They would put the commercial in when the time index
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.600]   told them to and not when the story flowed.
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.120]   - Yeah, even if they didn't have regard,
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.440]   it still didn't work, you know?
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:34.480]   Put some ads in the sopranos, see how good that is.
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:37.240]   - And he's point two, even the Xbox one,
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:39.760]   I plug a PMI pass through in Canada,
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:40.720]   it's not gonna do anything.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.960]   It took a year to get the iPhone here.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.320]   I can't even imagine how long it's gonna do to take,
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.160]   to get studio deals and things international.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.000]   - Right.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.680]   Well, we'll see.
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:53.680]   I talked to somebody over the weekend,
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:56.200]   I won't say what company works for a very large
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:59.520]   American company on the order of Ford or something,
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:02.120]   but not a car company at all.
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.920]   And he said, it was very interesting
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:08.360]   that in the measurement of their response
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:10.680]   on their broadcast ads,
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:13.200]   typically about 1% response rate,
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:18.880]   they were getting response rates on their social media plays
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:22.840]   of 500% more, five times better response
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.160]   on their social media plays.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:27.320]   And of course, it probably was less expensive
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:30.760]   than buying an ad on NBC.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:33.640]   So I think that companies are starting to,
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:34.920]   first of all, they're getting the metrics,
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:36.280]   they're starting to pay attention.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:38.440]   They're noticing this as they dip their toe
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:41.280]   into this new media and different ways of advertising
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:43.640]   and different ways of, let's not even say advertising,
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:47.320]   different ways of reaching their customers
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.160]   and talking to their customers,
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.200]   and more appropriate ways of talking to their customers.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:53.520]   And they realize it's so much more effective
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.960]   that I think that's gonna happen.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.800]   I think we're moving in that direction.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.600]   And I would hate to be a broadcast executive today.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.680]   That's why they should be listening to Apple, right?
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:08.160]   And by the way, the sale of Hulu is off.
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.480]   21st Century Fox, Murdoch, Disney and NBC Universal
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:17.280]   who jointly and kind of inharmoniously own Hulu
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:19.320]   have decided not to sell it, apparently the bids
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:22.640]   that they were getting were not anywhere near what they wanted.
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.320]   So they've decided to put more money into Hulu,
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:29.320]   which is interesting, $750 million into it.
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:31.360]   And I hope they can resolve their issues
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:34.640]   because what we'd heard as part of the problem was
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:39.640]   that one partner wanted ad-free paid versions.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:42.360]   One partner said, "No, you gotta have ads."
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.120]   Then you can guess which was which.
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:49.640]   So it's gonna be interesting to see what happens here.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:54.640]   Disney, NBC Universal and 21st Century Fox.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.280]   Comcast is a silent partner
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:00.800]   because they couldn't buy NBC Universal
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:04.640]   and maintain their managing role.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:09.160]   I don't know, what's the future of Hulu even?
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:14.840]   I like Hulu, I wish that the Hulu Plus didn't have ads in it.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.600]   It feels like I'm paying and then paying again.
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.080]   Yeah.
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.000]   It's not a lot of ads, but...
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   It's enough that it annoys you that you're paying for them.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.080]   It's a little annoying.
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:26.040]   Yeah.
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.760]   And it's interesting because iTunes has everything.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:30.040]   I can go to iTunes and get music and I can get movies
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:31.240]   and I can get TV shows.
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:32.480]   I can't do that for comic books.
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.200]   I have to go to a separate Marvel or DC app
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.760]   for comicsology, you can do it.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.120]   But it's, I can go to Hulu for television,
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.080]   but there's no grand unified place where this stuff just lives
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:42.720]   and maybe that's the future model
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.480]   where channels become apps and they exist
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:46.480]   and I truly believe that...
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:47.480]   It's sort of relevant to internet space.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:51.120]   The reason Hulu was founded is because they saw this kind of new idea
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:53.600]   of paid, of content that's paid,
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.640]   but they just couldn't get the partners to go along with it.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.680]   And that's the problem.
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:59.200]   And I think you're right, I think it's gonna...
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.520]   What did you call it?
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:01.960]   An extinction event?
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:02.800]   Yeah.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:03.640]   Extinction level event.
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.360]   It's gonna take that because these guys are just not gonna go for it.
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.840]   There's a phrase they use all the time for years,
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:13.120]   which is it's a great idea, but a lot of people are gonna have to die first.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:16.120]   I mean, it's not that we should kill people who are opposed
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.400]   to our plan to have free internet television,
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.320]   but only because there are people...
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:26.920]   You need people who have grown up with a wide broad menu
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:29.120]   of internet entertainment choices
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:31.840]   to just naturally and natively understand
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:34.080]   that our networks programming has to be available
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.760]   and streaming through the web,
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:39.080]   just as readily as it streams through any other result.
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:42.720]   When you have people who are even five to 10 years removed
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.760]   from that, they're always going to think that our business is cable,
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.160]   our business is cable television,
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:52.920]   and anything that could possibly ruin our revenue stream
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.560]   from there is just a non-starter.
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:57.960]   It's the same reason that that's why I think
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.960]   that wearable computing, that is going to be cracked
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:03.840]   by someone who grew up with phones, with smartphones.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:07.920]   It's not gonna be done by anybody over the age of 25 at this point,
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.240]   I think, only because you're not gonna understand,
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:11.920]   you don't have that native understanding of it
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.520]   unless you really grew up with this,
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:15.520]   always connected device in your pocket.
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.680]   Again, it's fortunately it's an age thing.
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:19.520]   I'm an old person, I'm stuck in my ways.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.960]   I need... I whittle small ducks and sell them for pennies.
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.840]   You're an old person, I'm the one talking about Monday night at the movies.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.320]   I mean, when you deal with immigrant versus native,
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.200]   there's some people who can move to a new country
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.120]   and immediately become fluent in the language
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:34.480]   and end up living almost like a native existence,
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.680]   and there's some people who, even after 50 years,
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:38.680]   can't speak a word of whatever the local language is
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:41.240]   and exist the same way they did the day they moved there,
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.440]   and it's the same thing digitally.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.920]   You have digital immigrants who never took to it,
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:46.640]   who looked to it as a threat, who fear it,
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.800]   and because it does change, they're changed,
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:51.560]   they're changed, it does change the fundamental nature of their business.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.800]   And even modern companies, I mean, we've seen Microsoft
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.000]   be incredibly afraid of hurting Windows revenue,
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.280]   even when it's destroyed a lot of opportunities for them,
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.160]   where Apple will go and make an iPod
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.600]   and then destroy that with an iPod Nano,
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:03.960]   then destroy that again with an iPhone,
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:06.280]   and then have an iPad next in line.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:09.720]   And it seems like Netflix wasn't called Mail You a DVD Flix,
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:12.200]   they had a clear vision of where the future was heading,
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:15.080]   and that kind of company just seems better suited to the digital future
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:17.360]   than a company that's worried about the copper wire
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.960]   and who has monopoly control over Podon Gillinoy's fiber feed.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.920]   You know, it's kind of depressing, I'm watching Ray Donovan,
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:26.640]   which is an ad-free show on Showtime,
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:29.080]   except that it's clear Apple bought product placement,
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:32.200]   because Donovan says, "Hey, where's my iPad?"
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:35.360]   And then at first I thought, "Oh, well, that was just,
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.440]   they were just trying to be authentic,"
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.040]   and then you see these Apple computers,
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.800]   everywhere it's all Apple computers.
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:44.040]   Same thing, what was the show where everybody had Nokia phones?
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:46.040]   Superman, the Superman movie.
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.160]   And Iron Man had to have his Burger King hamburger.
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.840]   Can you guys knock that off?
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:54.200]   Are we not paying you enough money already?
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:57.320]   It's just annoying.
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:00.440]   But at the same time, isn't it sort of distracting
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:03.960]   when you're watching a sitcom and you see them drinking cans of diet,
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.480]   cola?
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.640]   Well, no, I agree, there should be brands.
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.920]   No, I think it's okay if they're brands there,
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:12.040]   and it's okay if they decide,
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.400]   "Well, we can get 50 grand for basically putting a real product
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:18.520]   in someone's hand, and we're not forced to have them drink this."
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.680]   Right, there's ways to do it.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:21.640]   You're right.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.240]   Well, like CBS has these Windows computers
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:24.360]   that don't exist in the real world,
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.280]   they can't have Dell's, they have to have a Windows logo
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.480]   on the back of their computers.
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:29.800]   It was House of Lies where,
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.720]   unaccountably, every management consultant,
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:33.720]   this is a great show, but Don Cheadle's show.
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.960]   And again, ad-free, I think it was on Showtime,
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.600]   but every management consultant in this entire show
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.120]   is carrying a Nokia Windows phone.
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:43.640]   That pushes credulity to the limit.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:49.480]   That is true, but see, this has been going on for years.
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:53.080]   I was reading about making the movie Capricorn One
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:58.040]   and about how Telly Savalas got signed on to that movie,
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.960]   and the director didn't really want him,
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:02.520]   because I thought, "Well, he's these co-jack from the TV show,
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.880]   we don't want co-jack."
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:06.200]   For getting, he was already like a movie guy
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:07.480]   before he went to TV,
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:10.200]   but the producer who the director acknowledged
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.920]   was a genius at making this movie happen,
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:14.280]   said, "Well, let me put it this way.
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:17.080]   If we signed to Telly Savalas that role,
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.800]   his network will give us $500,000 for the production."
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:20.920]   It's like, "All right then."
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.800]   Okay, I don't know if you remember,
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:24.760]   but when the iPhone came out--
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.120]   It's definitely never advertising.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:27.640]   When the iPhone came out, a lot of TV shows
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:28.600]   were using it upside down.
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:29.960]   Clearly, they just wanted to use an iPhone
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.640]   and they had no idea what it actually was.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.520]   Now, you go again to CBS YE5O,
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.360]   they were using Windows phones for a whole season,
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:37.400]   but not just using them.
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:40.360]   Oh, let me show you how the contacts work on your new phone
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.440]   and then doing a mini tutorial in the middle of the show,
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:43.880]   which was hugely distracting.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:46.440]   Yick. Just yick.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.960]   Well, this season, look, I have a surface,
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.720]   and the person runs out of the police car,
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:52.920]   puts the keyboard down, clips it on, starts up Windows,
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.440]   and then tries to track the back guy,
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:55.160]   which just seems like--
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.280]   He's got an efficient idea.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:56.920]   He's gone.
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:04.280]   Apple Computer loses in court on the eBooks deal.
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:07.240]   All the other publishers tellingly settled
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:09.560]   before it went to court, but Apple decided to fight it.
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:12.680]   And in fact, they are lost in court.
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:15.640]   They say, "We did not fix e-book prices.
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.320]   We've done nothing wrong.
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:18.440]   We will appeal."
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:23.880]   And so this will go on and on and on.
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:24.840]   Apple?
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:25.240]   Go ahead.
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.160]   They're saying they didn't fix prices.
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.280]   They're still heartlessly broken.
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:30.360]   There's still some books that don't get 30% on.
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:31.320]   There you go.
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.240]   I personally prefer the agency model.
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:35.560]   It just makes more sense to me, but whatever.
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:38.280]   Apple-- this is a rumor, but an interesting rumor
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:41.160]   from Apple Insider-- plans to buy a chip fab
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:43.000]   to build its own chips.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.640]   Apple, as you know, buys its chips right now from Samsung.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:49.560]   Actually, you might consider this rumor
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:52.920]   a little less incredible since it comes from a source
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:56.120]   called Semi-accurate.
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:58.120]   I don't know if that's--
[01:16:58.120 --> 01:16:59.120]   Well, anyway.
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.600]   I didn't ask for semi-conductors.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:01.640]   Oh, Semi-acc.
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:02.040]   I get it.
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:02.800]   Semi-conductors.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.640]   It depends on whether there's five volts of voltage
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:06.160]   going through the rumor or not.
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:06.840]   Right.
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:11.880]   You have to pay $1,000 a year to see Semi-accurate stuff.
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:15.560]   So apparently, nobody Apple Insider wanted to buy,
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:17.480]   nor do I, for that matter.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.680]   But they say tags accompanying the story
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:22.200]   may reveal Apple's rumored mystery partner United
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.000]   Microelectronics Corporation, UMC.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.080]   That's a Taiwan-based chip maker.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.640]   It's been around since 1980.
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:34.000]   Trades is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   It would be interesting, wouldn't it, if Apple--
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:37.800]   that makes perfect sense.
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:42.080]   Really, they're designing their own systems on a chip.
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:44.840]   Why shouldn't they make them?
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:47.920]   And they have-- Apple has more chip designers working for them.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:51.560]   They're really-- there's thousands of guys
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.840]   working in this chip design area.
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:55.920]   Another rumor says that they're re-upping with Samsung
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.120]   in 2015.
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.840]   So I mean, it's 6 and 10 and--
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.200]   For the A9 chip.
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:10.920]   Rumor about the next iPhone having a slow motion camera.
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.840]   I have a slow motion camera on my HTC One.
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:14.920]   I don't know if that's--
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:15.840]   Do you like it?
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:18.200]   Yeah, it's cool.
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.000]   Do you like it?
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.040]   Yeah, I like it quite a lot.
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.160]   It's one of those things where I just
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:23.360]   want to film reservoir dogs over and over again.
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:24.720]   Well, and remember now, YouTube,
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:25.960]   you can just upload a normal video
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.720]   and it's super, super, super, well-mosed it.
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:30.040]   But it's kind of fun to have that built into the phone.
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:33.360]   You could do it in iMovie, too, of course.
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.600]   And that's less a rumor.
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:36.520]   And they went into the code for iOS 7
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:37.680]   and found references to that.
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:38.200]   And that's similar.
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:40.600]   I mean, there was panoramic code in iOS 4, 5,
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.040]   and it didn't ship until iOS 6.
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:44.280]   So it's because the code in there doesn't mean we'll see it,
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:46.280]   but it does mean that if something Apple's playing with it.
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:49.480]   It's the mogul feature.
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:55.440]   It would be, according to the code, 120 frames per second,
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:56.920]   which would be four times normal.
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:02.320]   What's nice about that is if you played it back
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:06.840]   at 120 frames per second, you'd have very nice crisp video.
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:12.360]   I have high frame rate video also on the HTC One, 60 frames.
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:12.840]   But it is.
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:13.200]   It's nice.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.760]   It motion looks much better.
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:16.400]   Don't you look at that kind of stutter?
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.480]   Look at the butterflies.
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:21.360]   Apple almost always has a camera feature.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.800]   And I mean, Andy's point about you imagining the keynote's
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.840]   Phil Schiller almost always does a camera segment.
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:28.360]   And you can imagine him talking about the new optics
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.200]   and the iPhone 5S and whatever they've
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.440]   done to make the lenses bigger and the sensors better and that.
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.640]   And then talking about-- and we've
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:37.080]   got this great new feature, 120.
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.200]   Most rock solid beautiful video you've ever seen.
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:39.560]   Look at it.
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:41.200]   It's just gorgeous.
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.880]   But when it's available in Android phone
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:46.280]   and it has been for some time, how many people
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:47.920]   are going to get fooled by that and say, oh, wow,
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:49.080]   that's really great.
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.840]   How many people are just going to say, yeah, well,
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.640]   welcome to the club.
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:55.840]   Well, I think that Apple's secret sauce with photography
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:20:01.480]   I think is really all about the software they put into it.
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:04.120]   Philadelphia on Saturday, for whatever reason,
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.640]   my real camera battery just did not recharge overnight.
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.440]   So I was blowing through both of my Android phone
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:12.320]   and my iPhone as a camera and just doing another one of those
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:14.000]   day through, side by side tests.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.880]   And every single time, there was just something much better
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:20.000]   about the way that the iPhone responded to that scene
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.880]   where the blacks were punchier, their colors
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:24.520]   were a little bit truer, there's a little bit more sharpness
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:25.040]   there.
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:27.000]   And part of that is due to the sensor and part of it
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:27.640]   is due to the lens.
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:29.920]   But a lot of it is just due to the firmware they put into it.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.400]   How do they process that data coming off of that sensor?
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:35.000]   And so I'm convinced that they really do--
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.120]   even if they don't come up with something like the Lumia 1020,
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:40.040]   where you can take it apart and they will show you,
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:41.760]   here's how huge our sensor is.
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:44.120]   Look how amazing our image stabilization is.
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:46.040]   And wow, look how responsive this is
[01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:47.840]   and blah, blah, blah on all the hardware.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:50.120]   But if they then hook it up to an image processor that
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:52.120]   just muddies all the details, who cares?
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:54.760]   You can have a very much simpler, much smaller sensor
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:57.000]   like the iPhones and still have a much, much, much better
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.520]   piece of photography at the end of it.
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.440]   And that's what the chipset you were talking about, Leo.
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.440]   They make their own chipset because that Swift processor
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:06.720]   has dedicated digital signal processors for cameras.
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:09.000]   And I mean, if you ask how people receive it,
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.360]   at the WWDC, Apple invented the square photo and filters,
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.360]   and people weren't adverse to that.
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:15.520]   Right.
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:16.520]   Right.
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:21.040]   That's a little bit embarrassing, I thought.
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.920]   It's like, don't be Instagram deep.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.400]   Don't debase yourself.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.320]   It's kind of like when you find out
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:31.360]   that this absolute guitar god or rock from the '70s and '80s
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:34.000]   is now doing a reality show on TLC.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.400]   It's like, oh, don't debase yourself by doing square stickers.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.000]   And every press release--
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:37.400]   And every press release--
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:39.160]   And crummy filters come on.
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:41.120]   You're better than that.
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.520]   Every press release in my inbox was, we're adding filters
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:44.080]   to this app.
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:47.000]   And if this alone kills all of those press releases,
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.240]   I will be happy.
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:51.680]   I mean, spreadsheets for getting filters.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:53.240]   It's embarrassing.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.480]   We're going to take a break.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:55.000]   Those color class.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.800]   When we come back, our picks of the week.
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:02.400]   Renee Richie's here from iMore.com, Andy Anako.
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:05.640]   From the Chicago Sun Times, you're watching Mac Break Weekly.
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:08.120]   Our show today, as many of our shows
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:10.240]   brought to you by Squarespace.com, simply
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:13.360]   the best place to create your next website,
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:16.800]   whether it's a blog, if you're an artist or a photographer,
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.840]   a portfolio, if you want to do e-commerce,
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.840]   they've got that now.
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.960]   Two Squarespace is hosting plus software.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:24.000]   And it's tightly coupled.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.120]   So you get some real advantages.
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:28.640]   For instance, it is impossible.
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:32.280]   I've never seen a Squarespace site brought to its knees.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.080]   Even when we send the entire Twitter army out
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:37.000]   to bring a site down, it just doesn't happen.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.600]   That's because they've got the best hosting
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:41.720]   with instant on demand bandwidth.
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:42.600]   It's behind the scenes.
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:43.600]   You don't see it.
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.960]   But when your site gets hit, they've got the bandwidth.
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:49.560]   They turn it on, and it just automatically happens.
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.000]   They also have the best templates.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.680]   And designers who are working-- award-winning design team--
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:56.160]   who are working all the time to add new features,
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:59.240]   beautiful templates like the new Momentum template,
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.880]   full bleed, if you're a photographer.
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:02.840]   You're going to love that.
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.120]   They also have a new calendar feature
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:06.280]   that bands will like or stores.
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:10.160]   Anybody with scheduled events, it's called the Events Collection.
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.600]   Everything is drag and drop.
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:14.560]   The Page Builder tool, they call it their layout engine,
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.560]   lets you customize pages in seconds
[01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:20.000]   by adding blocks of content like photos, videos, text,
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.160]   even things like social media content, plugins automatically.
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.640]   Immediately preview it as you go, so you don't need
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:27.400]   to do any coding.
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.280]   Now, if you are a CSS or JavaScript
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:32.160]   coder, they've got a fabulous developer platform.
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:34.560]   Color-coded syntax and all of that.
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:36.440]   The style editor allows selection of fonts,
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:38.320]   colors, or layouts to customize templates.
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:40.640]   Each template starts--
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.440]   there's the Momentum template at a great point.
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.160]   But then you customize it.
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:45.840]   In fact, as you browse around on Squarespace,
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:47.080]   you can see what people have done.
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:48.400]   And everything looks unique.
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.040]   Just scroll down.
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:51.120]   These are all Momentum-based sites.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.800]   It's amazing.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:56.680]   Squarespace.com, and now they've added their flexible and very
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:58.920]   powerful e-commerce solution.
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:03.600]   Unlimited sales, physical or digital goods, or both,
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.760]   they automatically will calculate tax and shipping.
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:11.120]   You can do coupon codes as you wish anytime.
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:13.120]   All the sites, including the e-commerce sites,
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:14.760]   are mobile responsive, which is great.
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:18.120]   It means you automatically have a mobile site.
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:20.280]   You automatically have a mobile store.
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:22.640]   You can publish to and from social media
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:24.080]   with just a few clicks.
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:28.080]   Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Google+, LinkedIn, and more.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:31.120]   All your website needs in a single, powerful platform--
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.760]   domains, design, development, commerce, hosting,
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.920]   and of course, the best 24/7 support.

[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:54.360]   all the SEO, all the images, even all the comments.

[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:58.760]   They won't ask you for money.
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.880]   It's two weeks, absolutely free.
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:03.040]   If you've got an event, two weeks from now,
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.400]   you can just create a site and say, thanks.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:05.920]   Walk away.
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:07.440]   They don't mind.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:09.560]   Oh, yeah, that's the Squarespace Node app, by the way.
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:13.200]   It's fabulous.
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:16.120]   The greatest app developers, they did the great Squarespace
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:19.240]   app for iPhone, iPad.
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.240]   Makes it easy to post, easy to check your stats.
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:22.920]   And I think that they said, hey, these guys are good.
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.240]   We should have them to something else.
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:26.080]   So they have the Squarespace Node app.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.480]   Squarespace is so cool.
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:29.240]   These are just a wonderful company.
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:31.480]   I want you to try it out free for two weeks.
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:34.200]   No credit card needed, no offer code needed.
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:36.640]   But if you decide you want to buy--
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:39.200]   by the way, the price is amazing.

[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:56.000]   because we're in the seventh month, July.

[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:01.720]   And if you buy a big plan, like a yearly plan,
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:03.560]   that's a big savings.
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:06.600]   Squarespace.com.

[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:12.560]   We really love them.
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:15.520]   Andy and Ico, your pick of the week's thaw.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:18.600]   Mine is sort of a combined pick and tip.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.000]   This is a free, very common item.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.400]   This is a travel USB hub with the addition
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:27.600]   that it is a powered hub.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:30.280]   So it's a really good thing to have for a couple of reasons.
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:33.400]   For the usual reason that, OK, you need extra ports.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:37.200]   Also, if you're using devices that are BC 1.1 compliant,
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:40.960]   like the fast charging USB charging system,
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:45.560]   now you have four different ports to charge a device from.
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:47.240]   Although realize that putting four on this
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:50.120]   is going to charge it very slowly.
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:52.080]   And that if you have a 10 watt charger,
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:54.280]   that's going to be a much better way to charge things.
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:57.160]   But the reason why it's a tip is that when
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:59.960]   I was traveling, I was hit the same problem.
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:01.880]   The one really frustrating problem
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:05.520]   I hit with the iPad, which is that you can buy what they--
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.040]   what Apple calls a camera connection kit,
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:11.680]   a camera connection kit, which you plug this in
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:15.080]   and allows you connect your camera or your SD card
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:18.200]   to this device and slurp in the photos.
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.920]   But the thing is, the iPad is very, very
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:23.040]   persnickety about the voltage requirements
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.960]   for this device you plug into it.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:28.040]   All kinds of other tablets and phones and other devices
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:31.040]   that I can hook USB stuff up to.
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.560]   These card readers and devices work just fine.
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:37.200]   With the iPad, it seems even when I'm using the SD card reader,
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:38.880]   as often as not, it'll tell me I'm sorry.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:40.040]   It's device.
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.920]   I can't use device throughout too much power.
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:45.560]   And I'm saying, but it's an SD card reader that Apple made.
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.600]   And I put an SD card reader.
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:48.960]   I refuse to even tell you.
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:49.600]   I apologize.
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:50.840]   I'm not going to use this.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:53.000]   And so it's even more frustrating
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.920]   when you have a device like Google Glass or something
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:58.840]   or a phone where all it has to do.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.160]   It has its own battery.
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:02.480]   It's not asking you to-- oh, man, it's going to try to charge.
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:06.200]   And so this is why now this is part of my standard travel
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:09.200]   kit because I travel with the iPad as my main computer.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.320]   So if you have a powered hub, then the powered hub
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:16.320]   will be delivering all the power that this camera or this card
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:18.800]   reader or this whatever needs for your iPad.
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:20.760]   And now you can finally slurp photos
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:24.680]   from your phone into your iPad or from your SD card
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:25.920]   into the iPad.
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:28.120]   Given that if you were traveling with your iPad
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:30.600]   as your sole computer, you really have no other options.
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:33.600]   It's important that photo import work,
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:36.480]   that's why this little thing, which will cost you all of $20,
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:40.360]   happened to choose the pluggable because it's nice and small.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:43.000]   I was in the hotel room looking for something
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.400]   to buy, good price, good reviews.
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.000]   I was familiar with the name.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:47.960]   And so that's why I picked it.
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:50.800]   But even if you go to office max or staples,
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:53.480]   you'll find others that are just like it.
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:55.600]   And tip number two I will also offer
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:29:00.320]   is that if you're ever traveling and you discover that, oh, geez,
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.720]   I can't do this thing that's really important for me to do,
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:05.840]   if only I had this object or this item or this accessory,
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.440]   I could do that.
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.440]   Order it right there in the hotel room
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.600]   and have it waiting for you when you get home.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:14.680]   Because if you just make a mental note to buy it sometime
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.480]   later on, you will be in a hotel room at some later date,
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:19.880]   also thinking, oh, I can't import in my iPad.
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:22.440]   Oh, if only I had a powered travel USB hub.
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.720]   And then again, you'll promise yourself to get it later on
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:25.640]   and then you will never get it.
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:27.640]   Order it the moment that you believe that you absolutely
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:30.320]   need this thing and then you'll actually have this thing.
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:31.800]   Very cool.
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:35.400]   I did actually order it as you were talking.
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:36.520]   I ordered it.
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:37.160]   It's pretty cool.
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:40.160]   Also, while you're at it, look online for tiny, tiny little
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:42.680]   drawstring bags because you also
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:45.000]   want to make sure that all these things are together
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.200]   when you repack for your trip.
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:49.000]   So I also have a tiny little drawstring bag that has this
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.400]   and the AC adapter and the mini USB connector for it
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.520]   so that they'll never get lost.
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:54.680]   So they'll either get--
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:56.800]   Yeah, have this like the whole thing together.
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:58.240]   Yeah.
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:00.560]   From Plugable, I guess that's the name.
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:01.640]   Plugable.
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:03.360]   It feels like it needs an oom-love because--
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.200]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:06.560]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.640]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:11.560]   They make pyapans and powered travel USB hubs.
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:13.320]   20 bucks on Amazon.
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:15.120]   It's a good deal.
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:17.080]   And I just ordered it.
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:19.280]   And I'm also going to order yours, I think.
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:22.880]   Renee Ritchie, the only guy on app.net, you and me.
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:24.200]   Yes.
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:25.440]   We spent a lot of time on it, though.
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:25.960]   I like it.
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:26.800]   We have a gentleman's agreement.
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:29.960]   It's almost like you and I have a private conversation going
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:30.000]   on.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.320]   Absolutely.
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:33.400]   No, I mean, it's interesting because app.net is different
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:34.520]   from Twitter in that they--
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:36.200]   like Amazon, they kind of also sell--
[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:38.040]   not sell, but they kind of give away their infrastructure.
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:40.160]   They have the microblogging thing.
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.400]   It's absolutely cool.
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.800]   I mean, people got to know it because they migrated there
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.600]   when they were upset with Twitter's policies.
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:47.160]   And they did the microblogging.
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:49.560]   But app.net quickly rolled out their messaging API,
[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:51.040]   which is more than direct messaging.
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:55.280]   It let apps like Whisper become full-fledged group chat apps.
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:56.920]   And they have a file storage API.
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:59.280]   And they've licensed a place's database.
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:00.440]   So you can do location.
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:03.520]   And you kind of can roll your own apps based
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:05.720]   on all this infrastructure they provide.
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:06.960]   And that's what this app does.
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:10.880]   It's by Steve Streza, who used to work at-- most recently
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:12.640]   at Pocket-- doing the Pocket app.
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:14.240]   Oh, love Pocket.
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:14.760]   Absolutely.
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:16.600]   He's gone independent now.
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:18.240]   And his first-- a little while ago, he
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:21.960]   did Project Amy, which let you do app.net messaging inside
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:23.520]   Apple's Messages app.
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:25.200]   And now this is called Oh High.
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:26.920]   And it's kind of a meme name.
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:28.480]   But what it is--
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:29.640]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:33.960]   And if you know Steve, it's got exactly his personality.
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:38.640]   And what it does is it uses a place's system that app.net
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:40.520]   licensed so that you can do check-ins,
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:43.240]   like you would at Four Square or Facebook or anything else.
[01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:45.640]   But he made it that with their file storage API
[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:48.280]   to let you store photographs and comments.
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:51.480]   So it's not Four Square and that it's not a social network,
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:52.160]   per se.
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:54.240]   It's more like a personal journal.
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:57.320]   He wanted an easy way so that he could go someplace cool
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.120]   and take a photo, write some notes,
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:01.440]   so that he himself would remember it.
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:04.720]   Or he could use a share sheet to send it to Twitter or Facebook,
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:06.920]   but not broadcast it to everybody.
[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:08.200]   And that's what this became.
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:10.640]   It's just a way to record the places that you go
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:14.320]   and the memories that you accumulate almost like a journal.
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:15.880]   And the really interesting thing is,
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:18.600]   because it's built on app.net, all your content
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:20.000]   is still app.net content.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.160]   So any other app that can see your files, for example,
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:25.920]   can see the photos that you've stored or pull the text.
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:29.160]   And he's sharing it quite openly so that theoretically,
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:31.720]   people could write apps that let you bring stuff in or take
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:32.600]   stuff out.
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:34.040]   People could write competitors, like,
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:38.320]   or exact duplicates of his own app, which might sound problematic,
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:40.560]   but it means that if he doesn't have the time or capacity
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:43.320]   to do an Android or Windows phone or a Blackberry version,
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:46.200]   somebody else could very easily assemble the same idea
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:47.720]   or a compatible app.
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:50.520]   And it sort of insulates you, because we've gotten used to this age
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:53.440]   when apps get bought or they just get turned off
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:54.120]   and they go away.
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:56.520]   And all the content we've invested in them
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:57.440]   either disappears.
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:00.600]   We have to go through this really complicated, exhausting,
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:03.080]   pulling it out and trying to find somewhere else for it.
[01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:06.320]   And because this is just using app.net, if this app goes away
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:08.240]   or he decides you lose his interest in it,
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:10.080]   all that stuff is still available and someone else
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:12.680]   could roll many different ways for you to get it.
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:15.520]   So I liked the optimism and the generosity of the app.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:18.480]   And I also liked the way the app itself functions.
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:19.720]   Very cool.
[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:23.360]   You have to have, of course, an app.net account.
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:25.120]   Now, they have free accounts now,
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:28.120]   because it used to be had to pay $50 a year for app.net, right?
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:29.600]   They have limited free accounts.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.200]   And you can either get invited or you
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.280]   can download the app.net Passport app,
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:36.360]   and that can get you a free account as to free app.
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:39.520]   Oh, that's an interesting way to do it.
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:40.920]   Yeah, and the Passport app lets them
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.080]   do universal sign-in.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.840]   So you know when you want to authenticate something
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:46.120]   with Dropbox, if you have Dropbox installed,
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.720]   it's just a one button click.
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:49.160]   And it's the same with the Passport app.
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:50.400]   Once you install it on your iPhone,
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:52.600]   anything else that wants access to app.net
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:54.880]   can just hook into that and you just press the button,
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.360]   yes, I'll allow this access.
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:59.120]   And it saves you having to log in every time.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:01.000]   Very cool.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:01.560]   All right.
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:02.240]   Oh, hi.
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:05.840]   Oh, HAI.
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:09.680]   So I recently went to the doctor,
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:13.200]   and he said, you have high blood pressure.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.880]   And you've got to keep track of this.
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:17.320]   And so fortunately, I have a blood pressure monitor
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:20.080]   that hooks up to my iPad and the way
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:21.400]   I end our iPhone from Y Things.
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:22.840]   I don't know if I've mentioned this before,
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:25.800]   but it really is cool, $129.95.
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:28.600]   I can email, I can take the blood pressure readings.
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:30.120]   It unfortunately is a 30-pin connector,
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:31.560]   but if you have the adapter, which I do,
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:35.960]   it works just fine with the iPhone 5 or the newer iPads,
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:38.360]   which keeps track of your blood pressure, your history.
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:42.760]   And yes, you can tweet it, which I do,
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:45.040]   or you can also email it.
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:48.480]   And so my doctor said, what I want you to do
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:50.560]   is just to take your blood pressure a few times a day,
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:52.400]   different times a day during stressful events and so forth,
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:53.800]   and send me a record of it.
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:56.160]   Instead of having to write this all down and blah, blah, blah.
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:57.200]   Very good way to do it.
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:00.080]   They have another tracker to measure your heart rate.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:02.000]   They really get-- I've got the Y Things scale.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.720]   They're really slowly adding to this,
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:05.800]   and they have a baby monitor as well.
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:06.960]   I don't know how that integrates,
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:10.960]   but it also works with the iPhone, which is pretty cool.
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:14.920]   W-I-T-H-I-N-G-S.com, not cheap.
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:17.280]   You can get an inexpensive blood pressure monitor
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:19.680]   for half the price at a drugstore,
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.560]   but it doesn't hook up to your iPhone,
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:24.120]   keep track of your history, and so forth.
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:25.800]   So if you're geek like I am, you're
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:31.280]   going to get the more expensive, but more cool blood pressure
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:32.120]   monitor.
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:37.360]   It is a cuff oscillometric monitor.
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:37.880]   It's great.
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:39.360]   One of my writers reviewed it, and they
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:40.280]   ended up buying their own.
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:41.320]   It was fantastic.
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:42.360]   Very easy to use.
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:44.720]   One size fits all, which is unusual.
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:50.480]   And good to know that it does work with the adapter,
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:54.520]   so it's not like you have to have a old-fashioned 30-pin
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:55.640]   device.
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:57.480]   Hey, that's it for Mac Break Weekly for this week.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:59.320]   I want to thank you, Renee Richie, for being here.
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:01.720]   iMore.com, the place to go.
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:05.400]   Also, if you want to follow the conversation at Talk Mobile,
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:09.720]   if you go to Talk Mobile 2013.com, every week, new stuff
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:11.200]   up there.
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:12.560]   This is a mobile platform week.
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:13.600]   So this is the big one, Leo.
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:15.480]   This is when we talk about different hardware vendors,
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:18.320]   different operating systems, ecosystem services.
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:19.880]   You're going to be contributing, I think,
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:22.040]   Thursday or Friday, talking about where you see
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:23.600]   the future of mobile going.
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:27.600]   We had Sasha Sagan this week, Dieter Bone, Christina Warren.
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:31.320]   We had the senior vice president of Blackberry OS and QNX on,
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:33.800]   I think he's on today, actually.
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:34.480]   Cool.
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:35.440]   Really good discussion going on.
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:36.680]   Very good.
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:39.680]   Talk mobile 2013.com.
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:42.360]   Andy Anakos from the Chicago Sun Times joins us every week
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:43.200]   on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:45.080]   We couldn't do it without him.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:48.440]   He also hosts a show called Anakos Almanac at 5x5.tv.
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:50.840]   Anything else you want to plug, Andrew?
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:53.080]   Oh, got a whole bunch of backlogged hardware reviews
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:54.920]   coming up in the next two weeks.
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:57.960]   So you'll be seeing lots of really crummy product photos
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:59.880]   that I do at Great Haste.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:02.520]   My third Chromebook just arrived in the office today
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:05.280]   so I could-- because I felt as though there was a gap.
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:08.320]   I feel as though when you're reviewing the $1,300 Chromebook,
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:12.400]   you also need to say, here's one that costs less than $300.
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:14.480]   So all that coming up on the Sun Times side.
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:17.360]   And I finally have got Logic Pro 10.
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.360]   I've downloaded all the loops.
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.840]   I have to say-- and I agree with Jim Dalrym,
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:25.360]   with the loop that Apple's done virtually the impossible,
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:28.240]   which is add immense pro power to it application
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:31.800]   and yet make it pretty transparent and easy to use.
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:33.800]   I do like the new interface.
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:36.360]   And I have to say, I think that this is--
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:38.600]   for $199, OK, I'm going to take it back.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.200]   This is great.
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:42.640]   This is a really sweet solution.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:44.880]   And look, you get an 808 drum machine.
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:48.040]   Message to all Twitch staff, rave in the break room.
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:50.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:51.560]   Leo's on the mic.
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:53.400]   I'm on the mics.
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.560]   Andy and I, Carine, Richie, Leo, LaPorte.
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:56.640]   Thank you for joining us.

[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:45.720]   even in the doldrums of July and August.
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:47.040]   Thank you, Chad.
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:48.000]   And thank you for being here.
