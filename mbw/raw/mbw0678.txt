[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. This was such a big day.
[00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.700]   My heart palpitations.
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.180]   A brand new iPhone.
[00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.640]   Brand new Apple Watch.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.800]   Apple Arcade.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.940]   Apple TV Plus.
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.200]   It took two doctors to figure it all out.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.400]   Oh, and JJ Stone.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.060]   Oh, doctors here along with Doc Rock from Hawaii
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.100]   and Andy Inako.
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.360]   Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.500]   And all the new Apple stuff next.
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.620]   Netcasts you love.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.000]   From people you trust.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.000]   This is Twigt.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.080]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 678, recorded Tuesday,
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.760]   September 10, 2019.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.880]   A look inside the iPhone 11.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.600]   Mac Break Weekly is brought to you by Gazelle,
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.440]   the trusted online marketplace for buying and selling
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.560]   used devices.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.600]   Get paid for giving new life to used devices.

[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.240]   at gazelle.com/twit.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.200]   And buy Epson's Eco Tank Printer's Kiss
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.760]   Expensive Cartridges.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.640]   Goodbye.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.440]   Add an Epson Eco Tank Printer to your home or office.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.520]   Eco Tank comes with a ridiculous amount of ink.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.080]   Just fill and chill.

[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.600]   And buy LastPass, a personal password manager

[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.880]   You only need one master password, and LastPass
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.160]   remembers the rest.

[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.840]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.600]   The annual iPhone edition Mac Break Weekly, Andy Nacos,
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.840]   in the house.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.000]   Andy actually is in the library, as usual.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.600]   Howdy, Andy.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.520]   Good to see you.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.280]   Yes, in a game of Clue, it's always
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.040]   done in the library.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.040]   In the library.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.320]   With the titanium watch.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.440]   Actually, I do carry a brass candlestick just in case.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.080]   I'm in trouble.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.800]   And we have two doctors on the show.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.760]   Renee Ritchie and Laurie Gill are, of course,
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.480]   at Apple Park right now, looking at the new iPhones.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.400]   But we thought it'd be fun to have old doctor.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.920]   I did promise him he would get to rant about the new iPhone.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.920]   Owen J. J. Stone.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.000]   It was good you didn't have y'all during the last stream.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.840]   It would have been bad.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.480]   There would have been no point in me having us.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.920]   I appreciate you bringing me on here now.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.440]   It's nice.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.680]   I'd have rode a whole show to cut my mic anyways.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.280]   No, we thought it'd be better just to have you on afterwards.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.280]   Just prudence.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.480]   And welcoming back Doc Rock, who is, of course, Doc Rock
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.800]   Tipps.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.280]   He's a great YouTuber.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.560]   And it's always good to have two doctors on the show in case
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.480]   I have a heart attack.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.520]   Doc Rock, welcome.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.320]   Aloha.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.200]   Aloha.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.400]   We're in Hawaii, are you, Doc?
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.040]   I'm in Honolulu, roughly.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.760]   I mean, Kakako, which is now the new Swanky City,
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.200]   but is roughly about a mile out of Waikiki.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.600]   Nice to have you.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.040]   Be alpha.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.480]   Thank you.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.360]   What is Be alpha?
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.920]   That's your hat.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.480]   What does that mean?
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.080]   I'm a Sony shooter.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.480]   Oh, I'm a Sony shooter too.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.840]   Do you get the mark four yet?
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.600]   I'm waiting.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.440]   I'm waiting too.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.880]   They ship tomorrow, day after tomorrow.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.480]   It's going to be a nice birthday, please.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.960]   I'm a Canon life.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.320]   Yeah, you're a Canon guy, huh?
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.280]   All right.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.280]   And we know Andy's an Olympus guy.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.200]   That's a 10-bit recording.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   We got him all here.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.160]   We got him all in the house.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.680]   Oh, I didn't realize the Be alpha is the Sony alpha.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.520]   The A7R4 comes out 61 megapixels on Thursday.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.560]   I like to tell people I'm an alpha male.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.880]   Alpha male.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.680]   I can't wait to get it.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.440]   I actually--
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.320]   I had on order the Leica Q2, which
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.920]   was a ridiculous $5,000 camera.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.800]   When I found out about the Sony A7 Mark IV for $3,298,
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.160]   I said, I'm taking it.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.760]   And then I treated myself to a lens.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.960]   So I ended up with the same amount of money.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.400]   And now don't you feel silly because your next phone
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.240]   will be just as professional as any other video.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.680]   It might be better.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.680]   Or still can't be.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.520]   It might be better.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.480]   We're coming off the Apple iPhone 11 announcement.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.760]   Yes, it is the iPhone 11, not Xi, but 11.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.000]   And actually, let's start with the iPhone.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.760]   Apple did not.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.760]   It was very interesting.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.320]   Apple started with Arcade Plus, then
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.840]   talked about TV Plus, then talked about the watch.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.800]   We're an hour in.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.720]   I'm thinking, are they going to talk about the iPhone?
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.560]   They did the iPad.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.760]   Finally got to the iPhone.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.560]   So we'll do it in reverse order.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.160]   The one thing I thought was very interesting--
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.920]   I'm curious what you all think of that--
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.320]   is it almost seemed like there was just one new iPhone.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.200]   They spent the big part of the beginning
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.240]   talking about the iPhone 11, which
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.560]   is their replacement for the iPhone XR, starting at 6.99.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.600]   I'm calling it the people's iPhone.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.640]   If there was one motif that ran--
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.440]   in my mind, ran throughout this entire show,
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.720]   it's that whether they're doing this expressly or not,
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.720]   they're really attacking the point that Apple stuff is only
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.320]   for people who have a certain amount of money in their wallet.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.000]   Almost across the entire range of announcements,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.440]   yes, they're showing off a new iPhone 11 that was not presented
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.040]   as, hey, here's a stripped down version.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.600]   Oh, here is the successor to last year's iPhone.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.800]   But now it really is the same cost
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.880]   as what we would probably think of as a moderately priced
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.240]   flagship phone, now that most of the flagships
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.640]   are going for at least $100 more than that.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.360]   And we'll get into the other stuff later on.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.720]   But almost every other category, there was a reason
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.720]   to say that, well, we have now we have a really amazing $330
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.480]   computer.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.240]   We have an Apple watch that it's not the latest,
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.960]   but we're dropping prices down to make sure
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.720]   that more people can get access to them who don't necessarily
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.600]   have a premium money to spend.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.880]   So I'm very, very pleased that they
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.920]   decided to present the iPhone 11.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.360]   Again, not as the, oh, we've got a plastic case,
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.200]   and we decided to make part of the CPU out of some sort
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.640]   of a compressed mulch sort of thing to save money.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.520]   It's like they're trying to say, no, this
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.160]   will compete with the next Pixel phone,
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.960]   with the next Galaxy phone, and it's just as good as everything
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.200]   else for a really good price.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.920]   And to their credit, they're keeping the iPhone 8
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.680]   and the iPhone 10R.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.600]   And the iPhone 8 starts, what is it, low is $359,
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.560]   which I think means that there is an iPhone for every price
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.880]   point.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.840]   I think that's--
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.600]   I think $499 could be wrong for the iPhone 8.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.200]   Is it $499?
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.840]   Let me look here.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.160]   Let's see.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.480]   These are the new ones.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.120]   iPhone 8.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.320]   So I mean, this-- actually, they're still selling.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.920]   It really takes like $6 and $7.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.480]   You're going all the way back to the AC.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.480]   I think they really want to take some wind out of Google sales
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.440]   because they came out to--
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.720]   Google came out with a lower priced version of the Pixel
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.440]   that became just a huge seller, probably the best selling
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.800]   Pixel they've ever made.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.160]   Again, at that same price point, I
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.000]   don't know if that was in Apple's mind
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.480]   as they were trying to figure out pricing.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.080]   But the ability to have an iPhone 8, which is still
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.800]   a kick butt phone for $500, is a really, really good
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.280]   development.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.020]   Yeah, $449 for the iPhone 8.
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:12.580]   $549 for the iPhone 8 plus $599 for the iPhone 10R.
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.760]   And then, of course, all the new ones.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.140]   Owen, are you excited?
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.580]   Did you like what you see?
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.820]   Well, what part are we talking about?
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.900]   The phone?
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.380]   Yeah, let's start with the phone.
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.460]   I'll let you get excited about something else later.
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.500]   So first of all, why doesn't this phone
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.980]   have an always-on display?
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.480]   OK.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.380]   Second of all, why would I watch in this keynote
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.620]   on my phone on YouTube?
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.020]   Finally, thank you, Lord.
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.100]   Jimmy Christmas.
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.580]   I can't do a split screen and tweet the trash talk
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.420]   I want to tweet while I'm watching the video.
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.780]   Oh, because I'm on an iPhone.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:44.660]   That's why.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:45.700]   Oh, but let me guess.
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.460]   You got an ultra-wide screen camera cookies to you.
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.300]   I was throwing cookies at my screen all day.
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.420]   I ate them, so I can't throw some at you right now.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.380]   But I was throwing cookies.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.460]   Like, you want cookies for ultra-wise?
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.100]   I mean, other than them showing an app
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:03.220]   that I can film a studio interview with 19 different cameras,
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.220]   I'm asking you to see it.
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.860]   That was cool to film a phone.
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.740]   Because God knows us professionals are all going to--
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.860]   you wait till you go to CES and pull that phone out.
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.020]   You better not post nothing that ain't recorded
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.740]   from your iPhone 11 pro.
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.660]   I don't want to hear nothing.
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.260]   I will see nothing.
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.060]   No, I actually--
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.860]   I'm already deciding.
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:20.340]   I'm already deciding.
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.060]   That's the phone I'm taking to CES,
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.500]   because I can record me and the person I'm talking to
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.220]   at the same time.
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.740]   It's the Aeromoris phone.
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.180]   It's the Aeromoris phone.
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.260]   That's filming.
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.580]   You have to buy a third-party app,
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:33.620]   which isn't yet available.
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.300]   And we don't know.
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.740]   Filmic, I think, is fairly expensive.
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.540]   These are in-app purchases.
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.140]   Actually, filming starts out free,
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.060]   and then it's like $19 for the Pro Pack.
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:42.980]   Oh, that's not too bad.
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:43.620]   That's not too bad.
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.460]   Doc, it's not bad at all.
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.460]   For what it does, it's not bad at all.
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.940]   The fact that this phone is fast enough to shoot
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.860]   with both the front and the back camera,
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.620]   or two of the back lenses, at the same time,
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.500]   with, I guess, saving two separate streams,
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.300]   is pretty impressive.
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.980]   I'm guessing that's also because they're
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.100]   using faster memory, faster storage,
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.900]   which other manufacturers have started to do as well.
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:06.860]   But they didn't mention that.
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.620]   In fact, there's a lot of specs that went on.
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:13.500]   That was one of the-- that was part of the cloud of features
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.020]   that was on the screen at some point,
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.340]   where they were calling a desktop-- there you go--
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.980]   desktop class storage.
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.580]   Right.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.260]   Let me ask you, Doc, Rock, what do you think?
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.660]   I'm really looking forward to the Pro for the number reason
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.340]   that I do shoot a lot of video with the iPhone,
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.180]   because it makes great b-roll stuff for my YouTube videos.
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.140]   And I'm shooting right now with a cinema movie,
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.540]   cinema robot.
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.980]   It's kind of like a gimbal.
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.900]   And I've been thinking about getting the new Osmo,
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.900]   so it's going to be great to be able to shoot
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.740]   both directions.
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:51.060]   Or with the Mivo, which I've used for a long time,
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.980]   you had that 4K that allows you to switch around.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.340]   Zoom around, yeah.
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.660]   Like the old Telecaster days, or that new tech thing
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.580]   that I used to have on my Mica piece.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.060]   Tricaster, there you go.
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.660]   So I remember what a Tricaster cost.
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.460]   I used to fix them and set them up.
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.740]   And now I can do that on the phone with a $200 gimbal.
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.140]   It's amazing.
[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.340]   They're going to have to redesign it.
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.500]   And I used to fewer of these gimbals,
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.100]   because a lot of them block the front-facing camera
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.020]   when you shoot in the back-facing camera.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:21.500]   Right.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.540]   Yeah, they're going to have to do it.
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.220]   Just to redesign a little bit so I can get both lenses going.
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.420]   But I have to say, you make a good point, oh,
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.140]   and it's not like this is the first phone with three lenses.
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.860]   It's not the first phone with Ultra Wide.
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.260]   I've been using the Samsung S10 Plus, and now the Note 10
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.580]   Plus with three lenses.
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.500]   And that was the first thing I noticed is the Ultra Wide,
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.700]   and how much I like it.
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.860]   But I do have to say, it looked like-- and maybe one of you
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.260]   can comment on this-- one of the problems with the Ultra
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.780]   Wides, it's effectively 13 millimeters, of course,
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.060]   is distortion around the edges, weird curvature.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.620]   And the images Apple was showing,
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.540]   and we'll have to wait until we get the phones to really check.
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.700]   Looked like they'd all been corrected.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.820]   There wasn't a lot of curvature.
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.100]   They looked pretty darn good.
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.820]   I think the truth does it in camera.
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.260]   It must, yeah, as you're going.
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.660]   Yeah, which is great.
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.340]   Yeah, according to the data that was attached to one
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.100]   of the Ultra Wides, the Super Wide 12 megapixel image
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.380]   was the 35 millimeter equivalent of a 13 millimeter lens
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.060]   with a 120 millimeter field of view.
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:21.620]   It's amazing.
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:22.220]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.580]   I was looking at the edges, and it really did look clean.
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.580]   Edge to Edge.
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.740]   Yeah, that's a hard thing to do.
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.140]   Again, that camera is the most impressive thing of the day
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.340]   for the phone for me.
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.140]   When they go through at 20 minutes of machine learning
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.220]   and show me a video game play that I've seen for the last nine
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.980]   years on an iPhone--
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.340]   Yeah, it was infinity played.
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.980]   It's a name, play 33.
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.540]   It's literally the same thing.
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.980]   I remember last year when they showed me the iPhone Max,
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.220]   and they had somebody shooting baskets,
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.100]   and the phone was tracking a basketball,
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.980]   counting up baskets, you don't remember that.
[00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.700]   I'm like, where's that app at?
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.940]   Where's that technology and use in my phone?
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.940]   I mean, I code softball, all kinds of stuff.
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.980]   I'm like, man, I could actually use something like that.
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.460]   OK, but we're still better.
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.700]   We're 34,000 times a computer learning.
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:10.540]   For what?
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.780]   Well, that was actually a good question.
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:17.060]   If you put in machine learning hardware,
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.180]   which Apple was loading up on-- and by the way,
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.580]   important to note, first time ever
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.780]   that somebody from the CPU design team
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:27.100]   is invited up on stage during this flagship event for Apple,
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:31.620]   shows Apple is really all in on its own internal CPU designs.
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.180]   I think that's an important kind of bell
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.820]   weather going forward for a desktops as well.
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.380]   But they did spend a long time talking
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.820]   about this machine learning pipeline.
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.820]   And at least for most portable devices,
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:48.380]   all the machine learning is done off machine,
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.700]   and then the model is put on the phone.
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.780]   You don't really.
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.660]   But I guess Apple wants to do more in camera.
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:54.980]   Is that it?
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.700]   Well, remember that one of Apple's big highlights
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.020]   is that, yes, we're doing machine learning and AI,
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.620]   but we're doing as much of it on device as possible.
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.580]   So we have to send as little data off of your phone
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.500]   to a central server as possible.
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.580]   And we're still waiting for-- just like Owen said,
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.740]   we're waiting for a company to say, hey, here is our machine
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.820]   learning app that we have created that does amazing things
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.420]   that's going to make all this justifiable.
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.420]   The key with machine learning is all a huge data set.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.100]   You learn from a huge data set, and then you
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.340]   take the learning, the model that you created,
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.540]   and you put that on the phone.
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:34.060]   You're not inputting a huge data set into the phone.
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:34.980]   So I'm kind of--
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.940]   You want to personalize your own results, though, don't we?
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:37.460]   Don't you?
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:37.980]   Yeah, but--
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:38.980]   Wouldn't you be creative if it learned that it was--
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.380]   Will you be doing that based on a model that
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.780]   was trained off phone anyway?
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.620]   For biggest data security, what you're going on
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.420]   is the Apple Watch.
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.380]   They're collecting a lot of data there, absolutely.
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:50.380]   And collecting a lot of data.
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.260]   Even that research thing that's coming up,
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.060]   I thought was impressive.
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.300]   The research app is going to do wonders.
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.740]   And I will be the first to admit, I stand here right now,
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.980]   three days away from 53 years old,
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.380]   grown man, 250-pound, six-foot tall.
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.180]   And when they started that Apple Watch video,
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.460]   Bratera was pouring out the side.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:14.540]   Especially the one where the mom talked about making it
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.700]   to the hospital in time for her birth,
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.820]   because she was having heart problems or whatever.
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.380]   That was amazing.
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:24.180]   The little cross-country kid, right when they got to that cross-country
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.500]   kid running and saying he uses the music to block people out,
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.980]   the tear was starting to get all up in the beard.
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.020]   That was really, really heartfelt.
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.500]   And people like to tease Apple for that kind of stuff,
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.940]   but that's because it doesn't affect you.
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:43.980]   As a person who has asthma, and a couple years back,
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.580]   I had a stroke.
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.860]   So I watch my heart now.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.540]   My watch helps me.
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.780]   And I don't like it when people poo-poo that because it doesn't
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.060]   affect you because you happen to be lucky enough not to have had
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:55.620]   any issues.
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:59.420]   So I kudos to Apple for that, no matter what any of the naysayers
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.420]   say.
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:00.700]   Yeah.
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.700]   I'm a naysayer.
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.900]   And I--
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:03.900]   Go ahead.
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.900]   Sorry.
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.340]   We have to mention that Owen actually has no heart.
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.540]   So it's not useful for him.
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.940]   No, I have high blood pressure.
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.300]   I have a weak heart.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.980]   I have to go get tested every six months.
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.380]   So it does affect me.
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.060]   But when my doctor, who is very proactive,
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.700]   tells me that there's not really that much that I shouldn't
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.060]   be depending on this watch, basically, is what I've been told.
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.220]   So is it useful to watch my heart rate?
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:28.980]   Yes.
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.060]   When I've gone into the doctor and I've checked it against things,
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.220]   it's not always accurate.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.740]   But at least it's something.
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:40.060]   So it's better to have than not have, but a lot of devices have it.
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.380]   And as far as the kid running and listening to music,
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.900]   I don't-- again, I don't have a heart.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.340]   I'm like, we never had iPods before.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.620]   Like the little earbuds from Samsung
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.460]   have four gigabytes of storage.
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.300]   I can put music at them and run.
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.340]   Again, I get marketing.
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.740]   But yeah, I'm one of those really does have a heart,
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:57.700]   with a certain thing.
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.820]   But again, better than what it happens.
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.100]   It's good, my book.
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.020]   It's great marketing.
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.100]   But it is just that.
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.300]   You're exactly right.
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:07.300]   It's a tear-jerking, beautiful movie, which--
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.260]   And the best at it.
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.340]   Apples the best at it.
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.020]   They're very good at it.
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.940]   I'm more interested, frankly, in speeds and feeds.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.180]   I thought it was really-- what I thought was really interesting
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.100]   was Apple dividing the presentation.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.780]   They did a presentation for normal people.
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:26.060]   That's the iPhone 11, the base model, the replacement
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:27.100]   for the 10R.
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.460]   And they talked about all the cool things the iPhone does,
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.700]   all the great pictures.
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.340]   And then there was a very clear line.
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.220]   And now, for those of you who really care about machine
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:40.180]   learning or pretend to or speeds and feeds,
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.020]   now we're going to get the enthusiast phone.
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.540]   I think this is something Apple has done in the past.
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.700]   I remember Steve Jobs, when he came back to Apple,
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:47.700]   drew that quadrant.
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.260]   He said, we have too many models.
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.380]   There's really only four kinds of models.
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.100]   There's Pro and Consumer.
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.980]   There's desktop and mobile.
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.220]   And I think this is Apple kind of going back to that.
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.660]   And I think that's why the Pro moniker is really important.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.940]   There is a consumer version of the phone.
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.500]   That's the one we're going to sell a lot of.
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.860]   That's the one that is much more affordable.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.060]   What was it? $699.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:13.500]   That's a great starting price.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.580]   But for those of you for whom price,
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.780]   for willing to pay 300 bucks more,
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.940]   for whom price is the whole object,
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.540]   we look at all the technology we can build in.
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.100]   This is kind of what they've been doing with it.
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.780]   Macintosh is kind of what they do in the MacBook.
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.420]   And they've what they've done with the iPad.
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.380]   And I think this is a really smart move on their part.
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.020]   Well, what it does is it controls the site.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.380]   Go ahead, Andy, and Doc Rock.
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.340]   It's just that the only thing that we've been sort of debating
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.980]   as it looked like they were doing something
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.460]   that they were going to call a Pro is
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.380]   what would make a phone into a Pro thing.
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.380]   And whereas Samsung has the answer of,
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.660]   we're going to give you amazing amounts of storage.
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.260]   We're going to give you expandable storage.
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.180]   We're going to give you the ability to use it as a desktop.
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.420]   We're going to give you a stylus,
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.420]   which are things that will appeal to somebody
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.740]   who feels as though they don't want to be carrying a tablet
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.940]   or a notebook around anywhere.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.220]   The only thing that Apple was able to really say
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.700]   is to hit upon the point of what a wonderful camera this is
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.180]   and what a wonderful video is that these things shoot.
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.140]   And also, here is how good the display is,
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.460]   which is something that really is only going to affect you
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.700]   if you're using it to shoot video and to take pictures.
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.380]   And of course, it makes all your Apple TV+ content
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.380]   look better, but it also looks fine on the cheaper camera.
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.420]   A cheaper phone.
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.020]   And the only other thing that was exclusive
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.820]   that they really hit upon was like we discussed improvements
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:34.820]   to the CPU for machine learning operations,
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.700]   though I don't know if that was exclusive
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.980]   to the iPhone 11 Pro.
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.340]   Really, so it's weird to think that the only thing
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.220]   that can really say about it is that now you can actually
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.100]   shoot professional level video using this new phone.
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.420]   They weren't saying, now they weren't saying,
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.180]   you know how you often will take videos of your kids
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.380]   and they come out looking lousy because the phone
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.220]   does not understand that these little rats
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.300]   are just jumping up and down into and out of light.
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.660]   We've got with the pro phone, we've got so much power
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.820]   and so much learning and so many cameras that you will
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.220]   always make sure you get great pictures of your kids
[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.740]   or your dogs or your vacations.
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.060]   It was all, of course you're gonna rent a studio,
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.700]   a film studio, you're gonna hire all these actors
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.940]   and all these professional sound
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.900]   and then you're gonna shoot it with a phone.
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:21.540]   Okay, maybe rent a red camera, I don't know,
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.060]   but okay, if it's fine, shoot it with your phone.
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.780]   - Great, Doc Rock, I mean, you would qualify as a pro
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.020]   at this point given what you did for a living.
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:33.860]   - Oh yeah, I shoot in red, sometimes I shoot in DSLR,
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.220]   sometimes I shoot in phone and it's really a matter
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.780]   of the situation of how obtrusive you want the camera to be.
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.260]   And so one of the benefits of having a phone
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:47.140]   that is qualified enough to basically be almost hidden
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:52.140]   is sometimes it allows the candid stuff to become candid,
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:56.540]   right, when I set up a SACLA V15 and plapa, a red
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:00.420]   or a larger format camera or even a large DSLR
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.820]   by the time you hook up all of the accoutrement
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:07.020]   it takes to make it really good, mirrorless not DSLR.
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:11.380]   Now there is a camera, but the phone is really good.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.380]   And as much as, again, in these events,
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:18.420]   we love the poo poo phones, but every day if you watch news
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.860]   they get somebody that manages to get something
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.740]   that's very integral to the story
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.100]   and the only way they shot it was because they had a phone
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.700]   in their pocket and Rick Sammons used to say
[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.940]   the most important phone is the one you have in your pocket.
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.860]   So yes, the camera will always be,
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.460]   but the one thing that I want everybody to keep in mind
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.500]   and I'm going to channel my Renee,
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.340]   remember every body shape of the iPhone,
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.660]   the third or fourth one is the maximum,
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.780]   the bestest and the greatest of all of that.
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.860]   So we weren't expecting any major change
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.740]   'cause this is not a retooling year.
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.380]   Next year is a retooling year.
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.780]   So for what it's worth, we got sort of what's always
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:58.980]   on this revision of an iPhone from all the way back to 3GS.
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.940]   - Aren't we kind of delayed though for the retooling year?
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.340]   Last year was the S model.
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.020]   Normally this would have been the retooling year.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.260]   We got a gap because of anniversary.
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.580]   - Right, that's it. - And that threw off the cycle.
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.100]   The 10 threw off the cycle.
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.260]   - Yeah, I have to say, I had to laugh in the video,
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.940]   they're showing the professionals using the iPhone.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:24.700]   Okay, I'm going to have to memorize this 11 Pro Max
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:29.700]   to shoot the string quartet and they've got it on a dolly
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.340]   on a professional tripod, you know,
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.660]   one of those with the glide liquid heads
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.940]   and it's been a mountain, there's a little dinky
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.500]   little phone on that.
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.420]   And it, it'll be a 17 year old in a stolen shopping cart
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.580]   that uses the battery. - Yeah.
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.580]   - It'll be a little silly. - To get the little,
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.460]   to briefly say that if you spend a little bit more money
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.580]   to get like the next, a phone a little bit better
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.860]   than what you're going to get as a 17 year old,
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.580]   you will be able to make the most wonderful
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.540]   next level of this video. - Put 'em on a skateboard.
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.700]   - I agree, put 'em on a skateboard and push 'em.
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.500]   - And they barely touched on,
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.420]   they barely touched on this stabilization.
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.060]   They talked about it real quick.
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.380]   - That's gonna be key too, isn't it?
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.660]   - That's gonna be key, but you know,
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.820]   coming from like the Osmo and Osmo pocket,
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.020]   which are great stabilizers,
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.700]   it's gonna be interesting to see how much
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.540]   in camera stabilization this thing really can do.
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:21.540]   - I, Doc Ruck, I have this feeling that there is,
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.620]   in my head, I am now starting to see stabilized video
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:28.060]   and it's bugging me because it's a little bit of a,
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.580]   it's almost like a jelly like,
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.900]   you can feel, you can see the stabilization.
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.980]   - That's warp stabilization in software after the fact.
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.900]   - No, no, I'm seeing it with Osmo too,
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.900]   and I don't like it.
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:38.820]   - Oh, you mean regular?
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.940]   - Yeah, I don't like it, right?
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.820]   - I wanna, oh yeah, it's weird.
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.620]   And I almost wanna say, bring back handheld.
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:46.540]   I don't think that we're getting,
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.100]   we've got used to it.
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.300]   We can overdo stabilization and be very interested
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:54.340]   to see Apple do a light touch stabilization that does almost--
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.580]   - Yeah, I like the Blair Witch.
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.540]   Blair Witch is much better than watching this
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.380]   through a lightning shadow.
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.980]   - You know what, you gotta make a video,
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.540]   image stabilized Blair Witch Project.
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:07.180]   - And I see how less, how much less scary that is.
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.020]   You know?
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.900]   - I was more impressed seeing a mom watching her kid play soccer
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.500]   or a dad watching her son play a basketball game
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.860]   and show me some back and forth track with your phone.
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:17.700]   - But that was my point is--
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:18.540]   - 'Cause when you put her on a dolly
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:19.540]   and you're like, oh my god.
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.660]   - But that's the point, is Apple's putting this
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.380]   dividing line, here's the soccer mom phone
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:28.180]   and here's the, I don't know, the videographer phone.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.140]   - The stabilization software and the chip are all the same.
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:31.980]   That's what I mean about that.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.060]   - I can't watch it. - I can't watch it.
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.460]   - And I can't watch a video and split screen and do it.
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.380]   You're telling me it's the most powerful chip
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.500]   two years out of pose to every other phone
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.660]   but I can't split screen and run two apps
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.620]   at the same time on my phone.
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.860]   But it's two times more powerful than any phone is out right now.
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.300]   - Owen. - I can't do that in my song.
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.500]   - Owen. - There's certain things
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:52.460]   that I'm like, what are you doing?
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.660]   - We've tested this with real people
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.180]   and we've found out nobody does it.
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.020]   - Nobody does it.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:57.860]   (laughing)
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.740]   - I don't, I've had it in my--
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:00.580]   - I've had it in my--
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.420]   - I've had it on my Samsung.
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.260]   - Except for the people do.
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:06.700]   - I just sat and watched a football on Sunday
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.180]   with four guys, had three phones out and two tablets
[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:12.660]   and everybody has split screens watching their fantasy team.
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.180]   So I don't think you live in a real world
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.180]   like I live in a real world and I see people do it all the time.
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.580]   My cousin writes notes on his galaxy note nine
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.980]   and he translates all the stuff--
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.820]   - Really?
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.220]   - And he thinks it's the greatest gift to the world.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.060]   - Okay. - Okay.
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.820]   - So I mean, I'm in the real world
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.940]   and I'm in the real world every day regular people.
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.940]   I see people that use the note for business and work
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.020]   and write stupid notes, which again,
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.380]   I don't really need the pen,
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.180]   but I would just like to do two things
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.660]   on my most powerful phone at one time
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.580]   as opposed to just watching a YouTube video
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.580]   and I can't do anything else.
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.300]   - You could only recently do two things on your iPad
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.220]   and you have a giant screen.
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.980]   - I know, but I don't feel like carrying around a 14 foot iPad
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.460]   pro all the time to do things.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:56.660]   - I've had, I've had multi-screen on all my galaxies
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.500]   for years and I, you know, it seems like a cool feature,
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.220]   but I never think to use it.
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:02.940]   - It's not something that you use
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.140]   every single moment of the day,
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.180]   but it's just like I would say,
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.700]   when you're in a situation where I would like to keep track
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.820]   of two things at the same time in my hand,
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:15.740]   like I want to know where I am on this moving map
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.500]   so I know when to get off this train,
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.420]   but I also want to keep up with tweets.
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.900]   I also want to look at pictures.
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.780]   That's when you're like, "You're on glad I have this thing."
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:23.620]   I'm glad I'm having it. - Oh wait a minute.
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.220]   I want to be realized. - I want to be realized.
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.860]   - If I could live tweet the event,
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.300]   that's one of the perfect uses for--
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.180]   - Who tweets on the phone? - I'm on the phone.
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.540]   And I get to 90% of America.
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.380]   You don't tweet or Facebook.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.860]   You are not on the phone.
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.580]   - No, and actually I realize why it's not an issue for me
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.780]   'cause I always have three or four phones with me.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.140]   So I just get my other phone out.
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.580]   - I know you got really good assets here.
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.340]   - I got, all right.
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.340]   Now I saw my problem. - You see, you saw the problem.
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.780]   Multitest. - There you go.
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.660]   Everybody should have one Samsung and one iPhone.
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.420]   It just makes sense.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.220]   - I do have nine phones in front of me too,
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.100]   but that's neither here nor there.
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.300]   - Well, one of you though, is honestly,
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.260]   I find myself doing the screen swap really fast.
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:11.620]   And I guess because I can't see that having the--
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:12.460]   - It's a swipe. - The life is wide.
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:13.420]   - It's a type full.
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.260]   It's fine.
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:15.340]   It doesn't really bother me.
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.420]   It's a single pop pop and it doesn't hurt anything.
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:22.860]   Now, however, here's the thing I find out about a lot of the
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.620]   old Apple needs to play catch up.
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:28.620]   Apple has always been, and I sometimes hate them for it,
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.820]   sometimes love them for them.
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.740]   We're not gonna put anything in just because it's possible.
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.100]   We kinda sorta wanna make sure it works.
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.780]   And the times that they've taken the risk
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.460]   and gone from, I'm gonna do something
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.300]   without making sure it's fully baked,
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.300]   we have ripped them a new Apple hole.
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:48.020]   So I prefer that they let everybody else play around with it
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.340]   and then come back and steal it when it's ready.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.740]   'Cause that's the experience that we use.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:52.780]   - This is Owen pointed out.
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:54.220]   We've had three lenses.
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.300]   Huawei did it.
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.180]   Samsung did it, three lenses.
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.860]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.460]   I do have to say though, what Apple did that's really cool
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.340]   is all three lenses on the Pro are hot.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.380]   They all three are focused.
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.020]   They all three are color balanced.
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:13.820]   And if you wanna slide your finger and zoom in,
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.580]   it's gonna be ready to go.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.420]   That is pretty cool.
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:19.260]   - That's awesome.
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.420]   But always on display, I think that's baked.
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.740]   I think like every phone in America, outside of Apple,
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:25.660]   has a old one. - They still don't.
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:27.220]   - They still don't do that.
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.420]   - And they showed me that they had up to a one knit line
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.060]   of power in the, like just do it.
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.780]   Just put it in the phone while you're doing it.
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.100]   That's all I'm saying. - But look at the battery life.
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:41.100]   They added on the iPhone 11 Pro Max XDR dohickey.
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.300]   They added five hours of battery life.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.180]   That's kind of-- - No rest.
[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.540]   - Nobody's doing that these days.
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.620]   - Let's make sure that we unpack it
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:53.300]   over the next week as people try to analyze this.
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.740]   'Cause they're a little bit saying,
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.380]   okay, compared to the XS, up to four hours more,
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.060]   with the Pro Max up to five, there was another stat
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.660]   that also compared it to, I think, to a different model.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.140]   - Oh, I thought they were comparing it to the XS Max.
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.660]   Five hours-- - No, they said five hours more than--
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.500]   We're gonna have to go to the tape, but my impression was--
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.580]   - Yes, that's why.
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.140]   - It was five hour more than the XS Max
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.020]   than the existing large phone.
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.420]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm saying that
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.780]   there's a little bit to unpack there
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.820]   before I would remove the quotation marks around it.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.660]   - Oh, yes.
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.780]   - Like an hour after the show,
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.740]   when you want to tell people that,
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.820]   oh, it has up to four or five hours more,
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.500]   you want to quote exactly what they say
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.260]   and not take responsibility for it.
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.580]   Next week, I'll take responsibility for, okay,
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:42.220]   it seems as though that is exactly what's going to happen now,
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.500]   but there seem to be a little bit of a gerundral--
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:48.100]   - Well, let me say that the caveat absolutely is
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.700]   that none of us have even played with this phone
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.660]   'cause we're not at the Apple Park,
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.820]   and especially with photography,
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.900]   I take everything with a grain of salt
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.500]   because those are their images carefully picked,
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.260]   and we have to see how it works in the real world.
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.500]   - And they said that's what I was getting on about earlier
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.980]   that I just wish that-- - Yeah, night mode.
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.740]   - They invented night mode.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.780]   - Yeah, but they get pretty quickly over it
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:13.940]   'cause they know how good the competitors
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.540]   are doing with night mode, and now they're saying,
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.340]   oh, we have this new mode,
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.220]   and here's a very, very quick one single picture
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.060]   of how well it works, but we're gonna be--
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.060]   - It did look good.
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.340]   Let's take another look at that bionic chip.
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.700]   But what I'm saying is that most,
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.220]   there are plenty of people, particularly journalists,
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:31.700]   particularly journalists who are putting their lives
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.540]   on the line by being citizens of a government
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:37.140]   that really, really, really wants them to disappear,
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.300]   that do professional level video
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.620]   and really great storytelling with their phones.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.020]   However, most of the people who are gonna be buying these phones
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.860]   again are gonna be wanting to say that,
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.260]   remember that time where we took that picture of the kid
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:53.260]   at Disney's Castle and someone walked right in the middle
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:56.060]   of the picture at the exact wrong time and we missed it?
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.540]   Or remember the time where the baby fidgeted it,
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.340]   so we only got a blur of the baby?
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.740]   They really wanna see that they'll spend the extra 300 bucks
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.780]   because here is the video that was shot
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.220]   with another person's camera,
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:08.660]   that it didn't come out well at all.
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.820]   Here's how we managed to fake a much, much better photographer
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.020]   with a much, much better camera,
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.380]   with a much, much more well-behaved kid
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:18.700]   because we've got all this technical know-how in this camera.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.220]   So that's why I'm surprised that they really, really went hard
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.540]   on if you want, and for those of you who are renting a studio
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.420]   and buying and renting a dolly rig
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.340]   and are a professional cinematographer,
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.900]   that's how many people in the audience are raising their hands.
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:33.020]   Oh, wow, that's totally me.
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.180]   Apple finally gets me.
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.580]   No, I think though, I wanna say it one more time,
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.060]   I think you guys are missing the point,
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.900]   that Apple had two audiences
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.100]   and two different messages for their iPhone.
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.340]   They had the regular person, the soccer mom,
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:49.620]   the O and JJ, whatever guy.
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:53.060]   And then they had the enthusiast, the Doc Rock,
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:56.460]   people like me who are all about speeds and feeds.
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:00.700]   And we say, oh, it's got core ML3 and 64 bits.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.580]   And so I think that that, they did a good job
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:07.980]   of splitting those two audiences.
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:10.300]   And so don't conflate the messages,
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.580]   there's two different audiences.
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.180]   To be clear, one, I do have a max,
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.940]   I am of the top tier, I'm just talking about
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.340]   regular people who live in.
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.900]   But the differences is that, again,
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:25.340]   the same chip so that in my mind makes it feel the same.
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:28.060]   The one thing I appreciated they did was change the branding.
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:32.060]   It's no longer an XR, it's just gonna be 11s going on forward.
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.540]   - Thank God. - Hopefully in the 12s,
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.580]   going on forward.
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.180]   So even, it makes it easier for people
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:38.940]   to make that decision and choice.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.380]   What are really gonna come down to is what people gonna forward.
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.620]   You know, I think this is $50 less than the XR
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:44.900]   came out last year, right?
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.780]   The XR launched at 749.
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:50.260]   So that in itself is a reaction definitely towards
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:53.860]   Pixel 3A device and how well that's done.
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.580]   And there is a market for that, bringing that price down.
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.060]   But I feel like people are just gonna go,
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.460]   oh, that's a cheaper phone, they could afford it or not.
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.900]   Like a lot of my friends, kids,
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.540]   I mean, I live in a moderately okay town,
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.900]   but like 17 of her friends all have XRs now
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.580]   because they felt like that was the cheaper phone to buy.
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:13.500]   The parents got the X or XS,
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.180]   and then they got all their kids XRs
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.740]   because you could buy one, get one free or whatever.
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:20.660]   That's always the deal they have on that lower to your phone.
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.500]   - Well, it turns out that-- - So it turns out
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.380]   that it said this on stage,
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:25.740]   it was the best selling iPhone of the year.
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.740]   - Yeah, the XR was the best phone ever.
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:31.180]   - Yeah, it also had the best battery life of any iPhone.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.660]   And I think that was a signal, frankly, to Apple.
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.580]   I think Apple's response to that signal is good.
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:38.860]   We're gonna, our first thing we're gonna talk about on stage
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:42.020]   is our next generation 10R, which is the iPhone 11.
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.380]   And then we're gonna talk about this high end phone.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.380]   I think this is smart.
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:49.420]   I think Apple has found two different audiences.
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.620]   - I think the best part about getting to 11
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.700]   is I finally don't have to hear people
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.620]   call the 10R the XR.
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:57.460]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:58.380]   - Oh, man.
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.620]   - I wasn't gonna say anything.
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.060]   - Oh, it's 10.
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:02.980]   It's OS 10.
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:03.900]   It's not OS X.
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:05.180]   I'm glad it's Mac OS now.
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.940]   I'm slowly going away because us people who say Lego
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.140]   without the S, that stuff bothers us.
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:10.980]   - That's right.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.820]   - The DVD disc.
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:13.660]   - You're that guy.
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.260]   - I don't need the NFT.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.100]   - I'm not my fault.
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.220]   That's Brandon's fault.
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:18.060]   That's Apple's fault.
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.260]   - I got a point out though.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.980]   I have a Model 10 Tesla.
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:26.020]   And it's very confusing whether to call it the Model X
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.100]   or the Model 10.
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.580]   I've got a, every time I look at it,
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:32.060]   every one of us has a cognitive load
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:36.700]   from Apple's decision to represent the number 10 with an X.
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.020]   - Yeah, I got a number.
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.980]   - Apple, you owe me some cognitive cycles.
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.860]   We don't have Professor 10 as the leader of the 10 men.
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:44.700]   - That's right.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:45.540]   The 10 men.
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:46.380]   - It's the leader of the X men.
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.220]   - Right.
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.860]   - I have some high-speed skills.
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.180]   - Girlfriend still cost me up.
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.740]   Every once in a while I gotta tell her no.
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.180]   (laughing)
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.620]   - I had a high school kid call me on the radio show yesterday
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.700]   saying, "Would you please help me all of my friends
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:02.700]   in high school call it the iPhone XS or the iPhone XR?
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.340]   Would you please help me tell them it's 10?"
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.220]   And I said, "I don't,
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.580]   I understand."
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.460]   It looks like it's the iPhone X.
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.540]   - Not my fault.
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.660]   That's brand-new fault.
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:14.100]   Like I said, first thing I said
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.940]   was at least we got on these 11s and 12s.
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.500]   - Goodness they're using the good old-fashioned
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:19.900]   Arabic numerals.
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:20.740]   - Numbers.
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:21.740]   - We got the Arabs.
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:24.820]   The ARabs are in charge instead of the Romans.
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.260]   - I failed school 14 times.
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:27.340]   They can't expect me to know
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.180]   an X from a 10 to 10 from an X.
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:30.020]   (laughing)
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:30.860]   It's not my four text.
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.900]   - Since when do I have to figure out Roman numerals?
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:34.740]   - No.
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:36.700]   - I got one question for you Leo.
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:37.540]   - Yeah.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.420]   - Because I think I might have heard you
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.620]   when I was setting up the studio.
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.620]   What's wrong with Midnight Green?
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:44.460]   - It's ugly.
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:45.300]   - Midnight Green.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.180]   - Well, you know, you're not alone.
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:49.660]   In fact, when you go to Apple's website on the iPhone,
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:51.060]   what color does it show you?
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:51.900]   - It's the first.
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:52.740]   - They show you Midnight Green.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:53.580]   - Midnight Green.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.100]   - I'll tell you two things.
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:56.380]   - Yes.
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:59.660]   - Money, Midnight Green, and the Philadelphia Eagles.
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:00.660]   I'm definitely out of the league.
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:01.500]   (laughing)
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.060]   - The Eagles in color.
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.580]   - Micah Sargent says he's buying green.
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.780]   I just think a green phone is ugly.
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.220]   - No, but no, everybody doesn't love green.
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:14.020]   - Everybody loves green, but you, everybody.
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:14.860]   - Ah, you.
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.380]   - So it turns out in fashion, it's a color this year.
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.220]   - It is a year.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.460]   - The green and purple, yeah.
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.460]   Green and purple are still raining in fashion.
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.260]   So somebody in Apple's department knows that.
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.340]   - You know why I hate green 'cause I'm old,
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.980]   and I remember when avocado was the color
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.700]   of refrigerators of--
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.860]   - Oh, God.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:36.980]   - Avocado and burnt orange.
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.580]   And you know, everything comes around again.
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.300]   So that was the 70s.
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:45.580]   Here we are 40 years later, 30 years later, and it's back.
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:47.620]   - You just, we wouldn't like green.
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:49.620]   - I'm sorry, it's avocado, dude.
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.300]   - That's my refrigerator from the grocery house.
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.780]   - Exactly, that's why you want it.
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:54.860]   - I hate to.
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.180]   (laughing)
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.380]   - That was literally the entire kitchen.
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:59.540]   - No, no, that's good.
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:02.500]   - That is the dark olive green color
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:05.540]   I've got on the ammo cases that I've got back in the garage.
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:08.500]   - That is, it's a very, very forceful color.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.980]   It's not lightest.
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.780]   - At least Apple's breaking touch.
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.220]   - Your fridge was made between the 11 and the 11 Pro.
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.380]   At least they're breaking part of, now we have,
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:20.620]   we have it in gray, a slightly different shade of gray,
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.740]   gray, shiny gray, or gold.
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.860]   It's like, okay, thank you for giving us three colors
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:29.860]   in the depressing post-apocalyptic 1984 commercial.
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.900]   This is like, this is the company that is so terrified
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:35.500]   of color, it's like this, these laptops, these phones
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.100]   would not be out of place in the same micro-
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:38.940]   - I'm gonna show you.
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:39.780]   - That used to break your yelp.
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.020]   - I'm gonna show you Doc Rock's kitchen
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.260]   when he was 12 years old.
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.420]   - Oh, that's my grandma's kitchen.
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.860]   (laughing)
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.020]   - Oh, my mom.
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:49.860]   - Oh, Missy, mom.
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:50.700]   - You got it, you got it.
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:51.540]   - I don't know, we got it.
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.380]   - He's going crazy.
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.220]   - He's going crazy.
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.060]   - Everything, man.
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:57.140]   - A monoratorator range, the predate of my,
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.700]   microwave was a monorator range.
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:02.340]   - And they put wood, plastic wood tone on the radar range
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.420]   to make it look classy.
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:07.940]   And you're right, you've got those giant stick-on flower
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.820]   wallpaper, and of course she's wearing a burnt orange
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.500]   pantsuit, that is the '70s in a nutshell, right?
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.340]   - Okay, I'm gonna catch you.
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.260]   - How many eggs have you brought real quick?
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.260]   Do you remember those stickers in the bathtub
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.100]   so you didn't fall?
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:19.940]   - Yes, the flowers.
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:20.780]   (laughing)
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:23.060]   - Yeah, that's what they are.
[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:25.500]   Welcome to the '70s, my friends.
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:27.580]   - Can we talk about the other thing that we're not
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:28.420]   talking about?
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.740]   - What's that?
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:30.820]   - Let me hold on, let me add this one.
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:32.260]   - I'm gonna do the phone, I'm gonna do the phone,
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:33.900]   we're gonna take a break, then we'll do the other thing.
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:34.740]   - Okay, I'm talking about it.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.580]   - You're not talking about it.
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.900]   - I'm trying to keep it all, I'm trying to segment it.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.860]   Trying to give it order, 'cause otherwise--
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.420]   - They are taking us on a journey.
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:42.260]   - It's a journey.
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.100]   - We're supposed to enjoy the journey.
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.780]   - It's a process, but I am glad you mentioned green.
[00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.540]   That is an interesting choice.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.380]   They still have black, white, and gold, right?
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.940]   And green, is green for the American market?
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.660]   'Cause remember gold was really, we thought
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.460]   the Chinese market wanted gold.
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.460]   - I never thought about it until Andy mentioned the ammo can,
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.700]   but being an ex-army, I think that's another reason why--
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.540]   - It's an army green.
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.540]   - I've lived a long portion of my life
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:09.100]   staring at that color religiously every day.
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.340]   (laughing)
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.180]   - To me, that's right.
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.460]   - Because it's given much, much cachet, to be honest with you.
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:16.300]   It looks like you--
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.620]   - It just reminds me of a 76 gremlin.
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:19.460]   - Yeah.
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:20.300]   (laughing)
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.820]   - I don't know, it's the same color as Steve McQueen's
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:24.020]   Mustang in bullet.
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.700]   - Oh, is it really, was it that green?
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:26.540]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:30.700]   - My college roommate had a 1970 green,
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.220]   had that slope back Mustang.
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.060]   Yeah, that was the color.
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:36.060]   - My grandfather had an El Torino, El Camino.
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.380]   That's really a grand Torino that was that color.
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:42.420]   - So those are the decisions that you will have to make.
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:47.420]   And as we expected, the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:51.380]   will be available for pre-order on Friday.
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:54.620]   Although in new time, just a little, make a note of this,
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:58.140]   not midnight Pacific time, but 5 AM Pacific time.
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:59.900]   - What do you say, Doc Rock?
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.020]   You'll be, what will that be?
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.060]   That'll be midnight for you, that'll be fine, right?
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:05.780]   - 2 AM, it's 2 AM.
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:06.620]   - Oh, it's three hours.
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:09.860]   - I used to be nine, and I loved it when it was nine,
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:12.100]   'cause it's nine, I still got time to do it.
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.700]   You know, I got time to go on a Twitter
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.700]   and yell at everybody and say, I didn't get it,
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.340]   or I got bumped out or whatever.
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:18.180]   - 2 AM.
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.020]   - Like 2 AM.
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:19.860]   - I'm sorry.
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:20.860]   - Oh, goodness.
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:21.820]   - I gotta get it, but 5 AM.
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:25.220]   So it's really, it's Andy who's got the benefit of this,
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.380]   'cause it's eight in the morning for you, you'll be alright.
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:30.900]   - I need to, so I got about a week to do a GoFundMe.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.180]   (laughing)
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:34.340]   - Yeah, and Andy wakes up in the middle of it.
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.620]   - Forget about the sick people, give me a,
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.340]   give me a new new iPhone for free.
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.740]   - So that'll be, go ahead on.
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:42.500]   - I'm getting tweets from regular people.
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.620]   Hey, oh, Doc, I run at least two apps.
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.420]   All my serious, I got to know it eight, Twitter, Doc.
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.500]   - Can I just say something?
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:49.620]   Oh, Doc, Doc. - Oh, no.
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.780]   - Can I just say something, oh, Doc?
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:51.620]   - No.
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:55.220]   - I'm gonna say regular people don't use Twitter, period.
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:57.620]   - Who's on Twitter then, Lee, help us out?
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:59.460]   - A bunch of tech journalists.
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.300]   - You get off of it.
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:03.540]   - A bunch of celebrities, normal people don't even know
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.180]   what Twitter is, they use Facebook,
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:07.260]   they use Instagram, they use Twitter.
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.340]   What are you crazy?
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.700]   - Oh, man, you need to go on Black Twitter.
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:11.540]   You don't know what's going on.
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:12.780]   - Oh, I do love Black Twitter, I do.
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.100]   But that's just, I'm saying regular people out here, though.
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.460]   - That's a different kind of Twitter.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.540]   That is, you're right, there's something going on there.
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:22.300]   - Yeah, but I don't think Twitter is a mass appeal phenomenon.
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.940]   (laughing)
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.420]   - Do you be tweeting?
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:26.260]   Do you be tweeting?
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:28.420]   - Yeah, that entalkies, movie sounds.
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.220]   (laughing)
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.980]   People be tweeting, I like that.
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:33.140]   - Do you be tweeting?
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:34.140]   - People be tweeting.
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.820]   - Do you be tweeting?
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:38.780]   - So I take that not as a solid piece of evidence
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:42.740]   that people do multi-screens, just people who do Twitter.
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.420]   But I mean, someone's watching this show
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:45.620]   and they tweeted me about it.
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.700]   - Normal people don't watch this show either.
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.060]   - True, I'd give that.
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:50.980]   - Yeah, I'd give that.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.260]   - No, I mean, this is a show for the pros.
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.100]   - Hey Leo.
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.420]   - Hey, Carson Bondi, host, I mean, editor,
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:58.580]   I mean, what are you, what's your title?
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:02.060]   - Oh, what a normal person who wanted to buy
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.180]   a new iPhone do.
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.340]   - They would wake up at 5 a.m. on Friday.
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.980]   - They already had an iPhone.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.380]   - They can trade it in, is that where you're going with this?
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:14.060]   - No, we're going with Ed.
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.380]   - No, oh yeah, oh yeah, we are going with Ed.
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.460]   Thank you, Owen, JJ Stone,
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.300]   for always keeping the bottom line in mind.
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.580]   You do get a green iPhone, just for that.
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:24.940]   You get a green iPhone.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:25.780]   - Love you too.
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:27.460]   - Show me the money, he says.
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:30.860]   All right, if you have an iPhone and you're looking at this,
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.220]   or you have other devices, I bet you,
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:35.500]   anybody watching this show has the drawer, you know,
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:36.780]   they're kind of the gadget drawer
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.980]   where there's all sorts of junk, all sorts of old phones.
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.860]   You just throw them in there, all sorts of stuff.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.420]   You know, that's cash in that drawer.
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:46.500]   Cash money, if you go to Gazelle,
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:50.580]   the trusted online marketplace for selling used electronics.
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:53.220]   Time to thank those items for their service
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.420]   and sell them to Gazelle.
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.380]   You know, it's great.
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:59.140]   Go online, gazelle.com/twit.
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:01.060]   You can enter in all the things you have.
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.980]   They're buying iPhone 5 through 10S Max,
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.660]   they're buying Galaxy phones.
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.100]   Get all that stuff in there, they'll give you an offer.
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:12.100]   They'll either confirm the offer, and if you accept it,
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:14.140]   you can always say no, by the way.
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.940]   If they say, well, it's not as good a shape as you thought,
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:18.380]   or whatever, and they lower the offer,
[00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.340]   you could say no.
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:21.460]   Oftentimes, my experience has almost always been,
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.340]   they give us more money.
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.060]   And maybe we just underestimate the value of our stuff.
[00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:27.380]   But you then accept their offer.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:30.540]   They will quickly turn it around, they will send you a check.
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:33.100]   You can get a PayPal or an Amazon gift card,
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.460]   and they even bump the Amazon gift card a little bit.
[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.260]   So if you buy a lot of stuff on Amazon,
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.940]   that's definitely the best way to go.
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.700]   Shipping always free, payment always fast.
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:45.060]   All you gotta do is go online, answer a few simple questions
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.380]   about the condition, the carrier, you'll get an instant quote.
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:49.100]   The quote, by the way, good for 30 days.
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:50.060]   So you may say, well, wait a minute,
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:51.660]   I'm not gonna get that iPhone.
[00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:53.020]   Until the 20th, no problem.
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:55.500]   You got plenty of time to get the phone,
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.940]   take the data off it, put it on the new device,
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:59.420]   and then send it to Gazelle.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:01.820]   When Gazelle receives your item, if it's in better condition,
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:03.420]   they'll increase the original offer.
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:04.620]   If they need to lower the offer,
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:06.780]   you can have it returned at no risk.
[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:08.780]   You can always accept it in an I-&E quote.
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:10.860]   They even have custom trading options for businesses
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.620]   that 10 or more devices to sell.
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:14.900]   If you have a fleet of phones,
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.940]   then Gazelle's the place to go.
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:18.580]   Oh, and by the way, you might wonder what happens
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:21.100]   to the great stuff that Gazelle has bought.
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:24.420]   Well, if you're looking to buy a certified pre-owned device,
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.100]   you don't need the latest.
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.980]   Gazelle has an incredible selection of quality pre-owned devices
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:32.540]   at great prices, even the iPhone XS and XS Max.
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:36.460]   So don't let those old devices gather in the drawer,
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:40.180]   especially if you wanna get some money to buy a new phone,
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:42.300]   lock in the value of your existing devices,
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.300]   and get an extra $10 on your first trade
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:48.500]   into $50 or more at gazelle.com/twit.
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:52.860]   10 bucks extra at gazelle.com/twit.
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.140]   Go there right now to get started.
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.540]   We thank Gazelle so much.
[00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:56.580]   I love this time of year,
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:59.140]   'cause that's when the, I know it's Apple iPhone time,
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:01.340]   'cause the Gazelle, the Gazelle ads return.
[00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:03.820]   It's the return of the Gazelle ads in the fall.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:07.380]   Gazelle.com/twit to get started.
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.620]   In fact, we always make a big box in about two weeks.
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:13.460]   We're gonna have a big box to send back to Gazelle
[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:14.580]   as the new stuff comes in.
[00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:16.100]   Anything more to say about the iPhone,
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:17.740]   I'm excited about the camera.
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.060]   Apple has always owned video, right?
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:22.100]   I mean, you can talk about the Pixel 3,
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.740]   and I'm sure next month Google will have a lot to say
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:28.180]   about the Pixel 4, but Apple's always been the best in video.
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:29.740]   You agree, Doc Rock?
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:31.020]   - Absolutely.
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:32.780]   - Yeah, I could have it having used them all,
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:34.940]   just something that they spend a lot of time
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.700]   worrying about, and they do a good job.
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:41.380]   And real quick before I left, the quick take, I love it.
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:42.380]   I don't know if they stole that,
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.100]   I don't know if another phone already has it,
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:45.060]   but I love that idea.
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:46.900]   - That's 'cause you use Snapchat.
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:47.820]   (laughs)
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:48.900]   - I've been trying to use it, no,
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.380]   I've been trying to shoot a picture,
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.260]   and then in my niece, she can't keep still,
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:55.100]   she starts running and I'm gonna flip it into video mode,
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:56.580]   and then you don't miss those little things.
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:57.420]   - It's so annoying.
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:58.980]   - Yeah, but it doesn't, don't,
[00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:01.540]   doesn't every social app now do that?
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.700]   I mean, you press, you take a picture,
[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:05.460]   or you press it long and you get a video.
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:06.700]   - Hold it, yep. - Yeah,
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.220]   you just, what condition to do that?
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.100]   And yeah, that's Apple doing the right thing.
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.140]   Again, not-- - The video is the best.
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:14.980]   The factory I was given it to the Pixel,
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:17.180]   but the video they always are on point.
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:18.540]   - Well, and they're a little behind, right?
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:21.380]   They're playing catch up now with the Pixel,
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:24.700]   and to some degree, the Samsung and the Huawei's.
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:25.700]   They're playing a little catch up,
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.020]   they just now have night sight.
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.940]   And then next month, there's gonna be a new Pixel,
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:34.380]   the Pixel 4, and I presume Apple will get leapfrogged once again.
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:36.900]   - It'd be interesting to see what Apple,
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.820]   what Google does with the video.
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.100]   - Yeah, once again, because they don't have the burden
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:42.940]   of Pixel being a professional,
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.540]   thought of as a professional camera,
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:45.980]   they can do features like,
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:49.380]   "Hey, here's a picture of the very latest iPhone
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:53.340]   taking a picture at a dark pizza party room
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:54.820]   and having a kid's birthday,
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.020]   and here's a picture of our,
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.980]   here's our new camera doing that."
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.540]   So that's the sort of features that I hope that Apple,
[00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:02.740]   I would hope that Apple would continue to promote
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:04.060]   and also continue to develop.
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:06.020]   - The ones that say, "It's always about,
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:08.540]   here's a big white button, press the button
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:09.580]   and don't think about it,
[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:11.500]   and you will get a great picture every single time,
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.740]   every single situation."
[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:15.500]   That's how you win the camera game.
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:18.340]   - And they had to do that because Google nailed it
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:21.860]   in marketing for once by running that 3A,
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:25.260]   like, "Hey, here's a $500 phone taking pictures in the dark."
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:26.620]   On your other iPhone,
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.380]   like they killed it with that commercial
[00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:29.660]   and let regular people know,
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:30.500]   like, "Oh, what's that?
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:31.340]   What's night sight?"
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:33.260]   Like, I had a lot of people ask, like, "What is that?"
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.740]   So it, you know, glad they have it.
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:36.580]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:39.380]   You know, on my iPhone user, I'm stuck in the ecosystem.
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:40.740]   So I'm glad that I have it on that phone.
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.900]   I don't have to carry around my pixels much anymore,
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.660]   depending on how good it works, we'll see.
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.420]   - One thing Apple has always done
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:48.060]   that makes their video a little bit better
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:50.820]   is when you shoot in video,
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:54.140]   you're shooting in HDR in real time,
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:56.100]   and it's noticeably better,
[00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:57.700]   but you couldn't get it in the past,
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.660]   you couldn't get it at 4K 60 frames per second.
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:01.900]   I'm reading between the lines
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:03.860]   because they didn't mention it on stage,
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:06.820]   but this is in the copy on the webpage.
[00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:09.700]   Epic processing power means it can shoot 4K video
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:12.060]   with extended dynamic range
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.380]   and cinematic video stabilization,
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:16.380]   all at 60 frames per second.
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:19.540]   It sounds to me like they're saying,
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.620]   "Yes, we have enough processing power now to do it."
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:27.620]   OIS and HDR or XDR, as they call it,
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:31.420]   in at the highest frame rates at 4K.
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.620]   - And I also probably have to do
[00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:35.260]   with the high speed storage as well.
[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:36.100]   That's exciting.
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:38.860]   - Also, they also make a point of the color grading
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.340]   on device without having to take it into,
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:42.340]   I move here something like that.
[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:43.420]   That's interesting too.
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:46.060]   - Yeah, in fact, they've built in video editing
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.300]   into the camera app, which is mind-voggling.
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:50.700]   - I kind of like that.
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.460]   I use loomafusion a lot,
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.700]   but it's really hard to use loomafusion
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:57.020]   with sausage fingers,
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:00.420]   so I didn't have a lot of steak in wanting the pen,
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:01.900]   but I would have invited it.
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:05.380]   So normally what I end up doing with loomafusion is basics
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:08.220]   and then jumping to the iPad to do the finished editing.
[00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.980]   - That is one thing that some thought might come
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:14.380]   with a pro version of the iPhone is a stylus of some kind.
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.900]   Of course, the Note 10 has a stylus,
[00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:19.020]   and while I never use it,
[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:21.940]   there are a lot of people who really want that.
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.500]   - I'm with you on loomafusion on the phone.
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:24.500]   I tried it too.
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.500]   - It touched targets are small.
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.500]   - It's the quickest thing, yeah, but it's really small,
[00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:31.740]   but it's a great app, but it is really small.
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:34.420]   - I really love it in the black and white stuff too.
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.260]   - Yeah.
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:36.100]   - Really cool.
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:38.060]   - Because I do street photography
[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:41.740]   and the masters also, it has to be black and white.
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.900]   There have to be people in it.
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:47.820]   Like it has to be candid, not really street port picture.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:49.780]   And I think that is something dope
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.460]   about the really, really good black and white stuff.
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:54.220]   Again, these are the professional stuff.
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:56.380]   We have to compare it to what we get here
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:59.860]   with the gigantic bright close to the sun.
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.060]   Hawaii blown out guys.
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:05.340]   Like we have harsh lighting conditions.
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:06.780]   It's beautiful when you get it right,
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:07.700]   but when you don't get it right,
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:09.780]   I saw so many blown out pictures.
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.940]   Just go check out #HawaionIG
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:14.380]   and go my God people, learn the tap screen.
[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:16.300]   - Are you excited?
[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:17.140]   - I'm so excited.
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:19.300]   - They showed the high key,
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.620]   new the high key mono effect that they're gonna do here.
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:24.140]   This really I thought,
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:28.340]   I thought this is gonna be fantastic for street.
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.180]   Or portrait.
[00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:30.900]   - I got looks like G-Jarragon.
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:31.980]   - It's gonna be amazing.
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:34.980]   - How do you use the other features of that?
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:37.180]   Like do you use the blackout like ever?
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:39.060]   - No, the blackout doesn't work that well
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:41.420]   because there's trouble with hair,
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:44.020]   but I'm looking at the hair on this high key.
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.820]   - Oh, it works perfect for me.
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:46.660]   - Really?
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:48.420]   - I don't have any hair, look at that.
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:49.260]   Isn't it?
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:50.100]   - Oh, no.
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:51.940]   - I was gonna say the same thing.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:54.740]   It looks good for me, my daughter looks freaky.
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:55.580]   - Yeah, 'cause me,
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:56.940]   it always has a really cool.
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:58.180]   - Yeah, but they--
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:49:59.940]   - Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.500]   - Notably, in a lot of these images,
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.860]   they've got hair, you know, a little fine hair.
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:08.100]   And I loved the detailed image Phil Schiller showed
[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:10.660]   on stage of the close up and the eyelashes.
[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:12.940]   And I think the detail is really remarkable.
[00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:15.500]   It looks like they have put more effort into
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:20.260]   getting the bokeh effects.
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.180]   - Now let's talk about the most
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:22.900]   funny thing about this phone.
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.580]   As I've been yelling about this phone,
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:26.060]   you forgot to talk about the most important thing about this.
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:27.500]   - Oh, what is that?
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:29.540]   - Come on, the Slofy's brother.
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:30.540]   - Slofy's.
[00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:31.380]   - Slofy's.
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:32.220]   - Slofy's.
[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:33.060]   - Slofy's.
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:34.500]   - How do we feel about this now?
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:36.460]   This is a new hashtag Slofy.
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:38.420]   - That was the best commercial they've ever done.
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.180]   And again, you were talking about crying of emotion.
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:41.860]   I'm being a jerk, I feel understanding emotional
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:42.700]   heartstrings.
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:45.180]   And I do feel those things, I was just being a punk.
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:49.020]   But that Slofy mom with the glamour,
[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:50.420]   and then it pulls back to her key,
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:52.140]   'cause that's real life stuff to be like.
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:53.340]   - That was so funny.
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:55.780]   - The mom sent her son in the blow dryer,
[00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:56.620]   and then she just like,
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:58.020]   "No, you turned it up too high, too high,
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:00.420]   "that was really great."
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.180]   - That was really great.
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:04.500]   - I'm just not looking forward to my Instagram
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:05.860]   and seeing everybody posting,
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:08.340]   "Oh, I think I'm gonna either sneeze or throw up.
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.340]   "Either way, I'm gonna be snowing myself."
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:12.300]   He's like, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:14.580]   - Instagram live on boomerang
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:16.180]   are gonna be nothing but Slofy's.
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:17.260]   You're talking.
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.100]   - Yes.
[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:20.420]   - For those who don't know what a Slofy is,
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:22.900]   and I'm showing it on screen right now,
[00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:26.620]   the selfie cam can also do slow-mo now.
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:30.580]   So you can do those great beauty shots with your,
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:33.500]   which means, I mean, that's just gonna ruin Instagram
[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:35.020]   as if it weren't our own ruin.
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:37.540]   - Slofy's also are gonna ruin,
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:41.180]   I'm sorry to all the females who already get enough of the,
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:45.260]   let's what's a good word for it, the D-picks.
[00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:46.580]   They're gonna use Slofy's notes.
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:48.660]   - Slofy D-pick?
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:49.500]   Why?
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:50.340]   - Wait a minute.
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:53.020]   - I don't know why, but I don't understand.
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:53.860]   - People are gonna do it.
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:54.940]   - I don't understand.
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:55.980]   What's this?
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:59.180]   No eggplant picks in Slofy, guys.
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.500]   And the first NBA starting is busted for it.
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.300]   He's instantly kicked out the lead.
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:05.140]   (laughing)
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:07.900]   - Oh man, I didn't even know this was the thing.
[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:08.740]   Okay.
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.500]   - I'm just gonna have a different audio
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:11.820]   when I'm there for a second there.
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.380]   - I'm gonna take my headphones off
[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:16.020]   and just check my audio 'cause that's true.
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:17.700]   I got like this buzzing, I just, sorry.
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:19.580]   Hope I didn't miss anything.
[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:22.980]   - So I'll tell you that the first thing Apple announced
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:25.220]   on stage this morning was actually the thing
[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:26.860]   that got me so excited.
[00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:28.580]   The new frogger is here.
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:30.540]   (laughing)
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:34.100]   No, Arcade Plus, the rumors about Arcade Plus are true.
[00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:35.100]   - It's a new reasoner, right?
[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:39.140]   - $4.99 a month, it will be available September,
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:41.020]   what do they say, 29th?
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:41.860]   Don't 20th.
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:42.700]   - Yep, 20th.
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:46.020]   - Of course, when you pay that $5,
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:48.180]   it's for a family of up to six people
[00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:50.940]   and for every Apple device you have.
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:54.780]   I think this is gonna be good.
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.700]   - Yeah, $5, I think that they were,
[00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:00.220]   they had to stay away from the Netflix price.
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:01.860]   They had to make sure that's not,
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:02.980]   people are gonna change,
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:04.260]   people are gonna compare this to how much
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:06.020]   they're gonna be spending for Netflix.
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:07.420]   They're 10 or 12 bucks a month.
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:09.820]   So as long as they keep way, way under that,
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:12.260]   they can sort of make sure, make people forget
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.860]   that they are now asking to pay another $5 a month
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:16.020]   for the rest of their lives.
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:18.700]   But that $5 is, a lot of people could really justify,
[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:20.860]   okay, $5 for lots of cool games that are not
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:24.540]   probably going to offend or scar my children anyway.
[00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:27.900]   Okay, I'm all for not scarring or offending my children.
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.340]   - September 19th, let me correct that.
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:31.860]   The day before you get your new iPhone, Arcade Plus,
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:33.900]   you show my screen, we'll show up.
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:36.340]   And I actually was very impressed with the variety
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:39.260]   and quality of the indie stuff.
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:42.740]   I think that my sense of it was that companies like
[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:46.660]   Konami and Capcom who have many, many, many developers
[00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:52.620]   and who pretty much play in the high end AAA console arena
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:56.700]   are welcoming a chance to take some of these engines
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:54:00.620]   they have to take some developers and make a simpler game
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:03.300]   that might really draw some traffic.
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:04.620]   I mean, this is somewhere in between.
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:05.620]   - For a brand extension.
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:07.940]   - Yeah, have a couple of characters from Red Dead
[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:09.820]   Redemption do just like a shootout game.
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.500]   Oh no, sorry, wouldn't be a shootout game,
[00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:14.980]   would be a throw rocks at a tree game, but still.
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:16.980]   - Oh, there was a, there was a, some sort of.
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:21.100]   - Yeah, I think I will, there's no doubt in my mind
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:25.140]   I will get this and keep it because there's no in-app purchases.
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:28.220]   You can down and play, down on playoff line.
[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:31.340]   You can play on iPad to Mac, any device.
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:32.140]   It's cheap. - That's the treat.
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:35.500]   - Really, and some of the games, they showed three games,
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:37.180]   looked really good, I thought.
[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:38.020]   They looked really interesting.
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:39.860]   Frogger looked great.
[00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:42.500]   I will say that yes, I did like Frogger.
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.660]   - You know, if you know, Arcadia's gonna shine?
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:45.500]   - Where?
[00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:47.620]   - Arcadia's gonna shine because it's gonna allow
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:50.380]   what we used to call the back catalog, right?
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:53.020]   It's gonna allow the people that have like Frogger.
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:55.780]   Frogger's a perfect concept of the back catalog.
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:59.500]   It's the way to also bridge the gap between say,
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:01.860]   like somebody like myself who grew up on Frogger,
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:03.980]   then my niece was gonna be new to Frogger
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:05.900]   and I can kind of show her things.
[00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:08.420]   She'd be like, wait, how do you already know how to do this?
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:09.820]   - You're gonna look good.
[00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:12.260]   - When I was 10, this was the thing, you know?
[00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:14.220]   - Uncle Doc Rock going look good.
[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:15.060]   (laughs)
[00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:17.420]   - Yeah, the back catalog stuff is gonna be great,
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:21.300]   but it also allows guys, games that probably
[00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:25.220]   would have gotten shelved because they weren't at that level.
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:27.180]   You just throw to Arcadia, it's not hurting anybody.
[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:28.260]   You throw it up there. - Yep.
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:30.940]   That was smart.
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:33.620]   And then they solved the conundrum that we've been talking
[00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:36.780]   about for, well, at least since WWDC,
[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:38.940]   about what are you gonna do with Apple TV Plus?
[00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:42.460]   You only have a handful of titles that some of them
[00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:45.500]   could be hits, but in this very crowded space
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:48.900]   with Disney coming soon and all of the other
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:51.340]   subscription channels like Netflix and Hulu,
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:53.340]   can Apple carve a hole in there?
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:54.700]   Do they have enough back catalog?
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:55.700]   They have none.
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.020]   Do they have good enough shows?
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:00.460]   They have none, but they did the right thing.
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:04.780]   First of all, the pricing, which was stunning, $4.99 a month,
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:08.180]   already you're undercutting every other choice out there.
[00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:10.660]   And then they said the thing that I think,
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:12.700]   maybe you predicted it already. - Home run.
[00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:15.100]   - The home run was a year free
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:17.260]   when you purchase any Apple device.
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:20.300]   Apple TV, Apple, iPad, Apple phone.
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:21.460]   I don't know if the watch counts,
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:26.460]   but any screen device, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV.
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:28.500]   That's fantastic.
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:31.300]   That means basically for people like us,
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.900]   you know, it's gonna be free forever.
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:35.060]   Unless they change the price.
[00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:35.900]   - Yeah, you buy stuff, yeah.
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:36.740]   - Pretty much.
[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:37.580]   - Pretty much.
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:38.420]   - It's pretty much. - It's pretty much.
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:39.500]   - $2,000 every two years, yes.
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:40.340]   - Yeah.
[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:41.740]   - I mean, we're spending a lot more.
[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:43.260]   - It's all psychological.
[00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:44.180]   - Free.
[00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:45.020]   - But it's free.
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:48.460]   - I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:51.300]   they need to offer something that's 1599,
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:54.620]   just give me everything because I'm not paying for an arcade.
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:56.820]   Most of the games my daughter plays are free,
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:58.380]   Aqua Park, IO, all the,
[00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:00.660]   she put Minecraft's like the only thing that we pay for
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:02.900]   that like all of her friends are playing all together.
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:04.060]   They play Roblox.
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:07.860]   I'm not paying for 99 for some backyard games,
[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:10.300]   and then I'm not paying for 99 or getting it free.
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:11.140]   I'm not using your service.
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:12.820]   You don't have anything on Earth for me to look at.
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:14.340]   The music is where it's at.
[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:16.020]   I would like to have the magazines,
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:17.940]   but again, you're not gonna nickel and dime me down
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:20.540]   because I gotta get Disney, I gotta scam Netflix.
[00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:21.620]   - What would you pay?
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:22.460]   - I got a lot of stuff.
[00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:24.100]   - What would you pay for an Apple bundle that includes
[00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:29.100]   arcade, TV, news plus, and music?
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:31.500]   - To be regularly fair, honestly?
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:35.780]   Yeah, I was gonna say 1799, you know, with 1799.
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:37.900]   - Well, you're paying 1599 for music,
[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:38.980]   so you gotta have a little.
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:41.420]   - Well, I'm paying 999, and me and my daughter
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:43.500]   just use it off schedule because she's using it
[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:44.340]   and I'm using it to kick one of them off.
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:45.500]   - So you don't have the family?
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:46.540]   - So, I mean, no, no, no.
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:50.500]   Again, that's the thing about with subscription stuff.
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:53.860]   Like, at some point, you unbundled TV
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:55.140]   and stuff to say, well, there's money,
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:57.660]   and then there's no way you're saving money anymore.
[00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:58.500]   - Right.
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:01.340]   - Because you're paying $15, $7, $9,
[00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:04.100]   and Apple just on their own has come out
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:06.340]   and given you six different options.
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:07.180]   - Right.
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:08.540]   - That makes no sense to me from that.
[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:10.740]   - I would not be at all surprised to hear one price.
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:12.220]   I don't think it'll be 1799.
[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:13.380]   I think Doc Rock is right.
[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:14.780]   It's gonna be 20 bucks.
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:20.420]   - And they did family though on TV and games, right?
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:21.260]   - Yes, yes.
[00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:22.700]   - TV plus in games of--
[00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:23.540]   - Yes.
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:24.540]   - And then they got the family out of the gate,
[00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:25.740]   which is gorgeous.
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:27.780]   Now what they need to do is take music.
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:29.380]   You're not gonna lose that much money.
[00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:30.940]   Just go ahead and make it 999.
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.740]   There's also a family out the gate.
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:36.420]   And somewhere around the next announcement,
[00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:38.420]   the next announcement, give money to that,
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:40.940]   you have the whole party for 20 bucks.
[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:41.780]   - That's a good idea.
[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:43.380]   - Then everybody's cool.
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:45.900]   Because Spotify is kind of messing with them now
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:49.500]   because Spotify includes Hulu on the premium price.
[00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:50.340]   - Right, right.
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:52.020]   - You know, so prior to that,
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:55.420]   Spotify and Apple, it was a good fight, you know?
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:58.740]   I only kept Spotify premium because of the DJ app,
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:00.540]   you know, it allows me to play whatever I wanna play
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:01.940]   whenever I wanna play it, you know,
[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:04.180]   in what I'm doing, it makes it so it's not.
[00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:05.860]   But yeah, they have to do that.
[00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:08.220]   - Apple TV coming November 1st,
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:11.460]   you get a one year when you buy an iPhone,
[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:16.460]   an iPad, a Mac, an Apple TV, or an iPod Touch.
[00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:19.620]   So that's, okay, that's pretty good.
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:21.860]   I wish they would do that with our arcade as well.
[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:23.500]   That would be kind of cool.
[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:24.340]   - Yeah.
[00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:25.260]   - They're gonna do some bundles.
[00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:26.420]   - Spundles will come, I think.
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:29.220]   - Yeah, they gotta go 'cause this really is the,
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:31.540]   there's, I think they accept that there's no way
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:32.980]   they're gonna charge, they're gonna be able
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:37.060]   to get 10 bucks a month for four, five, six shows,
[00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:37.900]   not a whole one.
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:39.940]   And well, they should either one of these
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:42.260]   as good as they are, not everybody loved Game of Thrones
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:44.780]   as big as it was, not everybody loves the DC stuff
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:45.660]   as good as it is.
[00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:47.940]   So I'm wondering what happens a year from now
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:50.100]   when they now have, let's say they now have a kind of,
[00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:51.540]   something akin to a catalog,
[00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:53.820]   now that they've got the movies that they've been buying
[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:57.300]   at the festivals, now that they've got back inventory,
[00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:59.540]   the people can binge watch of these TV shows.
[00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:01.780]   Will it be $5 a month forever?
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:04.420]   Or are they ever going to say, guess what?
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:06.220]   We've listened to your requests
[01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:09.820]   and now you can get Apple Arcade and Apple TV plus
[01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:13.180]   bundled together for only $20 a month.
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.020]   Like, wait, huh?
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:16.180]   Wait, what, what, what if they put music in there?
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.260]   - It sounds good.
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.820]   If you put music in with that.
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:22.420]   And like I said, the Holy Trinity is all the things they offer.
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:24.380]   They offer things that people want,
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.380]   but I'm just not going to pay it.
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:28.860]   Like I said, if you had it for 20 bucks
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:33.540]   and I got magazines, my arcade, whatever, and my music,
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:35.220]   you got me, because they're TV, let's be honest.
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.940]   They're TV's always going to be third
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:38.100]   to fifth rate citizen.
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:40.540]   Like, as far as I'm concerned, their TV shows
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:42.820]   are never going to compare to everything else
[01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:44.100]   I have available to me.
[01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:47.140]   I mean, I can go subscribe to Epic for $5.99
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:50.260]   and watch "Twins" from 1984 and every old movie
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:51.780]   and TV show I want.
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:53.700]   So I don't really think that on that level
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.460]   for a long time they're going to be able to compete.
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:58.060]   But everything else they have is really good.
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:00.220]   - You know, the one unknown is if one of these shows
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:04.140]   becomes a hit, it becomes a game of thrones.
[01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:06.260]   - You're about to watch it for it to become a hit.
[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:07.100]   - Yeah, that's true.
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:09.260]   I think that's why, you know, they're giving you,
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.860]   they're giving you what, a seven day trial,
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:13.140]   that's not very much, is it?
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:14.580]   Hey, the other thing that's not clear,
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:16.860]   maybe you noticed something, I didn't notice.
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:19.540]   Are they going to do the HBO model where they release one
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:21.180]   a week or are they going to do the Netflix model
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:22.500]   where they release them all at once?
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.620]   'Cause I prefer the binge model, but I'm not sure
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:26.460]   how they're going to do it.
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:28.420]   - I don't think they said anything about it.
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:30.940]   The problem with the binge model is that if a show does
[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:33.100]   become a hit, you get people signing up for one month
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:33.940]   and just two hours.
[01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.740]   The entire series had them canceling a problem.
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:36.580]   - That's right.
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:37.980]   They probably can't do that because they don't have
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:39.860]   enough catalog to do that, you'd think.
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:41.820]   You'd think it'd be better for them to space out
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:43.860]   since they don't have that much content.
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:45.860]   If they just throw out everything, you know what I mean?
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:46.700]   - Yeah. - They just started
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:48.740]   to think of binge, like, okay, I've watched everything
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:50.100]   already, I'm done.
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:51.100]   - Yeah. - You know.
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:53.060]   - You gotta get people into the habit of hitting
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:54.460]   that app and just to see what's new.
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:56.340]   So yeah, that would be a smart thing.
[01:01:56.340 --> 01:02:00.580]   - Again, there's a lot of old content that's not out yet.
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:01.900]   They're still unstreamable.
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:05.500]   They need good curators to go get some of these things
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:08.940]   that are like, you know, sitting on the shelf and dust them
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.820]   off and be like, hey, what if we give you a little money
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:12.740]   to let us put this in our network?
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:14.460]   There's a lot of stuff that's not out.
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:16.380]   I mean, an absolute lie.
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:18.860]   - Where's the golden girls?
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:22.220]   - There is. - Yeah, where's old Batman?
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:23.460]   - There you go.
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:24.700]   Which old Batman?
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:25.940]   You mean Bruce Wayne?
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:27.740]   - The one from the '60s, Adam West?
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:28.820]   - Adam West. - Adam West.
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.420]   - Adam West.
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:31.620]   - I mean, that's what I grew up with.
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:34.060]   I would, again, yeah, because I think it'd be funny
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:38.780]   to see the disparity between special effects then and now.
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:40.700]   - Just watch the compilations on YouTube
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:43.460]   of them walking up the wall.
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.340]   - Yeah. - Oh, oh, oh.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:46.180]   - This is so funny.
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:47.020]   Yeah, fake wine.
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:48.180]   Sammy Davis Jr.
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.980]   - Oh, hi. - I'm worried about the computer.
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.980]   (both laughing)
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:52.820]   - Hello.
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:54.140]   - This is Kitty.
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:56.140]   (both laughing)
[01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:56.980]   - Hey, man.
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:57.860]   - Gilligan's Island.
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:59.620]   Gilligan's Island was filmed across the street.
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:00.780]   I'd watch that again.
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:05.260]   - See, the problem, I think that the reason why these are hard
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:08.060]   to find on streaming is because they're much better
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:11.180]   if you remember how you felt as a little kid,
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:13.860]   watch them as syndication in the '70s and '80s.
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:15.340]   If you were to watch them today, it's like,
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:16.980]   oh, wow, this really was garbage.
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:17.820]   Wow.
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:19.660]   - It's like one of the four channels
[01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:21.660]   that I should've been out there for a long day though.
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:24.540]   - So I wasn't surprised to see arcade and TV.
[01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:27.260]   I was a little surprised to see the iPad,
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:30.340]   but it was only one model.
[01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:33.940]   Now we know from various databases in Europe
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:37.460]   and the Middle East that there are at least two
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:39.900]   or three models in the works.
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:43.140]   So I think it's pretty clear there is another shoot a drop.
[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:46.940]   There'll be another, I would expect another Apple event
[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:50.340]   coming in October that will do an iPad Pro,
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:54.100]   maybe a Mac Pro, maybe that new 16-inch MacBook Pro.
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:56.300]   So all they announced here was the entry level,
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.940]   the replacement for the $329 iPad,
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:03.340]   a little bit bigger, 10.2-inch screen instead of 9.7,
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:06.620]   half an inch bigger, it ships September 30th,
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:10.700]   $329 for the base model, $299 if your education.
[01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:13.220]   It does support the original Apple Pencil,
[01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:15.180]   still has big vessels. - And the smart record.
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:16.900]   - And the smart, actually the smart connector
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:18.900]   is a big deal 'cause you can use a keyboard with that.
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:21.300]   So this is a good student device.
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:23.340]   - I still think this is one of the greatest products
[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:24.820]   that Apple has in the product line.
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:27.100]   The idea of having a tablet that is this good
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:30.060]   for $329, even non-education,
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:33.340]   where it has a remarkably good stylus,
[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:35.060]   a processor, it's the A10 processor,
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:39.500]   which means that it really can compete with anything
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.180]   in the Windows space or Chromebook space
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:45.260]   that's going for anything less than $600 or $700.
[01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:47.380]   You still have to deal with the concept
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:48.700]   that you don't have a trackpad,
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:50.980]   you don't have a keyboard, you have to add those things.
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:53.740]   But in terms of having a, for $329,
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:56.340]   that's a hell of a lot of protein you get
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:57.660]   for not a hell of a lot of money.
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:00.380]   So I'm glad to see that Apple's continuing to invest
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:03.420]   in making this product as good as they can possibly can.
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:07.220]   And again, as someone who has always been one of the first
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:09.980]   to throw to be the Debbie Downer about,
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:13.140]   yeah, but Apple's policy is still go be poor
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:14.100]   someplace else.
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.940]   It's great to see Apple at least acknowledging
[01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:19.220]   that to be a really great company,
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:21.260]   they have to be able to create products
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:22.380]   for just about everybody.
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:23.780]   They're not gonna always be there.
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.300]   The people with their deep pockets
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:26.220]   are not always gonna be there.
[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:28.100]   They have to be able to branch out,
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:30.940]   to sell to all kinds of customers all over the world.
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:35.940]   And a $329 tablet of this quality is definitely up there.
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:39.340]   - Here, here, and the price didn't go down.
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:42.460]   - Yeah, the mini price is still $399, right?
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:47.260]   This is the, the 3.29 is a 32 gig model.
[01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:49.820]   Same processor though, they didn't upgrade the processor.
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:52.060]   It's still, it's the A10.
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:52.900]   - It's it.
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:58.460]   - They didn't bring it up in this, but is the Photoshop
[01:05:58.460 --> 01:05:59.780]   out for the iPad Pro yet?
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:02.300]   - Yeah, not yet, not yet, not yet.
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:04.860]   - Is Minecraft VR out yet?
[01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:07.220]   I mean, like, there's a bit of telling me all this cool stuff
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:10.100]   and then like, it's coming at Christmas time or whatever.
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.380]   And then we forget about it.
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:15.220]   Like I said, that basketball shooting app from the phone,
[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:16.060]   what happened to that company?
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:16.900]   Did they fold?
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:17.740]   Did they run out of money?
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.460]   Like, what happened to that app that they show us
[01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:21.540]   such cool stuff?
[01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:22.380]   - That's...
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:23.220]   - And then how many things would that happen?
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:24.060]   - That's not how the app goes in, though.
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:25.140]   - That they had.
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:27.340]   - Oh, I guess that's why I said that that company fold,
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:28.900]   did they go and money like?
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:31.780]   - Yeah, so you just left the show?
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:34.620]   - Yeah, that's the best part about putting it in.
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:37.340]   They got snowballed by whoever said that they were gonna
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:38.940]   have it ready at X-time.
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:42.940]   And I use Adobe all day every day
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:47.100]   and I'm gonna put a small gamble out
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:49.740]   that in the late October event
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:52.860]   when the iPad Pros get refreshed,
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:55.500]   we'll see Photoshop then.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:58.380]   But we also see, you know, the Pro-ish type stuff.
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:01.780]   - Yeah, you wouldn't show it with this device.
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:03.380]   - Well, yeah, no, I'm just saying in general.
[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:04.220]   - I'm just saying in general,
[01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.060]   the things they say.
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:08.220]   - Yeah, and we still got that probably September 29th
[01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:09.220]   because that's when scheduled
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:11.140]   with all other macOS releases.
[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:12.860]   We'll get, you know, Catalina.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:14.580]   So they'll talk about that then.
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:15.820]   But I do have to agree.
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:19.180]   I feel bad for them if they put their efforts
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:20.700]   in a belief in this company who says
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.860]   they're gonna have it ready and they don't have it ready.
[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:24.380]   I don't know if you guys remember
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:28.220]   when we were trying to build glass in Arizona
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:30.580]   and Apple put money into,
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:32.540]   I forget the name of the company now,
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:34.860]   but the company was basically--
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:35.860]   - The Sapphire's.
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:37.460]   - The Sapphire's company, yeah.
[01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:40.980]   - Sapphire glass and Apple got ganked.
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:43.060]   And so it's very possible they got ganked
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:45.580]   with the basketball AR and all these other stuffs
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:48.100]   because unfortunately that part's out of their hands,
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:51.260]   but it does people will hold them to that.
[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:54.700]   So I wish they would at least up data maybe,
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:56.060]   but I think they're just like,
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:58.260]   oh, we're better not even bringing it up.
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:07:59.820]   - It's like when they talk about the machine learning.
[01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:00.740]   - You did something wrong in a house.
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:01.580]   - Yeah.
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:02.580]   - And the machine learning on the device,
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.020]   I just wanna know where we're actually gonna use it at.
[01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:07.660]   I understand it where it's stronger, better, faster,
[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:09.900]   but I'm like, what could I do with it?
[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:11.220]   I mean, if apparently--
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.300]   - And that's like, what am I gonna be doing with it?
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:14.460]   - Yeah.
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:15.980]   I think that they already,
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:17.580]   it's not something where there's a feature
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:18.700]   you switch on or switch off.
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:21.340]   It really is where a certain app is enhanced
[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:24.460]   in such a huge way that you can't really do it
[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:26.700]   without some sort of machine learning.
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:29.740]   I think really the most impressive machine learning app
[01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:31.060]   that Apple's been associated with
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:32.900]   is simply the camera app.
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:34.460]   Most of what they're talking about,
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:36.380]   because they're talking about how they are optimized
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:37.980]   to CPU for all this sort of stuff,
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:38.820]   the way that they're saying.
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:42.860]   Now with this new magical mode that we're experimenting with
[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:44.140]   and we don't know when we're gonna release it,
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:45.740]   but here's a demo of a guy
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:50.300]   and a kind of a cable net sweater show how well it works.
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.180]   We're doing pixel by pixel by pixel,
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:53.780]   trying to figure out what should be a texture,
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:55.740]   what should be skin tone, what should be this,
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:57.660]   what should be that.
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:02.660]   So it's always, that secret sauce is that extra
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:06.220]   like cup full of MSG that someone throws into the bat
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:07.300]   that makes it taste better,
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:10.940]   but they don't put MSG as part of the ingredients.
[01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:15.940]   - So checking the Apple press release about Apple TV plus,
[01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:20.260]   most shows will launch with three episodes.
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:22.580]   Some will launch with all episodes.
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:26.780]   So it's gonna be a mix of that.
[01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:28.540]   And that's again, November 1st.
[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:29.820]   - Ever said, "Queen."
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:30.660]   - Yeah.
[01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:34.540]   ♪ Now we share in the same dream ♪
[01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:36.340]   - You know why three is better than one?
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:38.780]   'Cause three is just enough to get you hooked.
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:39.620]   - That's right.
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:40.460]   - To a half way.
[01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:41.300]   - That's right.
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:44.020]   - If you just watch one, you're not necessarily invested,
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:46.740]   you can go back to your regularly scheduled programming,
[01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:48.860]   but if you have three and now you're in,
[01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:51.300]   it's like, oh, what is Jennifer Aniston gonna say now?
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:52.140]   - Oh, you know.
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:53.260]   - It's enough to hook you.
[01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:55.540]   At launch, most Apple TV plus series will premiere
[01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:58.500]   with three episodes with one new episode each week,
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:01.620]   while full seasons of some series will be available
[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:02.460]   all at once.
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:04.940]   So that's the official word from Apple.
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:07.340]   - You know, I was gonna ditch after three,
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:09.820]   but it's implied that we're gonna see you Steve Carell's
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:11.220]   nude butt in episode four.
[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:12.820]   - I'm staying bad for you.
[01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:15.460]   - I'm sorry, but speaking of Steve Carell,
[01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:19.020]   Indian Steve Carell, man, that was so awesome.
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:21.580]   - I just made me laugh when he came on the stage,
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:22.900]   that guy is three.
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:24.100]   He looked like Steve Carell.
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:26.340]   - I didn't even notice the chip guy.
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:28.100]   - Oh my God, it was super funny.
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:29.660]   I was saying to myself, hey,
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:31.980]   Indian Steve Carell's need a drink of water.
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:33.780]   - He did, he needed a clear service.
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:34.980]   - Yeah, he was nervous.
[01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:36.620]   - He was a little nervous.
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:38.980]   - One thing I will say about Apple TV that has me excited
[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:42.540]   is I know Jason, because everybody who I know is each other
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:43.940]   and just a joke.
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:48.060]   But it's just cool to see somebody that I've known
[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:51.580]   for a while get bigger and bigger on the world stage.
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:54.220]   And so two of the top stars right now
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:56.580]   in the entire planet are from Hawaii.
[01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:58.140]   And that's Dwayne.
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:58.980]   - Dwayne Johnson.
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:10:59.820]   - Dwayne and Jason.
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:00.660]   - And Jason.
[01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:02.260]   - When I was growing up, we just had Althea,
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:03.940]   AKA Tier Career.
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:05.340]   She's still Althea to me.
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:09.140]   - So how do you run into Jason Momoa?
[01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.740]   Is he just like hanging out at the beach or what?
[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:13.260]   - He always goes to the beach.
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.540]   He cruises around.
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:16.220]   He makes these videos on YouTube.
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:19.380]   Him and his friends make these little clowny videos on YouTube.
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.060]   He's still a relatively normal guy.
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:22.780]   He hasn't gotten cocky.
[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:24.300]   And back when I used to go to the gym,
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.140]   we always run into Dwayne at the gym.
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:27.500]   - Nice.
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:30.100]   I wouldn't want to work out next to Dwayne Johnson or Jason
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:31.220]   Momoa. - Yeah, that's.
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:32.660]   (laughing)
[01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:33.500]   - Yeah.
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.860]   - I'm not fit to lift their barbell.
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:37.700]   - Yeah.
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:38.860]   I was like, hey, can you put some more plates on there,
[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:39.700]   buddy?
[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:40.540]   I like to cycle in.
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:42.820]   (laughing)
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:43.740]   - That's a good one.
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:44.580]   That's a good line.
[01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:46.180]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:47.700]   My girlfriend is on the line.
[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:48.740]   I gotta go.
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:51.500]   iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 a pro will be available
[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:55.100]   SIM-free and unlocked on day one.
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:57.140]   It's from nine to five Mac.
[01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:58.580]   That's really good.
[01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:01.900]   Sometimes the unlocked phones come later
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:03.620]   and almost always you get a carrier.
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:06.380]   You have to choose a carrier and get a SIM in that.
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:09.420]   So nearly all iPhone models sold on Apple.com
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:12.660]   and at the App Store are unlocked.
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:13.940]   At the Apple Store are unlocked.
[01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:16.020]   They're not tied to a carrier.
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:18.180]   - That's a big change.
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:19.540]   Yeah, of course.
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:20.380]   - Yeah.
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:22.620]   - But the good part is now you got the card, right?
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:25.300]   So with the card, you don't really have to do the AT&T
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:26.460]   next and all that stuff
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:28.820]   because you can control your interest better.
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:29.940]   - Right.
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:31.500]   Right.
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:36.500]   iOS 13.1 will come out September 30th.
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:39.340]   I was thinking we'd have come out with a new phone
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:41.220]   but apparently it's a little bit delayed.
[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:43.660]   iPad OS will also come out.
[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:46.220]   September 30th.
[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:49.980]   So 13.0 will drop with the new phone.
[01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:51.660]   So that's a little confusing.
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:55.980]   We've had a public beta 13.1 for a while.
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:56.820]   - Right.
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:58.500]   1241 just came out today.
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:00.220]   - 1241, okay.
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:03.580]   - So 13.0 on the 19th but 13.1 on the 30th.
[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:05.180]   - Right.
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:07.020]   I guess no reason to wait.
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:08.740]   You can do the upgrades.
[01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:09.860]   - Yeah.
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:11.860]   - A couple of weeks later, do the next one.
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:15.380]   All right, let's see anything else.
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:16.820]   Well, let's take a break and come back
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:17.940]   and we should talk watch
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:22.420]   because I think maybe the biggest Apple Watch announcement
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:25.700]   ever, at least a feature that almost everybody knew
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:27.980]   they wanted an Apple finally.
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:29.140]   Yep, gave us.
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:31.460]   But first a word from Epson.
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:33.900]   I love my Epson Eco Tank printers.
[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:37.620]   Got two at home because I for one, hate it
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:38.940]   when you're in the middle of a print job
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:40.140]   and the ink cartridge runs out
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:41.220]   and you gotta go to the store
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:43.140]   and everything's held up
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:45.300]   with the Epson Eco Tank printers.
[01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:47.180]   They come with a ridiculous amount of ink,
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:49.140]   enough to print thousands of pages,
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.780]   up to two years of ink in the box.
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:53.420]   And then when you go back to the store
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:56.580]   to get more ink in 2021,
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:58.220]   you get two more years of ink
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:00.420]   which with each replacement bottle set,
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:04.100]   which means I'm not gonna be back till 2023.
[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:05.980]   Super sized, easy to fill ink tanks
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:07.220]   mean fewer trips to the store,
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:08.820]   less frustration to you,
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:11.500]   uniquely keyed auto stop ink bottles
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.580]   mean you can't do it wrong,
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:15.420]   never spill a drop.
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:18.220]   This is stress free.
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:21.900]   That's why they say just fill and chill.
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:23.900]   Eco Tank is changing the way people print
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:26.420]   and I really have to tip my app to Epson because
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:27.740]   they said, you know what?
[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:28.540]   There is a better way.
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:29.780]   We're gonna do this for our customers.
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:31.900]   Get the compact Eco Tank printer.
[01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:34.580]   It's a wireless color all in one super tank printer
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:35.540]   for your home or office
[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:38.940]   than you can like Shaq just fill and chill.

[01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:05.500]   I'm sorry Doc Rock within the 48 contiguous states.
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.740]   Exclusions apply subject to availability.
[01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:11.340]   Epson EPSON.com/ecotankleo.
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.780]   Eco tank printers.
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:14.060]   Just fill and chill.
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:16.020]   Epson exceed your vision.
[01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.380]   You can still buy it in Hawaii.
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:20.060]   You just don't get that free overnight shipping.
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:21.220]   You're probably used to that right?
[01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:22.300]   That happens a lot.
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:23.500]   Oh, all the time.
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.500]   I get people to say we don't ship international
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.220]   and I have to ask them to start.
[01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:28.500]   What country do you think of it?
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:29.340]   How many stars?
[01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:30.500]   I say how many stars in the flag?
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:31.140]   They go 50.
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:32.700]   Why? I go we're number 50 dummy.
[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:35.060]   Put it in the UPS box or USPS box.
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:36.860]   It's the same price.
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:37.700]   Send it to me.
[01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:40.340]   Yeah. Well, Hawaii, you're not even American.
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:41.580]   Like wait what?
[01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:42.340]   What?
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:43.420]   Whoo.
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:48.340]   So Apple Watch Series 5.
[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:52.740]   And I almost thought, you know, we just got the Series 4 last year.
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:54.380]   Do we really need a Series 5?
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:59.420]   But there is a critical new feature that to me makes all the difference.
[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:01.420]   I never thought they'd do it.
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:03.900]   Always on display.
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:07.380]   Hallelujah.
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:09.300]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:13.340]   So they're saying that I was wondering if they were going to wait until like a new
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:15.620]   display technology came along.
[01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:18.780]   But they are using a new type of display.
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:23.780]   So they're calling it an LTPO display, which means that they can do kind of like what they
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:24.780]   were doing on the phones.
[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:27.180]   They were they can refresh the screen dynamically.
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:32.980]   So instead of at 60 Hertz, they can do it at like one one frame per cycle, like one Hertz,
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:33.980]   one cycle.
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:41.220]   So that it's actually only like repainting the screen like every basically almost never.
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:46.060]   And they also said that new display driver, new ambient light sensor to also cut things
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:47.420]   down on that sort of.
[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:48.980]   But yeah, that's exactly the sort of thing.
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:53.820]   I'm also glad that they they admitted one of the big reasons why people want that, which
[01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:58.420]   is the ability to just simply sort of side your risk when you're in a conversation with
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:01.620]   somebody and you don't want them to see that you're talking about.
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:03.500]   But you definitely are checking the time.
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:04.500]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:11.100]   So I want to read more about how they've implemented it because they said that they've said at
[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:16.980]   the actual release that it's it will support the time and any complications that are on
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:17.980]   the screen.
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:22.300]   But they also mentioned that certain other apps like the fitness app can also be are
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:24.380]   optimized for the always on display.
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:28.620]   So when you're doing workouts, you can actually the always on display will be on the workouts
[01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:29.620]   app.
[01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:30.620]   So the implication of that.
[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:34.460]   You could see your heart rate is I have to always, you know, I'm working out.
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:38.940]   I always have to raise my watch and then nothing happens and I have to tap it.
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:40.620]   That's a really great thing.
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:44.900]   This is actually a patent pending for Apple.
[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:49.140]   Apple has the LPTO or LTPO patent.
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:51.460]   So don't expect this elsewhere.
[01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:56.580]   Although Apple is not the first smart watch to have an always on display.
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:57.580]   But it's good.
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:59.420]   It's not going to sound like it's not going to impact battery life.
[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:00.420]   They said the same.
[01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:01.420]   Same.
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:04.300]   Battery life all day, but they now gave all day a number, which I was pleased to see
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:06.220]   is 18 hours.
[01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:08.140]   Yeah, that's all.
[01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:13.140]   So astronomer friends are going to have to figure out what planet is a day last 18 hours.
[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:15.180]   Yeah, but I'll give it to them all day.
[01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:19.860]   Well, you got to sleep sometime and speaking of sleep, six hours a day, speaking of sleep,
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:21.780]   you won't be wearing your watch to bed just yet.
[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:24.540]   The rumored sleep tracking app did not emerge.
[01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:27.500]   Which means the apps that are already in the app store?
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:30.900]   Well, they're third party apps, but there was a strong rumor that Apple was going to
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:31.900]   do it themselves.
[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:32.900]   I know.
[01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:36.460]   Do you use sleep tracking on your Apple watch?
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:40.700]   I used to when I use it on a generation one, I use it on a generation two.
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:45.340]   And now I really, I don't use them anymore because I'm sleeping like a rock before when
[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:46.340]   I wasn't sleeping very well.
[01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:52.180]   I cared about it, but I find that it didn't really, I have sleep tracking on a variety
[01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:55.100]   of devices, rings, watches.
[01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:56.980]   There's paddles under my pillow.
[01:18:56.980 --> 01:19:00.460]   And all it does is tell me I should be tired today.
[01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:02.780]   And I don't, I don't need that in front of you.
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.580]   I don't want to hear that.
[01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:09.140]   I just got a new beauty rest and it came with the tracker.
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:10.140]   That's what I have.
[01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:11.140]   I love that.
[01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:13.660]   I love that because I don't have to do it.
[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:17.140]   My phone and my watch are worried about, you know, whether it's not getting a proper
[01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:18.300]   charge or whatever.
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:20.780]   And Leo's right.
[01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:24.220]   They basically emailed me every morning was like donkey, you need more sleep, you got
[01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:25.220]   to be tired.
[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:26.220]   Oh my God.
[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:28.820]   Because you got up, you got up to P twice.
[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:34.660]   Yeah, I just found out I didn't look, I only got 49 out of 100 last night.
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:36.140]   I should be exhausted.
[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:39.620]   Because you're waiting to see me today.
[01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:40.620]   I couldn't wait.
[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:41.620]   I was so excited.
[01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:49.900]   I don't know if this quality always on is good enough to make people around by this,
[01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:50.900]   though.
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:53.900]   No, but it's for will for me.
[01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:59.940]   And the fact that I can now spend hundreds of dollars more on a titanium or thousands
[01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:02.300]   of dollars more on a ceramic.
[01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:04.460]   That's fantastic news.
[01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:05.460]   I know.
[01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:11.060]   The one thing about the way that they put things out there and okay, the always on loan
[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:16.260]   wouldn't make me run out to buy a new watch, but the my original red dot is now two years
[01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.540]   old and now I'm ready to buy.
[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:19.540]   You're different.
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:20.940]   Yeah, you need a red ring.
[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:22.500]   You're two years out.
[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:25.620]   I get any kind of upgrade once you're two generations out.
[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.980]   I'm talking about like, I have the four.
[01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:35.220]   There's no one reason for me to go get the five that weirdly they did last year.
[01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:38.700]   Weirdly they discontinued the four, but they still sell the three.
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.700]   The three, which is the other.
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:41.700]   That's the other.
[01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:43.700]   No, the great announcement.
[01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:48.060]   The fact that they've got the four, you would need the five.
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:50.660]   That's why they've got the.
[01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:54.580]   The fact they've got the three and now the price of the three is 199 bucks is one of
[01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:59.420]   the best announcements of Apple Watch in that saying that their whole day because I've
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:02.460]   always sort of thought that it's sort of a disconnect.
[01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:06.420]   But Apple is saying that look at all the people whose lives we're saving and all the
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:12.220]   people who's getting healthier and the woman who knew to go in immediately for a C section
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:15.980]   and the guy who knew immediately that he should go in for the stroke, but we're not willing
[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:19.460]   to do the for anybody who doesn't have at least 500 dollars to spend on watch.
[01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:24.940]   But the idea that they can get these features, these benefits to people who again are not
[01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:28.700]   necessarily in the market for a premium watch or premium smart watch is great.
[01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:33.740]   I can't wait for them to finally decide that perhaps the perhaps people who use Android
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:35.580]   phones are worth living.
[01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:37.660]   They're worth saving those lives too.
[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:41.860]   Maybe it's not market marketing to save the lives of people who don't own iPhones, but perhaps
[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:44.500]   there is there is a justification for doing that.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:48.660]   But I again, kudos to Apple for keeping the prices low.
[01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:52.300]   It's also optical illusion because the lifesaving watch is the four.
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:54.940]   That's the one with the lifesaving watch.
[01:21:54.940 --> 01:22:00.220]   The three's not really saving your life like well, it's only a hundred and ninety dollars
[01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:02.180]   saving anybody's life worth going.
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:03.180]   Come on.
[01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:04.700]   Don't be such a cheap skate.
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:08.540]   Hey, I need to have a compass and always on.
[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:13.900]   I'm going to drop this watch that I've had for nine months at 500 dollars ago by a new
[01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:14.900]   one.
[01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:15.900]   Okay.
[01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:21.260]   You're not going to be I don't have many friends who can buy like a brand new phone every single
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:23.020]   year or would buy a brand.
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:27.980]   But for people who have a series two or a series three almost bought the series four,
[01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:29.940]   this will be definitely series five.
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:31.900]   I think there's also a reasonable case to be made.
[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:35.220]   There's people who haven't bought the Apple watch yet because it didn't have an always
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:36.220]   on display.
[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:38.700]   I don't think there's anybody waiting for a compass, but they're there.
[01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:41.620]   It's conceivable that this is in every little nudge.
[01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:45.420]   I think Apple's really shown that they're going to make this better every year.
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:49.540]   Maybe not life changing better, but better every year and every little nudge gets more
[01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:50.540]   people in the market.
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:52.540]   It's already the best selling smartwatch.
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:56.980]   Yeah, I think the one that is right into the market that 199 is going to be killer.
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:58.220]   That's key price.
[01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:03.380]   I like the new Apple design studio too in the store and online.
[01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:06.020]   You can choose the size you want.
[01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:08.300]   You could choose the case you want.
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:12.780]   And then once you've picked that, you can choose the band you want.
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:14.780]   What's the most expensive watch?
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:16.780]   Should I build the most expensive watch?
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:18.660]   I know it's ceramic.
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:21.980]   It's the one I'm going to get on.
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:25.460]   Of course, it's the beautiful sport.
[01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:28.060]   Well, now let's not get it with a sport loop.
[01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:30.260]   If you're going to spend $1,299 on a watch.
[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.500]   I need to add a mess.
[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:36.660]   You know, I really like, I think the most expensive one is that link band, isn't it?
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:37.820]   That's a ridiculous band.
[01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:40.300]   No, stainless steel bracelet, wouldn't it be?
[01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:43.100]   Yeah, that's what we call the stainless steel bracelet.
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:44.100]   Yeah.
[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:46.420]   That's a great pop band.
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:47.420]   You need that band.
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:48.420]   That's all right.
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:49.420]   That's for me, baby.
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:50.420]   $15.99.
[01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:52.500]   That's that Casio band right there, brother.
[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:53.500]   I know.
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:56.060]   Isn't it funny that this band costs hundreds of dollars?
[01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:57.060]   Yeah.
[01:23:57.060 --> 01:23:59.260]   Oh, $16.99 with Space Black.
[01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:07.700]   When it was the Chanel ceramic G-Shock, there were about two grand for the basic one and
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:10.860]   five grand if you got it with the ceramic band.
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:15.140]   So they're in the right ballpark for that level of person who's buying that type of
[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:16.140]   thing.
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:17.140]   I just, yeah.
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:21.900]   I mean, honestly, $1,000 for a watch for a lot of people is a deal.
[01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:24.660]   Well, I don't even yell about that because I have my Vida watches.
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:25.900]   I have expensive watches.
[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:27.980]   If you want to spend the money, go ahead and spend the money.
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.460]   I just meant from upgrading.
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:32.980]   Like if you got the three to five, I get it four to five, not so much.
[01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:33.980]   That's a lot.
[01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:35.460]   That's a low $1,500 on a watch.
[01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:37.500]   Hey, that's your iPhone XR.
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.900]   There wouldn't be a lot to say get the 11.
[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:42.020]   No, not at all.
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:47.740]   And I think they're starting to realize that before it was, well, my excuse was always,
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:51.460]   you know, as a quote unquote tick writer, I had to always buy the new one.
[01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:53.260]   That's my excuse too.
[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:55.540]   I decided to skip it.
[01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:57.180]   And it didn't bother me.
[01:24:57.180 --> 01:25:02.660]   And now, you know, the tenor made me think, oh, maybe I should.
[01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:04.260]   It's not that expensive blah, blah, blah.
[01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:05.420]   But then I'm glad I kept it.
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:07.980]   I bought another lens for the camera camera.
[01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:08.980]   Hey, guys.
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:13.340]   At this point in time, I think, I think every two years, and we can stick to the every two
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:15.340]   years and everyone's comfortable with it.
[01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:22.540]   And you don't feel so much foma than, yeah, but the suck thing next year is probably going
[01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:26.940]   to be a guarantee by whatever the new form factor is going to cause you to want to jump
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:27.940]   back in.
[01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:32.340]   So you have to eat it like once every four years.
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:34.180]   Titanium, what is there?
[01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:38.700]   So you have aluminum, you have stainless steel, you have titanium and you have ceramic.
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:39.940]   Ceramic is an outlier.
[01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:43.900]   It's the most expensive and it's white, which is a little weird.
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:46.100]   Is the glass different on those higher end models?
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:51.300]   I think they have sapphire versus gorilla glass.
[01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:53.580]   What would be the case for buying titanium?
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:55.820]   Is it just looks or is it somehow better?
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:57.820]   It's lighter.
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:58.820]   It's lighter.
[01:25:58.820 --> 01:25:59.820]   Yeah.
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:00.820]   Although aluminum has to be pretty light.
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:02.820]   That's what I have right now is aluminum.
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:05.580]   I wonder about the durability of titanium.
[01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:10.980]   They're saying if they're saying that don't for God's sakes, don't put your apple card
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:14.340]   in the same wallet as something else.
[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:17.700]   It's like how scratched up is this watch going to go?
[01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:18.700]   I didn't even think of that.
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:20.060]   I like titanium watches.
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:24.780]   I've always had, you know, with the traditional watches, I've always chosen titanium or ceramic
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:27.020]   because I just think those are nice materials.
[01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:31.740]   It is a wategant titanium watches your CFN.
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:33.660]   What's a CFN?
[01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:35.660]   Oh, CFN.
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:37.660]   I like CFN.
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:38.660]   I like CFN.
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:41.660]   We're three CFN's on Amazon last week.
[01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:42.660]   They're amazing.
[01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:43.660]   They're amazing.
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:44.660]   It's titanium.
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:46.660]   They come in like that.
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:47.660]   We have weight.
[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:48.660]   That's right.
[01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:52.660]   Do you have the CFN that has the HEPA filter built in?
[01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:56.660]   Nothing but the best, Uncle Leo.
[01:26:56.660 --> 01:26:57.660]   Not the best.
[01:26:57.660 --> 01:27:03.420]   I like the, it didn't take long before we started getting memes about the new camera look.
[01:27:03.420 --> 01:27:06.100]   That is a, by the way, a massive bump.
[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:08.700]   You're going to want to get a case if you want to lie flat.
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:12.860]   But many people noted it looks a lot like a fidget spinner.
[01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:16.620]   It's the new fidget spinner camera.
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:17.620]   Here's a guy.
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:18.620]   I like that grill.
[01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:19.620]   French shrimp.
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:20.620]   French shrimp.
[01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:21.620]   Oh, you guys just make the line.
[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:23.020]   Oh, you use the green phone on it right now.
[01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:25.580]   I need to be cooking on grandma's stone towels.
[01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:27.100]   The next guy got me.
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:28.500]   The next guy got me.
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:30.100]   It's a coconut shell.
[01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:32.260]   That's the horizontal coconut.
[01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:35.540]   You stick a screwdriver in that hole though, man.
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:36.860]   Bowling ball?
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:37.860]   Maybe.
[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:38.860]   Maybe.
[01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:39.860]   That's for me.
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:40.860]   Yeah.
[01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:41.860]   Aliens.
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:42.860]   Aliens from chicken little.
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:46.340]   Okay, that's a stretch.
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:47.340]   That's what I'm going to do.
[01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:50.180]   I'm going to get a bunch of googly eye stickers and put it on the back of my iPhone.
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.340]   That'll scare the hell out of it.
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:52.820]   You know, iPhone 8 plus a couple of Google eyes.
[01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:55.780]   This kind of cost a lot less money than an iPhone 11.
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:57.540]   I'll tell you that.
[01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:00.460]   So the memes are flying fast and furious.
[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:02.620]   Oh, let's talk about you.
[01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:03.620]   You started talking about it.
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:06.780]   Let's talk about the new watch health tracking stuff.
[01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:14.780]   So there are three new research studies, including hearing, heart movement and cycle
[01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:19.420]   tracking, although with the latest article about how some of these cycle tracking apps
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:24.060]   send the information, not just about your cycle, but about a lot of other things, including
[01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:27.420]   your most recent sexual activity back to Facebook.
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:29.940]   There might be some people thinking twice about that.
[01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:32.860]   Well, that's that's why Apple is really careful to say that we don't.
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:34.900]   Yes, we don't tell anybody.
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:37.140]   We don't we don't even we don't know this data.
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:39.140]   So don't worry about it.
[01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:40.660]   Do you guys sign up automatically?
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:46.580]   The heart we've had a heart research before I signed up for it when it was available.
[01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:48.020]   Hearings interesting.
[01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:57.180]   You know, especially like seeing how daily sound exposure influences your hearing.
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:29:04.380]   That's from that's going to be, I think, expressly good for kids because for all of us on this
[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:06.820]   panel and we're just too late.
[01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:10.220]   We've already damaged like more of our hearing that we've realized.
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:12.060]   It's when the kids realize it.
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:14.300]   Oh, by the way, do you realize that?
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:18.140]   Here's what we've we've pulled your favorite track off your iPhone.
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:19.260]   Here's what's going to sound like.
[01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:23.020]   If you keep going through things like what you put yourself through yesterday, I was like,
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:27.580]   oh, that'll get the kids to buy your plate.
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:29.140]   You with that your kids always weren't headphones.
[01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:30.940]   So the watch is going to pick it up.
[01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:35.260]   The loudest places that people get like our sporting events like, you know, when they
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:38.540]   have people's heart rates going alerted, like the one guy doing some role is watching,
[01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:40.100]   like trying to help them.
[01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:43.060]   That's like Eagles fan.
[01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:46.900]   Or like if you're in a if you're in an industrial work environment, in which case you should
[01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:47.900]   know that it's loud.
[01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:48.900]   You should be wearing headphones anyway.
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:49.900]   Yeah.
[01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:53.820]   That's where that that could be useful, I guess.
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:58.340]   Young, just collecting data, I think is such a huge thing, especially for especially the
[01:29:58.340 --> 01:30:03.740]   data that could be collected from women specifically because women are underrepresented in studies.
[01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:07.700]   Most of the science that have been built up for 100 years was based on let's let's remove
[01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:11.820]   the idea of pregnancy in a menstrual cycle because we'll just so we'll only like observe
[01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:17.220]   men for it to figure out how neurological is shocking is that women are just men but
[01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:20.700]   with that extra stuff and we don't have to do any medical research on that.
[01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:23.220]   The extra stuff just confuses the results.
[01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:25.220]   And the other thing with this one is the one in carstylate.
[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:26.220]   Oh, sorry.
[01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:29.140]   An infertility watch cost like 400 bucks.
[01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:30.140]   Really?
[01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:31.140]   You're not cheap.
[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:32.140]   Oh, I know that.
[01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:33.140]   Oh, wow.
[01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:34.140]   Yes.
[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:35.140]   I have a friend who just got one because they're trying to have a baby.
[01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:36.140]   I was like, Oh, what's that?
[01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:37.140]   Is it a Fitbit?
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:38.140]   She's like, no, so fertility watch.
[01:30:38.140 --> 01:30:39.140]   I'm like, Oh, wow.
[01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:40.140]   What was that?
[01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:41.140]   She was like, Oh, it was like 375.
[01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:42.620]   I'm like, Whoa, what is this thing doing?
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:45.580]   It basically tracks her cycle and all that kind of stuff.
[01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:47.660]   And tells you, you know, when you should try to make a baby.
[01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:49.860]   Yeah, yeah, when you're ovulating and yeah, yeah.
[01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:52.300]   Premium mark after that other winner right there.
[01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:53.460]   Go ahead, Doc Rock.
[01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:58.420]   I don't know if the research app will answer these questions too, but another group of
[01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:02.980]   people who are underrepresented in health studies are people of color.
[01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:08.940]   So if in their health, there is a checkbox for ethnicity, then that can help out those
[01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:10.940]   of us meddling and enhance folks.
[01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:12.140]   So you guys will all do it, right?
[01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:13.740]   I mean, I think everybody would do it.
[01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:14.740]   I do it.
[01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:17.060]   Is it, I mean, it's good for Apple.
[01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:19.260]   It's good for PR.
[01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:22.900]   I guess it's valuable for the medical community and the research community.
[01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:25.140]   So it's a win all right.
[01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:28.060]   I think this really does move them as a company.
[01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:31.900]   It really is the sort of thing that when they talk the talk, this is them walking the
[01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:36.260]   walk about their responsibility to make life better for old humans everywhere.
[01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:41.260]   And also this is really with this is the Apple Watch is one of the most impressive product
[01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:46.340]   turnaround I've ever seen, it went from the one of the most confused, let's just build
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:49.060]   the watch and then figure it out later.
[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:52.260]   Product launches, middling for about a year, year and a half.
[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:56.540]   But when they finally figured out that we can make something that is so that is hyper,
[01:31:56.540 --> 01:31:58.540]   hyper, hyper focused on fitness.
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:02.580]   And it also has apps that will that will do other things as well.
[01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:07.160]   Notifications fine, but this is all going to be a health focused device that you really
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:12.220]   have to have a target to drive towards to really find that to get towards excellence.
[01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:16.920]   And now that they figured out that no, this is a health, this is not just a fitness device,
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:18.220]   this is a health device.
[01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:22.120]   They keep prosecuting that idea of harder and harder and harder with each iteration.
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:27.400]   And you can see the amount of the amount of excitement that it drives for them inside,
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:28.400]   I think.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:32.040]   All right, ladies, I mean, gentlemen.
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:33.040]   Ladies.
[01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:35.040]   All right, ladies.
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:39.880]   Let's take a break, unless you I'll give you one last chance.
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:43.240]   Anything you saw today during the event that you thought, yes, go ahead, Doc.
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:44.320]   You said it.
[01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:46.360]   That was not a La Porti and slip.
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:50.200]   That was actually real today on the diversity tip.
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:55.240]   Apple had a bunch of ladies present in the day and I give much, much kudos to that.
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:58.920]   And it didn't seem like they were just doing it to get that.
[01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:00.800]   These people are really doing these jobs.
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:02.640]   So kudos to them for that.
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:05.640]   Absolutely did not look like your typical Silicon Valley company.
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:07.960]   It looked like a true diverse company.
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:11.280]   And yeah, whether that's true or not in the ranks, I don't know, but it's a really great
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:13.440]   thing to see that on stage.
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:16.920]   Parenthetically, I would add to that, I would love to see them make sure that they caption
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:21.320]   every time that that someone appears on the stage with their actual name, because not
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:26.720]   everybody knows, oh, and now let's let's bring Chewie up on stage to talk about this feature.
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:30.880]   Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep insiders know who this person is, but the rest of the
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:35.040]   world who might want to know, oh, this person really seemed to have a lot to say, who is
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:36.040]   this person?
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:38.200]   Okay, give me the full name and let me check on.
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:39.600]   I'm the cynic.
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:44.440]   My cynical thought is the reason he didn't say last names, he didn't want us googling
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:48.200]   and finding out that she's the intern.
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:52.920]   And I don't know that they really had to dig deep to find a female of color to represent
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:53.920]   it.
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:55.400]   I don't know, but I agree with you, Andy.
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:57.760]   I want to see the full name and know what her title is.
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:58.760]   Go ahead.
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:33:59.760]   Oh, one.
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:01.600]   I'm just googling parenthetically.
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.600]   I'm just trying to educate myself.
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:06.080]   And yeah, and yeah, you're dropping bombs and stuff.
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.240]   I'm trying to catch up.
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:08.240]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:10.640]   Oh, parenthetically, okay, I got let's continue.
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:17.520]   Always a man of the people Owen, except I don't think he's really a man of the people.
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:19.160]   I think he just plays one on TV.
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:24.160]   I think actually Owen, you're living in a solid gold house, driving.
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:26.720]   You know, you know, my lifestyle.
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:29.720]   He's driving a Maybank.
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:33.240]   My lifestyle is like life of the walking dead, like the living walking dead.
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:37.080]   I just throw some blood on myself and I walk with his eyes and I was like, "Hey, that's
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:38.080]   what I'm saying."
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:40.520]   You sitting up there and that bubble people always try to pop that bubble.
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:42.320]   He smells like he's dead.
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:45.360]   Down here on regular, regular ground, I can live for a little while.
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:46.360]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:47.360]   Just trying to view the people.
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:50.080]   Amen to the people.
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:56.080]   And my people all say your people should stay where you are.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:00.000]   Our show is brought to you by, he's more of a Bugatti guy, they say.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.200]   All right, no Maybank for you, my friend.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:05.280]   Parenthetically, I say that.
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:09.600]   Get your anything else, any other thing, Owen, anything you saw on stage, we didn't talk
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:12.360]   about the no pen.
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:15.680]   I got bashed on us.
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:18.600]   The D.S. people are so mad at me talking about don't buy apple.
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:23.120]   First of all, I just like to talk about the things that they say are not always hyped up
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:24.120]   the way they are.
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:25.120]   I buy apple stuff.
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:26.120]   I buy apple.
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:27.520]   After which version of the phone will go to buy?
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:28.520]   I would tell you.
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:29.520]   I'm going to get that.
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:33.320]   No, but you like to puncture the reality distortion field whenever possible.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:34.680]   That's what we like having you on.
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:38.720]   What's good is great and what's the same thing like I said, I can throw cookies and stuff
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:42.000]   that they want to tell me that they invented always on screens, but I can't get it on the
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000]   phone.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.680]   I mean, this little thing, but you know, it's all good.
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:46.680]   That's it.
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:47.680]   We're happy.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:48.680]   Apple day.
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:51.280]   But I think Pixel 4 is going to be something to watch for as well, isn't it?
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:54.880]   I believe in the Pixel camera.
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:57.320]   Again, I want to see what this night site looks like.
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:59.360]   I can't say what kind of night mode they call it.
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:04.280]   Night mode looks like on the iPhone because night site is amazing.
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:06.360]   The camera on the Pixel is just phenomenal.
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.360]   Talked about them.
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.240]   Video not so much, but the camera is phenomenal.
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:10.240]   We have already just-
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:11.240]   Even on the cheaper version.
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:13.240]   Michael, in the 3A.
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:17.280]   We've already decided, Aunt Pruitt and I are going to be, it's going to be Ant and Leo
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:18.520]   at CES this year.
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:22.560]   We're going to do it completely guerilla style with this phone.
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:30.400]   We haven't decided yet if it's going to be the Pixel 4 or the iPhone 11 Max Pro Max Pro.
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:34.160]   You can't record 19 people on the 11 Pro Max 1177.
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:39.720]   I have to figure it out, but we're going to do extensive testing before January.
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:41.600]   And then whatever that is, that's what we're going to carry.
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:46.760]   We're going to go around and shoot CES booth by booth, little short segments.
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.400]   And we're going to do it on one of those two devices.
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:51.240]   I have a feeling right now it's going to be the iPhone.
[01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:55.200]   But we have to see what the Pixel has next month.
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:00.260]   Let's take a break and then if you want some pics of the week, but first a word from Last
[01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:01.260]   Pass.
[01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:02.260]   We're big Last Pass fans here.
[01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:07.960]   As you know, I've been a Last Pass user for, well since it first came out, I think 10
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:10.200]   years.
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:17.120]   We got Joe Seagrist, the guy who created it to talk with Steve Gibson, our security guru.
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:19.320]   You've got to look at the source code, how it's done.
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:21.360]   And he gave it his absolute seal of approval.
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:25.220]   In fact, Steve started using Last Pass at that point.
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:30.880]   There was a kind of a critical moment in Twitch history when one of our engineers put all
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:35.280]   of his passwords online on a public website when we realized, you know, we better use
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:36.440]   Last Pass at work too.
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.320]   We started using Last Pass Enterprise.
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:41.400]   So Last Pass for us is a critical tool.
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:44.720]   It is a password vault that you could put anything in.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:46.400]   Anything that you want to keep secure.
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:52.120]   It's encrypted everywhere except on your device and boy, every device, Android, iOS.
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:53.760]   I use it on Linux.
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:56.880]   It works in every browser, works on Mac and Windows.
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:59.040]   And that means I can use Last Pass everywhere.
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:02.160]   In fact, Last Pass is the first thing I install when I'm setting up a new device, whether
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:04.200]   it's a tablet, a phone or a computer.
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.720]   I'm a huge Last Pass fan.
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:10.200]   We use Last Pass Enterprise at work because after all, at work, we've got to give the
[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:14.800]   keys to the kingdom to our employees, bank accounts, websites, databases, they have
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:15.800]   all that.
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:18.480]   And so I want to make sure we do it in a way that's completely secure.
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:20.480]   Last Pass guarantees that.
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:22.600]   And they're not sitting on their laurels by any means.
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:27.120]   They just set up an expanded business lineup with some amazing features that does something
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:29.560]   that's almost impossible in security.
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:32.800]   It improves security and it improves convenience.
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:34.800]   No, it's true.
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:40.160]   Last Pass Enterprise now includes single sign-on and they started with 1200 plus SAML integrated
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:42.600]   apps, each with its own getting started guide.
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:44.960]   So it's easy for your employees to get up to speed.
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:48.520]   They'll love single sign-on because they don't have to have a password.
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:50.440]   On their phone, it says, "Is this you logging in?
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:52.320]   You press OK and you're in.
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:55.440]   That's more convenient for them and more secure for you."
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:01.640]   Plus, as an IT professional managing a Last Pass install at your enterprise, you get all
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:03.560]   the data, all the information.
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:04.560]   Who's using what?
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:05.800]   Who's logged in right now?
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:07.480]   You completely control it.
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:11.280]   Granular control with IT and frictionless assets to users.
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:13.160]   It's like the Holy Grail.
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:17.400]   There's also, along with Last Pass Enterprise and these SAML apps, there's also Last Pass
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:21.080]   MFA, not two factor, multi factor.
[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:26.480]   So it also adds biometrics like fingerprint and face, contextual factors like location
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:32.640]   and IP address to make sure that you are who you say you are, authentication plus.
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:33.640]   That's really important.
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:38.880]   They combine the two Last Pass Enterprise and Last Pass MFA into Last Pass identity from
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:43.160]   single sign on and password management to adaptive authentication.
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:47.800]   Last Pass gives you absolute control, gives your users what they're looking for, total
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:51.280]   convenience all in one simple, secure solution.
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:52.440]   You just kind of love it.
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:56.400]   No wonder it's the number one most preferred password manager at home and at work.
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:57.400]   And I put everything in there.
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:58.400]   I trusted so much.
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:00.720]   I put all my important documents and my passports are in there.
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:04.800]   When I travel, they always say, "Keep a copy of your passport," but I don't actually Xerox
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:06.920]   it and put it in my suitcase.
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:09.640]   I actually have it on my phone with the Last Pass.
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:11.880]   So it's secure there, but I have access to it.
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:15.320]   If anything should happen to my passport, I also keep social security numbers, drivers,
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:16.320]   licenses.
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:20.240]   And if you do online shopping, the autofill features of Last Pass are fantastic.
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:24.800]   Not just login and passwords, but it'll also keep your credit cards and you can autofill
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:25.800]   them that way.
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:30.240]   It is the easiest possible checkout process and you don't have to open your wallet.
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:33.760]   Last Pass is the password manager.
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:38.080]   You need it, your business needs it from authentication to access to passwords.
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:41.080]   Let Last Pass manage every entry point to your business.
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:47.200]   Mitigate risk, improve productivity, LastPass.com/twit to find out how they can help you.
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:48.680]   LastPass.com/twit.
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:52.440]   And don't forget we're going to be doing a special event in Boston with Last Pass.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:41:00.960]   On October 3rd, Steve Gibson, Last Pass is CISO Jerry Bookholt and the legendary Bill
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:04.120]   Cheswick, one of the great security guys of all time.
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:09.160]   He invented the firewall at Bell Labs and he's written extensively on passwords and why passwords
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.720]   have got to die.
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:14.560]   We're going to talk about that, the future of authentication.
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:15.560]   It's a free event.
[01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:23.360]   If you're going to be in Boston, October 3rd, go to twit.to/unlocked, twit.to/unlocked and
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:24.360]   get your ticket.
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:28.040]   We've expanded the venue now twice because we will make sure everybody gets in.
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:33.440]   Not only is it free, but LastPass is making this a benefit so you'll get a $100 token
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:36.720]   to donate to one of three chosen charities.
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:39.520]   The charity of your choice, you'll get to do that at the event.
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:43.800]   So it's a great cause and it's a great thing to go to and I would love to see you there.
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:44.800]   Twit.to/unlocked.
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.240]   Of course, you've got to be in Boston on October 3rd.
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:51.680]   We will be recording it and we'll put it out as a twit special.
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:53.520]   So you'll get to see it after the fact.
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:58.360]   If you're in town, come, it's going to start at 3.45 in the afternoon and there will be
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:03.920]   a cocktail hour where you get to meet and talk to our panelists and me as well afterwards.
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:07.080]   So it's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:08.200]   Let's get some pics of the week.
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:10.640]   Now, Doc Rock, I don't know if you are prepared.
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:12.160]   If there's anything you'd like to pick.
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:13.160]   Always prepared.
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:16.160]   What are you hot for these days?
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:17.160]   Okay.
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:23.240]   So I've been sitting on this until we knew exactly what was going to happen with the phone.
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:25.560]   And now I know it's going to happen when the phone, I'm ready for this.
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:29.120]   I want to talk about the Osmo Mobile 3.
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:31.680]   This is the latest rendition of the gimbal.
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:33.360]   I'm going to go ahead and pop the link in the chat.
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:34.920]   I love our Osmo.
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:35.920]   We love it.
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:36.920]   It is fantastic.
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:43.360]   Yeah, I had the one and then I played with the two and then I went to drones and I got
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:45.760]   my Osmo pocket, which I also love.
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:51.200]   But knowing that this phone is going to have this incredible video support.
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:55.120]   The cool thing about the three and I'm going to Hokkaido next month so I get to test it
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:56.560]   out right away.
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:05.720]   I love the fact that it folds so small and it has these really cool sort of built in
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:09.760]   cinema robotic moves for people who don't know how to do this stuff like with the special
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:12.520]   transitions and stuff that folks like me like to use.
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:16.880]   You have built in sort of camera moves.
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:23.560]   You can do the motion labs, the hyper labs, the wave at it in order to take a picture.
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:28.400]   It does the little barrel rolls like you're looking at right now.
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:29.400]   You know what I mean?
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:32.960]   That stuff you don't have to know how to do it because I spent years figuring this out.
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:38.400]   But now regular folks can do this and I have literally watched the way people's video game
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:44.320]   have up leveled up since people started using these little phone gimbals.
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:47.280]   The epic part about this is it's 119.
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:52.880]   If you just want the basic fellow, there is a bundle that gets you a little extra accoutrement
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.760]   that's like 139.
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:57.400]   But it's not even a pocketbook breaker.
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:58.400]   That's a really great price.
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:01.680]   Boy, a lot less than I've been paid for the last one.
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:02.680]   Yeah, right.
[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:07.440]   The original one, I think I started out at like 240 and it's gone down since.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:11.720]   But man, what an amazing device, incredible battery life.
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:13.640]   I love the ActiveTrack feature.
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:19.240]   So you sit it down and as I go like this and such, the camera stays with you, stuff like
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:20.600]   that is going to be great.
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:25.880]   So there's no reason to have $10,000 vacation with crappy footage.
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:35.080]   So you must get yourself an Osmo pocket, slap on your new iPhone, iPhone Pro or Pro Max
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:39.680]   or Pixel, whatever you got and get really, really good footage now.
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:40.680]   Really cool.
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:41.680]   Good pick.
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:43.880]   Somebody has my Osmo mobile.
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:45.880]   I wonder who...
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:46.880]   It's gorgeous.
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:50.560]   No, no, no, I got a video to send cars.
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:51.560]   Oh, good.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:52.560]   You did the review.
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:53.560]   Good.
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:54.560]   I did the review.
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:55.560]   I did review.
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:58.280]   It's actually on sale now and all the accessories are out.
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:04.440]   And it's sad because it's going to sound like a horrible, horrible DJI moment.
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:11.080]   But I was going to buy the DJI Ronan SC and then they were having problems with the iPhone
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:16.920]   because the field of view on the camera wasn't as wide as the Samsungs.
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:22.520]   Now with this new lens, the setup with the Ronan actually uses your phone as the Active
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:25.480]   Track on your DSLR or mirrorless camera.
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:28.320]   So you can set it up where it syncs with your camera.
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:33.720]   So now when I use my wide-angled lenses, the phone will actually be able to keep up with
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:34.720]   my mirrorless camera.
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:38.320]   So I'm going to order the Ronan SC today.
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:39.320]   How much is that though?
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:40.320]   That's going to sit your back.
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:41.320]   That's $4.39.
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:42.320]   And I've already got it.
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:44.040]   You're not going to get the bigger one.
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:47.760]   You're not going to get the motion one for $5.29, $5.39.
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:48.760]   Come on, oh man.
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:49.760]   Well, okay.
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:58.440]   So the difference with that one is I personally am not skilled enough to roll my focuses.
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:45:59.440]   That's what that does.
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:00.440]   It gives you the focus ring.
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:02.640]   That's what comes with the pro version versus on the pro version.
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:03.880]   Everything else is the same.
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:06.680]   But the focus ring, I'm not skilled enough to even use it.
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:10.120]   I have a Ronan M and I never used the focus ring on that.
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:12.120]   So I'm not going to waste the money on this.
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:16.000]   And I'm trying to downscale because I'm not as strong as I want to be in my mind.
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.600]   I look at the rock, but I ain't the rock.
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:19.880]   So the SC is lighter.
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:23.680]   And with the camera, this with the active track, I could set it up and use it like I
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:25.280]   use the Osmo pocket.
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:31.400]   And now instead of using just for B roll, I could use it with my Canon R, USR.
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:35.800]   So I'm super excited because the field of view with the iPhone was smaller.
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:39.200]   So when I'd use a wide angle lens, apparently people were saying the active track wouldn't
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:40.200]   sync with the iPhone.
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:43.680]   You'd have to use a Samsung, but now I can get an iPhone in a work.
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:47.320]   So just to for people wondering where all these things are, what we call gimbals, they're
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:49.040]   motion stabilizers.
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:52.920]   You just hold them and they automatically stabilize the motion on your phone and your
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:53.920]   camera.
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:59.440]   The Osmo's are for camera phones and the Ronan's, I guess, are for SLRs are actually probably
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:01.320]   more mirrorless than a mirrorless.
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:03.320]   It has a mirrorless version.
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:04.320]   And a DSLR version.
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:06.080]   The SD is for mirrorless.
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:07.080]   Okay.
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:11.360]   And Leo, if you're going to get a Ronan, you don't have to get the extra one with the
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:16.000]   focus ring because our new Sony camera focuses faster than anything in the world.
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.000]   So we don't need that.
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.800]   Oh, this would be good for that new, that new Alpha 7R.
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:24.760]   Exactly what I was buying the SD.
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:26.960]   You alpha bears.
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.680]   Yeah.
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:31.760]   Do you have a pick on?
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:33.520]   The Ronan SD was going to be my pick.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:35.520]   I can say this sounds like a DJI day.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:37.400]   It's DJI day.
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:38.920]   DJI day.
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:41.800]   You know, I can't buy any more drones.
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:46.560]   I've been cut off, so I'll have to buy something else.
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:48.480]   You have a drone kind of sore.
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:51.920]   I'm going to have a cousin, Ant, teach you how to fly.
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:52.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:53.920]   I'm going to put you through the fly force.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:57.320]   He's going to take you out step by step week by week, get you up.
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:59.480]   I'm going to start with a little $99 one.
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:01.480]   We're going to get you back up to fly air traffic.
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:07.280]   I thought I was with a drone father, Father Robert Ballisare, who is the king.
[01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:08.280]   He trained me.
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:09.800]   Apparently not good enough.
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:10.800]   I dunked my maverick.
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:14.360]   It was a new teacher that we got to dumb it down and start over and ask who we got.
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:15.360]   And that's what we got.
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:16.440]   All right, dumb it down.
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:17.880]   That's it.
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:19.320]   Break it down, start over.
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:20.880]   Build it up from scratch.
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:21.880]   Andy and not go.
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:22.880]   Pick of the week.
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:25.600]   Oh, Andy's muted.
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:27.240]   Andy unmute.
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:29.600]   Press the magic twanger.
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:30.600]   There you go.
[01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:32.600]   Very, very quick pick.
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:39.360]   I found a music player last week that is focused on albums and it has the worst title
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:41.880]   ever because if you look for it, you will never find it.
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:46.800]   It's called Albums, Album Focused Player by Adam Linder.
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:48.840]   It's a really, really simple player.
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:52.960]   All it, but the feature that it has that has been, because I'm starting playing with
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:57.000]   it and liking it, is that it really is focused on playing whole albums.
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.480]   It's one of the limitations, I think, of almost every single player that I've ever seen
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:05.880]   is that what if you like to listen to whole albums from start to finish?
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:09.560]   It lets you shuffle albums, lets you play albums like as entire units without having
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:10.560]   to specify.
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:14.480]   No, no, no, please don't just add this to a playlist and then start going.
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:19.200]   It will also automatically pull down all the album info from discogs.
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:25.200]   So if you want to know production info without having to hit Wikipedia, it will just pull
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:26.880]   all that stuff down.
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:33.040]   It's three bucks, but it's definitely an independent production and I really want, A, I like it
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:36.920]   for, again, listening to my collection as whole albums.
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:43.520]   We've worked with Apple Music as well with your own audio files putting in there.
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:48.000]   I hope that he continues to work on it and continues to improve it because that is one
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.520]   of the areas that I don't think that any music player right now does a really good job with.
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:56.400]   Again, it's one of the biggest frustrations about iTunes and one of the reasons why I
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:02.000]   sort of moved away from it is that it doesn't understand that if I put, like, if I've got
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.840]   one track from a certain album because I just like that one song, I really don't need to
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:10.480]   have that listed amongst like all the albums that I have.
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:15.680]   Allow me to look at my collection as here's a collection of complete albums where you get
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:21.880]   track one to track 11, not the ones that has only the three favorite songs from, from Abbey
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:22.880]   Road.
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:25.280]   Give me, let me accidentally play that.
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:27.480]   Let me play the entire album as it is.
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:32.800]   And so this is, I hope, attention being paid to people who want to listen to track one through
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:35.200]   track 11, site A to site B.
[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:39.160]   All right, here's one question that would put, by the way, a $2.99 I'm going to buy it no
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:40.160]   matter what.
[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:45.160]   But it would be really cool if I could play Dark Side of the Moon exactly, you know, without
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:49.200]   the gap, but exactly as it's not overlapping either crossfades, not what I want.
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:54.680]   I want it exactly as it sounds on the on the on the I think for the ultimate experience,
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:58.600]   it would have to use a location to figure out are you in a state where you can buy the
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:00.320]   substances that you need.
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:04.920]   And also to time it's that, okay, take one puff now, and I don't don't take anymore,
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:07.360]   but okay, another hit right now, right now, right now.
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:10.440]   Or when it starts the Wizard of Oz, that would be the other.
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:16.760]   Does it play a gapolis kind of like assembling the album as as, as I have not, I have not
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:17.760]   tried it.
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:20.520]   Sorry, I'm going to buy it anyway, because I mean, this is clearly the right thing to
[01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:21.520]   do.
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:22.520]   This is a great idea.
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:26.400]   Exactly, this is why I have two separate music players.
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:30.840]   I have one music player that's really for streaming services and then another self contained
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:36.080]   music player just for my entire collection of albums, because it's so confusing and so
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:38.040]   disappointing to do it otherwise.
[01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:41.200]   And this is one thing that I really wish that iTunes would do better because it doesn't
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:42.200]   do it at all right now.
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:46.960]   $2.99, Adam Linder, maybe if you search for Adam Linder, you'd be more likely to find
[01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:47.960]   it.
[01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:48.960]   That's fine.
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:54.240]   I got that I bookmark the actual link to the store in my notes app because I was spending
[01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:55.640]   five minutes while we were in the company.
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:59.040]   I was spending all the time with the commercials saying no, no, not photo albums.
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:04.520]   No, not music albums that have tracks like again, please at least like make it like a
[01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:10.160]   LBMZ or something just you got a you got a 1990s the these names up if you want people
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:11.160]   to find them on the Google.
[01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:16.080]   We didn't talk about it, but the New York Times did an expose on the app store search
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:18.920]   yesterday that showed how at least in the past.
[01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:24.360]   Apple really put all of its apps no matter what you searched for at the top of the search.
[01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:26.880]   Apple said we're not going to do that anymore.
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:29.160]   So but it was a it was a really interesting article.
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:30.840]   Yeah, good for them.
[01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:34.600]   They showed in this first example on the on the article online.
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:39.040]   If you search for podcast, you'd find pretty much every Apple app, not just their podcast
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:42.080]   app, but every Apple app.
[01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:45.360]   And then they start showing you other companies podcast apps compass.
