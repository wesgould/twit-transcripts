[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.040]   So it's a good thing the Mac break weekly team is on it first
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.680]   Thanks to Megan Moroni for filling in for me last week. I had a little vacation somebody semi. I felt bad
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.480]   Listener and Denmark sent me a note saying are you okay with such a sudden disappearance? I thought you had a heart attack
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.200]   Yeah, I'm fine. I didn't forgot to mention that I was gonna go on a mini vacation. So it took a few days off
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.280]   That's all two days
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.400]   Renee Richie's here from Montreal and you've been busy busy busy brand new I'm more calm layout coming and I
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.440]   Want to ask you later in the show about what what is the plan because it sounds like also kind of a tutorial shift
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.480]   Somewhat. Yeah, don't freak out folks. I
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.360]   Managed a babysit successfully. I might add yeah poor Georgia. I really gave her a hard time for a job
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.520]   I gave her a hard time for letting you take care of her kids. I was besmirched sir
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.920]   Apparently you did such a good job. The kids didn't want Georgia and Anthony to come home
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.040]   They said terrible babysitter said don't ask me
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.640]   Yeah, yeah, you did a great job. I gather they had a fun time
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.840]   Also here Andy and not co from the Chicago Sun times you can babysit my kids anytime
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.840]   he is
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.280]   Christopher I hope you don't know that I
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.080]   I
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.160]   Have to say that'll be no problem then because I defined successful babysitting as I didn't have to change the kid even once
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.880]   No, I guarantee you promise you you will not have that with all with all my sisters
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.600]   I'll say I'll baby if you drop off your kid. That's fine realize that when you pick him or her up again
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.320]   He or she will be a little bit heavier than when he arrived. So you're okay with that
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.240]   That's fine and for two weeks the second week in a row
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.040]   From the pixel core Alex Lindsey is here. Hey looking
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.080]   Tacklingly three-dimensional. I can't we can't quite figure out what it is
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.560]   But you're my special 3d camera that I figured out how to get into a webcam. You look marvelous
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.720]   Why I think it so big news
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.600]   Apple has updated the Mac Pro
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:57.760]   So what are they what is the counter yeah, they reset the counter what did they do to the Mac Pro?
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.800]   Can you reset the counter?
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.200]   I mean they're giving you what were the upgrades essentially at the base level price now
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.440]   So it's not like they didn't put the latest eons in they didn't put the latest
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.000]   GPUs in it's just the higher-end version but they at least
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.560]   Updated I mean it's still the trash cam. We're not saying that anything about that
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.760]   But they at least updated the graphics car, but you're saying it's not the latest latest stuff yet
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.320]   I have to double check it, but it looks to me like what you could previously get is upgrades
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.840]   It's like the number of cores went up
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.320]   But I don't think they're using like they're not using anything approaching what AMD is shipping now
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.600]   And I think that's they mentioned this in the well
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:38.320]   Groomer missions in the article is that they sort of got trapped by their own thermal core in that that machine requires the triple balance of a GPU and
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:45.760]   To sorry a CPU and two GPUs and they were betting heavily that the two GPU model would take off the general computing would take off that
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.920]   Things like open CL would take off and turns out not so much and you can't just throw a giant like a
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.480]   Nvidia 1080 card in here because it would destroy the thermal balance in the machine
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.880]   So they went the wrong direction and it's gonna take a while to recover
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.120]   So this is sort of the highest end they can put in the current casing for the same base price now
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.520]   So basically what they did is they dropped the price of thousand bucks on the high-end highest em-
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.400]   That's a that's a new that's a new style of upgrade is just like hey
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:19.560]   We gave you the same thing for less the the 3999 model with the eight core BTO and the dual D700 GPUs
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.040]   Is a high is the high-end stock configuration and the former high-end model the
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:33.360]   With the six cores e5 Xeon and the dual D500s and 16 gigs of RAM is now the base model
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.200]   2999
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.800]   So you can you can go as high as eight core e5 but as you point out Renee that's still the e5
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:47.680]   That's the processor that yeah, that shipped three years ago with the original Mac Pro the D700
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.680]   I don't think the process is such a big deal for people. Honestly. I mean I think it's the it's the it's the the GPUs
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.960]   You know the three-year-old GPUs are
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.840]   ancient and also if you're talking about a pro platform, you know really and
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.360]   AMD I mean I don't know there's a lot of us that don't really consider AMD a pro platform
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.560]   I mean that they do have some pro cards, but but Nvidia really owns that market
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:20.560]   There's there's just a lot of different definitions of what constitutes a pro user and I think where a lot of people were being left behind is
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.680]   The point in which you're buying a box where you're expecting that you'll be able to make it faster where you need to make it faster
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.080]   So you can't just plop another GPU where you need it
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.120]   You don't you can't just prop plop a CPU upgrade where you need it
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.040]   You really have to upgrade it the way that Apple was planning for you to upgrade this the the Quaker Road's box
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.800]   Style Mac Pro and this was just not a machine that was designed to do that so
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:48.520]   Like I said they let them at the money where the money quotes from Craig Federighi was we boxed ourselves in with a round design
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.320]   It's really that's funny, but thank you Phil Schiller for innovating his ass off
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:02.120]   Some people have long memories like I have a long memory because I bought one
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.960]   Do know I'm saying that of the five people who like who were at that table two of them decided to say turns out that can't
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.000]   Innovate my ass turned out to be exactly correct really. Oh, that's funny. So
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.040]   So this was unprecedented. I think correct me if I'm wrong when an Apple announced the new Mac Pro
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:27.640]   I think they knew immediately that there would be howls of pain and that the immediate conclusion we and everybody else would jump to is that's it
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.640]   Apple's done with the Macintosh
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:35.160]   Look at this. This is their idea of a pro update. So in an unprecedented
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:41.360]   I think unprecedented move they had a journalists come to Cupertino and at a round table
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.400]   Where they explained they explained to them?
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.600]   Why this is the best they could do right now?
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:55.920]   Yeah, they really they really did outline why the read one some of the reasons why they you didn't see that many updates because
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:05.360]   Like Renee said they it's a it's a triangle inside there with different different subsystems on each side of that triangle vertical triangle
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:11.280]   And the idea is that I have each one of these sides of the triangle as this computer was engineered
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.760]   Can't has to be generating about the same on him heat as the other
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:20.120]   So it's not was gonna be as easy as if the weaknesses the GPUs if they just they guess that
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:27.680]   The secret to greater performance is going to be distributed processing across multiple GPUs when it turns out that the direction
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:33.160]   That one was going since 2013 was one big beefy CPU a GPU that keeps getting updated
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:40.440]   And so they couldn't plop in one big beefy GPU because now one side of the triangle is hot enough to fry three eggs on and the other two
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:46.560]   With all the passive passive thermal stuff can't really get cooked good colder in order to compensate for it
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.560]   So they were absolutely stuck
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:54.080]   Thank you Apple. Thank you. I am here $3,000 and three years later. Thank you
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:00.240]   Yeah, there's a lot. There's a lot of good stuff. This is this is why I've always been hoping that Apple would be more open
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.960]   This is right. Well, they had to there was no choice at this point
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.360]   Yeah, exactly
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.360]   I mean there was there was no reason for anybody to assume that Apple has has or had faith in the Macintosh
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.560]   If they're not gonna they're not updating the Mac Pro for
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:19.520]   Substantially in three years they come up with a new note no updates to the iMac no real updates to the Mac mini
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:25.600]   Update to the Mac book pro that makes it more like an Mac book error than a conventional Mac book pro
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.480]   Unless you and that vacuum people are going to make whatever
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:35.920]   Whatever decisions that then speculations that they have to and silence is is not an answer as a like the life of the citizens
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.160]   We tried doing nothing and and that and that hasn't worked so you have to say that okay
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.880]   Here is exactly why you haven't seen in the updates and it does it has nothing to do with how we feel about the Macintosh
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:52.420]   It's because again, we put ourselves into a corner with this design well, you know if you want to judge how this new
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:58.680]   Briefing strategy worked and you got need to go no farther than the Fox news of Cupertino daring fireball
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.160]   Which okay, that's that's that's very very low
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:07.580]   I
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:12.320]   Challenge that there were other I read all five first of all gribber was the only one to
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:18.520]   Specify here are the here are the names of the other people who are at that table and also linking to all of them
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.000]   So it was easy for someone to click all the links and read all the different coverage
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.080]   Yeah, but and there are the farther to a three years his lead. Let's not beat around the bush
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.600]   I have great news to share well, that is good news. Yeah, well
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.000]   Okay, I guess it is good
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.920]   Bury's the part about but this is gonna be you know another year or so. It's like it's like comparing anybody to Delta airlines
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:48.560]   I have to say okay stop all right. That's not up all right. It was mean I admit it was a chip shot
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.000]   For me
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.440]   His was the easiest to follow a lot of them had very small articles or short articles that they were broken up a lot
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.800]   And I find them really hard to follow John's to me at least was very well organized and narrated and I sort of put you
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.360]   Not exactly the table with them, but in the table is so who was at this table?
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.800]   Who were the five people in the table John Paz from Buzzfeed?
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.720]   TechCrunch was there yeah TechCrunch Matt Panzer
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.280]   TechCrunch Buzzfeed from Buzz from Mashable okay
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.920]   interest at Rup
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:21.240]   And also again if that's why that's a big part of this of the story to find out who else was at that table
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.400]   Yeah, given that all of these people weren't you don't have the New York Times?
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.560]   They don't have the Wall Street Journal. These are clearly people particularly
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.620]   Gruber and TechCrunch these are
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:35.620]   Sites that are really well positioned to talk directly to developers directly to pro users
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:40.360]   So clearly Apple wanted a certain segment of the Mac community to hear about this
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.280]   This wasn't a this wasn't a stock price saving face
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.100]   This wasn't a part of the marketing push for the Mac
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:52.980]   This was so it really adds credibility to the idea that we really want to try to try to say that anybody who is
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:58.460]   Thinking of switching away from the Mac specifically because they don't think that we're supporting a pro Mac users
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:02.740]   At least give us another year or so to to come through on promise. We've made
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.760]   I think it's really I think the griddle is getting pretty hot for Apple
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:11.060]   I think that the the issue is I have never heard not just me never heard so many pro
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:18.260]   Computer users talking about moving to PC and trying to figure out how they're gonna do that and trying to figure out what that's gonna look like
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.260]   I mean to have that many people
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.860]   Concerned about moving. I mean this is a core audience
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:29.660]   And if you don't think that it affects Apple's overall brand look at when they when they switch to Final Cut and Conan
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:34.860]   O'Brien's edit crew, you know in in protest made a whole made fun of
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:41.260]   Final Cut you know and and that that definitely affects the overall brand for the core audience
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.740]   Who is deeply tied into the entertainment industry to be you know jumping chip?
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.180]   You know freeze now works for go ahead. I'm sorry
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.460]   I think it's also pretty clear that Apple did not want to have to do this
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.300]   Like this was not like in their plans
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:57.940]   My guess is they started working on these a while ago and it was kind of funny because last year there were articles
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:03.780]   But Apple abandoned the Mac but they've been working on this new Mac Pro and the new the new Pro upgrades to the iMac for a while
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:07.620]   And if I had to guess I'm thinking that these are delayed not delayed
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:13.500]   But they're not gonna be ready anywhere nearly as quickly as Apple hoped and that sort of fed into this situation because if they could have announced the spring
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.420]   The new Mac Pro the new modular back Pro then a lot of these problems
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:20.100]   They don't go away, but they don't have to have meetings like this one to sort of say don't worry
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.300]   We have new Mac pros on the way. It's more like boom. Here's the new Mac Pro
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.580]   We know you've been waiting a while
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:30.060]   But we think is worth it and when you start to find out that it's not gonna be ready for a variety of reasons until next year
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:34.940]   You got to decide are you gonna keep quiet and risk exactly what Alex is talking about people not just
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:40.060]   Discussing switching to windows but actually switching to windows or you're gonna step up and say look, you know
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.700]   We don't usually discuss future plans, but we have them
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:47.220]   And you know we're not abandoning the Mac and try to do as much damage control and perception
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.540]   And also they they don't
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:56.260]   They have to be careful of not rushing it either because then you end up with the Mac Pro which is a lot of pro users
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.740]   You know, we're like myself. We're pretty upset with I mean they took you know
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.860]   We don't want a whole bunch of USB just USB C's, you know
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:10.260]   There are things that this makes a whole lot more complicated and if you're you know if you want a fast a fast laptop and you're a business user
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.780]   It's probably great, but for pro users
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.700]   Not necessary for a large number of them. It wasn't great
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:24.260]   You know, so I think it was a mixture of a false start on the on the laptop along with no updates on the hardware on the on the desktop
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.420]   Created a situation where they had to respond
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:31.340]   So I apologize because I really didn't do this very well
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.540]   Let me give you the news because we're analyzing it
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:40.860]   And I don't think I really coherently stated the news the news is and I'll do it in in group
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:45.500]   Resordered everybody really led with the fact that Apple is gonna rethink the Mac Pro
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.140]   And come up with a new design
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:57.300]   It sounds suspiciously like the cheese grater a modular design that will allow upgrades to the CPUs and the GPUs and other hardware
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:05.980]   On a regular basis the bad news is the existing Mac pros get a kind of a non update update a minor update
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.640]   Including no USB C no Thunderbolt 3 really really no change it all to the
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:16.580]   This the Mac Pro form factor and it still won't support the 5k display
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:26.340]   The other bad news is these these new Mac pros won't be out for some reason until next year. They are going to
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.940]   ship new iMacs later this year with
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:34.460]   Pro configurations, but the iMac isn't upgradable either
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:39.660]   The reason Alex said they want to get them right and getting them right now is not as important to them is getting
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:47.460]   Yeah, how can I wait a minute though really how come it takes that long because I think I think that they were going one direction
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.460]   And realized that that one direction
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:56.580]   My you're saying if you started today, it would take you to next year to come up with a redesign Mac Pro
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:01.860]   Yeah, why because because they're not just talking about mass production of hardware
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:06.100]   I mean and and then refitting refitting a factory and then you know built
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:10.940]   I mean they built a whole factory around this round trash can and so now you know
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:15.020]   You know having something else that they're gonna have to actually produce and by the way
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.780]   I would have been totally happy if they had left the cheese grater in place
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.780]   I'm a call BS
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:26.020]   It took them three years to figure out they couldn't upgrade the Mac Pro and they only decided in the spring of 2017
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:31.700]   Oh shoot. We realized we can't upgrade this thing. We better work on a different model. It took them that one
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.780]   I call BS. I don't buy any of this. I don't think this is gonna happen
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.300]   They were pretty candid about that
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.940]   Those people that Alex is talking about who were about to leave the fold in
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.740]   Sustainable you know suspended animation for another year
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:51.780]   But it that only pushes off the inevitable another year if they don't come up with something and I think that I think the opportunity for Apple
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:55.420]   If they really want to hear the pro users, they're going to
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:17:01.260]   They're going to give us something that is rack mountable that is modular that allows us to swap out
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.620]   Just about every component, you know there
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:07.860]   But but do it in an Apple way which is that when it's rack mounted it looks great
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:13.260]   When you slide things in and out it's not a bunch of little wires that you're all doing a whole bunch of crazy stuff with
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.980]   It's actually you're just actually sliding things in and out
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:24.380]   You know those are all the opportunities that Apple has to to show their design skill is not to ignore what works for professionals
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.820]   It is to
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.660]   To find a way to make that experience elegant
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.940]   You don't think that there's a significant rinsics. This is vaporware and Apple's just
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:40.140]   Trying to keep you from from switching to Windows for another year and then they're going to say you know what we figured out
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.300]   It's the iPad Pro that you really want
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.740]   No, but the problem is that much harder
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.060]   They don't want that and if they did that all they're going to end up with them
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.820]   Maybe maybe it's pushing you down another year
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.820]   But if they pushed if they did that
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.580]   What you'd end up with is just a bunch of people because there's just a bunch of people not buying a lot of computers
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.980]   And they're going to make a decision in another year. Maybe well
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:57.740]   I agree you know
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.660]   You're pushing your kick in the can down and then a year you're gonna have even more angry
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.540]   People if you don't come up with something so yeah
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.100]   I just think I just like that would be and that would be an insane thing to do for on Apple side
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.100]   I don't think they're they're insane
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:13.180]   The same thing to do is to make a new Mac Pro and not updated for three years and then and three years later say
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.540]   Whoops, we can't make it this can't upgrade this so we're gonna start over
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:22.340]   That's insane. That'll make it four years. I think Renee was about to say what I'm about to say so when I
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.620]   Renee say I think you were about to say I say it then all right
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.380]   Well, there's a couple things so maybe I'll hit on one of them
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:33.060]   But one is like I think Federique he spoke to this where he said that it was a mixture of them trying to fix it
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.060]   Not getting it right and I'll go as far as say denial and I think he might have used that word too
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:40.060]   Where they're trying to fix the Mac Pro that they have to see what they can do with it
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:44.060]   And then they have other priorities and it's like any human thing apples are a marketable human company
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.060]   You can distract. Oh, I've got to get that basement that decks said done
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.740]   You know I've got to get but look I have to fix this car and you're very good at ignoring problems
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:51.940]   But that does not make them go away
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.980]   And I think that they tried to ignore and a little bit fix this
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.260]   But they had iMacs and they can say iMac sell better
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.500]   We'll focus on those and yeah
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.820]   We'll get back to fixing the Mac Pro and oh look we got to get the iPhone out
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.260]   And yeah
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:06.620]   We'll get to the Mac Pro and that just it becomes years and years and the pressure and the problem builds and builds and
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.820]   At a certain point I think probably a year or so ago
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:12.700]   They realized that you know that was just going no further and they started working on something new
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.380]   How long does it take windows? It's manufacturers to be
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.180]   It's not long that is that well
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.940]   So Leo it's not just that is that they have to get the new iMac out
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:25.500]   Then you the new display out the new iPhone out the new iPad out the iPad didn't ship yet the iPad Pro update didn't ship yet
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:30.340]   And they have to get the Pro out so they're building this in amongst the turbulence of getting all those other
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.060]   things shipped
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:35.100]   It's unprecedented I think I think it's a precedent for Apple to communicate like this
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.100]   And so I do want to commend them for at least communicating
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:45.120]   Yeah, it's also unprecedented for them to admit admit makes such a huge this is a huge admission of failure and miss man and
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:51.900]   Miss management. Yeah, Phil to Phil did say we're sorry to pro users for the mistakes that were made
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.100]   Although it was not you know tear my shirt open and you know
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.740]   Neil
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.660]   But nonetheless it's see this a lot I think they I think this this little summit meeting
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:07.780]   Made a lot of progress not only because of promising. Hey, here's what wrong. Here's what we're gonna be doing
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:12.900]   Here's what we're gonna be releasing something next year. Don't worry about that, but also saying that
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:20.540]   Giving us some sort of a peek into how they're thinking they also mentioned that their defeat their definition of a pro
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:27.140]   How malleable yet the definition of a pro user was saying that we find that a lot of our pro users are using iMacs
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:33.260]   A lot of our pro users are using Macbook pros. So to Renee's point it really allows yourself to say no
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:37.500]   No, no, this is a brilliant idea people just we're skating to where the puck is going to be and if we just
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.340]   Stand here patiently with our stick
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:44.860]   That's where the puck is going to be and I'm not realizing that people are skating towards the iMac and they're skating towards
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:50.820]   Towards this other thing because they're waiting for you to do something with this this other this other machine
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:55.220]   So it comes very easy to talk yourself into thinking that you don't have a problem here
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:21:02.740]   It's just something that's going to resolve itself over time. So it also but there's there's good news and then there's always
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:08.340]   Reason to at least be a little flag on the play just thinking that realize that
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:16.740]   If apple says that don't worry, we've got great plans for the Mac Mac pro we're gonna be we've got something great coming into the 2018
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:23.380]   It could be something like the original Mac pro or it could be something like the 2016 Macbook pro where
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:28.500]   They think they think this is great, but maybe you don't think it's great at all
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:35.540]   I think that if if apple could do one thing to really really get me excited about how they're thinking has changed
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:39.860]   It's if they really did come up with something like an updated cheese grater that we made something
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.860]   We made something boring but absolutely practical and useful
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:51.780]   I was talking I'll never forget something that an aerospace engineer told me about airplane design where I was talking about that bert rittans
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.660]   Really and really cool
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:22:00.820]   Like alternative like sort of off center designs for for aircraft. I said how come like every how come like there is no
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.380]   A lot more creativity like that and he said well
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.460]   We are creative people as engineers
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:12.020]   The problem is that we also are good historians and we know that every time someone has built something that does not look like every airplane
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.860]   That's ever been built that crashes. So that's why we don't build them that way
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.580]   That's why we keep building of the way that everyone else builds them
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:24.740]   And if everybody else is building the the high power machines being these are boxes with straight corners
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:30.980]   And good cooling systems and lots of empty room empty space in there so you can put things in and take them out
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.940]   One of the reasons that could be is because people aren't as creative
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.260]   Creative and interesting as the engineers at apple
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:40.980]   Another reason is that every time someone tries to build a pro computer that is not shaped that way it
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.420]   It crashes and burns like that like the uh, make a road smack
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.940]   And I think that a lot of times for a lot of the pro computer
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.660]   So we have a lot of a lot of Linux boxes
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:55.140]   And we have a lot, you know a couple pc boxes and we have then a couple max
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:23:00.660]   and um, you know that there's a lot of things about them that could be improved dramatically, you know
[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:07.700]   So apple has a lot of places inside of the world of pro because a lot of them are based on let's make it as cheap as possible
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:12.660]   For every component except for what you want and if you're not doing that you're even when you're spending a lot of money
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.660]   I mean we have servers that we're spending
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.740]   Tens of thousands of dollars on and and and even on those ones
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.100]   You're just like really? This is this is the best I get and I get a lot of hardware speed
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:26.660]   But I what I want is you know, if I'm going to be an apple user and I want an apple experience
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.180]   Figure out a way that I can slide these cards in and I will tear the whole thing apart
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:34.900]   Just to just to move something around figure out a way that I can you know, you add ram or change this
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.660]   You know the cpu without it being you know, um, you know, open heart surgery
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.060]   Figure out a way that i've got great ways to slide
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:46.100]   You know what I want into it make it very modular make it very powerful make it and then make it look really cool
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.500]   You know, I mean I have to admit we um
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:53.220]   You know, we have these uh, you guys have the elementals, you know, the elementals have this little front
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.940]   Uh great that that shy brain. It's silly
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:03.780]   I would silly for that but but but I uh, we make a lot of money on that on that front plate because it opens up a conversation
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:04.900]   Oh, what are those?
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.060]   They make a lot of money, you know, people are live streaming for me
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:13.060]   And i'm live streaming for them. So so the uh, you know, so the the point is is that make it make it something that is
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:18.820]   Um, that feels cool when I when I use it, but it's also very modular and i'm going to be able to use it for the next four or five years
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.460]   You know, i'm going to be able to swap out pieces easily
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:25.460]   I'm going to be able to you know, do all of those things and I think that that would get people excited
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:31.860]   What would not get them excited is the is to continue down this minimalist path that got me a mac pro that I don't have a mag safe in
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:35.060]   You know, like like that is, you know, to me like that was the
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.900]   Just the level of insanity, you know, like like just i'm sorry
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.100]   I mean, I know people are fine
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.940]   I'm going to get a hundred comments about the fact that someone makes a little thing that pops into the
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:51.620]   Into my usb still a mag safe, but it's not it's sticking out it will get ripped off, you know, and it'll damage my computer that is unfixable
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:56.020]   You know, and so the you know the the I mean that the one of the single best
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:00.580]   Component that apple ever built was the mag safe and they took it out of it on the new one because they're being minimalist
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.580]   And and what got them in trouble with the the trash can was being minimalist
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:09.220]   Like like, you know, like the thing is is there is there's being minimalist. I get it. That's cool
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:14.740]   But for pro users, we we want to be you know, not we don't want everything everywhere
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:19.060]   But we do want to have be able to put things where we need them to make them actually work
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:23.700]   Now there's one there's some that when you talk about apple apple has these disagreements the way we do and
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:28.580]   Steve jobs at one point came in and dropped an ipad air in front of the mac team and said why can't you do this?
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:33.700]   And they sort of took that as they're marching order and that's where we get the ipad the macbook air from that's where we get the mac book from
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:39.700]   That's where we get a lot of the computing appliance look from is to try to satisfy that Steve jobs in marching order
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:43.060]   But there are people in apple who have very different opinions and sometimes they win those arguments
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:48.260]   And the case in point they announced there's going to be a new apple display to go with the new mac pro in it ships
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.220]   And that was a huge argument too. Some people saying we have iMacs
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.340]   We can't we can't spare the resources to get a new display out
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:59.380]   They've got to all be working on the new iMacs other people saying but you can't do that people need to have apple displays
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.780]   It's what they look at all day and if they're looking at lg that hurts us as a brand and that's a huge argument
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.700]   And one side won that but that's I didn't win it forever. It looks like that decision has been reversed
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:11.540]   And we've seen that happen with ipad pro and we've seen that happen with all sorts of things
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:15.780]   And I think you know, Alex's point there are people who lost those arguments for a long time
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:20.340]   And I think right now apple is looking at him and saying we'll stop wait. Maybe we need to go back down a different path
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.340]   Well, if you were using non-mac and tush
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:29.060]   That's what I was saying one thing I as a pro user would prefer for apple to stop making hardware like
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:34.660]   It was being super clear like I was about to say if you're a pro user at this point just stop
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:39.220]   You mean you don't have time to deal with
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:44.820]   A temp what looks starting to look like a temperamental diva company
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.940]   You gotta get the job done
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:53.700]   The thing is is that what we want as pro users at this point is not the hardware what we want is the software
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:58.180]   We want the os we like our mac os they have you locked in have that they do have you locked in
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:03.620]   But but we you know like we don't care about the hardware like, you know, like at this point
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:10.820]   In fact, we would prefer to have our faster pc hardware, um, which all of our pc hardware is faster than our max
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.780]   Um, we prefer to have that we just don't want to use windows
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.420]   You know and I think that that is the I mean, you know, and it's like
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.300]   At this point use lennox and windows and all kinds of other stuff
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:23.940]   But but I still prefer my mac I still prefer working on on the on the mac os so that's great
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.500]   Um, but but it is like the heart
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:32.740]   It's too small of a market for them to really put the kind of energy that I think is needed to keep us happy
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:36.420]   Um, you know, I think it doesn't make any sense for a domain hardware to be honest with you
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:43.700]   I agree. I don't know if it what what is mac what is the mac and tush if not the ultimate expression of what is possible
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:50.260]   When the engineers who develop the hardware are working with the developers engineers who work on the operating system and to a large extent
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.260]   The engineers who are working on the end user pro applications as well
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.460]   I don't I really want there to be a ability to get
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:03.860]   Uh to buy one macbook and to know that i'm getting the best i can possibly get and also get when this tailor to me
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.860]   I mean, I would love to see i would love to see apple open virtualization
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:13.140]   I think that would be that would be like for his hammer slamming into the ground transforming the
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:19.380]   Company and something that well, okay, if you if you want to if you if you don't like the keyboard on our mac macbook pro
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.540]   That's fine running virtualization. You'll just take a processing hit but you'll be able to get the harbor you want
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:29.620]   You'll get the sports you want you'll get the ethernet port you whole world is moving to containers to docker like containers
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:34.580]   To virtualization anyway, but I don't I guess as a pro user though. I don't want virtualization
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.020]   I want I want something that is we're already using intel chips
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.620]   I just want something that I can install on any intel machine
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.380]   Is it possible there's a tech there prototype for everybody?
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:49.860]   It's possible is it possible there's a technology coming next year that apple's waiting for
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:56.260]   That's certainly possible. I was thinking I was thinking more along the lines of not necessarily a technology
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:01.380]   They're waiting for but a technology they know they're going to be using in three or four years that it would be silly to
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.140]   Totally rev the platform without making sure that's going to be relevant
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.420]   Kind of on a time when your platform revs
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:14.100]   At the beginning of a new cycle of something new. I mean they missed type, you know type c they were early on
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.420]   But they're you know, they don't they're met their pros doesn't have type c so it's like
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:25.300]   Like you mean like a lake or cannon lake or something. Yeah, they're yeah. I'm just wondering is there is there a magic
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:31.140]   It was interesting and by the way, I thank the chat room for this. This is not unprecedented in 2012
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:34.660]   When apple did a minor upgrade to the cheese grater?
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:40.820]   Tim Cook stepped forward he put it up on a facebook group page and said apple is working on something really great
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.300]   For 2013
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:49.620]   They said in effect the same thing. I apologize. We're not doing much. You know a laying. This is the headline
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.060]   Uh
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:56.340]   From apple insider a laying current mac pro's owners fears that the desktop has reached the end of its life
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:02.020]   And they're talking about the cheese grater. Tim said no. No, we got something really great company coming next year
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:06.420]   So this isn't unprecedented in that respect. Well, it's it's a little bit
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:12.020]   It's a little bit different in that they weren't quite so this wasn't we're going to give 90 minutes to five different people
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.020]   Uh, and those people are free to ask lots of inconvenient questions like hey
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:19.620]   I noticed that you didn't see you didn't mention the the mac mini at all or hey
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:25.300]   Are you do you have any twists and touch screens anymore? And hey, how about arm on the mac and you have to at least
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.820]   They were and they responded to those which is great. Yeah, exactly
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:32.420]   I think the Ida had the had the only question about arms. She thought it was the only
[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:39.940]   The other one said that that said that apple has no plans to move or no plans to move mac to uh
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:44.740]   To arm processors. It's a very it was a very very short sentence. I didn't know whether
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:52.820]   I was I wanted to follow up with her to see if he was saying that he was asked this question directly and said directly that we have no plans
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:58.020]   Or if it was we have nothing to announce on that front which in apple terms of my is a very different thing
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:00.580]   Um, so you also categorically
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:04.980]   Denied any touch future for mac os
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:11.380]   Yeah, once again, once again signing citing all the research they did with uh, the with actual developers
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:14.500]   They had a lot of listening sessions over the past year or so
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.940]   Saying that that wasn't even anywhere on the map of what people want
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:27.140]   We're speaking specifically about the about microsoft surface, which let's admittedly is not necessarily a pro machine as we're defining it here
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:32.260]   But uh, they're still very committed to no multi touch saying that hey if you want multi touch
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:36.340]   We're all for people buying a second machine in the form of uh of an ipad pro
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:38.580]   Uh, so that's that's the answer right there
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:43.140]   There are also there are also citing a lot of the other research they had that maybe cut maybe colors
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:47.780]   Why this wasn't internally a big priority for them to keep moving on the app in the mac pro
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:52.020]   matching that the uh, this market for them is in the single digits
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.620]   Uh, and
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.140]   That could be 9.4
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:59.540]   percent, but close to one the tote but the but the tote but the tote but the tote in the i mean
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:06.660]   Uh, technically speaking but the tone of the room as people were saying was that probably closer to one than to say seven
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.980]   So maybe they were maybe they're part
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:13.620]   They're probably being being affected by the idea of it doesn't matter that we don't have another
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:17.700]   A replacement for the cheese grater mac there are very few people buying them anyway and the people who would have bought one
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.220]   Are going to buy an iMac anyway?
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:26.660]   So we we don't feel like we're sniffing anybody really by taking it slow or trying to figure trying to figure out how to make the mac pro work
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.700]   but they also the other things that they got in their research is that
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.420]   Something that I was hit. I've been hitting on for a while
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:37.300]   Which is that sometimes there are pro users who are doing nothing but final cut pro every single day
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:42.260]   But there are also people who have a final cut or have that one app that requires
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:49.140]   That requires a mac pro or a pro level piece of hardware that they only use about once a week or so
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:53.060]   So it's not necessarily there is one tribe of people called mac pro users
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.260]   There are there's a lot of overlap between the general mac population
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.940]   And the hardcore, you know, just thumping
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.660]   He-man he-woman
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.660]   Mac pro users
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:08.420]   They also said what about the mac mini that they're going they are going to keep making them
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:16.020]   They said yeah in response to a direct question again, so I think it was a tech wrench was it who who called out that
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:20.100]   Hey, you haven't mentioned you haven't mentioned about the mac mini and I got and they got they got the
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:24.580]   And they got like the standard apple. We have we have great faith in the mac mini
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:27.780]   We have great things in store for the mac mini, which is okay
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:35.780]   That's and I have great plans for a lot of things for a long time before we found out that you the plan was to say bye
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.500]   Well, that's perfect
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.140]   I'm hoping that what we see is is mac mini is actually getting smaller
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:46.420]   I mean we have a lot of mac minis as well and we use them for all kinds of glue to tie things together
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.020]   We know there were a lot of hard processes with them
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:53.140]   But they we generate scopes and we do all kinds of other stuff with them and they're they're great for that
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:56.260]   Um, you know for us we would like them to you know, obviously
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:00.580]   They don't really for us need to get any faster. They just need to get we would love to see them in a quarter
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.900]   You know quarter one you rather than a half one you
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:06.180]   Some form factor we think that most of that could be done
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.580]   Um, you know in the in the back there
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:11.620]   We're you know a lot of some of the stuff that we're putting together
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:17.140]   We're experimenting with things like intel nooks and stuff like that to do small display stuff because those are not
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:20.580]   The expense is good. They're cheaper, but they're also smaller
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:28.020]   So, uh, you know and I have to say it's worth reading all four or all five articles
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:33.860]   And i'm john did a great job. In fact, uh, probably the first article you should read is it daring fireball
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.540]   um
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.660]   You know and I think apple was surprisingly
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:41.380]   Uh forthcoming in in what they said
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:44.500]   Matthew panzerino's article in the tech crunch
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:49.700]   Uh lance eulon offs article on mashable. There's lance talking to phil shiller and craig
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.260]   Uh faggot fedderie gina freed
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.820]   uh writing for
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:58.900]   Axios now and and and buzzfeed
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.700]   Uh, which is john pachikovsky
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.860]   um, it's interesting because
[00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:08.340]   I don't think eena's particularly associate lance isn't particularly associate with apple or or eena
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.340]   um
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:16.100]   John writes about apple a lot of course john grooper and john pachikovsky both write about apple a lot
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.940]   um
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:23.380]   So but they did have some kind of people who are just more traditional tech journalists than apple journalists
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.340]   Um, they got the word out
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:32.340]   And you know what all will be forgiven right in 28 2018 hard to believe oh again
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:37.380]   They still they still have to deliver in all this remember they deliver right it's it's that let's let's forget
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.500]   Let's not forget that there for years. They've been saying oh, we've got great things in plow
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.100]   We have great things in store. Oh, we got great things planned. It's like, okay, that's that's nice
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:48.180]   But that I think one of the reasons for this little summit was again at this point
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:51.780]   This is like hearing apple say we have great faith in the mac
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:57.540]   We have it's a big part of our future. That's like clicks pops and buzzes to the year of any journals like, okay
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:00.180]   We don't even hear that anymore. Yeah, we are we will go on
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:06.900]   The news the news piece is going to be you have actually shown faith in the mac you have actually moved the mac forward
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:12.740]   And so although we're getting a lot of faith in the terms of promises of specific hardware. Let's also see
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:16.260]   A new version of the finder that is
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:23.540]   Substantially improved from what's happened before not just simply we've taken popular features of ios and move them onto the mac
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:26.580]   Let's see how we can leverage a series so that it works
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:30.580]   More it works better on the desktop on a mac than it does
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:36.580]   It simply has a speech assistant on the mac stuff like that. I really want to say i'm glad to hear i'm glad to hear this
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:44.020]   I'm glad to see them again. This is this is like this is apple is catholic and they just ate a big beef hamburger on friday
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.500]   That's the importance of them doing this
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.900]   This announcement this way so i'm glad to buy that show of
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:57.380]   Acknowledging how important it is that they they actually start to get ahead of this
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:03.780]   But again, let's start to see more excitement more work more visible work on the mac than they have shown in the past three or four or five years
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:09.380]   And I do think that one final interesting thing is that they really didn't bring in a lot of major pras
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:15.300]   They brought in the really specific verticals that were you know, the they felt were important. Yeah, no mozburger
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:20.980]   No, no, no, no, no, no, david pov. No, we're seeing that at bay none of the traditional apple
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:26.580]   Uh, super stars, but actually I think a good a good group of five people ranae
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.580]   No ranae
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.580]   Absolutely. No, jason's we're not too big for that
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:34.740]   I see he's too, you know like that that whole thing like he's he's too big of a fish to have that
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:39.380]   You know, I I but I think it's interesting we're seeing this across a lot of the corporate clients that we have of
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:44.020]   Not really looking forward to the public press and really focusing more and more on online press
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:50.260]   Um in general, uh when they when they think about doing these analysis. Yeah, there was nobody from the times there nobody from the wall street journal there
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.900]   Yeah, that's interesting. It's well again. I think it's
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:58.660]   I think it's mostly because they want to know where the pro users are reading their news from where where it's kind of
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.740]   What's going to do the job of this pr hit?
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:07.380]   This isn't just doing it just because they got a whole bunch of coffee and danish thing to get rid of it's here is the purpose of this summit meeting and that
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:11.460]   The purpose of the summit meeting is to get to the audiences of these five people
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:15.620]   And a lot of it has to do with the good relate personal relationships
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:20.260]   That these writers might have with apple directly and by good relationship
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:25.060]   I don't mean that they just they only write positive things and they're you know, they're there they're behold
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:27.860]   They're they carry water for apple the time. I mean that
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:31.860]   The whoever it is who decided who came up with this list
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:38.420]   Thought of names like well, I I know I know john greeber. We hang out like at these at these events all the time
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.540]   I like him. I trust him. I'm comfortable talking to him
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:45.060]   I know he's not going to ask something stupid like hey while i'm here
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:49.060]   How about those how about that exploding battery pack that that was on that was on
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:53.380]   Reddit three weeks ago on an iphone five like, you know, half a little class
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:56.020]   Don't take your shoes off and put your feet up on the desk
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.260]   You're you know, we know why you're here and we know
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:02.820]   We know we're going to get mutually going to get things done for ourselves and for your readers
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:09.060]   Or is it could be possible that and he's onto something and they were actually moving cafe max to the apple park and had all this danish
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.500]   They had to get rid of
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:14.660]   Well, actually any aesons is something for sure with the with a point that this is a pr
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:18.260]   Event. Oh, obviously. Yeah, this is not a product
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:23.780]   You know and and and phil shall i even said you see all those black cloths because they were meeting in the in the product design lab with the
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:29.140]   All the cnc machines in the and he said then there are so many of them were covered with black cloths
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.700]   And he said don't don't expect us to unveil anything today
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:35.060]   That's not right because they could have had them at the media briefing center
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:38.660]   There's no difference if you're not going to show them products or conference room or they're
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:43.620]   Again, so okay, so what's the semiotics of having them in the design center? It's cool because
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:51.060]   I mean, oh, there's also a message like there's also a message. We're hard at work here. We're working. Yeah, yeah
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:56.500]   Yeah, they again it puts the entire thing in context that this is not we can't just simply order parts out of out of
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.540]   Of the snap-on tools catalog and assemble them and ship them out
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:02.660]   We do have to do design the the lobby of this building according to this
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:05.380]   According to this was has like just handmade
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:11.140]   Shell prototypes going all the way back to the performance series when yeah, rene's right they could have just had it in a conference room
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:16.900]   Just as easily it's all about keeping this message very very clean and very very pure and it's nothing that
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:21.060]   That other companies don't do i've i've had i've had
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:26.180]   Meetings with ceos where i'm very very aware that i didn't
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:31.700]   We're we're it's like i'm not gonna be in a comfy chair or i'm gonna be like in a bench
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:38.820]   Where like there's all kinds of trees in the gardens and where we can have part of the conversation about how well like take a look at that bamboo tree over there
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:43.860]   It's like that that's a good that's a good metaphor for the sort of casing that we our philosophy about
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:48.900]   About di design like okay, so that's why i'm sitting on a hard-wind bench
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:56.260]   With a little table between us from my from my recorder and we're not in a nice conference room where i don't have to like button up my overcoat
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:00.420]   Uh, all right, so if you're a hard-headed
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.780]   Pro user
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:11.060]   Not swayed by events like this but really trying to decide what your budget for 2017 and 2018 is going to be you've got jobs to do
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:17.940]   Do you say you don't this is not this is not the information that's going to change anything is it?
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:26.980]   Well, I I think that first it depends on how deep someone is in the in the os 10 or you know like it depends on how deep they are in
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:31.620]   In the process so so they've got a lot of apps that they're comfortable using that are not available on the pc
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:34.180]   I think you know if they're using final cut they're
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:37.300]   Going to try to hang out for a year if they're using premiere, maybe not
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:40.820]   Um, they are going to uh, you know, make decisions
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:47.220]   I know a lot of folks that are buying a pc a lot of pros are buying a pc to sit next to their mac as they try to figure out
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:51.780]   You know whether it makes sense get comfortable with windows platform because a lot of it's just comfort
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:55.140]   Of the windows platform. Uh, is it something that they
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:42:01.540]   Can do trying to do as much work as they can do on it. So I think that this year is definitely for a lot of pros a
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:04.260]   You know, they're going to keep on dating
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:09.380]   Dating other girls, um and you know, they're not sure if this is this relationship is going to work or not
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:13.940]   I think that they're gonna they may uh hold out before they start buying tens or
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:19.380]   20s of computers for uh to roll out until apple does something to 2018
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:23.700]   Risk a lot of testing a loss of confidence because apple's in effect admitted
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:28.020]   That that they bet on this trash can for uh, well, we kind of already knew it
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:31.380]   But they admitted it that they bet on this trash can and weren't able to upgrade it
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:33.460]   They made a horrible design decision
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:39.220]   Um, and well, I think that's a strike against you if you're thinking I think the macbook pro really turned a lot of people off as well
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:40.820]   Yes, they just really
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:42.820]   With the the long delay
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:45.140]   Combined with the backlash from macbook pro
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:51.780]   Um, I think put them in a put puts them in a box where they could lose a lot of uh pro users very very quickly
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:57.380]   And I think that if they don't knock it out of the park in 2018, I think you're gonna that's it's over
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:02.420]   Like a lot of a lot of pro users are using cross-platform apps at this point apple doesn't have a
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:05.540]   Yeah, much of a native advantage in that regard
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:11.540]   A lot of it is the pro's comfort with the with the mac, you know, they they like using the mac
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:16.260]   They like that, you know that a lot of us have used a mac, you know for 20 years, you know, 25
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.700]   Yeah, that's loyalty, but that's not necessarily for a technical reason
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:24.340]   You know when we moved our editors to windows it didn't really change that much because they they live in premiere
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:30.020]   They're not yeah, they're not using windows. They're like, and i know loyalty is so precarious
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:35.380]   I mean my most two my two most important apps or okay three most important apps would be chrome
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.180]   Which is my chosen chosen browser
[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:42.500]   Okay, we're checking this anywhere though and they canceled when they canceled aperture
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.780]   I switched to adobe lightroom and and that's multi platform
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:51.860]   And of course skrivener my favorite word processor which after a year or two they made multi platforming made into windows
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:54.020]   so now it really is
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:44:03.140]   If apple if if apple if apple ever created a new mac that was so totally out of alignment with what i need for hardware
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:09.460]   It would not be difficult for me to switch platforms and it wouldn't be a violent, you know, I said good day, sir slam
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:12.420]   It would be okay. Well as it's another two years
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:16.580]   I've got another two thousand dollars to spend on a new laptop because my one is the is my old one
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:23.380]   Which one do i buy and now instead of I can really I can really expand my focus beyond the mac platform inside
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:27.300]   If I need a machine that will just run these three key apps really really well
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:32.820]   What can I get for two thousand dollars and what's going to do that do the job as best as best as best that I can
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:36.100]   It might not be a mac. I'm just saying that I think that
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:44.100]   Even five years ago when we weren't asking these questions about the mac it's always a good idea if you're spending more than 13
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:49.700]   Dollars on anything to this is a good chance to ask yourself. Do I really need a if my next phone?
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:54.180]   Every time I buy a new phone. It's like do I really want to buy my next phone to be an android?
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:59.780]   What has what has been happening in ios since I switched that that I would really really let get my hands on
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:04.980]   Similarly the fact that i've been buying portable mac since i've been buying portable computers of any kind
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:09.140]   Does it mean that every single two or three years that i'm in the market for new one?
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:13.300]   I don't at least take a look at what else is out there because I don't I can't just
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:18.340]   My money is not disposable. I got to spend two thousand bucks on something that's going to make me a lot of money
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.900]   Over the two or three years are going to be using it
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:25.300]   It's it's going to be the thing i'm going to be staring at like eight to 12 to 14 hours a day
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.140]   So it has to be absolutely right
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:34.740]   So if apple thinks that I that if apples attitude is that we can just sort of predict where people will want to go in three years
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:38.340]   And hope that they follow us to this new beacon. We're going to plant in the future
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:41.780]   I just hope that they realize that that's not always going to work for them
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:45.540]   And I and I think that there but I think that there are especially video professionals
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:47.860]   I think the high-end professionals have already moved to
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:48.820]   Linux or windows
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:52.900]   And I think that one of the things that has made this much more complicated is apple could ride on this for a while because
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:54.740]   Microsoft
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.900]   Was kind of rudderless for quite some time
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:04.020]   I think that the upgrade that that Microsoft have made to their hardware to their software has made this much more complicated
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:05.460]   because
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.060]   Because it's actually
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:11.060]   Steve after after he was pushed out at apple was furious
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:15.700]   With the way apple was running at the company said I gave them a 10-year lead
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:21.700]   With mac OS in 1984 and they frittered it away and he felt he told me
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.660]   That uh by 10 years later
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.940]   By 1994 that microsoft had caught up
[00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:31.940]   And apple had frittered its lead away. I wonder what he'd be saying today
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:39.380]   I do think that microsoft spent a lot of time looking for its car keys and they found the keys about three four years ago
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:41.700]   And you can't I agree
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.740]   Well window again windows
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:47.460]   And they have fun
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:49.940]   They have still fumbled a few things if the forest upgrade
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:56.740]   Uh, you know, there are a lot of people who had their windows 10 systems broken by the anniversary update last july
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:01.140]   We're going to see in a week or two a big update to windows 10 that will break many more people's
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:08.100]   Workflows and machines and software and hardware. Uh, so it's not it's not a paradise over there by any means
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:13.380]   Right, um, but but people but if people especially the old old timers like us
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:16.660]   I mean, I I was I've been there since
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:21.060]   The first uh, since the first rollout of the first mac since being that little kid
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:26.260]   My face pressed against the with the shop window watching the watching the old time candy maker
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:30.980]   Make it pour out the molds and make it in fresh trays of mac and tauch 128s
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.060]   And thinking oh if only I could have one of those
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:37.300]   And so it's hard to get it's your sort of culturally programmed to think that oh, yes
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:42.420]   But those the pcs are just terrible and they're terrible hardware and the op the software sucks
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:48.100]   It's unreliable and you can't run it for 10 seconds without getting infected with all kinds of malware and and spyware
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:51.460]   It's like no actually it's very very modern and my windows
[00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:54.500]   I have a couple of windows 10 machines in the office and in many
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:59.940]   It's not as it's not as if the mac mac OS on the desktop is harder to use
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:02.020]   It's just that in many ways
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:09.220]   Windows has made things easier windows 10 again, particularly I use I use cortana a lot more than I use
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.220]   Siri on the mac
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:14.900]   Similarly because i'm just not in a if i have i'm not in a
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:18.900]   Hold a button down speak something and get something spoken back to me
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:23.940]   I'm really on a if I can just type something very very quickly and not have not have to switch modes
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:26.900]   Just that simple thing and the way that cortana
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:33.780]   I think is a lot smarter about how to be a personal assistant on the desktop versus being a personal assistant on a mobile device
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:39.060]   Things like that. So like i'm saying, it's it's worth taking a look at i'm not saying that you're you will switch
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.380]   I'm saying that you will at least
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:46.260]   You will probably remain a mac user, but you will understand where you would like the mac to go
[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:50.900]   Just by seeing how another company who is very very talented and also has a very clear picture
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:54.580]   What they want to do has gone with this idea of desktop computing
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.580]   I
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:01.140]   Final thought Renee and then all i will take a break and come back with more
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:06.100]   No, i'm super glad that apple decided to do this. I think that you know, you know in a perfect world
[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:09.540]   They would have changed course and updated the mac pro a couple of years ago
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:13.300]   You know, they would have seen that the open cl and the double graphics card wasn't the future
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:17.860]   And they would have adjusted much more quickly but given their priorities given the market size given all sorts of factors
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:21.940]   You know, they sort of let it they procrastinated their way into a much much bigger problem
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:24.660]   They needed to and if they could have shipped now it would have been great
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:27.620]   But they can't so they really had to get ahead of this because of the narratives that Andy and
[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:30.660]   Alex talked about so so eloquently so
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:33.380]   Well, they just said it's not shipping this year
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:36.260]   We don't have a firm deadline that is shipping next to we don't know when we're gonna see it
[00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:39.540]   So we're taking it as an act of faith that it's coming next year and apple's gonna have to
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:41.460]   I think we're at the point now that we
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:44.260]   Apple's gonna have to return some of that faith, especially to the pro market
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:47.460]   you know
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:53.780]   I mentioned that the warring factions within an apple and I'm wondering it's a healthy discussion like healthy discussion
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.740]   No, it is it's very much like they've been together so long
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:02.100]   It's like eddy telling steve has to put itunes on windows and steve finally listening or say we have to make a small tablet
[00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:06.100]   It's an argument and you know, those are not easy people to argue with let alone win with
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:10.340]   But once in a while some of those arguments lead to the best things like itunes on windows
[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:12.820]   I do feel like though that
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:18.980]   the the kind of existential argument that's going on right now at apple is whether they should abandon
[00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:21.220]   Mac OS
[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:26.100]   They make you know, I actually we're gonna address this in the next segment because uh
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.820]   Neil cybert wrote a very interesting piece
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:31.860]   on above avelon where he talks about mac
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:35.220]   sales ipad sales and
[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:41.140]   And and draws a conclusion that I think is not too far off. I am sure that they're within apple
[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:48.740]   There are at least two parties one that says it's time to get out of computing or get out of desktop computing get out of mac
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:49.860]   OS
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:52.980]   And then there's the other and you know, maybe it's greg and and phil and
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:56.500]   And those guys who say no, no, we can't that's our heritage
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:00.180]   I reminded though that apple had a massive
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:04.340]   Convention a massive event called apple two forever
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:08.100]   After the mac came out shortly before they killed the apple two
[00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:12.500]   Right with that with that jaunty theme song no less
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:15.940]   It's always worth pointing out forever
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:18.900]   Bringing the always worth pointing out sort of two things
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:21.860]   Two forever
[00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:29.380]   Is that real is that was there really a song there was apple two forever? It's on my phil and dave's excellent cd
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:32.100]   The uh, velcro cd
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:33.060]   Wow
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:37.860]   I'm betting that before the commercial break is over somebody can find that on a team somewhere right
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.420]   Now
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:41.940]   Go ahead. I'm sorry rene keep it
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:48.180]   It's worth pointing out that apple is a company that for a very long time only had one business and then two businesses and trying to run five or six businesses
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:51.860]   In a structure in a in a functional organization like apples means that you're always
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:56.820]   Prioritizing one product over another even you know at different scales in different times
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:52:01.860]   But you have to get out iPhones you just have to get at iPhones and you want to get at ipads because they sell so well
[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:04.500]   And all these products the guy pad might be doomed and going nowhere
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:10.100]   But it's selling tens of millions of units and mac might not be a huge business for them compared to iphone
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:15.380]   But it's it's a billions and billions of dollars of business any other company would give their right to executives to have these businesses
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:21.060]   So i don't i think like you can make a bean count argument saying it's only 1% of our business and we should get out of it
[00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:26.980]   But that's in comparison to iphone and you cannot compare anything to iphone at mac is still a huge business for apple
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:29.060]   yeah
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:33.540]   All right, let's take a break andi and an echo rene richy and alex lindsey and
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:36.340]   of course
[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:38.660]   the apple too
[00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:40.980]   forever
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:04.100]   I want you to imagine somebody in the colorful leotard way to one book rippings on the string on the stage
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.060]   This is an official video from apple
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:13.060]   Now the flash day is hard
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:23.940]   I'm not ready
[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:26.260]   Every day
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:36.180]   And i sound like pimp arms
[00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:39.540]   It's a fake it's a cheap kim pucks
[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:48.260]   Nice to san francisco skyline of the rainbow and the big apple too forever conference
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:55.140]   in the mid 80s
[00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:58.660]   And it sounds every bit of it
[00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:05.620]   Oh it goes on and on the ending is just incredible
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:10.180]   Some guy with an apple like an apple to eat
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:14.740]   Like a piece of a separate song there's a good might be a song called leading the way
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:17.780]   Oh, i remember leading the way as he gets a separate stance like
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:21.620]   You can imagine the part of the presentation with her
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:25.700]   Brovick people are smelling out apple and egg
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:36.740]   Almost as good as the female song
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:40.340]   Who would star in this sitcom?
[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:48.660]   And I thought Andy was choking
[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:51.380]   No
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:54.900]   A win just a does not joke
[00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:59.780]   Oh it goes on there's more
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:09.380]   Now the question is how long this goes how long after those that they killed with product
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:14.100]   You know that's a good question somebody should do some research because it was shortly after this
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:16.900]   You saw in this video they have max
[00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:24.420]   It was shortly after this I after the convention apple too forever convention, which I think it was in 1984
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:29.860]   That was like it was 19 April 12 or April 24th, 19
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:33.300]   Yeah, that sounds right so it's actually
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:37.940]   This month is the
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:40.660]   Gotta do my math
[00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:44.580]   30
[00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:46.580]   First anniversary
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:50.660]   The apple too
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:52.660]   Now we're in a starfield for
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:57.380]   Well, I guess technically the apple to the apple to e car
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:00.260]   Looks like it was 1993
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:06.260]   Oh, that's right. They kept making them for a while didn't they? Yeah, I mean I had I had I had some what would be considered
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:09.060]   November 93 was the apple to e was discontinued
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:12.180]   and then remember they did made the two ci and
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.540]   Yeah, right
[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:21.780]   This was actually when the two c came out they had the apple to forever so forever, you know eight years

[00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:32.260]   No, no
[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:34.820]   Okay, just two hours
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:40.420]   Actually, we've been doing this. This is our 553 episode. We've been doing it for uh almost
[00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:43.620]   Almost 12 years
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:46.020]   It feels like forever a long time. I've been doing
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:51.940]   We passed hello dolly and then if we get from another 10 10 showings that we will pass uh the original run
[00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:55.220]   Of chorus line you're keeping track of this, huh?
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:59:01.460]   We're never gonna get we're never gonna surpass laymiz. I don't know how the new revival of cats figures in but we're up there
[00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:05.380]   the very first mac break weekly was august 12 2006
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:11.940]   And this was the one where we were I think at the first was this where we were this was after ww dc
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:18.180]   And of course, Alex you started it earlier. You were doing the video version of mac break. We were doing mac break
[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:21.540]   Yeah, we started mac break earlier that year. I think in in january
[00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:27.780]   Where we did remember we ran around with uh with emry and it was so fun and and brende bire
[00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:33.220]   and brende bire was shooting and um and so we did that for we did that at then we
[00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:40.180]   The same week we recorded like 22 episodes and then we uh of uh, I think it was 15 or 20
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:42.020]   Maybe a 15 or 20 episodes
[00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:47.700]   And of the mac break video and and then we couldn't figure out how to actually create a show out of it because it was ten
[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:53.300]   NDP and none of the computers were fast enough. So then I had to do I think the second episode was like the road to ten
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:56.420]   NDP, which is still the most popular mac break video ever
[00:59:56.420 --> 01:00:02.260]   Not not mac break weekly but mac break video because it's like it had like two million downloads and so um
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:04.180]   the uh
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.980]   But it was just me drawing over something to try to save time
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:10.660]   Or to stall like apple like it was just stalling
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:14.740]   And then we finally got some of the product out and then after that once we did the video for a while we were like
[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:18.260]   Videos hard and so then we started talking about doing the first episode
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:21.700]   A laughably short 51 minutes
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:24.100]   It was audio only
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:28.900]   David pogue amber macarthur chris breen and a guy named Alex lindsey were on the yetche
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:32.740]   Those were the days my friends in fact
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:33.700]   Oh it was worth that day
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:36.980]   You know what we were talking about a look at leopard and the new mac pro
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:41.860]   Wow, it's always a new mac pro le pot
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:47.380]   So interesting you said something interesting and then I think the convention ran a the conventional wisdom is that the ipad
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:51.460]   You know is dwindling and if you look at total ipad sales
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:56.660]   And this is from neil cybarts blog above avalon, which is often a really good resource for this kind of stuff
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:01.700]   Uh based on company reports this you know, it's a mountain and we're on the downhill slope
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:05.620]   Of the mountain, but he makes a really interesting point, but it's a mountain
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.420]   Well, it is a mountain right it's still a large mountain
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:11.940]   Uh, you know, we're we're well over 40 million unit sales
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.940]   for the ipad
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:18.020]   Uh all told this is the red line at the top is the iphone
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:20.420]   Which has had a little dip of course
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:24.740]   The blue is the mountain of ipads and the and the gray is mac
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:30.340]   Which is relatively flat. I mean and of course mac is a lot more expensive unit cost
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:35.780]   So you you know, you can't really but here's his interesting point which I I hadn't really thought about
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:39.700]   He says it's not the ipad that's
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:45.460]   Kind of going down. It's the ipad mini that's dragging the ipad down
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:51.460]   He says ipad mini sales weakness has masked stronger sales trends for larger ipads
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:54.900]   And what will come as a surprise to many the ipad air too
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:57.460]   Has been the best selling ipad to date
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:02.900]   In addition more than half the people buying an ipad air too were new to ipad
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:08.100]   So if you take the mini out, it's a very different kind of picture
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:12.820]   And that makes sense in fact it confirms what a lot of people including myself had to theorize
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:18.020]   That the as the iphone got bigger people didn't feel the need for an intermediate sized
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:20.180]   device
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:22.820]   and the mini really suffered as a result but
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.220]   ipads
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:27.060]   Larger ipads still are selling
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:33.860]   A quiet pad too and then for a very short time ipad mini and then ipad air too in terms of popularity and then
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:39.300]   With this new 9.7 inch starting at $329
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:44.580]   Suddenly, i have apple i think i think we'll we'll see in the next you know quarterly results
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:47.620]   But i think apple now has a very compelling
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:52.980]   A story to tell and i think a lot of people who said i'm not going to buy a 500 dollar ipad
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:03:02.100]   Will look twice at a 329 dollar ipad people are not as sensitive to the speeds or to the laminated screen as we might be
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:08.340]   Yeah, you have to there's a dollar proposition, but also at this is clearly a pitch towards enterprise
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:10.340]   Um, but they they've lost
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:16.900]   Well, they've lost that they're you know, they lost i don't think that i don't think they think that they i don't think they look at the numbers
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:19.460]   I think that we can regain this or this market back
[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:23.620]   but they can definitely make make it back in enterprise because
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:26.900]   iOS devices that have so many problems with
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:33.620]   Being suitable for when a lot of people want to use in school a lot of administrators want to use in schools
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:39.140]   Have kind of like the reverse advantages in enterprise where this is a dummy proof machine
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:42.740]   You could even give it to a vice president and he or she cannot screw the damn thing up
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:47.460]   Uh, they cannot you can you can they just have to make sure that it's scriptable. That's automatable
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:50.900]   Hey, look look listen to their uh, they're most recent acquisition
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:54.900]   They tooled that will let you uh automate a lot of stuff on iOS very very easily
[01:03:55.620 --> 01:04:01.940]   And at $329 that's suddenly a lot more attractive than the baseline $500 machines used to be so
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:05.780]   the uh, so neil continues hell of a deal. Yeah
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:08.500]   neil continues on uh
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:14.820]   To point out that for instance apple has really launched a massive marketing campaign for ipad
[01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:20.260]   As a pc replacement, right? That's what all those twitter ipad ads are and all that
[01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:25.540]   Uh, he says ultimately management has two app options for the mac and this is this is what we're talking
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:27.460]   About before the break and I don't disagree
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:33.060]   This is for the mac and but he does point out the the mac brings in 23 billion dollars of revenue a year
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:36.980]   Which is four billion more than the ipad because of course mac's cost a lot more
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:40.660]   Uh apple can either double down on the mac
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:46.580]   He says from the product perspective. There's a clear path forward with the laptop and desktop form factors at apple
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:51.380]   The company could continue bringing elements of mobile to the mac as they have done. They did with sierra
[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:54.980]   Apple can control more of the core technologies powering the mac
[01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:59.620]   And this would include bringing a version of iOS to the laptop and desktop form factors
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:04.340]   This effort would take years to accomplish and utilize a significant amount of resources or
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:10.660]   And I guarantee you these are the discussions that apple's having right now in the boardroom and and elsewhere
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:13.380]   move beyond the mac
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:16.820]   This option would begin with more sporadic updates to the mac line
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:24.420]   And then eventually lead to apple playing paying less and less attention on to the category as other products game priority and resources
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:26.660]   apple would still sell macs
[01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:30.660]   But it would become clear the company's focus is on newer products designed to handle the tasks
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:36.100]   Currently given to the mac we talked about this uh months ago with ben tomsen's uh, stratecary article
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:40.180]   Management faces a difficult choice between the two options the mac is selling very well
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:42.340]   But
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:48.340]   Neil says I think the apple that apple is pushing larger screen ipads because management is determined to move beyond
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:51.700]   The mac apple now thinks this is the time to raise awareness
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:54.260]   that the ipad is a legitimate pc
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:57.460]   alternative
[01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:04.340]   And he does point out everybody's saying, you know, uh, you know, we love the mac. We love the mac. We're gonna make new macs, etc, etc
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:07.220]   I had a super fun. We definitely have people in our company. We've
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:10.260]   Go ahead to rene and then and then alix go ahead rene
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:14.340]   I had a super fun experience this weekend where both my god kids decided they wanted to be bloggers
[01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:17.540]   But I only had one mac with me so the elder started working on the mac and the youngest
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:21.460]   Fun sex I gave him the ipad and he's like I can't do anything. This is crap
[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:24.660]   I'm exaggerating but then I showed him split view
[01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:26.740]   I put the browser on one side and the notes thing on the other side
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:32.580]   And he was like this is amazing and he started working better than the other one who was trying to navigate multiple windows and moving back and forth and getting lost sometimes
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:35.060]   Uh, and it's it's sort of
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:40.020]   Almost like the inverse I think of what niel is saying is not that apple needs to move beyond them or wants to push us beyond the mac
[01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:43.540]   But there's a realization that in terms of how markets go we have this huge embedded
[01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:49.540]   Traditional computer base, but kids these days are being born into a world that is touch first that is mobile first that has access to
[01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:54.980]   Technology that simply weren't available when the traditional computing market started and that if apple doesn't move
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:07:02.420]   More towards ipad the mac business will evaporate the way the ipod business did one day and they'll be left sort of standing around and staring
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:05.220]   And not very good at not being left standing around staring
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:11.940]   He's not he's not saying that the mac is dead by any means but he is saying that the what he's really saying is the ipad is far from dead
[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:16.340]   You know, I mean a lot of people looking at the dwindling sales of the ipad think that that category has
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:20.660]   The next billion computer owners won't be buying traditional computers exactly. He says
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:26.340]   He says you're gonna have a hunt there that are a hundred million people still using older ipads
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:30.740]   ipad one two three ipad four and ipad many that's his estimate
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.300]   Uh, that that's that's a lot of people
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:38.820]   I think the big the big challenge that they have is not so much that that the there's less people wanting an ipad
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:43.460]   It is that that the ipad actually for what the developers are pushing
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:46.020]   Or what they're developing for the ipad
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:51.620]   It's very hard to see oftentimes a reason to upgrade. I had my ipad one died
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:56.500]   About six months ago. Um, you know, this play did something, you know went sideways
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:08:02.180]   Um, but until then my my kids they didn't care which one they have and they don't they don't have any
[01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:06.820]   Uh, you know real sense of oh, this is a newer one or an older one or whatever
[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:08.820]   I mean, they you know, and they they just kind of use whatever
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:11.060]   I think real users don't notice the speed difference
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:15.300]   But I do think developers have led apple down by not developing more productivity apps
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:18.500]   For the ipad
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:22.900]   I don't know if that's true. I I I have a glorious experience on my ipad pro
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:28.260]   And I've I have been thinking about windows surf windows, excuse me
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:30.740]   surface tablet and
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:35.220]   It's great in desktop mode. It's not as great as the ipad in in
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:39.060]   Tablets style mode. I have the exact same experience that rene's
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:40.500]   a
[01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:44.740]   Young wards head which is there times where I could just get a lot more done by simply
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:50.340]   But a lot more done on my ipad than on my mac book by simply by virtue of the fact of saying look
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:52.420]   I don't need 11 million apps
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:55.300]   I need the document app that i'm writing a
[01:08:55.300 --> 01:09:01.860]   Outline or a document on I need another tile that simply has the google search app so I can do fact checking and stuff like that
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:06.740]   I don't and just give me that level of focus if the mac had that level of
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:12.340]   Adaptability towards here is here's the task. I want you to be the best machine possible at
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:16.180]   Not 11 million things, but this one thing that I want you to do right now
[01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:21.220]   That would be the that would be the game changer for me and even windows is not quite as good as that
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:25.140]   Although I think it's better than the mac OS at understanding the different the fluidity
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:29.700]   I will say though that I'm kind of worried that I I get the vibe
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:33.540]   Not from inside information not from any context
[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:38.020]   I'm getting the impression that apple really bet wrong
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:45.460]   By making a touch and either or proposition either you have the touch device or you have the desktop device and nair should
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:49.540]   Latoin meet that makes it as rene said it is it is true that the first
[01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:55.620]   Just as the first experience that I had with the computer was through a keyboard and the next generation their first experience was the remouse
[01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:59.060]   The first experience the kids are having these days are through a piece of glass
[01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:04.260]   And it's very very easy for a windows user to sort of transition between
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:08.980]   Using their iPhone using their Android device and using their desktop machine
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:16.660]   If they have the ability to simply reach out and touch the screen when it's appropriate to do so apple has absolutely zero ability to do that
[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:20.500]   So I think that they bet they bet the wrong horse on this one and
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:23.220]   A lot of I see I see a lot of well
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:29.460]   Let's see if we can sort of give people multi-touch without actually giving people multi-touch and a lot of the hardware that I'm seeing now
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:35.220]   Well, and I think that one of the things that that uh, you know, I think that apple gets into is the idea that people are going to use touch all the time
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:36.500]   That's not what I want
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:37.460]   Uh, you know touch it
[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:38.980]   You know having touch all the time is not the issue
[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:44.260]   It's like when I want to mark a photo up or you know someone sends me an image or someone sends me a document and I want to mark it up
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:46.580]   I'm more likely to open it on my on my iPad
[01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:52.180]   Because I can sit there and just pop up in the pen and sit there and circle things and draw on them and and send it back to them really quickly
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:54.900]   You know and and that's something I can't do on my Mac
[01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:57.860]   And so I have a productivity machine that I can't be productive on
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:01.860]   You know and it's not that I want the reason I'm still using my Mac is I don't want to use touch for everything
[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:05.140]   I don't I'm fine with I just want to have the ability to do it
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:08.260]   Which it you know really works much more seamlessly on a windows environment
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:15.220]   quite I think there's a question is that they will all those hundred million iPad users buy another iPad
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:18.980]   When the battery dies or whatever and I think so, right?
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:22.340]   I think what they will if they do something significant to it
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:24.340]   I mean if they if they do something
[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:31.700]   At some point it may not be a price is significant for a lot of people like for some people the absolute most important feature for them
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:33.860]   Is price yeah, they're not gonna buy a win
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:39.460]   But when the battery stops working or many of these iPads are 32 bit and all of a sudden apps
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.380]   Stop working
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.700]   They're gonna probably they don't get operating system updates
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:48.180]   So a lot of people in my family have older iPads my mom moved to an iPad pro because she's an artist
[01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:52.420]   And she loved the idea of pencil but a lot of people look at it and say 600 bucks starting price point
[01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:59.060]   That's just too much for it and now a lot of them who had iPad 2 iPad 3 4 iPad air 1 are looking at the new iPad exactly
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:03.700]   29 and that's that that's a huge incentive because they will get the OS updates
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:10.820]   They will get all the fancy new apps and I think it's just one thing where I don't know that apple bet wrong so much as they were a victim of success
[01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:15.620]   Microsoft had no successful mobile operating system if windows phone it sold gangbusters
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:18.420]   And if they decided to make windows phone the surface operating system
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:22.900]   We could be looking at a very different reality now, but windows phone didn't Microsoft had very little choice
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:27.300]   But to add touch to windows because the touch operating system didn't work where apple had the other problem
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:32.180]   iOS is one of the most popular operating systems on the planet and to go back and spend time retrofitting macOS
[01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:38.580]   Rather than just keeping improving iOS to the point where maybe eventually an arm macbook runs iOS instead of macOS
[01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:42.500]   It's hard to devote resources between two two products as opposed to one
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.980]   Here's an interesting product
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:49.540]   Product lines. I think I think they could have done that and I don't think knowing from knowing my microsoft history
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:53.380]   I don't think it was quite as back into corners that although you are
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:13:00.260]   Although it's it's I think that we have a sort of reversal of roles here where apple has often
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:07.940]   benefited from the ability to look at how bad first the iPhone was such a success partly because they could look at all the problems of the
[01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:11.860]   Blackberry they could look at all the problems limitations of windows phone devices
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:15.780]   I'm talking about the previous windows phone devices and no key is things like that and say great
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:19.300]   So we know what people want to use these for now. Let's build a way of doing that
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:21.380]   That's much much better than what they have now
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:24.740]   Microsoft sort of was able to do that in reverse being hey people
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:28.180]   We not only have their been netbooks, but now there have been
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:33.940]   iPads we know the people like them. We know what people are using them for now. Let's create a new version of windows
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:36.500]   That allows people to that basically let
[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:39.140]   Let people use an iPad
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:46.820]   But in more fluent ways and my and windows have microsoft has always had the advantage of they don't have to throw everybody out
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:49.300]   With a with a brand new update right now
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:54.500]   The usages split between windows 10 and windows 7 not because people are necessary
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:58.900]   Not because windows 10 is necessarily a failure, but because people can very very easily choose
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:02.100]   Well, I don't I don't really have a need to update upgrade to windows 10
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:04.180]   So I'm going to stay with the one platform
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:08.100]   I'm used to the one platform I like which gave windows 10 a couple of years to
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:10.900]   Really find its leg so that by the time someone is
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:15.060]   Looking for a multi touch device. They've got something that's a lot more mature
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:17.380]   It's it's a really interesting conversation though
[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:22.340]   Yeah, and it's a totally interesting dynamic because we come from a world where Microsoft was just everywhere
[01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:30.580]   in enterprise and apple was making enterprise mainstream it was a pc on every desktop and apple was making sort of niche products for creatives and designers and
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:37.140]   Animators and now we're in a place where apple of bio-rachea of ios is everywhere and they've they're you know
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:43.940]   They are the mainstream computing solution for hundreds of millions of people and mikasoft now is focusing on on you know arguably the more
[01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:51.460]   Niche markets like with surface studio and surface creative and it's almost like my whole world is top turvy andy here's something completely from left field
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:58.740]   Samsung this last week announced the samsung galaxy 8 and with it they announced this weird little decks dock thing
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:05.380]   I've ordered both so i'll be playing with them, but what they did which I think was really interesting is they modified android
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:10.580]   To provide a desktop experience and then they went to microsoft
[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:15.780]   And they said microsoft we want to make sure that your android office apps
[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:21.380]   Can be used on the desktop. This is not a touch screen by the way it doesn't support touch on the desktop
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:25.060]   But it does have an hcm i port in a usb port on this little dock and can
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:31.060]   It doesn't come with a samsung keyboard mouse and monitor you can use any keyboard mouse and monitor and
[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:35.780]   It's got windowing it's like it's like an operating system
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:42.260]   Yeah, this this is the sort of stuff i'm talking about window android and the material user interface
[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:49.220]   It's just genius. It's brilliant when you're using it when i'm talking about what samsung is doing with this one product
[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:55.220]   If you i've had android devices where when you dock them the expands into a desktop operating desktop experience
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:59.380]   Even on my phone if I can connect a bluetooth mouse to it use it with a mouse
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:04.340]   And the but the damn thing is when i've had when I have it connected to a full-size monitor
[01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:09.620]   It feels nothing is visually different except for the screen real estate, but it feels like
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:13.860]   I'm the operating system that was optimized for a mouse and a keyboard
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:16.740]   It stops really feeling like a multi touch thing
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:21.300]   And then when I go back to a small a small phone or a mid-sized tablet once again
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:24.900]   It feels like a multi touch sort of multi touch solution
[01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:28.740]   Uh, so I don't know if this solution is going to work. I mean this is one of those things we've seen everybody
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:33.780]   We've seen it before exactly but this is but but i'm saying is what's different here is that samsung went to
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:38.740]   Microsoft and said yeah make these desktop versions when I dock it
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:42.020]   And it's got windowing it's got drag drop. It's got right click
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:49.540]   I think that's really interesting and the fact that microsoft is in a bed with samsung on an android device is fascinating too
[01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:51.620]   And or android
[01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:53.620]   School is doing the same thing they've been there
[01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:57.940]   They're pointing towards a future of android laptops as well and android does tops as well
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:00.820]   So and and also this is also shows microsoft
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:03.700]   Again at some point they they stop looking for they finally
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:07.060]   They finally pulled up pulled up parts enough sofa cushions
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:10.740]   They found their car keys they jumped in and they've been rooming grooming ever since
[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:16.180]   Their strategy with with with with microsoft office to say that we will make it work on whatever device you have in your hand
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:19.780]   And say they don't care that you're not running it on windows. We will make the best
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:22.100]   We will make the best productivity app
[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:24.100]   iOS has ever seen
[01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:27.860]   We will make the best productivity app that an android phone has ever seen
[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:35.300]   If if samsung which is the the apple of android device makers wants to make a desktop dock
[01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:38.340]   They will make a version of office for it because that's their whole plan
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:42.660]   Let's make the best version of office we have on every device that anybody has in their hands
[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:47.940]   That's what I mean about trying to live in a world that is mobile and desktop at the same time
[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:50.980]   Not by saying we're going to try to graft certain
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:56.740]   Features onto one or the other but we are going to try to live in the world that we live in as opposed to
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:02.420]   Try to try to pretend that multi touch that the desktop is the land multi touch is the ocean
[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:07.860]   And unless you're aquaman, you cannot exist on both. We have to have that line of demarcation
[01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:12.020]   It's like no, that that's completely false. We can make something that works in both worlds
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:16.340]   And then look at this it supports virtualization. So if you do want full windows
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:18.500]   Oh, look
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:21.220]   You get it. You got a full windows virtual machine
[01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:23.860]   When I was looking at it on the internet
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:27.860]   That's because by the way, this has a very fast processor, which I'm sure apple could
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:33.300]   Could compete with the snapdragon 835 which is a 10 nanometer very
[01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:36.260]   About twice as fast on single threaded application. So there you go
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:40.900]   Oh, but so and also it's the proof is in the pudding. We'll see what it does with heat
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:44.580]   Yeah, oh, it's got a fan built in it's got a little built in fan
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:48.100]   But let's let's see if it can I was going to talk about the
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:50.820]   So I was at the event the samsung event last week
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:53.780]   I actually got one of the new gear 360 cameras
[01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:56.180]   And when I got home, I was able to connect it to
[01:18:56.180 --> 01:19:00.820]   It shoots 3d video. Excuse me 360 degree video 360 degree stills
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:06.100]   Unfortunately, it's going to be the software is going to be available for iOS when it ships
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:09.860]   Right now the beta software you need to get the photos off of it
[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:14.180]   But only work with samsung devices. So I had to wait till I got home and could go through my drawer of
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:18.180]   Devices to pluck out the latest one that I had that will work with it
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:21.620]   And it's great because hey great now it's taking it's taking the stuff as
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:24.900]   Converting it to like a regular movie file that can put on any device
[01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:29.220]   But oh man was the back of that galaxy s s s 6 getting hot
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:30.660]   And I had at one point
[01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:35.220]   I was I was actually trying to do here are eight videos that I shot and please convert all of them
[01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:40.820]   And at some point it reached not thermal failure, but it said hi things are a little hot right now
[01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:44.260]   I'm just oh, oh lordy. I believe I've gotten myself a vape
[01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:48.340]   I'm just I'm gonna go. I'm gonna wrecking my my fate and couch
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:53.700]   It does that it does that with the gear with the with the visor the 3d visor as well
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:54.420]   Yeah
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:58.420]   And that is a problem and actually it could be a big problem and remember that the snapdragon 810
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:02.340]   Was a cross-the-board failure because of heat problems
[01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:07.940]   In fact companies ended up underclocking it because they just couldn't use it. I hope and he trusts battery life
[01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:12.740]   Yeah, I hope call cause choice of battery hasn't made the same mistake with the 835. I ordered it. We'll see
[01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:15.860]   I'll play with it. I mean, I think it's just interesting. I think it's
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:20.100]   I tried continuum. Yeah, very it's very interesting. No, but it's the same idea right?
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:23.940]   Microsoft offers a little doc for but it's only right now with an HP phone
[01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:30.180]   Uh a rather massive HP phone, but the premise is why do you have to have multiple computers?
[01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:33.780]   You know, why not have one computer that has everything on it
[01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:38.500]   And then just use this and he was so roundly mocked by bloggers
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:43.220]   He said one day there'll be a brain and multiple endpoints and you'll just have yeah pocket devices
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:46.740]   It'll show up on your screen in your car and well, I'm convinced that's the future
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:51.060]   I'm convinced that's the future that you will have something and it won't be wired
[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:55.780]   And it will just you walk up to a screen or a keyboard anywhere and it will recognize you and say
[01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:57.940]   You know, I'm your input device for the moment
[01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:00.980]   I'm sure this is why I was that's good when they changed gears on project titans
[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:05.220]   I think that was bringing the future to us faster than we would have otherwise gotten it the car project
[01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:08.980]   Yeah, well, it was all over the car project now. It's very much a car project
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:11.860]   It was more than that. Oh, interesting
[01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:19.140]   Yeah, I think that I think that one of the advantages Microsoft has is they're really operating like the underdog while they still have the revenue of the
[01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:21.780]   Big dog
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:27.380]   But apples in that position too
[01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:32.180]   You know a lot of people say oh apple is the large you know the most valuable company in the world they're doing fine
[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:34.980]   That's the time that you become the upstart
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:37.700]   When you got that revenue
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:43.380]   Also realized that it's a big world out there. There was a new study some web
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:49.140]   Web marketing service had a study out was at least yesterday or a couple days ago
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:52.980]   Saying that android is now by a certain metric the most popular
[01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:56.900]   Internet operating system on the planet beating out windows beating out ios
[01:21:56.900 --> 01:22:03.380]   In terms of devices that are that are used on the internet not in terms of revenue not in terms of users
[01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:06.260]   But here's how much is transacted on the internet with this
[01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:10.820]   It is ahead by a fraction. It's ahead of windows and
[01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:16.660]   ios is way ahead of android in north america. It's also way ahead of android in europe
[01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:21.060]   But it's a world market. Uh, i'm having i haven't dug into this study yet
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:28.740]   I wanted to ask the the the the the big floating question is do you factor in all those crappy adware apps that keep that
[01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:33.780]   That push all kinds of traffic that the user doesn't know or care about into all of this
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:38.020]   But nonetheless it the that's not a lesson of oh well ios is on its way down
[01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:43.940]   But that it is a big big planet and it's not just the united states that that uses computers
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:46.260]   And so if people if apple
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:50.340]   I don't believe that apple thinks that oh well we're we're on the top of the world
[01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:54.020]   We're making so much money. This cannot possibly the ios is going to is going to be great forever
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:23:00.020]   I'm sure that they're looking at those kind of numbers worldwide and thinking where where have we what parts of the planet?
[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:02.420]   Are we not picking money up off the floor in?
[01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:06.900]   And where where are our vulnerabilities and how can we make sure that the
[01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:13.140]   Uh, the advantages that we have in ios and the advantages we can deliver to users with ios are still going to be relevant five years from now
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:16.100]   By the way rene has published his fifth generation
[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:20.500]   Uh ipad review and calls it the best value in tablets today
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:25.300]   You've got a great image in here that shows the difference between a laminated and non laminated screen
[01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:30.260]   Not that anybody would really care, but you you this is by the way the new i'm more yellow
[01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:35.940]   Uh, you think this is the ipad 5 especially at 329 dollars is a compelling is a very
[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:39.860]   Yeah, it was a very hard review for me because I kept going through and going no the camera is not as good
[01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:45.060]   No, this means not as good. No the processor is not what I want and then I realized you know 329 329 329
[01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:47.060]   329 and it really is an ipad se
[01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:54.180]   Where they took give you a shell they put a new intern is an ipad air original ipad air with the guts from uh, basically a 12
[01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:56.260]   0.9 inch ipad pro
[01:23:56.740 --> 01:24:00.980]   Brain not not not for anything, but if you give me your give me a mailing address
[01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:05.780]   I want to send you either a towel or a big piece of felt because every time you have these reviews
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:08.580]   We have these beautiful things on asphalt and on cobblestone
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:11.300]   I feel so bad
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:14.020]   It's a place them vertically if you place them vertically, they're fine
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:17.780]   And also when I started doing it'll just make me feel better
[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:20.660]   you go actually
[01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:23.780]   There were so many complaints if you scroll down to the the internal section
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:28.420]   Um, I actually have it. Uh, I I used a cover mix of lego bricks
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:32.580]   Clever use of lego bricks to make sure that it wasn't actually touching the
[01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:39.060]   Is floating above the yes, it's a review you to do whatever you want with it. You're hurting all of us
[01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:43.060]   The selection of colors. Hey, at least he doesn't put it in a blender
[01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:48.420]   That's true that what I said. You see the one where they blew up an iphone with 25 pounds of black powder
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:50.740]   Why?
[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:54.420]   I well, especially I can well never mind. I was I hope you wear I pretend
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:58.500]   I'm gonna give you a technical review of why that doesn't make any sense that the first five pounds is all that really matters
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:02.900]   Because the black powder doesn't you know, they were using
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:08.820]   The black powder is the way the way it's gonna burn is it's gonna burn off on the top blow the blow the iphone off and then just burn out the rest of it
[01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:14.660]   Ladies and gentlemen, I think we've learned something about gunpowder here and I think that's very valuable. Then I'm gonna remember it from now on
[01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:18.340]   Well, the first five pounds is all the mess
[01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:24.900]   Well, if you're blowing up an iphone, you know, if you're if you're gonna contain it the whole 25 pounds is is gonna be used to put it inside
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:27.460]   In a situation. Yeah, what they didn't
[01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:32.260]   2f or 4f or 5f, you know, I mean these are all things that are important as far as the speed of burn
[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:35.780]   You know the 2f it looked like it was burning like a 2f not like a 4f
[01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:38.020]   Come over to your house and we can shoot off cannons
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:43.780]   I don't have any cannons. I don't have any black powder anymore. I haven't seen it for a long time
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:44.980]   So that's his story
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:50.340]   Not since I was 18 because it turns out that if you're under 18 and you're blowing stuff up you're precocious
[01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:52.420]   And if you're over 18, you're a felon
[01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:58.420]   I noticed that as well. There was a time when I was 19 or 20 and I realized I was about to do something that I was
[01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:00.740]   Totally a no dealer no brainer
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:07.140]   16 or 17 I realized oh if this gets out of hand, I'm going to jail as opposed to all that's just that
[01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:11.300]   That that I not go kid. He's always getting into some sort of high tech mischief
[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:18.500]   I want a cannon out front that I could set off at 11 a.m. Every day signal the beginning of our broadcast day
[01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:21.140]   Well, you know, I you know, I my my my brother
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:25.460]   My wife and I had it my wife when I was in petaluma, you know, I didn't mow my lawn my front lawn
[01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:27.460]   I remember right by petal it was an ice chair
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:31.140]   My wife was on the boulevard. We drive by it all the time I go. Yep. That's Alex
[01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:35.700]   Well, and my my wife asked why and I said well it's security and she's like how is it security?
[01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:40.500]   I was like where I come from a long lawn in the front means I got a shotgun and I know how to use it
[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:44.900]   And I said, you know, all that stacking up all those cars in the front
[01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:50.740]   That's not that's not people being lazy. That's that's a that's a that's a covert billboard for how many how many guns they have
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:53.860]   And so the and I was like you see a big truck on it
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:56.420]   You know, they've got it. They've got some good licenses back there
[01:26:56.420 --> 01:27:00.020]   And so we were driving home. We were driving to my parents house in some middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania
[01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:05.700]   And um, and we drive by this one. It's got a tractor trailer on a on a on blocks
[01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:09.460]   You know, it's all rusty and everything else out in the front yard, you know, and uh
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:16.180]   And and uh carly carly to said so I so I imagined that they have a cannon and I was like actually they do we rent it all
[01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:20.500]   I see that
[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:23.860]   Just goes to show you how regionalism is different now in the northeast
[01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:29.700]   We would say that we don't want to give somebody a place from which to return a place of cover from which to return fire
[01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:35.140]   You want to clear fire and feel yeah, you don't want to throw away your advantages of the high ground. It's like you give no place
[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:40.660]   And so rene that does explain the strange floating iPad here. This is up on legos
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:44.420]   Yes, I've been doing that for more pictures now because of people like Andy
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:50.020]   No, he's got he's got it stacked in front of samsung galaxy phones
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:54.260]   Just to be no then it'd be on oh, I was watching nci sla
[01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:58.180]   And they said why did they murder that flight attendant the other ones that maybe they bought a samsung phone on
[01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:05.780]   And I thought oh wow that's decidedly mainstream. Wow. Wow. Wow. Yeah. I I for one. I bought the
[01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:08.340]   Samsung galaxy s8 plus
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:13.940]   I for one feels safe enough. Oh totally. Yeah, I mean they can't they can't fact again
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:17.860]   It's the less it's the least likely phone to blow up now in my entire arsenal
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:22.980]   I like that scene from corner to garprey watches a plane crash into the house. He's touring
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:25.060]   They will take this house
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:28.420]   Another plane hitting the same house will be safe here
[01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:35.220]   Our show today brought to you brought to you my fresh books
[01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:36.020]   Oh, man
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:42.660]   Did they save my life back when I was going down to canada going up to canada and uh doing the the show up there in toronto
[01:28:42.660 --> 01:28:47.780]   And I'd have to build them and expenses and and it had to be in canadian dollars
[01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:50.260]   It was just I'd fire up word nixal and make those
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:54.580]   You know invoices in the promise. I wouldn't make them often enough. I put it off
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:58.420]   And I found out if you don't invoice people they don't pay you
[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:04.820]   You know if you use fresh books first of all, it's easy to make professional looking great invoices and you'll get paid
[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:11.220]   On average 11 days faster because not only is it easier for you to make your invoices
[01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:16.420]   It's easier for your clients to pay you they hate paying as they don't nobody likes paying bills or sending bills
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:20.820]   And but make it easy. It all gets done. It eliminates the friction
[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:26.820]   With fresh books payments you can enable your clients to pay you online by credit card. No setup required
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:33.300]   Your customer could pay straight from their invoices. You always know which invoices have been sent viewed
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:35.780]   Yes, you could tell if it's been viewed paid
[01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:38.260]   Which invoices are overdue?
[01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:40.980]   Which are outstanding and how much your outstanding totals are
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:47.700]   In fact, you know your whole financial story right there on the fresh books front page right on the dashboard
[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:51.780]   Including expenses how much you paid how much you owed
[01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:56.180]   You can easily brand those invoices make them look great. You could set up recurring invoices
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:59.540]   Set up auto payment reminders automatic late fees
[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:03.540]   That's one of the reasons you get paid faster. You keep on top of it
[01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:08.580]   And it's easy fresh books time tracking allows you to build for time by client and by project
[01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:10.900]   So you can track your time down to the minute
[01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:13.860]   And even manage team time sheets. That's all in the app
[01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:16.740]   On an iPhone or android or on the desktop
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:23.620]   When it comes time to create an invoice, you'll know what you did when you did it and you will do it in less than 30 seconds
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:28.500]   Oh man, it has saved my life. Now since I started using fresh books that was 2004
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:34.260]   10 million small business owners now use fresh books. It's grown. It is great. It's gotten better and better and better
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:38.260]   Next it's too late for this year's tax season, but next year
[01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:44.900]   You'll ensure a smooth tax season and save 192 hours a year on paperwork. You didn't get in a business
[01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:47.060]   You know to do paperwork

[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:02.500]   I said it was a big news week
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:05.140]   We kind of that one of the big stories of the week is
[01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:08.740]   A press release from imagination technologies
[01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:16.100]   A little british company that apple just like arm, you know arm is a fabulous chip design company also in britain
[01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:18.980]   apple licenses
[01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:24.900]   The arm design and uses it as a foundational technology for their a processors
[01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:31.060]   Um, I didn't know this but they've been doing since 2000 semisys the first I've found they've been doing the same thing for their gpu
[01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:33.940]   with imagination
[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:38.340]   Imagination put out a press release and said we just got a letter from apple saying
[01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:41.220]   They're gonna stop using us
[01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:44.980]   In not right away, but the next two to three years
[01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:47.060]   Uh
[01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:50.820]   They're stock and they're they're publicly created company. So was this a this is a i believe
[01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:53.300]   9 stock drop. Yeah
[01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:58.660]   Uh, they're trying to be proactive imagination also said, uh interestingly
[01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:01.380]   Uh, we don't think apple can do it
[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:04.740]   You know, they say that they you know, they're gonna do clean room
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:08.500]   Design and create their own gpu's that I have nothing to do with ours
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:14.500]   We don't believe it and we're going to the negotiation table because we think apple's gonna continue to owe us
[01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:17.140]   license fees going forward
[01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:22.420]   Might be easier just to pay them regardless. I think I think that's what admonations thinking
[01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:28.100]   Now in order to not pay them they'd have to do a clean room design. I mean this is hard to do apple has hired
[01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:33.940]   A lot of legend you desire. Yeah, yeah, so they have the people who could do it
[01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:38.180]   But I mean you'd have to prove that you did it clean room and that may be hard to do
[01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:41.940]   What's why first of all why did apple say?
[01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:47.380]   We're we're not going to use imagination anymore. Why did they use it in the first place and why are they not using it anymore?
[01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:51.780]   The original iphone used almost off the shell parts like they had sam song
[01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:57.700]   CPUs that used arm and they they got the imagination gpu because that wasn't an area of expertise at some point
[01:32:57.700 --> 01:33:00.260]   Steve job said, you know, just like I want the best sushi chef in the world
[01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:04.580]   I want the best chip people in the world originally to help them pick out chips to use in future iphones
[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:10.340]   But then they might as well bring that in house because apple really likes to own their core technologies and they began to realize that silicon
[01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:16.420]   If they could control it would give them a huge competitive advantage because they wouldn't sort of be stuck on anybody else's update cycle
[01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:20.820]   They could do exactly what they wanted and since there's no profit per lot or loss for the ship division
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:23.940]   They just let those people run like the we want to put on a new chip do it
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:26.820]   We want to add an extra core do it. They they are almost limitless
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:29.300]   Which is an amazing place for a chip design?
[01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:34.420]   People to work, which is why I think apples attracted so much talent and it gets to a point where you know
[01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:38.820]   I joked when they started announcing like the a1 the m1 the w1 that there's a lot of letters left
[01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:42.900]   In the alphabet and I really think they're working on all of them. They're working on modems
[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:46.020]   They're working on gpu's because that's the only way to get the gpu
[01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:51.940]   They really want and we've already seen them do custom versions of imagination gpu's where they have extra cores or slightly different
[01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:55.940]   Just like they do with the arm chips right the arm design the arms are 100% custom now
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:34:00.740]   They used to use a reference design, but you can also just license the ip and you can also just probably
[01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:07.060]   Let's call them architecture licenses allows. Yes a reference architecture. So now it's rv7. It's an instruction set basically
[01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:14.180]   So they're compatible with the rv7 instructions. I guess that's the license that apple's probably going to end up with with imagination is something like that, right?
[01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:17.860]   Yeah, well they have their own metal layers and they have open gls
[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:21.940]   There's a lot of standards that they could build on right away and I think they just want to control their own gpu
[01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:27.700]   We see with a mac pro. It's not multiple gpu's anymore, but they still want to control their own gpu. You know, uh,
[01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:34.500]   We had Brianna Wu on twit on sunday. She is a game designer. She designed zio s games
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:38.820]   Uh, she said almost nobody uses apple's own
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:46.180]   Metal and other technologies because open gl is so terrible apple really made a bad bet with open gl
[01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:50.020]   So people using the real engine or they're designing and their own engine
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:56.020]   Is this an opportunity for apple to kind of rethink open gl as well
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:35:02.100]   It's they they don't use in video because in video wants control and apple doesn't like other companies that want control like in video
[01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:07.540]   Probably won't let them right to the metal they'll force them to use kuda and apple was competing against kuda with open cl
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:10.580]   Which they're maybe again the new mac pro shows they're not going to do that anymore
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:15.460]   So they had a imd would let them do almost anything which is why I think we've seen a md cards and so many things
[01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:22.900]   But this is a whole new architecture. This is like arm to x86 sort of this is very different sort of an infrastructure and they could replace open
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:29.300]   Open gl, but what would they replace it? Was it metals? It was metal to replace open gl or was it just a layer on top?
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:32.020]   It's a late. Yeah, so it's kind of like direct
[01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:36.340]   Yeah, I think it's very similar. Okay, Brianna would be much better
[01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:44.100]   Yeah, but she but you know she said speaking for the developer community, but nobody's very happy with apples 3d particularly 3d graphics
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:47.140]   on uh on iOS at this point
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:51.460]   So maybe and I think that an opportunity to fix that well unity abstracts that away for them
[01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:55.060]   I think they develop for unity. Well, yeah, and I asked her I said, uh, you know, do people use unity?
[01:35:55.060 --> 01:36:02.840]   She said yeah, it's cross platform, but it's not great either. She I think uh space cat gal her company uses the real engine
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:05.140]   Yeah, unreal not real unreal
[01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:08.180]   the real engine
[01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:10.340]   Anyway, I thought it was very interesting insight
[01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:14.820]   I think apple. I mean I think they could get more if they really care able to they get more developers
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:20.340]   Adopting their their work as long as but they really do have to invest in really high performance
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:24.980]   And then you know great libraries that people can use and I think right now they haven't there's two problems
[01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:28.420]   Open GL does run better on on on windows than it does on apple
[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:32.260]   So partly it's apples implementation, but it also I think
[01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:40.660]   I won't speak Alex you should speak to this but my sense is that open GL is not really a very good platform for graphics
[01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:42.900]   Or it's not considered anymore to be a good platform
[01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:46.980]   Well, I think there's some people that are using definitely using open GL for for a lot of what they're doing
[01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:49.060]   But I think but not necessarily on
[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:51.700]   Not necessarily on on the iOS platform
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:53.700]   I know I you know, I think that the
[01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:58.260]   There is I think that this all of what we're talking about right now when it comes to the GPUs and everything else
[01:36:58.260 --> 01:37:02.580]   I think part of what apple may need to do and one of the reasons they're taking it over is as they start to really look at
[01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:09.140]   Augmented reality augment reality is going to depend extremely heavily on a lot of the processes that we're talking about
[01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:15.620]   That's how this came up. She said I am not sanguine about apple's future where they are because of their crappy
[01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:18.740]   3d layer
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:22.580]   Right and so they they have to spend and I think that they they need to control this
[01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:25.780]   You know, they need to be able to control their destiny when it comes to this
[01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:30.980]   And I think they're not going to want to work with an external platform because the problem that they have is they're going to have to make requests
[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:35.460]   You know for bits and pieces or they're going to have to license things that are going to show in their cards
[01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:38.580]   They're going to start making improving someone else's ability to do it
[01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:40.580]   And I think that they want to keep it as much
[01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:45.220]   Tight, you know, there's that you know, I you know as we've done we're starting to do a lot of AR
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:48.740]   R&D to augment some of the stuff that we're doing with
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:53.780]   360 video and and so and so forth and as you get into what you realize how big of a market it can be
[01:37:53.780 --> 01:38:00.100]   You know starting some of the just an early test and even just some of the stuff we're papering out where like oh, this could change everything
[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:05.060]   You know, but but you need you need libraries that don't exist right now to really make that work
[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:08.660]   So, you know, we're working on the content side of it hoping that the libraries catch up
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:14.820]   But but being able to you know track real-time data in you know, real-time image data to lock
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:17.300]   What we're working on, you know into reality
[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:23.140]   As well as you know being able to render whole new scenes on top of the video is something that
[01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:27.700]   Isn't done. I don't think anybody really effectively yet. Maybe Microsoft with the HoloLens
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:33.060]   But but outside of that it's still, you know, very very early early stages and I think Apple's gonna
[01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:36.580]   It sounds like they're really focusing on it and it's the right place to focus in my opinion
[01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:42.740]   They also apparently are a bidder for Toshiba's nan flash memory business Toshiba's selling off
[01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:47.620]   It's a it's business looking to raise nine billion dollars to cover
[01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:56.340]   Losses, it's it's nuclear unit. Westinghouse went out of business went belly up. Interesting times, isn't it? Yeah, so Amazon's bidding for it, but also
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:58.980]   according
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:38:59.540]   uh
[01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:01.220]   according to uh
[01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:04.740]   Forbes our I guess it's Forbes uh Amazon and google
[01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:07.060]   so
[01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:10.980]   Uh as well as micron sk highnix western digital
[01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:15.060]   Um, so this is interesting. I'm sorry Reuters
[01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:17.700]   Reuters quoted
[01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:23.140]   Yomi Yomi Yuri shimboon, which is a Japanese publication ice must flow Leo. We must get our nan flash
[01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:29.380]   Broadcom and silver lake partners bid together about 18 billion
[01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:33.620]   Dollars so apple but apples got the money they could kick this in
[01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:36.900]   They would give them a lock on
[01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:39.780]   you know memory for all of their devices
[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:43.300]   And probably by owning the Toshiba plants
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:48.180]   They wouldn't have any hold up any any bottleneck. I don't know if that's been one of the reasons
[01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:49.620]   It's been hard to get
[01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:53.780]   You know apple iPhones cranked out fast enough, but that certainly could make a big difference
[01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:58.980]   I mean they don't usually own factories though. They usually lice it like lease and then get machines in there and it's a very different business
[01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:00.260]   right
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:00.820]   uh
[01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:06.900]   western digital uh operates a plant Toshiba with jotiba in japan and both micron and sk highnix are
[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:09.700]   suppliers to apple
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:16.900]   But if you know, I think if you're apple owning these owning this technology owning the production and cutting everybody off
[01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:21.540]   Might might look pretty pretty good worth 18 billion dollars
[01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:27.300]   Uh, are we uh, are we not gonna have a spring event? I think it's too late now, right?
[01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:33.780]   With this and with these I mean since they talked about this this morning and we were holding out for max and ipad pros
[01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:35.780]   It's very little left for an event
[01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:38.980]   But what about the uh, fight what about the 10.5 inch ipad pro
[01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:44.820]   But that's that's not an event that's a product. I think that they hold off until they have several products to to announce
[01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:47.460]   WWDC
[01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:52.340]   Sadness. Yeah, maybe I mean they've done heart. They've done macron pros. They've done the mac pro ww dc. It's not unheard of
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:56.980]   So it that would be in june, uh, so just be another massive
[01:40:56.980 --> 01:41:01.780]   Do it all at once or maybe or maybe we'll bring in another five people
[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:06.820]   There are my skies. I'd like to volunteer the mac break weekly panel for the next event
[01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:11.060]   I remember like a couple years ago. It was that it was the first ipad pro was apple tv
[01:41:11.060 --> 01:41:16.020]   It was the iphone success. It was the updated apple. I mean it's just they've they've jam packed those things on occasion
[01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:19.860]   apple has purchased workflow and ios app that
[01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:24.500]   Uh, you know was kind of designed to be automator for ios
[01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:30.100]   Of course because it's a third party app. It didn't have anywhere near the functionality of something like automator
[01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:33.620]   I'm excited if apple buys apple has bought it as apple, uh
[01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:37.220]   You know makes it part of the os. This could be uh, you know
[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:41.940]   Maybe they shouldn't have uh, let's sal go. This could be really cool to have some automation in ios, right?
[01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:47.220]   Well, they they wouldn't have let's sal go unless they unless they knew exactly what they were doing
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:48.820]   So don't don't worry about that
[01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:53.540]   Uh, and i like i was saying earlier before i think that this is another another fate towards
[01:41:53.540 --> 01:42:00.100]   How they really want ipad to have credibility and enterprise because if you can't script it again your enterprise means
[01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:06.820]   Giving computers to dumb people who are only going to break it because they know more than the it department does knows about technology
[01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:12.660]   So what the need what the what the vice president or the regular employee needs is a button that you push
[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:18.660]   To generate a report automatically and put it on the server where it needs to be where so the work group can get at it
[01:42:18.660 --> 01:42:22.900]   And you can't do that just by saying here's a printed card here are the steps you're going to do
[01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:25.620]   Here's the app you need to launch for the ftp server
[01:42:25.620 --> 01:42:30.340]   They need a button you push in order to launch an automated script that the it department has created
[01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:35.460]   That makes everything work exactly the way it's supposed to work. So that's why i think this is the reason why
[01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:40.020]   Uh, they bought this this this solution just bang lift out plug in you've got it
[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:43.860]   One and i think that we'll see this i think we'll see this uh flush it, you know, it'll
[01:42:43.860 --> 01:42:49.700]   You know apple give it more hooks than it than it had before i think then you'll see it work on mac os
[01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:53.940]   Then you'll see it home kid then you'll see it work on you know like all of those things are
[01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:59.140]   I think that's probably the trajectory for something like this. It's not a free on the app store if you want to play with it
[01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:00.340]   Yeah
[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:02.740]   I i think it's also a way to sort of uh
[01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:05.780]   Religitimize extensions on ios
[01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:10.020]   Because you basically can turn pretty much anything into an ios extension
[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:13.300]   Uh as opposed to the uh the automation's
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:19.220]   System that you have on ios which is reliant on a whole bunch of technologies that have rebooting on ios for now
[01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:22.500]   So, uh, it's it's it's a good move. It's a smart move
[01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:28.420]   And if you are terrified that apple is moving towards the towards the ipad and away from the mac
[01:43:28.420 --> 01:43:32.580]   This is a good reason to be afraid but not not after today's announcements not after
[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:36.340]   After finding that they're actually investing money in creating a new mac pro
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:45.060]   apple's ticket lottery for the uh worldwide developers conference in june ended on friday developers are starting to be notified if they've won tickets
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:50.260]   1599 1,599 dollars the price for the ticket
[01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:52.580]   uh and uh
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:58.260]   Presumably, um if you were notified you've already paid for it because the deadline was last night at five p.m
[01:43:58.260 --> 01:44:01.460]   Pacific to pay that 1599
[01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:08.260]   You know if they don't do a spring event at least for us. I mean developers are always interested in ww dc but for the rest of us
[01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:11.620]   ww dc might be very important
[01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:15.540]   Yeah, they certainly have a lot to talk about. Yep
[01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:18.820]   Uh, let's see
[01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:21.780]   The first time ever
[01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:27.140]   streaming music generated the majority of annual music sales
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:33.780]   subscription services helped revenue rise more than 11 for the us music industry so
[01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:38.020]   I think that's a good news actually. I think one of the things that's important and apple is
[01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:43.220]   Showing to produce a lot more revenue for the for the industry than than most of the other services
[01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:44.820]   Uh, but I think that
[01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:49.540]   uh one of the things that's really interesting about this is that a lot of us have been talking about the fact that one streaming really took
[01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:53.620]   Over there was actually more money to be made than then selling off, you know physical units
[01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:56.100]   And you know
[01:44:56.100 --> 01:45:01.940]   I'm talking about how small the revenue is well that was because there was only a small number of people using the subscription services but as they
[01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:10.420]   Go ahead. Let's just let's just let's make sure we clarify small revenue for the actual content creators. Yes, that's that's the
[01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:13.300]   Well, I'm sure the label's made plenty money
[01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:18.980]   So but but but but but the here's the issue is is that is that as the streaming services become
[01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:24.900]   More and more powerful and as as you know the distribution model becomes less and less needed
[01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:31.700]   Uh, what you're what I think you're really looking at and the delta is too high between the revenue generated and what the artists are getting
[01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:34.980]   I think you get into a position where the artists and the artists management do really well
[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:41.060]   Um, and they go why am I why do I have a label and we're seeing more and more artists that are that are moving away from having a label
[01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:44.740]   Um because you know, they don't you know, the label doesn't provide
[01:45:44.740 --> 01:45:50.020]   Much for what they you know for what they're on needed in the next generation of media
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:53.540]   And so I think that as we see this revenue flow becoming larger and larger
[01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:58.260]   Uh, you know, there are a lot of advantages for the artists to move away from the labels
[01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:02.740]   And I think that that is I think because they you know, they're not making enough money per per download
[01:46:02.740 --> 01:46:07.460]   Um, and I think that we're going to see a lot of restructuring of deals and I think we're going to see a lot of artists more like
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:11.620]   Um, you know an Annie de franco or peter gay real or you know, many other
[01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:15.700]   Those are the first ones the pioneers of that but I think that we're going to see a lot more
[01:46:15.700 --> 01:46:18.100]   Um artists going kind of on their own
[01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:21.300]   And and really taking it out because they can make even if they have much smaller
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:26.580]   Usage when you don't have to persuade someone to sell, you know to or to buy your product
[01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:31.540]   When they simply can get a hold of your song and share the song. I think that there's a lot of advantages
[01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:38.180]   I think one of the problems is is that the way that we're still promoting stuff isn't enough viral isn't isn't enough ground up
[01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:43.620]   Um within within the services allowing people to share, you know, like you can share playlists
[01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:46.500]   But finding ways that people could actually make money sharing like playlists
[01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:51.140]   I think is kind of the next new thing to help generate something that is gonna
[01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:54.420]   Um get people interested. I've got a lot of your plays and so yeah
[01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:56.900]   Yeah
[01:46:56.900 --> 01:47:00.420]   But also but also realize that they that at least the way the businesses right now
[01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:04.340]   All these acts they're not making money off of album sales. They're making money off of touring
[01:47:04.340 --> 01:47:09.380]   So that does that does point to the idea that they don't really need to labels as much anymore
[01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:14.100]   If they are if they got their if they've got their live act business totally separate from the label
[01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:19.460]   It's like it's more like you're making an album to promote your live act where you actually make your
[01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:24.260]   Make your money whereas in generations ago. These would be absolutely the reverse
[01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:26.660]   You would tour in order to sell more albums. So
[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:29.060]   Realize that
[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:32.340]   If they're making a better business, it's always going to be a better business for the labels
[01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:37.540]   And there might be a crisis point when the labels have nobody that that's left to design
[01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:43.060]   And the acts have absolutely no money interest in signing up for a label to begin with
[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:47.540]   All they will have is a hundred years worth of copyrights that they've stolen from
[01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:51.220]   Poor and about badly represented artists
[01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:55.220]   So so long as they can continue to sell the white album over and over and over again
[01:47:55.220 --> 01:48:00.020]   They'll be somewhere with it. So long as the mark started in the mood is how they've got that master tape really safe
[01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:01.220]   I think they'll be well
[01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:04.260]   And as we as we look at both the music industry and the film industry
[01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:09.860]   You know the the film industry right now is being eviscerated by Netflix and and a couple of other ones a couple of other services
[01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:12.340]   Amazon possibly apple in the future
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:17.060]   You know didn't have to be this way for the for the labels or for the or for the movie
[01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:19.380]   You know industry
[01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:24.500]   They you know they really play decide to play hardball with these companies that are much larger than them
[01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:28.900]   Thinking that they were going to be able to control this and now that these companies have stepped into it
[01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:31.540]   Basically, they're just taking all of their talent
[01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:35.540]   You know, you know, they're they're they're taking away all of the producers all of the all the directors
[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:40.900]   Uh, you know when when when Netflix start signing martin's corsese to to films, you know everybody in holly
[01:48:40.900 --> 01:48:44.100]   Which would worry, you know, and so this is not just a music industry issue
[01:48:44.180 --> 01:48:48.180]   This is a the artist. This has never been a better time to be an artist that wants to create
[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:54.020]   Video content especially but but also I think in the coming days with streaming in the coming years
[01:48:54.020 --> 01:48:55.780]   Uh, you know music as well
[01:48:55.780 --> 01:48:58.660]   It's gone through a hard time over the last 15 years because of
[01:48:58.660 --> 01:49:03.460]   The reaction but but I think that we're getting to another point where being an artist and being the distributor
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:07.940]   The end distributor is great being anywhere in the middle is is more difficult
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:13.780]   Couple of uh things about the month of april it is the cruelest months
[01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:16.100]   According to tsl it it's also the months
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:19.300]   That apple starts moving into its spaceship
[01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:26.900]   Campus it's not done yet. They're gonna continue work, but the first apple employees will occupy apple park
[01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:29.780]   Uh starting, uh this month
[01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:35.220]   Eventually, I think I think when we say occupying it. I think it's the it guys and the movers
[01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:40.340]   And everything else these are the k somebody there still put their their full time as they move things around
[01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:45.780]   But I don't think that they're actually there's people doing what they're I would I'd be surprised if we see any real work done until august
[01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:51.300]   They uh the um trees uh they're putting in our fully grown
[01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:56.820]   Uh trees so that the to make it greener faster those are expensive when you buy a tree like that
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:58.820]   They are so cool. Have you ever seen those things?
[01:49:58.820 --> 01:50:01.540]   They have a tractor that just comes down and just
[01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:07.060]   Just sucks them right out of the ground and sends them back down. It's it's really cool. It's really cool
[01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:11.620]   These are all the two million over nature is complete. Yes. It's all a
[01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:14.500]   Uh apple
[01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:19.700]   Tim cook told vogue hard to know what's more beautiful the building or that pile of dirt in the middle
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:24.340]   That's the dirt that was removed to make the building apparently
[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:29.300]   Uh they they've they've been secretly building a pyramid in the middle of the spaceship
[01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:32.420]   This whole thing turns out to be a big antenna to bring
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:39.140]   So uh the other big event in april it is uh autism acceptance month
[01:50:39.140 --> 01:50:41.780]   And uh apple is celebrating
[01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:43.380]   Uh
[01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:47.300]   Both in the app store and field trips to the retail store, but there's a whole page of
[01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:50.980]   autism acceptance apps that are appropriate
[01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:53.460]   Uh for autistic people
[01:50:53.460 --> 01:51:01.140]   um dozens of important accessibility apps and they're organized too so lots of different categories apps for every day apps for learning
[01:51:01.140 --> 01:51:03.140]   There's books there's even podcasts
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:06.260]   Uh, I love that
[01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:07.620]   Uh
[01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:11.540]   And I think oh one more uh one more story and then we can
[01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:14.660]   We can wrap it up and um
[01:51:14.660 --> 01:51:17.380]   And uh get to our picks of the week
[01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:24.340]   What was the one more story? I was going to say I can't remember. Oh, well. Oh, I know
[01:51:24.340 --> 01:51:27.060]   Uh, you may remember that
[01:51:30.740 --> 01:51:32.740]   Let's see. How should I put this?
[01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:40.900]   Uh, the trump administration is disassembling uh climate change regulations in the government apple and other big companies have
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:44.580]   Decided to take that as an opportunity to say no, we're still committed
[01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:47.860]   We still think there was there is climate change we think it's caused by humans
[01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:54.180]   And we are going to continue to do what we can both in our new campus and in general to cut carbon pollution
[01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:56.500]   um
[01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:58.900]   Despite the change in regulations apples
[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:02.020]   Response
[01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:05.860]   Was a part of a joint statement from apple amazon google and microsoft
[01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:09.300]   We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies like the clean power plan
[01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:16.980]   Which has been gutted can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting american competitiveness
[01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:19.940]   innovation and job growth
[01:52:19.940 --> 01:52:24.580]   All proctor and gamel nestley ikea levi's and best by all signed
[01:52:25.220 --> 01:52:28.980]   It's one of those things where regardless of what you think the cause is we'll all die the same
[01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:32.500]   Yeah, so it's good to be on the right side. You know what it's good to do changes not a bad thing
[01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:35.940]   Yes to have solar panels on the roof
[01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:40.340]   Even if there's no climate change is still a good thing. Okay, all our grandchildren will
[01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:44.900]   We'll die at the same time. So fix it regardless of where you think it comes from exactly
[01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:50.420]   And also just just to throw the law of rants. There's going to be some coal in the gift shop if you want to buy coal
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:54.580]   It's not like we're trying to keep put people out of work here. No, no, not at all
[01:52:55.540 --> 01:52:58.100]   Uh, let's take a break your picks of the week my friends coming up
[01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:01.220]   It just to fit our show to bid a brought to you by my magazine collection
[01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:03.540]   I won't ask how I flew with Alex lindsey

[01:53:09.540 --> 01:53:14.580]   But uh, I have a better way why I have a stack of papers that cost you hundreds of dollars

[01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:03.220]   Trees
[01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:05.780]   Alex lindsey pick of the week time
[01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:09.380]   So I have been experimenting with interfaces for
[01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:15.540]   For skype and web and and so and so forth and so this is uh, this is one of the experiments. You're looking at it
[01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:22.100]   Uh, this is a um, uh, what i'm interfacing with one of the problems with getting into the web pages easily
[01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:26.740]   Uh was having a webcam that I could that I could actually you know, it had to be a webcam
[01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:28.740]   I had to look like a webcam
[01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:30.420]   Even though I wanted to use a professional camera
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:35.540]   And so one of the things that I got recently that I've been playing with is a and I have to be careful because hold on
[01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:39.620]   I'll grab the box hold on a second. Yeah, don't don't disconnect your camera
[01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:42.420]   This one right here
[01:55:42.420 --> 01:55:42.980]   Oh
[01:55:42.980 --> 01:55:44.500]   I've done that
[01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:49.940]   I uh, one of the machines that we were recording on was a windows machine and uh, I was doing windows weekly and I uh
[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:55.460]   I said, paul, I'm get I've got an update. Should I install it? He said no, and that was the last thing we heard from him as it was booting
[01:55:55.460 --> 01:56:00.660]   So i'm opening the other one. I have a tent we have a tendency to to test things
[01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:06.420]   Um with a couple copies of things so um, so this is the black magic web presenter
[01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:10.660]   Um, how interesting and uh, so basically so it's hardware and software
[01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:17.540]   Yeah, it's it's well. It's just hardware. So it's just I mean it has, you know, you so basically this is this is what it looks like here
[01:56:17.540 --> 01:56:20.980]   It's like this little box here. This happens to be a one third of you
[01:56:20.980 --> 01:56:23.940]   Um, and the reason that that's important is they have a lot of things that are one third you
[01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:27.780]   Um, they they have a new switcher that is an hd switcher
[01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:33.140]   Um that takes their a 10 stuff that they've already had with all the software and stuff and it does
[01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:37.780]   I think it has eight inputs or something sti and hd my it's a great little switcher that we've been testing as well
[01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:43.700]   It's two thirds you so you can actually put this on one you you can you can install this and have it
[01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:46.900]   A switcher that you can actually and especially if you're thinking about an industrial
[01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:51.940]   Uh solution where you just want you just need to switch between cameras. You don't need all the board and everything else
[01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:54.340]   It's a great little um switcher for that. So in the back
[01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:59.060]   Uh, you've got you know sti loop through's hd my loop throughs
[01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:01.620]   Um and just a standard
[01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:04.580]   Uh, iec. It's a c13 input
[01:57:05.220 --> 01:57:10.020]   And then audio input so that you can embed your audio, uh through it. I'm not doing that here
[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:15.380]   I'm still using the webcam. I didn't get that far today, but um, but anyway, so it's a it's a slick little
[01:57:15.380 --> 01:57:18.820]   Uh box and I wasn't sure it doesn't work with wire cast yet
[01:57:18.820 --> 01:57:23.540]   But we're not sure exactly why but it doesn't work with all the web apps and web rtc and skype and
[01:57:23.540 --> 01:57:28.420]   Everything else and what it allows you to do of course is take a either a um a little camcorder
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:32.580]   Like you would use uh in in many things or many people would use for for this type of thing
[01:57:32.980 --> 01:57:35.540]   In this case i'm using another black magic camera, um
[01:57:35.540 --> 01:57:41.380]   Which is the ultra hd and it's actually scaling it all down and making it 720p to put into uh
[01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:45.860]   And do it. I think it's looked okay. Um, you know, it looks great to see what it looks like on your side. So
[01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:48.340]   Yeah, but it may it helps. I mean you've got a good lens
[01:57:48.340 --> 01:57:50.580]   Uh, you've got a good camera
[01:57:50.580 --> 01:57:54.580]   And then uh, and then and then beat but being it has been an issue
[01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:58.340]   We've had all kinds of interfaces and I still use mage wells and the nice thing
[01:57:58.340 --> 01:58:02.740]   But the mage well on the in the mini recorder is um, the the black magic makes and the mage well
[01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:05.620]   Interfaces that I can put in my backpack a little easier than the square
[01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:12.580]   But if you're building a rack mountable system that you want to use for your your school or your company or your pod your your live cast
[01:58:12.580 --> 01:58:14.580]   To to facebook live or youtube
[01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:17.860]   Um, all of those things, uh, you know, it's it's not an encoder
[01:58:17.860 --> 01:58:24.660]   Um, it just simply interfaces with a lot of the uh, the stuff you want on your computer and it just shows up like a webcam
[01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:26.660]   So you don't have to have um
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:29.940]   Uh, you know, it's it's a little easier to use than um
[01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:34.420]   Then a lot of the other options, uh, as far as interface goes and how much you want to work to hook it up
[01:58:34.420 --> 01:58:37.300]   I don't know it's expensive
[01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:43.700]   If you have to ask you can't afford it. Well, no, I I have a bad habit of I I I want to test stuff and I tell someone
[01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:49.220]   How many Alex is this? I know I know I know and then and then and then it shows up and then I and I don't think about it anymore
[01:58:49.220 --> 01:58:52.020]   And um, you know, I just have some boxes sitting in the office
[01:58:52.020 --> 01:58:56.740]   You're on it now so and then somebody asks me how much it costs four hundred
[01:58:56.740 --> 01:59:00.900]   495, okay, so it's a you know, it's a little bit more expensive than then buying something
[01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:04.420]   A mage well is about 400 bucks. I think which is probably the best other solution
[01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:09.380]   The mini recorder that that black magic also makes is about $150 which is a lot
[01:59:09.380 --> 01:59:17.700]   Less, uh of a product than this. Um, so so I think that this is a um, you know, significantly superior product to to those
[01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:21.700]   I mean it takes up more space. So if you're trying to throw something in your backpack, this is not really
[01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:27.220]   the the right solution, um, but if you are looking for something you're going to put into your office
[01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:31.460]   Uh, we're we build a lot of you know, we build studios for folks and and so on and so forth
[01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:34.500]   This is a great one to just make it easy, you know, and things are just going to see it
[01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:39.620]   It's going to pop up and it's got enough professional tools in it that that you can kind of get it ready to go
[01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:43.220]   So if you're building a studio area, I think that that's a pretty good solution
[01:59:43.220 --> 01:59:45.620]   If you're building a um
[01:59:45.620 --> 01:59:49.540]   Uh, if you are going to carry around your backpack, it's probably not the right solution
[01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:51.860]   And it's only two thirds of an Alex
[01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:54.260]   Exactly. Yeah, exactly
[01:59:54.260 --> 01:59:57.860]   Mr. Andy and ico your pick of the week
[01:59:57.860 --> 02:00:01.860]   My pick is something that i've been sort of looking for for a while
[02:00:01.860 --> 02:00:04.180]   It's this little and we're gonna
[02:00:04.180 --> 02:00:08.260]   adult move crayon cam 2000 the future of
[02:00:08.260 --> 02:00:15.940]   Video podcasting. Come on crayon cam 3000. Uh, this is a really cool little 50 watt desktop
[02:00:15.940 --> 02:00:17.860]   Amplifier
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:21.700]   That I can't okay. Maybe should maybe should use the picture that I supplied because I can't bend it
[02:00:21.700 --> 02:00:24.260]   I can't bend it's all right. I'm messing with it. Um, yeah
[02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:26.100]   I'm looking for like a real
[02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:32.580]   Just a usb powered really good amplifier that I could keep on my desktop next to the computer and plug a couple of nice speakers into
[02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:38.580]   Uh rather than get like a sound bar rather than get something as bluetooth rather than get something that costs 13
[02:00:38.580 --> 02:00:40.580]   Dollars at best buy with a subwoofer
[02:00:40.580 --> 02:00:44.580]   All right, this was exactly what I was looking for so made by topping
[02:00:44.580 --> 02:00:48.900]   It's the tp 32 ex it costs about 110 bucks
[02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:53.380]   And it's a legit 50 watt amplifier with lots of chips in it with lots of
[02:00:53.380 --> 02:00:59.380]   Numbers after it that if you keep googling for you will find lots of impressive things to to talk about
[02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:03.300]   I've trying to I've got the tri-path tk 2050
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:09.220]   T amp is good operating a true fed input stage a wide output swing with one volt of the rails
[02:01:09.620 --> 02:01:16.020]   Allow increase to headroom and making it ideal for audio circuits. It's basically digital auto converter is a serious logic
[02:01:16.020 --> 02:01:18.420]   CS 43 92
[02:01:18.420 --> 02:01:24.420]   140 db 24-bit 192 kilohertz stereo with direct stream digital support no linear
[02:01:24.420 --> 02:01:28.500]   That sort of stuff what do you want to know is that it's a really good clean amplifier
[02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:29.940]   50 watts
[02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:34.580]   Operysify usb so you plug it into your mac and it just sends the since the raw digital
[02:01:35.300 --> 02:01:40.180]   Rod digital stream to the device and they're not really good on board digital audio converter
[02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:43.780]   And amp will actually convert something that your speakers can use
[02:01:43.780 --> 02:01:51.620]   I've actually got plugged into my realistic minimus 77 metal speakers that i've had since college that are still damn good
[02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:56.340]   They'll be even better after I use an upgrade kit that I bought off a ebay that supposedly
[02:01:56.340 --> 02:01:58.340]   Makes them sound even better
[02:01:58.340 --> 02:02:05.060]   But it gets really really good sound through all speakers not only that but also have good for for headphone use
[02:02:05.460 --> 02:02:11.860]   It also will have a regular ox input so I've actually got my my cd player
[02:02:11.860 --> 02:02:16.580]   Plugged into it as well so that cd's that i've bought second hand but i haven't ripped yet
[02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:20.340]   I can still play them directly without having to go through itunes or anything like that
[02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:26.340]   Uh, and it's very it's I was of course it's easy to find like a cheap little amp you can put in your desktop
[02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:31.460]   But not only is this usb but it's also very very smart where if you've got it plugged in via usb
[02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:36.100]   It will turn itself on and off as you as the computer goes to sleep and wakes up
[02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:39.700]   So it's not as if you have to keep turning it on and off to to conserve power
[02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:42.740]   Uh, not not that expensive. I mean you can buy
[02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:48.740]   Uh, little amps like this that are based on a lot of the same chipsets for two three four five hundred dollars
[02:02:48.740 --> 02:02:50.420]   And if you go to the audio
[02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:53.060]   Audio forums you will find lots of arguments about how
[02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:59.220]   Depends oh what gauge cables are you using are using are using isolated cables or you're just running it along the floor?
[02:02:59.380 --> 02:03:04.820]   I don't know all in wall. I want it louder and I want it nice so that I can listen to like my opera
[02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:08.340]   Recordings and it doesn't just give up and cry and go home
[02:03:08.340 --> 02:03:14.180]   Because of all the highs and all the lows and for 110 bucks. It was exactly what I was looking for really works nice
[02:03:14.180 --> 02:03:20.100]   I like I like having blue LEDs on my desktop. I like having push buttons for volume control
[02:03:20.100 --> 02:03:23.620]   That is the only maybe disadvantage if you want to consider that
[02:03:24.340 --> 02:03:30.180]   That when you're using this as the output device remember that it's not the Mac that's generating the audio is just saying okay great
[02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:31.780]   We will send the digital stream
[02:03:31.780 --> 02:03:36.180]   Uh directly to the spots you handle it which means that the volume control is grayed out on your Mac
[02:03:36.180 --> 02:03:39.780]   So now you you change the you change the volume on the device itself
[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:43.780]   It does have a remote control so that if you want to use it from across the room you can do that too
[02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:50.420]   But it's exactly what I was looking for. It's kind of funny that I used to have my old like 500 watt pioneer
[02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:56.020]   Like the the the big av receiver that I bought as a gift to myself when I finished my first book
[02:03:56.020 --> 02:04:01.380]   And almost died over the last three months. I'm buying my so i've been very good. I'm buying myself a toy
[02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:04.420]   And really this this little hundred dollar box
[02:04:04.420 --> 02:04:09.700]   Kind of kicks its butt for when I wanted to use it for uh, so the it's the topping
[02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:14.660]   What would I call it? It's the sex is right here the the topping tp 32 ex
[02:04:14.660 --> 02:04:19.540]   Uh and really really solved the problem for you well available in black and brushed chrome
[02:04:20.180 --> 02:04:22.020]   Nice
[02:04:22.020 --> 02:04:24.180]   Skew more picked but we like it
[02:04:24.180 --> 02:04:28.260]   Yeah, this act is actual brush chrome. So I don't think it is skewer thick. It's actual brush
[02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:32.900]   Oh, and it's also it's a it's a metal case. It's really built well simulated brush chrome
[02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:35.220]   That'd be exactly you have to brush it yourself
[02:04:35.220 --> 02:04:36.580]   Renee
[02:04:36.580 --> 02:04:38.580]   Renee richy your pick of the week sir
[02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:39.700]   I have two picks now
[02:04:39.700 --> 02:04:45.700]   The first one is sort of an uber pick because last friday it was world backup day when they tried to sort of get everyone together and say
[02:04:45.940 --> 02:04:52.340]   You may not always pay attention to backups. You might decide that's future use problem and screw that future you you're having fun today
[02:04:52.340 --> 02:04:57.220]   But just as a way of awareness they wanted everyone to sort of stop and think do you have a backup plan?
[02:04:57.220 --> 02:05:00.580]   If you do is it still working is time machine still backing up is your
[02:05:00.580 --> 02:05:02.740]   It's super duper still cloning your machine
[02:05:02.740 --> 02:05:08.740]   Is backblaze or crash plan still running in the background to stop and double check and make sure your backups are happening
[02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:11.780]   And if you don't have a backup plan, it's the perfect time to get one
[02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:16.740]   And if you don't want to fuss with anything you can subscribe to like backblaze or crash plan or carbonite or something
[02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:23.940]   And just get your stuff to start backing up use google photos use iCloud photos use something so that at some point you don't lose your computer
[02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:31.780]   Or have a break in or a fire or a flood or something and lose your family photos or lose the important health or financial information
[02:05:31.780 --> 02:05:36.180]   Or or you lose your work laptop and they're suddenly scurrying to try to cope
[02:05:36.180 --> 02:05:40.500]   And it's just again a point of reflection a point for you to start establishing a plan
[02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:45.300]   Serenity called well, nori gill for people who use apple, you know max iphones ipads
[02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:50.340]   They put together a phenomenal ultimate guide to backing up where it goes through all of your options
[02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:55.540]   When to choose encryption when not to whether to use online how to do local how to do local and off site
[02:05:55.540 --> 02:05:59.700]   All those different things. So if you want links or recommendations, you can go to that
[02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:02.020]   But the important thing is just backup
[02:06:02.020 --> 02:06:05.860]   And sort of a side pick on this is when you go to that page
[02:06:05.860 --> 02:06:10.020]   You'll notice that we've done a complete redesign for i'm or which you'll mentioned earlier
[02:06:10.500 --> 02:06:13.700]   And that is live now. I'm calling it the new i'm more yellow
[02:06:13.700 --> 02:06:17.780]   It is it is more yellow. We want it to make sort of a dramatic change
[02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:21.700]   Yeah, this is so you get it's really actually you don't see the yellow so much on the front page
[02:06:21.700 --> 02:06:25.940]   Uh, but you see it when you go when you I guess when you go into an article because you have the bar
[02:06:25.940 --> 02:06:31.140]   At the top there, but I like it and there's also a change in in in um
[02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:33.140]   kind of
[02:06:33.140 --> 02:06:38.340]   Beat how how is that changing? I know it's for instance now you've got iphone seven iphone eight i always 10 11
[02:06:38.820 --> 02:06:40.820]   I'm glad you got a pokemon go button
[02:06:40.820 --> 02:06:44.580]   Mac OS here popular people still don't understand how popular pokemon go
[02:06:44.580 --> 02:06:49.940]   People still have iphone last year. Yeah, um, so how is how are you changing editorial?
[02:06:49.940 --> 02:06:51.940]   What is the evolution of i'm more?
[02:06:51.940 --> 02:06:53.860]   So it's all it's gonna be in several stages
[02:06:53.860 --> 02:06:59.540]   The first one is sort of like how apple stores have been evolving when they were originally planned they were very much focused on apple products
[02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:05.460]   But apple products are mainstream now. You know, most people have a phone most people have a computer most people have a tablet
[02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:08.020]   you know, it's it's well penetrated and
[02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:12.660]   They're moving on to other things. They have the promenade now where you get audio equipment or video equipment
[02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:16.900]   It's not so much buying your phone or your computer. It's what you can do with it once you have it
[02:07:16.900 --> 02:07:21.460]   And so we're gonna we're gonna maintain the core the apple stuff isn't changing. It isn't going anywhere
[02:07:21.460 --> 02:07:24.740]   It's just becoming the hub around which we're launching other spokes
[02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:32.180]   And some of them are really closely related like accessories and photography and other ones are a little bit further out like transport or you know toys
[02:07:32.180 --> 02:07:36.580]   Like drones and things like that. But it all comes back to what can we do with
[02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:39.380]   Um sort of the stuff that we have and we also wanted
[02:07:39.380 --> 02:07:44.180]   I think too often in our industry cynicism is used as a as a replacement for intelligence
[02:07:44.180 --> 02:07:49.860]   Like instead of a smart analysis you get a cynical one and we sort of like the optimistic take that you you can sort of
[02:07:49.860 --> 02:07:56.180]   Every company will have its ups and downs, but the products we're getting the technology we're getting across the board is fantastic now
[02:07:56.180 --> 02:07:58.500]   And we want a chance to explore more of it
[02:07:58.500 --> 02:08:04.980]   And I think you'll see over time. I'm more is going to just expand even greater like I wouldn't be surprised if we have an android phone review
[02:08:05.220 --> 02:08:09.940]   Every once in a while or you know, it's something to do with microsoft pcs like a surface studio
[02:08:09.940 --> 02:08:14.820]   Article up on there. I think it's we're gonna we're gonna push it as far as we can
[02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:17.300]   Yeah, because we all love technology, right?
[02:08:17.300 --> 02:08:21.540]   Sure, and it's not consumed anymore. We have cross platform households, right?
[02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:26.660]   Exactly good. I'm more calm still got the podcasts rene's great writing
[02:08:26.660 --> 02:08:31.540]   And uh you've always been great about uh how to use your stuff better
[02:08:31.540 --> 02:08:34.420]   And i'm glad to hear that you're focusing more and more on that. That's fantastic
[02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:40.340]   Oh, and we're gonna solve another problem because there are some people who just want the apple stuff and don't care about pokemon go or how to's and we're
[02:08:40.340 --> 02:08:43.620]   There's sort of a hub approach now. Yeah, it's not finalized yet
[02:08:43.620 --> 02:08:45.380]   We're still we're still making updates
[02:08:45.380 --> 02:08:48.500]   But if you want you'll be able to go there and just see apple news and editorials
[02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:53.140]   And if you want you'll just get help out to use and buying guides and if you want you'll just get transportation stories
[02:08:53.140 --> 02:08:57.700]   So make it much easier for you to get the coverage that you want and i'm not writing me nasty congratulations
[02:08:57.700 --> 02:09:01.460]   You know i'm i'm always getting better and better all the time. Thank you. Thank you
[02:09:02.100 --> 02:09:09.220]   Renee richie i'm moor.com and a nako you'll find him at cwob.com his website and also of course on the pages
[02:09:09.220 --> 02:09:11.860]   of the chicago sun times
[02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:14.740]   Sporting a lovely burette today
[02:09:14.740 --> 02:09:20.260]   Also known as i'm having a horrible morning and i can't even comb my hair i'm so frustrated
[02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:23.860]   What are you frustrated with?
[02:09:23.860 --> 02:09:29.380]   Uh about five minutes before i had to sit down for the podcast i spilled a big can of paint on the floor
[02:09:30.980 --> 02:09:36.980]   I had just enough time to basically use up every piece of paper towels and suppose 10 minutes after i say goodbye
[02:09:36.980 --> 02:09:41.220]   i'm going to home depot to buy every solvent there is to see if i can
[02:09:41.220 --> 02:09:46.580]   Fix the floor i can i can definitely fix the floor, but that was not how i was playing to spend my five p.m
