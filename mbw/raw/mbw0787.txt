[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.100]   From Apple, is there news we'll find out momentarily.
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.400]   But first, let's welcome our panel, joining us from Montreal, Canada, USA.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.100]   It's Renee Ritchie at ReneeYouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.800]   Hello.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.100]   Renee Ritchie.
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.000]   Hello, Leo. I'm so chuffed.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.200]   I got my videos for this month already early.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.400]   And then it just turned out to be the perfect time.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.300]   You're showing off your exploded Macintosh t-shirt.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.200]   Coincidence.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.300]   Coincidence, I swear.
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.100]   That's a really sweet looking little tee there.
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.700]   I like it.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.800]   That's the original Mac.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.100]   Infinite Loop 128.
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.600]   Yeah, Infinite Loop has the good t-shirts.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.100]   Apple Park does not have the good t-shirts.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.700]   You have to have the Infinite Loop for the good t-shirts.
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.300]   Yes, Alex Lindsay always says that.
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.100]   Alex Lindsay's also here from Office Hours at 090.media.
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.900]   You love the infillate.
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.900]   The Infinite Loop store is better for the shirts.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.000]   I bought my kids at the Infinite Loop store.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.400]   I bought them too, like a one with AirPods and another one with something else
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.100]   that was just like what Renee had.
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.300]   I got them like two or three years ago.
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.900]   They don't look like they've been washed once and they wear them all the time.
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.300]   You know, they're incredible.
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.200]   It's a typical apple.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.700]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.400]   Like they just whatever they spent on that shirt.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   And it was expensive.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.900]   Goodbye.
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.300]   It was not like Steve would.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.200]   Chut, chut, chut.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.000]   Very carefully look and see and check each model.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I feel like they must have watched it like a hundred times and said,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.300]   well, it looks 90%.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.600]   I think we'll keep it.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.800]   Wow.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.800]   Wow.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.500]   Also with this Andy and I go from WGBH in Boston, Boston public radio.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.700]   Hello, Mr. Not Go.
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.800]   Hello.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.900]   I agree with Alex.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.100]   This is the best investment that a company can make is when you sell t-shirts,
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.500]   sell them like on really good quality teas because I still have and wear
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.000]   regularly like my BB edit t-shirts from like the 90s because they went
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.800]   for like the heavyweight Haynes beefy teas.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   Whereas there are other shirts that I have where, oh, wow, that's a great.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.900]   That's a really like your website or really like your patron.
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.700]   Yes, I'll absolutely take a shirt and then it comes in and it's like,
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.100]   okay, I can wear this on top of another shirt two times before it will
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.800]   definitely have to be thrown out.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.800]   That was a good use of $28.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.100]   Thank you.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.600]   And BB edit improves the fact that it's good design too.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.900]   Like I don't even I'm not, you know, just not my business that I use BB
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.600]   edit that much, but I wear the shirts because it's a great design.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.100]   It's a great shirt.
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.600]   It's such a great app too.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.600]   So great.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:16.100]   On Sunday, I for Dan Moran is is I'm going to mention him in this context.
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.500]   Although we agreed the week before we were talking about, well, if Apple has a
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.900]   date, when would it be?
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.700]   Oh, and author Dan Moran.
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.000]   You.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.500]   Yes, the sci fi author Dan Moran from six colors in macro.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.700]   He he said, just like I think you did, Renee.
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.100]   Well, you know, next Tuesday is the 19th.
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.100]   That's when Google has announced is going to do the Pixel six phone.
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.900]   So probably Apple will do it the following Tuesday.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.300]   But what we forgot is, you know, Apple did not used to like to do events
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.600]   on Mondays because they didn't want the team to have to work so hard
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.400]   over the weekend.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.800]   I think that was the story.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.200]   Although this is unions doesn't sound for you.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.300]   You need to be at the venue.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.300]   The unions are the venues.
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.300]   You're not on the weekend, but it doesn't matter because now the venue, first of all,
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.300]   Apple owns a venue.
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.600]   Probably don't have it.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.900]   They could just use interns and second of all, they're not even using the venue
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.100]   because it's all prerecorded.
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.800]   So we kind of we didn't think.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.300]   And of course, what did Apple do?
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.600]   Something very happily they said, well, hold my beer.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.400]   What if we did it the day before the Pixel event?
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.300]   Take that Google.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.800]   My guess my guess knowing Apple is they probably didn't pay attention.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.900]   They don't care to anything.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.400]   They don't care.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.900]   They're just like, they're like, this was the date that they decided
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.900]   was the best date and they probably weren't looking at Google.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.600]   No, I think it cares.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.600]   Yeah, I do.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.000]   I do.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.900]   I do think that Apple was smart to say that, okay, two major product announcements
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.800]   on the same date is probably no good for us or or anybody.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.200]   Well, how much what would it cost us to do it the day before?
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.000]   I think if you're trying to get the most attention with the same event,
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.400]   you're not going to try to stack it on top of what looks to be something
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.500]   very, very big that that Google couldn't be announcing.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.700]   So what's the point?
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.740]   And especially because Google announced earlier, the real
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.200]   the we know everything there is about the Pixel six.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.000]   But what I mean, if it was just a rumored event, I think Apple would have
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.300]   taken the Tuesday like if they'd been able to go first, I think they would
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.400]   have just taken a Tuesday, but because Google announced first, you know,
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.800]   so the real thing for Apple is when can we ship these?
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.300]   Right.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.100]   In fact, I think they had the idea of these was was ready in June at WWDC,
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.700]   but we thought they'd release these then.
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.600]   And I think it was really about when can we when when is manufacture going
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.300]   to be ready in any event?
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.400]   We've now completely talked around the fact the big story, which is Apple
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.300]   announced this morning.
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.300]   They are going to have an event next Monday, October 18th, 10 AM Pacific.
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.900]   Apple event is says here that seems like a generic placeholder.
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.500]   Unleashed.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.200]   It's called on Lee.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.600]   I know.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.100]   I understand this is on the Apple.com page.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.000]   They they didn't finish the mock up or something.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.100]   Is that Alex?
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.800]   Is that an accurate?
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.800]   Going into hyperspace.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   It depends on whether you're going your Star Trek or Star Wars.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   You know, it's a it actually looks nicer than the Star Wars one.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.800]   Are you sure?
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.800]   As the streets go.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.800]   This is not are you sure it's not the iron throne from Game of Thrones?
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.800]   I think I just think I think they're coming out with the the the Apple
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.800]   Millennium Falcon.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.800]   It's all smooth and shiny and plenty and Vulcan.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   So it will be recorded.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.800]   We will of course stream it will be here.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.800]   I'll have to come in on a day.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.800]   Thank you very much Apple.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.800]   Thanks Apple.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.800]   I think your Apple they didn't even call you and ask.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   No, I think they said what could screw Leo the most.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.800]   That's what they said.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.800]   That's what they said.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   Yeah, I'll be up late celebrating a Giants victory and boy the next day.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   I have to come in.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   Apple event.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.800]   This is not the invitation.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.800]   That's so funny on their website on the invitation to say Apple unleashed.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.800]   It just says unleashed.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   Yeah, that's so strange that they they forgot to fix that here.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   You know what?
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   It's just a simple HTML tag.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.800]   You could probably fix it right now, Apple if you're watching.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.800]   Unleashed doesn't say anything.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.800]   This picture doesn't say anything, but we pretty much know what it's going to be.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.800]   Right, Renee?
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.800]   Yeah, I just I first I just they put a period at the end of unleashed.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.800]   Apple keeps doing this.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.800]   They put a period at the end of single words like in poster art and like and I know there's
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.800]   some all you need to know.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.800]   It's all you need to know.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.800]   It feels passive aggressive to me.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.800]   You know, and you know, there's a lot of meetings about it too.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.800]   Like it's not it's not like someone forgot or slipped in.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   Oh, they put another there's probably three weeks of meetings about the period.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.800]   It's a mic drop.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.800]   It's a visual mic drop unleashed.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.800]   Where are the last ones done?
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   This is an unleashed or or or it's just everybody's exhausted.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.800]   We're not even out of code.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.800]   Look unleashed is a full sentence.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.800]   Whatever we put up there, they're going to pick it apart and put meaning into it anyway.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   Let's just go home and get waffles tonight.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.800]   Okay, we're going to call it leashed, but we figured unleashed would be better suited to the formation.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   There is no leash.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.800]   Well, I think like this is it's well like it ain't going to be an M one because you wouldn't say unleashed
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.800]   if it were an M one.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.800]   It is something new, right?
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   M one isn't powerful enough.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.800]   M one is the ultra low power version of the ship.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   It's basically what an A14 X would have been the most interesting thing for me now is they're
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   going to unleash M one X after they've unleashed A15 now.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   And that's not unusual because they put out the A12 Z for the iPad Pro after they put the A13 in the iPhone.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.800]   So it's not unprecedented, but like do they change things up for marketing?
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.800]   Do they call it an M2 X just because it sounds more reasonable, even though it's not the
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   IP generation or maybe we don't do it at all.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.800]   Just call it M2.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   Well, M2 is going to go into the next Mac book here.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.800]   That's going to be the next generation ultra low power Mac book air.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   Oh, I see to say this is a pro chip.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.800]   So that's what they do with the iPad.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.800]   Oh, branding.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   That's what they do.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:50.800]   So the A14 is for the phone and the A14 X is the for the iPad.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.800]   It's the iPad Pro.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   It's X force.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.800]   X force.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   It was for extended because it was for extra because it had extra cores in it.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.800]   The thing that interests me.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.800]   So it would be logical.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.800]   It would be not necessarily the best marketing, but it would be a lot.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.800]   Totally.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.800]   But the part that interests me the most is some people are saying like now there's an A15.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.800]   It should be the M2 X.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:14.800]   But I wonder if some of the things we saw in the A15 last month didn't actually come from M1 X.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:21.800]   Like Apple taking an afterburner and saying we can do ProRes, hard re acceleration on a chip now for the Mac book Pro.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.800]   Oh, why don't we put that into the next iPhone?
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:29.800]   So I wonder if this is going to be some sort of hybrid generation with mixed A14, A15 IP.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:34.800]   Just something that was purpose built for the Mac, but that they're pulling stuff out of now for their next generation.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.800]   Previously the iPhone was feeding the next generation for the iPad.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.800]   But you're saying it may now go both ways.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:49.800]   And the things that for instance the high performance high efficiency chips that we're seeing on the iPhone 13.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.800]   You know, maybe that maybe that.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   When an Antech came out with their, an Antech is great for this.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.800]   They're the only people I think who really should be benchmarking because they don't just download an app and press a button.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   They actually like dig into everything and they published and they're saying yes, the performance cores are 10% faster.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.800]   But the efficiency cores are like 30% faster.
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.800]   And the GPU cores are massively, they throttle, but they're massively faster.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:17.800]   And they looked at the 120 years display and they're like this actually has way better power characteristics than anything we've seen.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   And that sort of stuff will filter into what we're getting on the Mac as well.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   So those, it's not just like a generational thing, it's not just a number.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:32.800]   But it's like the Mac, the M1X is supposed to have two efficiency cores, eight performance cores as opposed to four and four, like on the M1.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.800]   So that's less efficient.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.800]   So people are worrying, does that mean battery life is going to be worse?
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.800]   If they're higher performance efficiency cores, will it be much worse?
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.800]   Does Mac OS low power mode, I'm out connect?
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.800]   So there's a lot of speculation going on, but it's going to be really interesting.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.800]   So the chip hounds are the ones that are going to be watching most closely on Monday.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.800]   I think anybody, anybody ready to buy a new Mac.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.800]   It's really close.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:12:02.800]   So we've, it's pushed off buying a, my nephew graduated from Rhode Island School of Design in the summer.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.800]   And I promised him he needed a nice hot new laptop for his new graphics design jobs.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.800]   And I thought, I said, oh, it's going to come out in June, the WWDC will get to the new 16 inch.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.800]   It didn't, I bought them an air and I said, give the air to your brother when we get the 16.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.800]   And we've been waiting ever since.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.800]   I think this Monday's is the day.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.800]   Absolutely.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:38.800]   Not only because of the new chips, but also because this is the final, this is the final erasure of the blight upon the Macbook line known as the 2016 Macbook for a refresh where this is the, this is the, this is the Andy was right edition where they go.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.800]   You know what?
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.800]   You know what?
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.800]   Maybe, maybe we, maybe we should have put a SD card slot there.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:49.800]   Maybe we should have put, maybe the, maybe we should have put physical function keys up there.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.800]   Maybe we should have an HDMI port up there.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.800]   So it really is like a return to form.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:06.800]   Like let's make something more practical, less something that doesn't quite look so great in a keynote presentation, but looks great every single day you pull it out and you don't have to pull out like eight dongles to make the damn thing work.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.800]   We should point out you are functioning on rumor.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.800]   We don't know anything about it.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.800]   Exactly.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.800]   Right.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   The rumor is it will have the Alex was right, magsafe adapter.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.800]   Yes.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.800]   Andy was right.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.800]   HDMI port SD card slot port.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.800]   The Leo was right.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.800]   No freakin touch bar.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.800]   What were you right about Renee?
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.800]   Intel being just completely.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.800]   No Intel.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.800]   So we are all right Andy.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.800]   Andy was right even earlier and I want to see ethernet back.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.800]   Oh, he's going to be.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.800]   That's going to be like the iMac.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.800]   Literally every Andy and I write about the butterfly keyboard too.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.800]   Exactly.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.800]   No from day one.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.800]   Yeah, but they fixed that.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   At least they fixed that before they realized that, okay, no, this is a crime against humanity.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.800]   We're about to be dragged up from the front of the Hague if we don't fix this keyboard.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.800]   You know, as we do, you know, all these video things, you can tell, I can always tell someone on the other side has gone wifi.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:09.800]   So I'm always plugged into ethernet and every single time I plug an adapter into into a computer for my ethernet.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.800]   I think of Andy.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   Andy, what's right about?
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.800]   Well, if it's an power brick like the iMac, Alex, would that be okay?
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.800]   What?
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.800]   I love the idea of ethernet and the power brick.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.800]   I love that idea.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.800]   It looks like it's going to be an power brick like the iMac.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.800]   You think so?
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.800]   Because then it's under the desk, it's on the floor.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.800]   It's plugged in as it should be.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.800]   And you don't unplug anything when you take the laptop.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.800]   You just take off the mag safe and you go.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.800]   That's great.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.800]   That's how it should be because you're always plugged in.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.800]   I mean, these are networks next to the plug, basically.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.800]   It would be great if it had the ethernet and the, and on the USB C and then you have like a hub to it and everything else.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.800]   You plug in your power and you're like, I have all the things.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.800]   That would be interesting.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.800]   That's going to be a disaster with all the dust and dirt that you get on the floor.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.800]   That's going to follow up that USB C really quickly.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.800]   But that's it.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:58.800]   But that is a, that would be a great move forward because you would, apple would suddenly be giving us that like $12.15 dongle for free because they're good.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.800]   That's a talk.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.800]   That's a good point though.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.800]   I mean, you then you're giving us a talk.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.800]   Well, no, but just by the way, I should give it out.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.800]   Microsoft does that or did that in the original surfaces.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.800]   They had a USB port on the power.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.800]   Andy knows that power is going to be 50 bucks more expensive.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:25.800]   Well, again, if we're assuming, assuming we're not moving towards the future, which apple says that we feel as though as our gift to the environment, we're no longer going to give you a charger along with your $2000.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.800]   That would be a little too much.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.800]   I know, I know.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:40.800]   But this way, but this way, they can give us a little bit of extra functionality that actually actually fits perfectly because like you said, you don't, nobody likes to show off their ethernet cables.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.800]   The ethernet cable is the, is the, is the snake in the grass literally on the, on my, on my office carpet.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.800]   So there's no better place to put it than put it right on the floor.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.800]   So yeah, that would be a really great move.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:16:00.800]   So probably also there was a rumor 14 and 16 inch, right? Roughly the same, both MacBook Pros with the pro underline.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.800]   Yeah, the 13 inch would get the same treatment.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.800]   This is the 15 year Scott in 2019 and just have the bezels.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.800]   Thanos snapped in half.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.800]   So I'd fill more of the frame roughly the same size, but a bigger display.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:19.800]   The other rumor was that one of the reasons this wasn't available in the June is these, they're going to use mini LED displays, the same display they use on the iPad Pro.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.800]   And it's difficult to produce in quantity.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.800]   Apparently.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.800]   Does that make sense?
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:40.800]   Yeah, there was a, there was a tweet from an analyst who specializes in, in the panel industry, who said specifically that, thank you very much, who said specifically that this is basically a scaled up version of the 12.9 inch iPad Pro display.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:49.800]   I think he committed to mini LED.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:57.800]   If that's true, that's another point in favor of this being a really landmark MacBook Pro, because that is one stellar display after having used it for several months.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:05.800]   I'll be frank, maybe I just don't have the good eyes, but I don't really see any big difference in the iPad Pro with many.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:14.800]   If you put them side by side, you'll see it like if you put them side by side and you put on something that's high dynamic range, you'll see the blacks are much deeper and 1600 nits Leo that could give you a tan.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:20.800]   But you have to put them side by side. It isn't always 1600 nits only with the very brightest specular highlight kind of things.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.800]   I don't think it's in a day to day use.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.800]   I don't, I don't.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.800]   Maybe you would notice it Alex because you have to do probably great.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.800]   It's my job.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.800]   That's what I do.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.800]   So, you know, I definitely noticed I do.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:36.800]   I have noticed now I take these, I took some video recently of a sunset and it looks so good on my iPhone.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.800]   And then I send it, I send it to somebody and they opened up their liquor.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.800]   It's all kind of blown out.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.800]   I was like, oh, you don't have, like, oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.800]   But I think that that's going to hit people more and more.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:54.800]   Like you just notice how your photos and your video on your iPhone look so much better on your iPhone or on your iPad than they do everywhere else and you're like, okay, well.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:02.800]   And you start noticing the TV now, I keep on thinking, one of my TVs is still SDR and I keep on looking at, what is wrong with this picture?
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.800]   And then I'm like, oh, it's just not HDR.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:16.800]   Well, there's also a rumor that Apple has secretly switched to 10-bit panels, which like they've been doing 10-bit internally for years and they just temporarily dither it to make it look like more colors than the 8-bit physical panels could produce.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.800]   But one of the rumors in an Antech was that they're actually showing full 10-bit color now.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:25.800]   And if that is propagating across their new panel lineup, that's like a lot of people, again, won't notice a difference.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   Some people don't see high frame rate.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.800]   Some people don't notice high resolution.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.800]   Some people could care less about, you know, wide gamut.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.800]   But some people do notice it.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:40.800]   And when you're working on this stuff, like every day, editing every day, those little things just make it so much more accurate and so much a better experience for you.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.800]   I'm really excited that this is like pushing the industry again the way the IMac did when it went 5K.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.800]   And the hard part, though, is it's really, it's much harder.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.800]   You know, like, it's much harder to produce.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.800]   Like, I just finished, like, literally last night in the middle of the night, I finished a 709 project.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.800]   And Rick's 709 is so cute.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.800]   Like, it's like, it's like a little color space.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.800]   Like, it's so much easier than what I'm used to.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.800]   You know, like, I'm used to everything's all vision or PQ or something like that.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.800]   And so I was like, oh, this is just a little 709 project.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.800]   I can just color correct it and call it a day.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:18.800]   But this is where Apple limits our choice and makes things simpler, so to speak, where, like, I wound up with that advanced display because I wanted the 12.9 inch.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.800]   I didn't want the 10 inch iPad.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.800]   And so, well, congratulations.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.800]   You're just paying for the, you're paying for the best display you can possibly get.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.800]   So, well, could you give me, like, the same display as the smaller one, but knock 150 bucks?
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.800]   No, congratulations.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:47.800]   You have the best display there is, which is completely appropriate when you're talking about a device that is positioned not for content consumption, but for people like me who I want the larger display because one of the things I like to do with it is photo editing and photo retouching.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.800]   And so that's the arena in which you do appreciate the difference.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.800]   It's not going to be the sort of thing where everybody is going to see the benefit.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.800]   So that's why they have to be very, very judicious in where they put this panel.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:06.800]   One thing also, though, a lot of people don't know what they don't see 4K different than 1080p until you watch a lot of 4K.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:12.800]   And so by having it in everything, it means that you're pushing that whole thing where people are getting used to it.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:17.800]   And you start looking at everything else kind of, you don't know why, but it feels different.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.800]   And that's the thing that happens is...
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:28.800]   I get that, but that also means you're pushing the prices of things up, 100 bucks, 150 bucks for something that people might not really appreciate.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.800]   That's usually my opinion.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:36.800]   I guess I'll always argue that they don't appreciate it immediately, but it also creates the market that allows people to create those things.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:48.800]   So the market, like you can't really create until Apple started, Apple's main HDR really work as a platform, and almost nobody else has, from a computing perspective.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:57.800]   And the same thing with spatial, allowing us to be able to develop for it means that it builds that whole industry.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:03.800]   Because there's millions of devices that you can do it, not the handful of people that they'll be asking for.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:11.800]   People don't know what to ask for, but the thing is, is after a couple years of watching HDR and listening to spatial, you know, because I've spent a couple years doing that.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:19.800]   And I was watching Foundation and they're barely mixing, for whatever reason, at least in the first one, they're barely mixing to the side speakers.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.800]   And I was just like, "Why are they mushing all the stuff up into the front?"
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.800]   Are you wasting a lot of time?
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.800]   People complain about their foundation that they can't understand the dialogue.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.800]   Scott Wilkinson and Steve Gibson both said, "I can't understand the dialogue. Is that because they did that?"
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.800]   That's partially. I mean, they're mushing everything up.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.800]   The big thing with immersive sound isn't just that it's all around you.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   It's that your brain can actually put all that sound in different places.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:51.800]   And somehow it doesn't help with Tenet, but in general it allows your brain to separate what's going on.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:58.800]   If you listen to a lot of stuff that's done in Atmos for music, you suddenly hear instruments that you didn't hear before.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.800]   Because your brain has a place to put them, they're not all in one place.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:06.800]   And so it's more than just being around and just being able to identify it.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:15.800]   And specifically when you're not just dealing with two channels when you have a surround, you have a center speaker that is typically your voice track.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:21.800]   And that makes it a lot easier to actually, for me it makes it a lot easier to hear, except for Tenet.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:26.800]   The thing that was really super exciting to me too is, according to MacRumors, what they found in the source code for macOS Monterey
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.800]   is that these displays are going to be actual retina displays.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:36.800]   Right now the resolution isn't high enough to use a desktop scaler to get us 1.5x, but these will be true 2x panels.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:42.800]   And again, a lot of people don't care. They don't care if every pixel is not on the grid, if there's anti-aliasing and mushiness and stuff.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.800]   But for people who really want, you know, I want the pixels that I got, you know, I want a real retina,
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.800]   these should be the first real retina display, Macs.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:54.800]   Not 4K, but like every pixel will be at 2x what a traditional Mac was.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   Let's take a look. It's kind of become a tradition when you go on your iPhone to the Apple Event page
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.800]   and you tap the logo. Let's see what magic can...
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:12.800]   We've got magic for you. Yes we do. It's an augmented reality. That's really disappointing.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.800]   There's going to be more, right, in a minute.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.800]   Look at it. There it is. There it is. And look what happens.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.800]   Look what happens when I stream through the Time Warp.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.800]   There comes an Apple logo. There comes a day.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.800]   It's just a great disturbance in the false.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.800]   I wish I had... Notice how it's going under your table.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.800]   Is it really? Some of it looked like it was going to be a table.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.800]   Oh, it is. Totally right. So that's why it didn't trigger right away.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.800]   I had to give it the flat surface. It was supposed to go under.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   It had to get something, yeah. I had nowhere to go.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.800]   Wow. That's kind of cool. Prepare my ship.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.800]   I will go to Lord Vader's ship and apologize personally for losing the Falcon.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.800]   It's actually going behind you, Alex. Look at that.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.800]   Look at it. I hope you don't mind those things streaming behind you there.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.800]   And that's the big advantage of the light arm. Yeah. Look at that. That's amazing.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.800]   And this is that old iPhone 12 that nobody wants anymore.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:09.800]   Imagine what this would be like an augmented reality.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.800]   Like if you had the Apple goggles on. Yeah.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.800]   Yeah. I'd be throwing up right now. That's what it would be like.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.800]   You feel like an e-shot in the face.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.800]   I love it that...
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.800]   Cultimat calls this an Easter egg that it says October 18th and the thing.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   But it also pops up on my screen as you can see.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:31.800]   Would you like to add it to your calendar? So it's not exactly a surprising thing.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.800]   But still, that's cool. Yeah, that really is cool that it's going behind you, Alex.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   And Andy. It's going behind both of them.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.800]   Oh, no. It's going a little bit over Andy.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   Some is behind, some is over. So a reflective...
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.800]   You're at a reflective angle for it.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.800]   So it'll have a little harder time in certain angles.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.800]   You see the reflections are...
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.800]   You need your one conclusion. Your conclusion is denuclear.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.800]   Yeah. Or your Fitbit, one or the other.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:00.800]   But it's pretty slick. And I think part of this is that it keeps on having you get to think about what...
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.800]   What it might be like with the future will hold.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.800]   Well, it turns the person up and the user's self off.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.800]   Because the future doesn't have very good battery life.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.800]   Okay, go ahead. The future overheats your CPU.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.800]   But other than that.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:23.800]   No, but this is just brilliant. It's a bit of fun, but also it turns out from something that you just sort of noticed that,
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.800]   okay, I guess sometime next week there's going to be a...
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:32.800]   You just spent like 30 seconds to a minute focusing on this big 1018 1018.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.800]   And now you're going to be like at dinner tonight and say, "Can you pass the 1018 please?"
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.800]   When you...
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.800]   On the meatloaf.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:50.800]   What... So laptops pretty much we agree for sure, right? A 14 inch and a 16 inch higher end M1X or some similarly named...
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:59.800]   Processor, Mini LED displays. We're hoping we're crossing our fingers for MagSafe plus more ports.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.800]   Maybe in AirPods.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.800]   You think we'll see AirPods with... These have been rumored all year that they've been...
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:09.800]   And by the way, it would just be an AirPods 3 would be a redesign of the existing AirPods, right?
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.800]   Yeah, I think that it's the right time to do it before Christmas.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.800]   So it's... I think that would be the time to do it.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.800]   That was the reason why they had to do it on October 18th.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:22.800]   Well, the interesting thing is they've never done AirPods on stage except for the first ones.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.800]   The AirPods Pro, the AirPods Pro Max and the AirPods 2 were all press release dumps.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.800]   They were never even any stage time.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.800]   Have you guys lost anything with the AirPods by the way?
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:32.800]   I was thinking about it because of the one.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.800]   I have and I never found it.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.800]   Oh my gosh.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   The funny thing is that I lost my keys the other day and I opened it up and had the new...
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.800]   Find them rather than having them beep.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.800]   And I hit it and it's like it's behind you and I turned around and it's like 12 feet, 10 feet.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.800]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:54.800]   It works really well when you're in the same room as the thing you lost.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.800]   But if you are not in the same room, it says, "Get closer.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.800]   I can't see them."
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.800]   Well, if I knew where they were, I wouldn't need to.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.800]   That's the ultra-wound band.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:04.800]   It's also a pandemic.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.800]   So there's not a lot of people mulling around a lot of places where they can pick up your...
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.800]   Yeah, in my house, I guess that's the problem.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.800]   I need more people with iPhones in my house.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.800]   It took me pretty far.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:20.800]   It was up in my bedroom and I was down in my office and it was like, just go this way and
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.800]   head a little arrow and I just followed it up and I was there and I was like, "Okay, this
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.800]   is..."
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:32.800]   I just want to report, you shouldn't rely on this because it works.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.800]   When it works, it works nicely.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.800]   It was also a bug that they just fixed in the latest update.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.800]   Oh, okay.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.800]   Some of the find my stuff wasn't showing up on the...
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   So it was in my purse in the...
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:48.800]   It's European.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:53.800]   It's European carry-all in the living room and I was in the bedroom so I was maybe 30 feet
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.800]   away but there were two walls in between me.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.800]   I don't know where it is.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.800]   I have no idea.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.800]   It's somewhere.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.800]   Get closer.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:09.800]   So what I end up doing, I've done this twice now, is I have to wander all over the house until it wakes up.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:14.800]   And in my purse, this beeping sound isn't loud enough to really hear it outside.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.800]   I will say, I want my big complaints is that you can barely hear the beeping.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.800]   It's very, very faint.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.800]   So just compare to a tile.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.800]   Don't play Marco Polo with your keys.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.800]   Unless you really can't find them.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.800]   And I admit, if more people are in my house, maybe it'll work better.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.800]   The funniest thing that I've ever used is that I've barely used my car while I've...
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.800]   Sorry, Andy.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:42.800]   Oh, I was just going to say, I've tried four different tags over the past year and none of them work as well as you hope they would.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:49.800]   You have to think of them as almost like a reserve parachute where, okay, this is not designed to get this designed.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:50.800]   That's a good analogy.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   Hopefully, hopefully, if not, instead of being definitely screwed, maybe it will find it for me.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:02.800]   And I have to say that Apple does a much better job with alerts than the tile app does because the tile...
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   I've had to actually turn off alerts on tile because it's always giving me false alerts.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.800]   I notice you left the house without your laptop bag.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:16.800]   And number one, yes, I did, but that was because I'm just going around the corner to go to the store.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:22.800]   And I forgot to turn it off before then, but also because every time that happens, I always think about...
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:30.800]   So I didn't get this alert until it was like five, six, seven minutes, eight minutes later, where I want to find out...
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   I want there to be like a 20-foot leash.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:39.800]   And when that leash is broken, when I can just turn around, go right back to the security check and pick up the bag that I love.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:44.800]   I don't want to say, "Oh, by the way, your bag has probably been stolen by now.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:52.800]   Don't tell me something at a point which, okay, it's 10 minutes later, you are definitely on the subway now and rocketing towards Cambridge.
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   There's no way in hell you're going to be able to turn around in time to actually correct the stupid mistake that you made.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:08.800]   I have to say there was a brief period Apple must have fixed it of about two or three days where I was getting constant alerts saying you've left your bag behind.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.800]   You left your bag behind, you left your bag.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.800]   I still get those.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.800]   You still get those?
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.800]   In my car.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:26.800]   If I park my car in the driveway, I'll go into the house and it'll say, "But the things I barely use my car now, so whenever I go to my car, it's like once a week to get groceries, it starts beeping with the thing that someone may have left this behind because it's been so long since anything connected to it."
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.800]   So I go, "D-D-D-D-D."
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.800]   I'm like, "Yes, I know you're there, I put you there."
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.800]   So for all of them...
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.800]   I'd be managing a period.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:33.800]   I'd be managing a period.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.800]   They're not perfect.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   They're not sentient.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.800]   No, nor can they be.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:39.800]   They're still nifty.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:50.800]   Speaking of not perfect, I'm not going to trust John Prosser anymore, but he does say there'll be a new Mac mini as well, and that would make a lot of sense on Monday.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.800]   And actually holding back from behind the next ten.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.800]   I know it's very tempting.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.800]   I have no need for this at all, but it's very tempting.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.800]   Between '09, '09, '09, I think we've bought like 20 so far.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:10.800]   I just rendered some real...I was rendering 8K footage on an 8GIG Mac mini last night, and I was just like, "This is amazing."
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.800]   And it was really fast, I mean, for what it was doing.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.800]   And the memory didn't seem to matter.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.800]   I did run out of memory finally.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.800]   I did something that made it run out of memory, but it was...
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.800]   But it's...they're amazing little machines.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.800]   I mean, an upgraded one would definitely have me just buy more.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:32.800]   So there is a new YouTube Flex. It's really interesting how you YouTubers René like to flex in certain ways.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:38.800]   Like Marques Brownlee has the robot arm. Prosser of late has been doing renders of the rumors.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:39.800]   Yes.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.800]   And I think it's really even more misleading, because this is kinders.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.800]   The rumor doesn't actually tell you enough to do a render, but nevertheless.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.800]   So there's a little background for this.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:54.800]   Like for Android and Windows products, the manufacturer almost always uploads images to the website months before the products come out.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.800]   And people like EV Leaks find these renders and post them.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.800]   So you know exactly what all the Android phones are going to look like.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.800]   Or Google Leaks on themselves now. I mean, that's a thing.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.800]   But Apple doesn't do that.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.800]   Like once in a while, the day before, people like Guillem O'Rambo have found them.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.800]   But they've learned to not do that.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:18.800]   So to sort of fill that gap, people like Onleaks and John Prosser make their own based on the CAD files that they find.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.800]   Yeah. So this is on CAD files, if it's a real CAD file.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.800]   A plexiglass now on the top.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   A plexiglass-like reflective surface on the top, according to Prosser.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:34.800]   And on an otherwise aluminum enclosure, it will be slimmer.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.800]   Which makes sense, because Apple Silicon means heat's not as much of a problem.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.800]   Lots of...
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.800]   Look at those.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.800]   Look at those.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.800]   Is this possible for Thunderbolt 3 ports?
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.800]   Or what is that?
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.800]   Thunderbolt 4?
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.800]   USB A2?
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.800]   USB C something.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.800]   Alex's favorite cable port.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   And by the way, even though the USB...
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.800]   By the way, I don't have any...
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.800]   My thing is, it's not that I hate the USB C.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.800]   It's just that I don't think it should be standardized.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:05.800]   You hate it.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:06.800]   It is standardized.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.800]   In theory, there's a...
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:14.800]   In fact, even the USB organ recently even added to the logos that are supposed to be stamped on every cable.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:15.800]   They're so bad.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.800]   They don't consume the same event.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:21.800]   They don't consume the same event.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.800]   But they don't know cable uses in large lengths.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.800]   Nobody puts them on their computers.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.800]   You do put a little Thunderbolt though.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   You still have to guess.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.800]   If you just use a Thunderbolt cable, if you pay for the really expensive Thunderbolt cables, it'll work for everyone.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:35.800]   Well, that was my solution to Alex's.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.800]   You're buying cheap cables.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.800]   Just buy cables that do it all.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:39.800]   No, it's just that...
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.800]   My thing is not that...
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:42.800]   Because everyone thinks I hate USB C now.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.800]   And I have to definitely set that up for yourself.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.800]   I just don't think...
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.800]   I know I did.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.800]   But my whole thing is that it's just that I just don't think the government should be trying to decide what...
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.800]   Things change every year.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:53.800]   It's the US...
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.800]   Oh, you're saying with the EU saying...
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.800]   EU.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.800]   That was my argument.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.800]   Is that we shouldn't start telling people exactly what...
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.800]   Remember, they were trying to do...
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.800]   What was it?
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.800]   USB Micro USB was the one that they were going to standardize us on 10 years ago.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:09.800]   So the thing is, is that we look back on that and go, "Well, that would have been pretty silly."
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.800]   And we'll just look back at this one that same way.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.800]   You put a second word.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.800]   Like they said that.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.800]   I don't have any problem with USB C.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:15.800]   You can use the PC if you want.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.800]   Alex, I'm going to send you this.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.800]   This is a graphic from A to Thruit.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.800]   Everything you need to know about USB C.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.800]   It's all in there, Alex.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.800]   I don't know why you're confused.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.800]   I know, exactly.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.800]   It looks like a QAnon diagram.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.800]   I know, it was just this attempt to do everything.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.800]   And it just, it was like...
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.800]   Some are 10 gigs and some are 480 mags and some are...
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.800]   No.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.800]   This actually, this diagram actually makes your point, Alex, I have to say.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.800]   This is really what yours is.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.800]   This is humorous.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.800]   This is engineers going awry.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.800]   You know, like, we can put this in and then what if we do this and then it can do this
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.800]   and this and then it can do that and that.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.800]   And then we don't have to always do that.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.800]   You do have to always do it.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.800]   That's the problem.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.800]   So USB 2.1, 2.3, 3.4 is a USB.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.800]   Because the letters are for the type of plug, but the numbers are for the speed of the plug, guys.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.800]   That's how we're going to do it.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.800]   Oh my gosh.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.800]   I think this, I don't know if this comes from A to Fruit.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.800]   I got it from A to Fruit.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.800]   I don't know if they made it or if...
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   And then Apple's controller supports you as Thunderbolt 4, but they're only delivering Thunderbolt 3.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.800]   It goes right down the rabbit hole, Leo.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.800]   It's crazy.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.800]   Yeah, I think this is...
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.800]   A to Fruit made this.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:26.800]   So thank you A to Fruit.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.800]   Isaac Wellish.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.800]   But I'm with Alex.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.800]   I'm so hyped for like a revamp Mac mini.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   Last...
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.800]   I could have bit on the Mac mini last year if it not for the...
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   It had the same limitations as the M1X in terms of output, in terms of how many channels they have for accessories.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:56.800]   And so the idea of having something that's more akin to the Intel Mac mini in terms of what I can plug into it and how many displays I can use at the same time,
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   coupled with the M1X processor.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:04.800]   Because I know regrets whatsoever about having bought this MacBook Pro last year,
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:10.800]   because I desperately needed an upgrade and I will be able to use this once I replace it with a desktop sometime this year or next.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   But oh my god, it's so...
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.800]   It's gonna be so hard not to just simply spend the money.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:25.800]   I've set aside for what I want to buy during the Google event to buy it the day before spending it on the M1X Mac mini if that comes out at the same time.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.800]   And I think that the thing for me is that they're just so...
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.800]   Before Mac mini's were kind of...
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:37.800]   They're cute. They were like little glue that you could use, like little servers that serve up keys and do little things.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   What changed with the M1 is that they actually are powerful enough to run Resolve and they're in a final cut in motion and Cinema 4D and all these other things.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.800]   And they're really fast at doing that.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:55.800]   And so suddenly you have this really powerful computer that's this tiny little box and you can rack mount two of them and I got them stacked up over them.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.800]   Exactly.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.800]   And they're quiet.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:07.800]   Yeah, exactly. It's the unsung hero of the Mac lineup because it's the one thing where you'll always find a place for this in your house or in your office where...
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:15.800]   When I buy a new Mac mini where this year or next year, it's gonna be my desktop powerful Mac.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:23.800]   My previous Intel Mac mini is going to go onto another desk and it's probably going to be basically for ripping files or for crunching.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.800]   I actually have an older Mac mini that's...
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.800]   Exactly.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.800]   Actually with the glass now can be like an induction cooktop.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.800]   But that would have to be the Intel.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.800]   But then the older...
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   I actually have an older one that I bought at the MIT flea market that I actually use as a media server, like running Plex.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:51.800]   So no matter how old it is, it's an iMac at some point or an iMac or a MacBook, at some point you can't get away from the fact that it is not shaped to be a nondescript little box that you just put into whatever workflow you've got.
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:54.800]   With the Mac mini it's designed specifically.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:05.800]   It's got to be one of the best, most interesting challenges that Apple design has where we have to make it look cool coming out of the box, but once it's on the desk, it can't get in the way, it can't attract attention.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.800]   And so this is the solution that come up with.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   Here's a rounded rectangle of aluminum that looks like an app award you get for being an Apple for five or ten years.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.800]   I feel like somebody just looked at it.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.800]   They just looked at the cube and just said, "If we just squeeze this really hard..."
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.800]   We don't need any of this crap.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.800]   We don't have a hard drive anymore.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.800]   We don't have the smaller memory.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.800]   We can just get through this dead air.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   And the parts are cooler.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.800]   So, I mean, that's really cool.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:39.800]   Actually, Apple may silk screen the USB C logos on there because those renders may not have the additional stuff.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.800]   You've seen the real ones?
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.800]   Yeah, these are really attractive.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.800]   I can't wait till Apple puts... I don't see this happening.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:50.800]   You're supposed to glance at these and they're so complicated.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.800]   This is supposed to go on a cable.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   My small cable is supposed to put all the crap on it.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:00.800]   This is designed by the same people who designed the SD card standard logos.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   Okay, this is what speed is it?
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.800]   What can I use it with?
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.800]   We have no idea what it's for.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:08.800]   That's totally confusing.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.800]   I don't have to admit that my...
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.800]   You must see X-E.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:19.800]   Yeah, to Renee's point, the main thing I make sure when I grab cables, I look around, I have them all stacked up and I make sure I find ones with lightning bolts.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.800]   Like, I just look for the lightning bolts.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:21.800]   I've got to grab...
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.800]   That's all I do.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.800]   And they're little thick.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.800]   Everything will work.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:25.800]   They're a little thicker.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.800]   So, you can also do it by touch.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.800]   Actually, heat shrink a little red band around the end of it.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:32.800]   So, I can tell this is expensive.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.800]   Don't lend this.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   Specifically, don't lend this.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.800]   This is a $30 cable.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.800]   That's not a power cable.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:51.800]   Bloomberg, Mark Gurman, last week said the new Mac Mini will feature the M1X or M2 with eight high performance cores, two efficiency cores.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.800]   That seems like a reasonable prediction.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:40:00.800]   64 gigs of RAM at max and will feature more thunderbolt lanes.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:07.800]   So, and this is probably...you could probably extrapolate that this would be what you would see in a 16 inch MacBook Pro as well, right?
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.800]   Like, these will be similar designs, I would imagine.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.800]   They'll be the same trend.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   And I think that it'll probably perform probably nearly as good as a base level.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.800]   Mac Pro.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.800]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.800]   What about graphics processes?
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.800]   Probably a thing of...
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.800]   No, yeah.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.800]   Exactly.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.800]   No dedicated GPU.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:37.800]   So, the address is a lot with you, Alex, and I'd be very curious what you say after Monday, but it feels like Apple is still lagging behind what the top of the line radiance or Nvidia's can do.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:49.800]   Maybe the top of the line, but for what most people need to use, we have to rethink that when you have all those lanes that are all tied together with the CPU and the memory, there's just a lot more that you can do that you can't do through the buses.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.800]   And so, I think that Apple gains a lot.
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:57.800]   I don't think it's...I don't think they're competing with quadri cards, you know, but I think that they are competing with a lot of people.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.800]   I'm competing with a lot of the game level stuff.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:12.800]   And really, again, what 90% of the...I think the Mac Pro will come out sometime next year and it'll have places for you to put, unfortunately, AMD cards in it, not Nvidia.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:17.800]   So, you'll have to be able to put stack a bunch of cards into it, I think.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:25.800]   But the...I think that for what you're buying the Mini 4, the Mac Pros, everything else, I think you're ending up with an incredible amount of GPU speed.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:32.800]   I just know that I'm doing 4 and 8K work on my Mini and it's pretty quick, you know.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.800]   Well, if I could add to that quickly, like they...
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:43.800]   If they have 32 and 64 gigabytes of RAM options and you're using unified memory, you now have a GPU as being fed by 32 or 64 gigabytes of RAM, more or less.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:48.800]   And that is unheard of, I think, when it comes to just GPUs and a laptop, never mind desktops.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.800]   And exchanging all that data back and forth is so much faster than the bus.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.800]   So, it really is a different...
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.800]   It's not...
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:00.800]   And where it falls down is people who are addressing those cards directly.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.800]   So, that's where it doesn't...that may not be as efficient.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:10.800]   But when you're writing for it, and specifically when you're writing to metal, you're going to be in a better position.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.800]   So, you're going to buy 10?
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.800]   I'll probably buy a couple.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.800]   I just add to that again.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:26.800]   I was going to say the new office hours are already used as five and we still are already in another five to do what we're doing.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.800]   And so, we're probably buying at least three to five of them.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   Renee?
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:37.800]   I was just going to say, if you add to that, like Apple is increasingly moving off the big cores, which I think is smart because you're going to run into thermal envelope problems, Intel's run into them AMD.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.800]   Even on a desktop.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:39.800]   Apple is running into them.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:40.800]   Even on a desktop.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:42.800]   Even on a desktop.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.800]   But what they're doing, so they...
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.800]   Like, we talked about this last week, the A15, it's a double cold core.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:43:02.800]   It's blizzard and avalanche, and the cache, the whole thing runs much cooler, runs way more efficiently, and they're putting a lot of stuff off the big CPU block, like the big compute cores with dedicated accelerators, like H.264, H.265, now ProRes.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.800]   The audio stuff is all off the cores.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:16.800]   And if they have a box that not only has unified memory for the CPU, the GPU, the neural engine, which they're doing a lot more stuff on now too, but they have dedicated ProRes blocks, dedicated H.264 blocks, dedicated audio processor blocks.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:17.800]   What a necessary...
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:18.800]   That thing is going to scream.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:19.800]   Holy...
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:20.800]   Like, never mind a GPU anymore.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:24.800]   Like, the whole idea of what a GPU did is being deprecated and spread over a bunch of different...
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:27.800]   If you don't have discrete components, it's all in the SOC.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.800]   And 64 gigs of unified memory, you think they can go that high?
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:36.800]   Feeding the image processor, feeding the neural engine, feeding the ProRes and code decode blocks.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.800]   Like, it's a whole new way of thinking about computers.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:40.800]   This is exciting.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.800]   It's an afterburner in a laptop.
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:44.800]   Right.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:49.800]   And I think that by the time we get to the Mac Pro, we can be talking 128, 256, you know, those kinds of...
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:54.800]   And all of that stuff is being totally accessible by the GPU and the CPU are mostly accessible.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:05.800]   So really what Monday will be is a day to kind of geek out on this platform, this new Apple Silicon platform and what it can do.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.800]   And that makes a lot of sense.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.800]   I don't think you delude it with AirPods or anything else.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:13.800]   This is all about Apple Silicon and what it can do.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.800]   The one thing that occurs to me right after Alex said it is that they came out with...
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:22.800]   Back when they were talking about the A10 and the Fusion, the thing they said was their secret sauce was the performance controller.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:26.800]   It was the thing that could choose which core to direct any particular task to.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:36.800]   And then when they announced the neural engine, they announced the ML controller, which could figure out between the AMX units on the CPU, the GPU and the neural engine where to send machine learning to.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:46.800]   They've built this entire infrastructure to be incredibly scalable.
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.800]   No one has to write anything for that.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.800]   This is the available compete we have for you.
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.800]   We'll handle the efficiency part.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.800]   You just tell us what you want to do and everything else is done.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.800]   And that is an amazing idea, I think, when it comes to Silicon architecture.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:44:59.800]   It could be a very...
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:05.800]   I would say 64 or 120 or 256 gigs of RAM, not processors.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:06.800]   Of course.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:07.800]   Of course.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.800]   Of course.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:09.800]   That would be amazing.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:10.800]   Why not?
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.800]   It could.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:12.800]   It could.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:19.800]   And I think that the big thing is that there's this process to do this really well.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.800]   You need to be able to make the hardware.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.800]   You need to be able to do the software.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.800]   You need to be able to have the IDE.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:26.800]   All the things that are...
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.800]   You have to have all of those things to get this to really work.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:33.800]   And so that's the hard part that everyone else has is that Apple is going to start running down the path with this.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.800]   It's really hard to do what they're doing.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.800]   If you don't have an entire vertical.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.800]   So they've got the whole thing.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.800]   On top of everything else, this is a brand new opportunity for them they've never had before.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.800]   Usually they used to be able to sell hardware based on Mac versus Windows.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:49.800]   Mac OS versus Windows.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:57.800]   Now they're really on a footing where they can start to say Apple Silicon versus Intel and AMD.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:02.800]   Because it was going to be enough for them last year when they made this announcement to say
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.800]   that it will work.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.800]   You will get better performance.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:07.800]   You will get better performance.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:08.800]   You will get better performance.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.800]   Things will not work worse.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:10.800]   This is a safe thing to do.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:16.800]   We're not entering into a two years of transition in which you'll have to choose between Intel or Apple Silicon
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.800]   because Intel will be stable and work.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.800]   And Apple Silicon is for early adopters.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:25.800]   No, we are telling you that this is like drop in replacement for whatever you have right now.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:30.800]   This year and maybe next year when they do the NM2 is when they can say,
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:35.800]   "No, no, no, look, we are establishing ourselves where we can flex ourselves as a chip manufacturer."
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:42.800]   If you want the most powerful machines that can do things that nothing else that at Best Buy can do
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:47.800]   or anything else that's available for a purchase order can do, you want a Mac now because
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:53.800]   here are the things that not only, and it's not where as AMD or who's Intel is largely a battle of numbers
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:58.800]   where you do have to go to an Antec and say, "Here are the numbers that this chip generated.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.800]   Here are the numbers that this chip generated.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.800]   Here's what this architecture will do for video.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.800]   Here's what this architecture will do for video."
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.800]   Apple can simply say, "We have a platform that goes way, way beyond that.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:15.800]   Here is every step of the way that is not turning down one single opportunity to increase performance
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:19.800]   from one end of the electron path to the add-on on the screen."
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.800]   Let me put a pin in this because I want to take a break.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:22.800]   We've got to take a break.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.800]   I do want to come back and continue this conversation.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.800]   Normally, I would have moved on to other stuff.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.800]   Let's keep going on this.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.800]   There's also news with Nvidia ARM, and I want to get to that.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:36.800]   If there's a competitor in this space, it's not Intel.
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.800]   If you ask me, it's Nvidia.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.800]   It's an AMD.
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:42.800]   Yeah, well, maybe an AMD, but I think Nvidia also.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.800]   We'll get to that in a second.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   Our show today brought to you by Udacity.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:52.800]   Udacity is the place to get the skills you need to get the job you want in big tech.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:56.800]   If you've been saying, "I wish I could get to work for Apple or IBM or Microsoft or
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.800]   Google or Amazon," this is where you get those skills.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:06.800]   Udacity offers you an online education program geared towards anybody looking to take their
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.800]   technology to the next level.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.800]   They've specialized for the last decade in exciting content.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:13.800]   It really works, by the way.
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.800]   They could help take you further in the career you want.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:22.800]   They offer the latest cutting-edge nanodegree programs, and you can't find these anywhere else.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.800]   By the way, Udacity, it's not just the learning.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.800]   They're here to encourage your career growth.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:31.800]   They want to give you the information about the career you want, give you the skills for
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.800]   that career, and then help you get that job.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.800]   You shouldn't let the pandemic stop you from improving your skills.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:40.800]   In fact, there couldn't be a better time to do this.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.800]   One Udacity graduate lost his job.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.800]   He was working at a Nigerian airline.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.800]   COVID-19 laid him off.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.800]   He decided, "I've got to do something."
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:53.800]   He decided to turn things around, applied for the Machine Learning Scholarship Program
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.800]   for Microsoft Azure.
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.800]   He got the scholarship within six months of receiving it.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.800]   He transitioned into a career as a data analyst.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:04.800]   And by the way, I talk about job security.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:09.800]   Check out one of Udacity's top five nanodegree programs, Data Engineering or Product Manager,
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:14.800]   Data Analyst, Data Scientist, programming for data science with Python.
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:20.800]   If you're looking into getting the most cutting edge technology careers, you can get nanodegree
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:21.800]   programs in AI.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:25.800]   How about this flying car and autonomous flight engineer?
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.800]   Yes, they have a nanodegree program for that.
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:33.800]   Intro to self-driving cars, machine learning engineer, robotics software engineer, and more.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.800]   They're working with the biggest companies in the business.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:40.800]   They select team leads at those companies to be the instructors.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.800]   So you're learning from the best.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.800]   You can get the knowledge from the experts who work in that field every day.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.800]   It's not academic.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.800]   These people know this stuff.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:52.800]   And when you're signing up for a nanodegree program with Udacity, you can expect the courses
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:53.800]   to be project-based.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.800]   I love that.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.800]   Very much hands-on active learning.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.800]   So you'll test your knowledge.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.800]   You won't just learn it.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.800]   You'll use it.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.800]   Homework and projects will be reviewed by qualified professionals.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:09.800]   You'll get real human feedback and reviews with access to mentors 24/7 plus flexible schedules
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.480]   because you've got to make this work with your current job, right?
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.840]   Whether it's five or ten hours a week, it's at your own pace.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:18.960]   You can graduate in as little as three months.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:23.800]   If your team needs to master cutting-edge technologies like data science, AI, and cybersecurity,
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.360]   check out Udacity for enterprise.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:29.800]   You can upskill the entire workforce with a real-world project-based learning.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:33.080]   You'll find it all at the enterprise section of Udacity's website today to learn more.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:37.160]   So whether individual or business, Udacity's got the classes for you.

[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:09.560]   Udacit.yudacity.com/twit.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.640]   Don't forget that offer code "Twit 7.5."
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:15.000]   That way they know you saw it on Macbreak Weekly and we get credit.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.400]   Thank you, Udacity, for preparing people for the next generation.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:27.840]   The NVIDIA bid for ARM, which is now up to $54 billion, shows you how valuable ARM is,
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:31.880]   still on hold and in fact the EU is now saying, "You know what?
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:36.640]   You didn't go far enough to allay our concerns."
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:41.200]   Britain's antitrust agency said, because the ARM is a British company, we're going to maybe
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:46.040]   investigate this now, the EU says it is, four month investigation.
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.640]   It ain't going to happen.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.960]   It's a success of all the tax mergers recently.
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.400]   It's good to be prudent.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.400]   Be prudent.
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:52:00.640]   I know NVIDIA is known for graphics processors, for AI, in car chips and things like that.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:07.320]   But honestly, I think their skills, you bring in ARM, that could make them a competitor
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.320]   to Apple, too, I think, in this space.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.800]   They could do it without buying ARM, though.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:11.800]   ARM could be licensed.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:15.160]   AMD just licenses ARM or X86.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:17.560]   NVIDIA could have done this a long time ago.
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:22.440]   It's odd that they didn't, because AMD has been offering end-to-end solutions and APUs
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:23.440]   for a while now.
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:27.880]   The real question, though, is, and I think I know the answer, can you do what Apple's
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:31.760]   done with Apple Silicon without owning the whole platform?
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.360]   I think you have to own the whole platform.
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.360]   I don't know if you can't.
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:36.560]   I can say that the hill is much steeper.
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.800]   It's just a lot harder to do it that way.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.120]   Apple makes the whole stack.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:41.320]   They do the operating system.
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.320]   They do the hardware.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.000]   They build the machines.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.440]   They can tune it to be exactly what their customers need.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:49.920]   Well, exactly what they're building.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:54.920]   Their final cut in motion and the AR and all the other things are all being built into
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:55.920]   it.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:59.840]   When you think about AR as an extension of the desktop, which is what it'll probably
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:05.640]   become down the path, having all of that graphics and CPU and everything else just all embedded
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:08.640]   into the whole thing is really hard to do other things.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:09.640]   Describe what you're thinking.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:13.560]   Do you think we'll be wearing goggles when we're working in our desktop?
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.480]   Or will you be in rejection?
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:19.880]   I think there might be goggles, but I think that right now it's...
[00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:23.520]   It's odd, but if I get something on the phone, if I send you something on the phone right
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.440]   now, I did a...
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.440]   We just want...
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:31.440]   I'll be able to show it in a couple of weeks here, but we did an AR version of a hardware
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:35.680]   device that we were doing, and we actually animated it all in motion and did all the
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.000]   stuff and it looked great.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.720]   But we built a USDZ version.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.280]   I can send it to somebody.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:42.000]   They can click on it and it pops up on their desk.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.520]   We actually did a shot with it next to the real thing, and we told people, "Got to guess
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:47.520]   which one is real."
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:48.520]   Wow.
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:50.400]   And people were guessing the wrong one.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:54.200]   It popped out of your phone at scale.
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:55.640]   It just comes out of the same size.
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:54:00.080]   We tried it and it literally was the same size, same orientation.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.400]   It looked great.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:06.320]   So, as we think about that, though, imagine being able to...
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:12.280]   You're doing a presentation with a keynote and someone's watching and they can pull out
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:13.440]   their phone and look at it.
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:17.800]   But eventually, we think that the rumors are that there'll be glasses that you'll be
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:18.800]   able to have on.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:23.000]   I think they won't look like anything we've had before and probably a little lighter
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   weight.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.640]   But imagine being able to look down or look up and look over and you just see what they're
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:30.520]   talking about or looking at it.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:35.640]   But it's connected to your phone or your desktop or all of those things.
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:38.720]   It's just an add-on when needed that you would have there.
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:39.720]   And I think that...
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:43.760]   Again, I think that it has to be more integrated and a lot of people like me wear glasses all
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:44.760]   the time.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:48.000]   It'll just be something you're wearing that does the thing.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   I think is the...
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   That's what I hope.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.480]   I don't know anything about it.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:55.400]   On Saturday, Scott Wilkinson was talking about light field labs.
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.120]   Are you aware of this display that they're doing?
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:05.040]   I don't know if this is yet to be good enough to be a 3D AR display.
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:08.320]   But they're using reverse ray tracing here.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.400]   Let me show you the...
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:16.040]   This actually fires into your eyes in effect.
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:18.960]   I can't remember, but a billion pixels, something like that.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.520]   So as you move around, watches will move around a little bit.
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:25.880]   Obviously, the terrarium is real, but the chameleon is not.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:30.560]   And as you move around it, it is projected into the space.
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.240]   And you don't have to stand in any particular place.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:35.680]   It's true 3D without a glasses or anything like that.
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:37.680]   It's very interesting.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:40.480]   It'll always be how do you get...
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:46.120]   The big thing that Apple brings to it is being able to get an enormous number of people with
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:47.680]   access to it.
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:53.200]   A lot of these technologies are amazing and you just don't know how public they will
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.200]   become.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:58.720]   And Apple can roll around to 100 million people.
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:00.080]   These are monitors.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:02.680]   So I'm sure they're hugely expensive.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:10.840]   But I think eventually the idea is 2.5 billion pixels, 40 pixels per square meter.
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:12.160]   And they're firing into your eyes.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:17.920]   So as a result, they're able to basically give you something in front of you that makes
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:22.200]   you feel like you're looking at a 3D object and you can move around it and so forth.
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.200]   I don't know.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:25.200]   It'll be interesting to see.
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:27.400]   There's a demo in LA, if you want to go down there, Alex.
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.640]   You want to go check it out?
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:29.640]   Where is it in LA?
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:30.640]   I'm not going to check it out.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.640]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:32.640]   I'm going to go over this.
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:34.640]   Okay, definitely.
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:37.280]   Look for Lightfield Labs.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:38.440]   It's kind of like a whole...
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.080]   Like remember we used to have holograms.
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.280]   It's kind of like the real deal.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.880]   Actually, maybe they're in San Jose.
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.040]   It looks like they're in San Jose.
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:46.800]   I thought Scott said he was going to be...
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:49.280]   No, I guess he said he was going to come up to San Jose to see it.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.880]   So they're inviting the press up to take a look at it.
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.880]   I would love it if you would and give us your...
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:56.040]   Yeah, I'll see if I can find a light.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:57.040]   I'll reach out to them.
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:58.040]   LightfieldLab.com.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.040]   LightfieldLab.com.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:04.040]   Very interesting stuff.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.920]   So that's what I'm curious.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.160]   I mean, nobody wants to wear...
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:11.160]   Microsoft shows people standing at their desk wearing HoloLens.
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.160]   No.
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.320]   Not for an eight hour day.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.800]   No, I'm not going to do that.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.280]   Nobody wants to do that, right?
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:17.800]   Well, and I think that...
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:22.800]   What I think is interesting is something that would generally feel to people like it wasn't
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.320]   anything extra for them.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.320]   Yes.
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:26.320]   You know, that they wear it.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:30.720]   Especially for people who wear glasses and, unfortunately, for people who build glasses,
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:32.680]   myopia is a dominant gene.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:35.000]   There's an awful lot of people that have them.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   And so...
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:41.560]   But if you have something that just feels like you're wearing it anyway, and then when
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:42.840]   it's needed, it comes up.
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.680]   And it's not something you put on to do something.
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:46.240]   Like, you couldn't do that with glass.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.720]   I got glass when it first came out.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.840]   And the problem was it was always pulling a little to the side and it looked weird.
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:54.640]   You know, there was all this stuff.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:58.240]   And so it wasn't something that you could just wear around all day.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:59.240]   Well, the rubber is...
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:02.200]   Apple's going to have those spectacles in a couple of years, right?
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:03.720]   That's not too far off, really.
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:04.720]   Who knows?
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:05.720]   Who knows?
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:06.720]   I know.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:07.720]   It's hard.
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:08.720]   It's hard to do.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:09.720]   It's out there somewhere.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.720]   Spectacles or goggles?
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:12.720]   That's going to be the big question.
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.720]   Oh, I don't want to wear goggles.
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:14.720]   I'm telling you.
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:17.200]   It's got to be like glasses like Alex says, like spectacles.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:20.400]   I think the big thing with goggles is that it just has to be...
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.120]   And there has to be less friction about putting it on.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:26.360]   If their glasses, if their goggles were something you could just put on and then you interact
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:29.720]   with it all and then you take them off and they generally just work, the problem is
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:35.000]   is that Oculus, for instance, which I have all the Oculus things, and even Quest, you
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.400]   have to go to Facebook and then you have to do this thing and then you have to sign
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:39.360]   up for this thing and it won't run by itself.
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:43.400]   And there's extra stuff that you have to do as opposed to just being able to...
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:44.720]   I'm just going to put it on and have it work.
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:48.200]   And that's what Apple's going to be able to do probably more effectively because they
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:49.800]   have everything else working.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.640]   If they did some kind of goggles, it'd probably be a lot.
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:55.680]   The friction of putting them on and having it immediately do what you want it to do is
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.680]   probably much lower.
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:00.160]   He seems a difference also between virtual reality and augmented reality.
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:01.320]   I mean, that's really...
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:04.160]   I don't want to be sealed off from the world.
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.200]   I want to be able to see the world.
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.120]   Yeah, I think that's...
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:09.120]   Yeah, I mean, sometimes it's...
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.440]   I think that there are times when you want to...
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:15.680]   What Renee said, I mean, I think there are times when being sealed off is quite nice if
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.160]   the resolution's high enough.
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:18.920]   The problem we've had up until now is it's hard.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:20.800]   Like when someone said, "We saw...
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:25.960]   When we saw video in the early '90s at 320x240, we were like, "This is going to take over."
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:29.880]   And broadcasters were like, "Do you know how bad that looks?"
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:33.320]   It's really pretty bad.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:37.360]   And then years later now, online is higher resolution than TV.
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:42.080]   So the resolution and frame rate and all these things become really, really important because
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:48.000]   when you see 8K at 60 frames or 120 frames, it's an entirely different experience.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:54.560]   An 8K per eye, even at 60 frames a second, is compelling, but not...
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:55.560]   But super expensive.
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:57.800]   They're like $100,000 goggles, you know, like, you know, per...
[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:58.800]   Prepare, you know?
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:02.640]   And so the thing is, is that when we get to a point where that price comes down and the
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:07.000]   performance is up there and you're looking at 8K per eye at 120 frames a second or whatever...
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.520]   That's what Apple is supposed to be, right?
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.520]   Like for $3K?
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.520]   I don't know.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.560]   $6,000 for double 8K lenses.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.440]   If it is, it'll be amazing, you know?
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:19.760]   And the thing is, is... but I will say that the point... there's a point at about 6,000 pixels...
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:26.000]   I mean, 6K, I'm sorry, 6K per eye or 8K per eye where the experience of being in VR is
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.200]   completely different.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:32.120]   You know, and as that frame rate goes up, you really start to feel like you're there.
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.700]   And so I think that what we've seen so far is it's not worth it because you put these
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:38.480]   goggles on and they're low res... they're essentially low resolution, you know, per eye.
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.320]   You know, 4K per eye is still pretty low resolution and hard to do.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.960]   And so I think that we have to get to the point where the resolution and frame rates
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.480]   are where they need to be.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:51.760]   And then it starts to get pretty interesting, you know, as far as what you can do.
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.040]   Yesterday, Magic Leap announced their Magic Leap 2 headsets.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.040]   They're still around.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.040]   I'm surprised I thought they went out of business.
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:02.360]   It's not a $500 million.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.840]   But these are AR.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.160]   I tried the first ones.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.960]   They had a very narrow field of view.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:10.360]   So you were seeing the world and then there was projected into it this little box that
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.960]   had a virtual thing.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.640]   This is a little bit larger field of view, apparently.
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:16.640]   That's the first thing.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.040]   That's the universal problem.
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:23.520]   When you have virtual reality goggles, you can create a completely immersive experience.
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:27.520]   Most people that I've talked to, actually myself included, when you try on these augmented
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:33.240]   reality goggles, you're so used to like... it can produce a great experience staring
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.400]   dead ahead.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.160]   So much so that you're disappointed when you turn your head and you realize that this
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.320]   machine is trying to keep up with you because it can't paint something into your peripheral
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.320]   vision.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:46.680]   That's when you realize exactly how important your peripheral vision is to your perception
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:47.680]   of reality.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:51.400]   That's where your cue is that you can create an audio cue that says that, "Hey, there's
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:55.080]   something interesting or something you want to investigate off here to the right."
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:02:00.400]   But unless there's also a little flicker of light or something shadow-twishing, it just
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.960]   doesn't sell.
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:08.360]   And so this is why it's going to be a while, I think, before augmented reality escapes
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:14.040]   from the net it's already in, which is great for training, great for like vertical markets.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.480]   It's going to be a while before it matches the reality of what people are expecting from
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.480]   it.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:22.120]   Okay, we're excited Monday.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.480]   We'll be covering it 10 a.m. Pacific.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:27.160]   That's 1 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:31.360]   1,700 or, yeah, I guess it'll still be 1,700 UTC.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.360]   Yeah, we don't change.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:33.960]   I forget we're getting the daylight saving.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.760]   It's never pushed till November, the end of daylight saving.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.000]   So we will be doing that live.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   You can watch it.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.160]   That TV slash live, of course, you can watch the Apple stream directly, but if you want
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.760]   a little snarkfest.
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:51.680]   No, I think this time it will really be oo-ing and on.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:55.640]   And Renee, do you, I guess there's nowhere to go.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:56.640]   You can watch it anywhere.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.920]   Are they going to, can you tell us whether you're going to get some briefings or anything
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.400]   or do you know?
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.400]   I never know.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.400]   I always hope.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.120]   You know, it's always, it's, I have to do it either way.
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.440]   It's always easier, you know, if I get to get a message.
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:11.000]   Well, we'll be talking about what is your business as well.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.400]   And I hope you'll be here for that.
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.000]   I hope you won't have to go somewhere.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   Oh, for sure.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.520]   On the following day should be very exciting.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.720]   I can't wait.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:26.080]   I will be winging and awning and probably saying take my money.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.760]   Do we want rounded bezels like the surface or do we want square bezels like MacBooks
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.760]   have always had?
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.920]   Well, it's, it's, it's fancy talking about actual rounded bezels.
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.840]   Are you talking about, oh, well, there's some pixels that are there in the, in the display,
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.600]   but we're not going to show them to you.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.440]   My mouse can go to them, but I can't see them.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.440]   Yeah, that's very annoying.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:43.440]   I don't like that at all.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.280]   Is that what the surface does?
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.400]   That's not, yeah, I don't like that at all.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.240]   Yeah, it's, it's, it's not going to affect performance.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.920]   It's not going to affect, but it's just annoying.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.920]   It's not a static.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:57.520]   Like, it's like when you, when you spend that much money on a car and there's an extra click
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:01.920]   when you shut the door, it's like, why couldn't you just make the door just click perfectly
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.160]   instead of just giving me this little annoying.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.240]   Um, good.
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.240]   I'm excited.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.240]   I can't wait.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.720]   I don't have a desktop Macintosh.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:14.880]   I guess I'll have to get the mini to go with my 55 inch OLED display.
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.840]   One thing, one thing that is starting to build up for me is that, is that I, is that I do
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.840]   feel like Apple needs to do a monitor because I feel like I have all, they have one big
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.680]   one, but that's more than I want to spend.
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:23.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:27.920]   And the problem is I have lots of Dell monitors right now that I have all on arms and I swing
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:31.260]   them around and that's why the Mac mini's work and put them kind of like, I need a really
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:36.280]   good HDR monitor that isn't $6,000 or $5,500 or whatever.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:41.680]   And so I think we said OLED was from a, Alienware was about 2000.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:42.680]   So that's not bad.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.720]   55 inch out of Alex Lindsay budget.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.760]   You've not, you've not nailed your mark.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:58.080]   I just don't want to put four of them up.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.080]   Oh my mind in my desk.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.360]   Oh, that's another question.
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.480]   Well, they, I'm sure they will solve the monitor, multi monitor issue.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:06.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.480]   Hopefully.
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:08.480]   We love more Thunderbolt lanes.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.200]   If you have more lanes, more, more, more monitors.
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:15.160]   All they got to do is give me three monitors on a Mac mini and that's, that'll make me
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.160]   happy.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.160]   I know is really good.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:22.960]   Three is, well, I know, I know, but I'm talking about, I'm talking about Apple Silicon Mac
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.960]   mini is what he wants.
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:28.960]   I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know there, I know there are ways to do that,
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.680]   but I want to have like three thunder.
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:31.680]   I don't want to have to buy.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:37.040]   I want to be able to buy three monitors, not three monitors plus three jury rig things.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.440]   I know, I know, I know, I know.
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:43.440]   HyperX has a new thing that gives you two monitors with a single port.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:47.520]   So I'm saying that most consumers are thinking, Oh, well, I plugged this right into the back,
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:48.520]   right?
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:50.800]   Because I have all these extra ports that are like, Oh, no, you buy this extra box and
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.200]   then you make sure that this works is configured correctly.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.760]   And yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:55.760]   Okay.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:56.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:59.360]   I didn't mean to jump on you, but I'm like, I, I've, I've, I've ever been like in like
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:04.960]   Twitter mode where it's like you say that you're going to say, Oh gosh, I wish I had a
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.720]   longer cable for this.
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:09.680]   And then you're, because you're just making just a little low is the Monday and I'm just
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.160]   complaining a little bit and you get 18 people that are saying, Oh, you know, you should,
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.200]   you could, you should get, you should get a hub.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:18.200]   Cause a hub like, I know there's such a thing called a hub.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:21.480]   Please I'm not saying that please solve my problem for me.
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:22.440]   I'm saying that I'm just,
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:23.440]   and he's in beast mode.
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.440]   Leave him alone.
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:25.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.440]   Sorry.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:30.720]   Any, any one more thing that they might say, I think not, I think they should just, this
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.360]   should be, this should be ship.
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:35.520]   I think that'll be the, yeah, the one thing we don't get yet.
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.520]   The 32 and Jimack.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.520]   The big, yeah.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.520]   That's next year.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.520]   The Mac pro or next year, probably, right?
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:47.640]   The other question we haven't really discussed yet is, are there going to open up pre-orders
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:51.840]   immediately or are they going to wait until say, they'll be available for pre-order starting
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:56.480]   November 12th or they're going to, for some models, are they going to say, this will be
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:59.480]   available by the end of 2021.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.480]   Yes.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:06.280]   I think that, like, I think it'll be, I think it'll be like 10 days after it.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:08.880]   I'm going to be like the light end of the way and I have to admit.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:09.880]   We've been waiting so long.
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:15.040]   I mean, I think that they've been stuck in the mups since June in warehouses, right?
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:19.440]   I just, what I think is insane is that, because then I get up, you know, I get up early so
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:22.560]   it's, you know, five o'clock to order is not a big deal.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:27.000]   But my watch, I ordered it, I was, I ordered it at five, 12 in the morning and I'm, I look
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   three weeks in.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   Are you really?
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.960]   The clock was a series of super supply constraints though.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:35.200]   Well, my gosh, I was like three weeks in five, in 12 minutes.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.800]   So why did you buy the new watch?
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.000]   I have a four really old one.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   Okay.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   I have a version four.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   So I toyed with it briefly.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.240]   But then I thought, I've got the series six.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:48.520]   I don't, I kept, I said that about five and I said that about six.
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.520]   Yeah.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.680]   And seven, I was like, okay, it's time to get in my battery.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.200]   My battery's starting to get a little like.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.200]   This doesn't last as long.
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.200]   I think you're going to love this.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.840]   So, you know, I, I saw the watch, I thought I was going to buy one every year and I did.
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.160]   I bought one, two, three, four and then I was like, okay, this is crazy.
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.160]   Slow down.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.160]   They're not going to be two.
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.160]   You know, and this is the first time I haven't.
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:09.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.160]   You know what?
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:14.320]   Every once in a while you see Epic come on stage with Apple to show off the capabilities
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:15.320]   of their processor.
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:16.320]   Won't be happening this year.
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:17.320]   I don't think that'll happen.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:18.320]   That's going to happen this year.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:23.880]   But maybe Zinga with Farmville three, it's back ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:27.320]   It's back for the iPhone, the iPad and Mac OS.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:32.520]   If you missed Farmville, the classic Facebook game from 12 years ago.
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:35.440]   And I didn't even use the counteract the negative publicity that Mark Zuckerberg has
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:36.440]   been making.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:40.680]   I thought Zinga was at a business to be honest with you, but apparently Farmville is back.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:41.680]   Okay.
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:43.560]   That's all I need to say about that.
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.400]   I am looking for a new game.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:48.560]   I'm going to go to a squid game Farmville mashup.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.120]   That would have been interesting.
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:51.120]   I.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.120]   Ooh.
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.680]   And they actually kill you if you don't win.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:54.680]   That'd be fun.
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:55.680]   Well, the animals, not us.
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:56.680]   Oh, okay.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:57.680]   Okay.
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:58.680]   I don't want to get too dark.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:08:59.680]   It's pretty dark.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.680]   It's a dark show.
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:02.480]   It's a very dark show.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:08.040]   It's doing so well in South Korea that the South Korean ISPs are going to Netflix saying
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:10.800]   you get you you need to pay us for this bandwidth.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:15.520]   There was so many people watching the Netflix shows combined, like the Witcher and all those
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:16.520]   combined.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:17.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.120]   I don't think it's I only watched the first episode last night, just so I could talk about
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:21.120]   it.
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:24.560]   Someone was explaining it as like a Mr. Beast video if there were no laws.
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:27.240]   That was like the way it was vicious.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.240]   It's really vicious.
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.640]   I don't I just don't need that.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:34.040]   I'll wait till 2020 when the skies are clog our sun here.
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.040]   Yes.
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:38.800]   When the birds are singing again, I just don't I'm not I'm not judging.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:41.520]   I'm just saying that I'm tabling this for a sun year day.
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:48.320]   That's all Apple did declare victory, of course, with the judges ruling in the epic case.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:50.400]   Epic walked out with a long face.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:52.080]   Now I know why Apple was so happy.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:56.320]   They are appealing and they're asking the judge, look, since we're appealing, can we
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:01.760]   have a stay on the order to put that big button on there that says you can buy something
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:02.760]   somewhere else?
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:06.040]   We don't that's a lot of work in case they lose on appeal.
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.680]   We should let just wait, right?
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:11.360]   We're just two hippies in a garage.
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:15.840]   I will say I will say that that anybody who thinks that three months is enough to change
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.600]   an entire infrastructure, that's a lot.
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:18.600]   No, it's naive.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:23.200]   You know, like it takes that long to it takes a year to spec it, you know, like to figure
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:25.760]   out how you're going to hand off all of those things in a reasonable way.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:32.320]   And so it was a, you know, that's a ruling done by a judge that doesn't understand technology.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.560]   And how long it takes to develop things.
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:38.760]   And so I get that they're in a rush and they said what they're going to say, but the stay
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:42.640]   A is completely reasonable and B, if it happens, it's over.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.200]   Like it, they'll have a different business model by the time it comes through.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.240]   Well, and that's the point.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:50.360]   If you wait till after the appeals are done, the appeals could go for years.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:54.400]   But it is unreasonable that if you're appealing something, it is reasonable to say that we
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:58.800]   probably don't have to recode everything until we, until we figure it out, you know, because
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.520]   well, Apple doesn't have the recode thing.
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:04.400]   No, Apple just has to allow third parties to add the buttons in there.
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.320]   Well, it's changing the entire business model.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.120]   Yeah, but there's no, but it's not.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.120]   They've done that.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.520]   They've done that a couple of times before in the past two or three years.
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:12.520]   Not that hard to do.
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:15.720]   You just have to say, okay, you can do it now.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:19.560]   Yeah, but they still also, they're it's truly our ecosystem.
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.760]   So they still have to figure out how they're going to charge them.
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.320]   No, you know, like there's no, no, no, no.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:30.440]   All they have, all the judge says is you have to add in app links to external payment websites.
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:35.560]   So if I'm on a Netflix, I'm using the Netflix app and I, and it's a, and all it is, because
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:40.400]   Apple won't let you say you could buy this online instead of paying Apple 30% big.
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:44.400]   Yeah, but what's going to happen is is that all of us that, you know, the consumer again,
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:48.880]   the user is going to have now have all these greedy little companies who want their little
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.600]   extras to, they're going to all put those things on it.
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.160]   So what, what was this nice little thing that we have?
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:56.120]   We're changing your tune.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.280]   Don't, don't be smurched.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:01.320]   Uh, judge, uh, Yvonne Gazzan's Rogers, because I think she's actually very technical.
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.920]   And this is not a hard thing for Apple to do because Apple doesn't have to do anything,
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.040]   but it is a big hit to their bottom line potentially.
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.760]   Well, and it's a hit to the user.
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:09.760]   It is a hit to the user.
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.720]   Like it is a hit to the user.
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:14.960]   I don't, I think it's a hit to the user that when I'm using the Kindle app, I can't buy
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:15.960]   a book.
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.920]   I have to exit out of the Kindle app, go to the web, buy a book and go back into the Kindle
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.080]   app to download the book.
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:23.040]   Yeah, but what it's going to do is going to constantly push us out.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:28.080]   So the thing is, is the way that the users, prepping all the users, the way that we should,
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:34.040]   we should handle this is one star, one star for everything that does this, just one star.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:35.160]   You know, like it's what?
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.440]   And the thing is, is that we should, guess what, Alex?
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:38.440]   Everybody one star.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.440]   Guess what Alex?
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:40.440]   People actually want this.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.920]   And yeah, we'll say you're wrong, Alex.
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:46.280]   You're saying you like the experience of reading a book in the Kindle app and then having
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:49.040]   to exit out to buy the book?
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.320]   I don't, I don't, I buy it on Amazon.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.200]   I don't even think about it because it's with one app.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.400]   But the thing is, is it's going to pull us out all the time.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:59.040]   Like it's going to be like, it's going to be mass chaos for the users because right now
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.440]   our subscriptions are all managed.
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:04.160]   Our subscriptions are all managed inside or are, you know, I don't have to think about
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.360]   where my credit card is going.
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.240]   I just, I just say buy and it's, it's, it's all tied up.
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:12.320]   It's a nice little package secure experience that's no longer going to be there.
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:15.760]   You know, it's because these are already building software.
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:19.360]   What I'm saying is they're so excited about this.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.880]   Maybe some people will be excited about it.
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.520]   The developers are excited about it.
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:23.680]   The users are not going to be.
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:27.720]   And all I can say is if you're a user and you don't like it, give them one star.
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:31.360]   You know, just, just give them one star and it doesn't matter.
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.600]   It doesn't, not all of us have to not like it.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:38.600]   If 50,000 of us don't like it, it won't make any difference because the judge ruled.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:40.600]   Now, no, no, I think I'm not saying this one.
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.320]   I think the judge is going to give them a stay because it isn't unreasonable to say,
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.760]   all right, you're on our, you know, we were on appeal.
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:46.760]   I think that's not unreasonable.
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:50.840]   So I suspect, we don't know, but I suspect in November, judge Rogers will say, all right,
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:56.000]   all right, all right, because that was the only count they lost on with Epic.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.840]   But if she doesn't give them this day and they have to implement it,
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.200]   it's pretty much a flip of it.
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.040]   There's nothing to do.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.040]   You just have to stop enforcing that rule.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:06.760]   It's collecting the fees that Tim Cook wants to collect from people regardless
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.040]   of whether they use the App Store or not that takes a little bit of work.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:10.240]   But they'll proceed without that.
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:11.640]   Oh, yeah, because they said they're going to.
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:12.560]   I'm not going to wait for him.
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:16.000]   They're going to invoice Amazon and Netflix and all the companies and say,
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.440]   we want that 30%, please.
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:22.840]   Well, and again, just watch what happens because now what we used to be a simple
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:27.040]   in-app purchase or a simple purchase or what we want to use is going to be.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.520]   Now you have to go, it's what's going to happen.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:32.200]   Like when you wanted to watch something on your Apple TV and now it wants a code
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:34.920]   that you have to type in that you have to go to your cable provider,
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.560]   that's what it's going to be like for everything.
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:40.120]   You know, and the thing is, you know, and the only way for us as users to fight back
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.840]   from that is to give them one star.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:42.240]   Okay.
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:42.840]   Possibly.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:45.600]   Yeah, Alex is going to go on this crusade.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:46.160]   Everybody.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:46.680]   But here's things.
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.480]   Everybody, just remember.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:52.480]   The thing is, is that 3,000 one stars will give it a one star and then how many
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.280]   people we're going to buy it.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:57.400]   You know, like, so the thing is, it doesn't have to be, you don't have to be the
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:57.920]   majority.
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:58.960]   You just have to be the vocal member.
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.320]   Oh, and then you can be the developers not to do this.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:01.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:02.040]   I get what you're saying.
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:02.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.040]   You just pound the app into the ground.
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:04.280]   Right.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:07.120]   So the thing is, if so, if you're listening to this and you don't like where it's going,
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.840]   when they do it, give them one star.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.720]   All five of you, you can give them one star.
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:11.520]   Yeah, we'll see.
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:12.520]   We'll see.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:18.320]   All five Apple employees plus Alex can do this.
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.240]   I really don't understand Alex.
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:20.840]   You're religious.
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:28.680]   I honestly, I was about to say because it's the thing is, it's okay for Apple to have
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:29.520]   more problems.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:31.520]   They're equipped to deal with those problems.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:35.800]   And if we're going to, we never know, we never know, we never know, we never know exactly
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:39.560]   how a change is going to affect the entire infrastructure.
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:40.640]   There's no way to predict that.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:46.200]   However, I am, I do lean towards a change in infrastructure that makes things easier for
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.560]   the companies that do not have $2 trillion.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:54.560]   And for the users who were just trying to get a better experience, I don't feel as though,
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:16:00.000]   I don't feel as though, I don't feel as though a simple change is every single simple change
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.720]   is going to rip out this one tent pole that's keeping the entire.
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.720]   No, it's just going to be smelting it for the user.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:07.000]   It's because of Apple that it's not better for the user.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.560]   It's not better for the user because we have, we can order everything through our dot
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.560]   our dot app.
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:17.720]   Apple could make it so that I'm in the Kindle app by the book from in the Kindle app and
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:19.320]   Apple doesn't take 30%.
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:21.920]   That Apple could make it easier, but they won't.
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:22.880]   So if there is blame,
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:26.600]   Neither does Microsoft, neither does Sony and neither does Google like none of them.
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:27.600]   Microsoft's charges.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.120]   One person Apple part of the app is not good.
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.800]   Yeah, for their for their, for the Xbox.
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:33.800]   No, not for Microsoft.
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:35.920]   For the Microsoft, 30% Windows.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:39.680]   And no one uses the Microsoft store that almost see that's actually changing.
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:43.440]   So anyway, but the, but the, yeah, it's easy to get 1% when there's nothing there.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:48.480]   So, so the thing is, is that the, the, the issue is that they built an ecosystem.
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:51.280]   They have the right to charge for it, but I don't really care about Apple's rights.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.480]   What I care about is my right to keep it simple.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:56.840]   Like this is the one thing that you should blame Apple for not keeping it simple because
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:57.840]   no, it is simple.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.360]   They have it's not simple.
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.760]   Apple's rules are the reason it's not simple.
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:08.640]   You could easily in the Kindle app have a button that buys a book, but Apple's decided
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:10.960]   no matter what we're taking 30%.
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.960]   So Apple's the one that's making this hard.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:16.080]   Alex, not, not anybody else.
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.040]   If you're mad, you should be mad at Apple.
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:21.480]   If I built them all that, that was set up all this way and I let people use it for free.
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:25.360]   And all I'm saying is that if you come in here and sell it, sell it in my infrastructure,
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:26.360]   you know, they built it.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.360]   They built it.
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:30.000]   The thing is, is that, you know, I don't think that, I don't think that people have the
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.520]   right to say, well, just because you're the most successful, you now have to give it all
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:33.520]   up.
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:35.160]   You know, they're just, they're not saying that at all.
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:37.160]   They're not saying that at all.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.160]   It's completely untrue.
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:45.520]   There's, okay, there's, there, there, there has, there has to be an area in which a government
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:51.960]   is allowed to impose a ruling upon a large corporation that says that we have decided
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:56.040]   that you're acting unfairly towards a market or towards individuals like cable and that
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:18:00.440]   if they do decide to impose that ruling, that doesn't mean that they're trying to screw
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:04.160]   everybody over and that once again, we will have peace without honor.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:06.320]   We will have dogs and cats living together, et cetera.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.880]   You know, I will end this.
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:12.200]   I will end my part of this discussion because we can go into another 20 minutes, but I don't
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:16.720]   agree that this change is going to create a huge problem that's going to be anti-user.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:19.880]   I think you're worried for nothing and I think that you're making it very, very, very
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:22.080]   conversation for Apple to, yep.
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:24.080]   This goes through, this goes through around three to five years.
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:27.360]   We'll have the conversation again, but it's going to be interesting to see little, little
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:31.960]   stores and if it goes through, which I don't, if, if this stay happens, it'll never happen
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:33.680]   because it won't make it through the courts.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:34.680]   Right.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:35.880]   Like it, this is not, it's basically a week of a case.
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:41.080]   I think that that's the argument for Judge Rogers not to issue the stay is if you issue
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:44.480]   the stay, it'll never happen because it's just going to go well, but all the way.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:47.880]   The issue is that and by then it's going to go to Supreme Court and they're going to
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.640]   lose like in the Supreme Court.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:53.800]   And so the thing is that this is Alex, I know you have strong religious feelings about
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:55.440]   that, but I don't think that's clear.
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:00.000]   This is a company called Paddle that thinks that stays not going to happen.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.680]   There are already ready.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:05.240]   Notice this is a demo on an iPhone.
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:09.240]   They're already ready to provide a third party payment infrastructure.
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:13.480]   In fact, they even say in their, on their website, the Epic versus Apple Verda clears
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:18.520]   the way for Epic and clears creators to choose an alternative.
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:22.120]   So paddle, but you know, paddle is probably watching with great interest what happens
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:26.840]   in November because there will be no opportunity for them to do this if the judge offers the
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:27.840]   stay.
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:29.120]   So we shall see.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.120]   We shall see.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:34.520]   One star member doesn't have to be everybody.
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.120]   Just has to be enough people.
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.640]   Just a few nutcases.
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:43.360]   Moving on to other stories.
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:44.840]   Great article.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:45.840]   Thank you.
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:51.680]   Hey, lied about how Apple's macro technology works.
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:52.680]   They do great stuff.
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:54.200]   Have you guys played with it much?
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:55.640]   Have you guys played with the macro?
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:57.640]   Oh my gosh.
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.920]   Well, it's interesting because because the.
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:07.080]   Folks who do halide have announced they're going to add this macro capability to all iPhones
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:10.040]   that have what you have to have a wide angle lens.
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.560]   I can't remember, but this is.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:12.960]   Well, they're a digital version.
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:16.400]   It's a digital version and it's interesting tricks that they're playing, but it's also
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:21.640]   if you just want to know about how Apple's doing it, it's really interesting to read
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:25.200]   this and then they and then at the end of it, they say, Oh, and by the way, we're going
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:29.360]   to do it too, which is kind of kind of interesting.
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:32.400]   I've tried a little bit their technique.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:42.080]   This is what's interesting is this video as Apple is switching from the to the macro
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:46.480]   mode and then out of the macro mode, it's actually switching lenses and you can see the
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:47.680]   crop.
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:50.680]   The crop change.
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:55.520]   And so that's what's kind of a kind of a revelation when you put it together like this.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:56.920]   And this is, I think what people like.
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.160]   We just want other vendors do.
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.800]   It's well, it's the way you do it.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:02.520]   It's how you have to do the macro on the wide angle, right?
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:04.520]   The ultra wide.
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:06.920]   I should see.
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:07.920]   It's stunning.
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:08.920]   I mean, it's just so much fun.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:11.520]   You just want to keep on taking pictures of things.
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:12.520]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:15.600]   I didn't realize how much Apple's doing this, but apparently this is there's quite a bit
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:18.760]   of lens switching going on.
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:19.760]   It is.
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:22.000]   I do wish that they would give us manual control over that.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:28.120]   Like I find it to be like it's a stunning camera and I wish that I could I'm hoping
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:31.600]   that how lied and film it and other folks.
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:35.560]   I hope they have the ability to just go in there and just say, I want to use this lens.
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:36.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:37.560]   Give them the manual transmission.
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.600]   I think they kind of do have pro controls at this point, right?
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:41.800]   I think they're close to it.
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:46.240]   But the one in the camera, that's the that's the issue is that is that it keeps on switching
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:49.640]   when I don't really want it to rather figure out where to put the camera rather than having
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:50.640]   the camera.
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:51.640]   You feel like you're fighting it.
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.200]   And like it's like, oh, I'm in the wrong place.
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:56.040]   Now I got to turn this in and you're kind of dancing with it as opposed to just like,
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.560]   hey, just give me this lens.
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.160]   And then I'll figure out where to put the camera.
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:03.520]   Ben Sandofsky writes, believe it or not, Apple has pulled off this silent cropping for years.
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:08.240]   If you tried to focus on something too close for the telephoto lens to handle or the scene
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:12.320]   just requires more light, the iPhone quietly switches over to the wide angle lens and then
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:13.680]   crops it.
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:15.720]   So so it's the same view.
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:19.080]   It's like a telephoto shot, but it's using a different lens kind of without your knowledge.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.080]   It's kind of clever.
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.400]   The whole thing has always been like, that's an implementation detail.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:23.400]   Like we're putting all these cameras.
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.120]   You don't need to do a bunch of stuff.
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:27.000]   You just need a good picture and we're going to give you that.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.800]   Let us manage the rest of it.
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:34.360]   Although to respond to the complaints, Apple has apparently put it in a toggle on the auto
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:37.440]   macro in beta three of iOS 15.1.
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.440]   Right?
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:39.440]   Is that right?
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:40.440]   Are you using it yet?
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:42.440]   There were some reviewers like Ray Wong.
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:43.440]   I didn't initially think about it.
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:44.440]   I thought it was great because like you didn't have to manage it.
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:48.240]   When you got close, you would just go into macro mode, but he pointed out sometimes he
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:52.000]   wants to go a blurry object up front and focus on something behind.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.040]   And with this feature, it would just automatically macro the thing in front.
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:58.040]   So it removed options instead of making it just easier.
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:01.280]   So I think this is good because people who don't know any better will just take their
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:03.800]   macros and people who are like, no, I'm an artsy photographer.
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:04.800]   I want that control.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:06.560]   They'll turn it off and do it on their own.
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:07.560]   Send offs it.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:13.080]   He compares it to a manual transmission versus gear shift that some people want to shift
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:14.080]   the gears.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:16.080]   Most people will just want the automatic.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.080]   Yeah.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:18.080]   Yeah.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:23.240]   And if you've never driven with a 5-speed, you're going to hate it.
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.680]   You're not going to want to do it.
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:27.880]   I did -- Halite is amazing.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:30.840]   And I since I didn't buy the iPhone 13, so I don't have the macro mode.
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:33.440]   It's nice to at least have that feature.
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:38.600]   This is the latest version of Halite 2.5 with macro mode.
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:45.120]   And true to any real camera, macro mode has a traditional button of a flower.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:48.720]   And they say because our designer is Dutch, it's a tulip.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:50.720]   It's a vast deal to whiff.
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:53.280]   It's really cool that Apple services all these APIs as well.
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:57.760]   Halite, they are pure unadulterated genius, but they get so much from the APIs, like the
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:00.880]   GAP APIs and the camera APIs.
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:04.240]   And when they make the app, they can target just an immense amount of phones.
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.360]   So it's really economical for them to make an app like Alight.
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:08.360]   Yeah.
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:09.360]   Yeah.
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:13.960]   We are getting the Alex Lindsey update to the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:17.120]   iOS 15.0.2.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.760]   Alex, you always say -- This is the one you start to start --
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:21.240]   Wait to this one.
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.240]   Time to update.
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:23.320]   Don't do the big update.
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:26.240]   Don't do the fix to the big update, 15.0.1.
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:28.000]   Do the fix to the fix.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000]   We're here.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000]   Exactly.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000]   And it didn't take much time.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.520]   Didn't we get 15.1 like last week?
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.680]   Really getting better.
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:36.680]   Yeah.
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:39.640]   What does -- It just means that they fix less things.
[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:41.360]   You still want to wait a little while.
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:44.800]   But maybe go 15.0.3?
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:45.800]   I don't know.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:49.640]   To me, it's more time than with version.
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:52.880]   I like to come in two months after.
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:53.880]   Don't be too clear.
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:54.880]   They kind of settle in.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.640]   Well, as I mentioned, I'm fighting to move my iMac to Big Sur.
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:00.640]   Wow.
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.200]   I'm upgrading it.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:06.400]   I have Big Sur on a couple of other machines, but the one that I use -- and I have one
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:07.400]   computer still in Mojave.
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:11.040]   You kind of -- because there's always apps that you can't open and stuff like that.
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.040]   You never want to turn everything all the way.
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.040]   Dial everything forward.
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.040]   Right.
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:16.040]   At least I don't.
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:18.880]   And as I mentioned, they're already beta testing 15.1.
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:19.880]   Right.
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:23.240]   So, I don't know.
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:24.240]   It's kind of confusing.
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:27.040]   I guess I won't pay attention to the betas.
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:38.160]   15.0.2 fixes some security issues, including the IO mobile frame buffer, which would allow
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:41.560]   an application to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:44.240]   Those are words you don't want to hear.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.760]   Apple is -- oh, here's worse.
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:49.680]   Apple is aware of a report this issue may have been actively exploited.
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:57.000]   I'm going to bet this is another high-end exploit for governments that can afford it.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.440]   But I don't know.
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:01.440]   Right.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:11.080]   CVE 2021 30883 memory corruption issue addressed with improved memory handling in 15.0.2.
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:15.560]   There are other consumer-focused benefits, I'm sure.
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:19.080]   Yeah, just a ton of bug fixes.
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.240]   AirTag.
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.920]   Is that the one you were talking about?
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:22.920]   Yeah.
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:23.920]   Yeah.
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:24.920]   MagSafe.
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:27.120]   If you're in Find My Items tab, that's been fixed.
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:31.800]   Photos saved to your library for messages could be deleted after removing the associated
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:34.200]   message that's been fixed.
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:40.600]   The iPhone leather wallet with MagSafe may not connect to Find My, that's been fixed.
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:45.000]   CarPlay may fail to open audio apps or disconnect during playback.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000]   That's been fixed.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.920]   And Device Restore or Update may fail when using Finder or iTunes for iPhone 13 models.
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:52.760]   So, there's a lot of little bugs.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:53.760]   That's what you'd expect.
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:57.720]   When you release a big iOS update, lots of reports will come in from people as they start
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:59.760]   using it.
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:04.880]   I don't know the touchscreen responsiveness issue, any word whether that's gone away or
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:05.880]   not.
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:08.640]   We thought it kind of gone away with .1, right?
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:09.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:10.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.640]   That's sort of points I heard.
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:14.280]   Okay.
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:18.640]   So, it turns out I've tested it and shaking it violently is not.
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:20.440]   It does not make sense.
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:24.280]   You always do this like, "Why don't you kill it?"
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:26.240]   And pounding on your finger like this doesn't...
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.240]   Listen up.
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:28.720]   So, will you having that hesitation thing happen?
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:29.720]   Yeah.
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:30.720]   I wasn't having a hesitation every once in a while.
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:32.680]   My thing was just like, "No, I can't.
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.280]   I will not listen to you anymore."
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:36.840]   I just see image and I'm just like, "I don't..."
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:38.440]   And I just would close it and open it again.
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:39.440]   It was okay, but it was...
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:40.440]   That's weird.
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:42.800]   Yeah, I've had that happen, I guess, come to think of it.
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.960]   I just didn't notice it.
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:45.960]   I mean, it's just...
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:49.480]   I'm using computer stuff, working.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:54.800]   These things happen.
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:28:01.480]   Here's some shot on iPhone pictures on Instagram commissioned by Apple using the new macro...
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:04.000]   Or I'm sorry, the ultra wide.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.200]   Oh, these are pretty.
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:07.200]   That's a cool...
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:09.280]   These are cool shots on the iPhone 13.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:16.040]   That was by Zurb M. This is by Cody C. Just to prove that wide angle doesn't have to be
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.320]   distorted and weird.
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:26.680]   Oh, I like that by Jake M. Jason N. Are these professionals, do you think?
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:27.680]   Or these are...
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:28.680]   I get the feeling there.
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:30.200]   Well, that guy is.
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:34.120]   That's a Jason Noceido studio.
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.120]   That's pretty.
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.120]   Yeah, they have a mix.
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.120]   Ryan James Carras.
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:42.640]   Sir, Julian James.
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:44.920]   So wide you have to take two frames.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.520]   Just show it all.
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:48.520]   She's a super spreader.
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:49.520]   Wow.
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:51.480]   That's great.
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.720]   207,000 likes on Apple's Instagram account at Apple.
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:57.400]   Hopefully these aren't Finstas or Blumenthal's going to engage again.
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:58.560]   Oh my God.
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:28:59.560]   It's a Finsta.
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:03.440]   I see you, Finsta.
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:12.600]   Apple has turned on a way to automatically generate two factors and auto fill two factors.
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.120]   And that's part of iOS 15.
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:16.040]   I did not know about this.
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:19.000]   Renee, have you used this?
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.480]   The integrated two FA?
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:23.480]   Is it integrated two factor code generator?
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.440]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:29.560]   So the password managers have been doing this for a while now and Apple's built into their
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.840]   keychain, which is their version of a password manager.
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:34.040]   They just keep adding more and more features to it.
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:38.880]   So that if all you need is increasing basic functionality, you can do it.
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:44.440]   My thing is that as they're moving towards doing this, both myself and Dieter Bonne have
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:48.640]   been running this issue where Google asks for the two FA, but they will not accept your
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:49.800]   authenticator code.
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:53.200]   They will only accept an OK from a Gmail app on a Pixel or an iPhone.
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:54.200]   Yeah.
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:55.200]   And you may not have that phone anymore.
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:56.200]   Yeah.
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:01.240]   You know, you can choose alternate authentication methods.
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:03.320]   But for some reason, some of them aren't offered.
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:04.320]   This is kind of cool.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:05.320]   I'm going to try this.
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:06.320]   I found out the--
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:07.320]   Go ahead.
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:14.400]   I found out it's because login and re-authentication are separate strings and they're not the re-authentication
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:18.000]   one isn't as advanced as the login one yet.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.280]   Oh, interesting.
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:23.920]   So if you are trying to add two factor to a site, which you should, if you're not using
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:28.360]   two factor in every possible site, and I think this is probably OK.
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:32.960]   Normally, I like to have the authentication separate from the password manager in case
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:35.360]   one is breached, the other is still secure.
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:38.080]   But if you don't-- it's so convenient.
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.080]   When you see the QR code--
[01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:40.080]   It's so convenient.
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:50.800]   When you see the QR code, you long press it and it-- and you'll get a pop-up that says
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:55.920]   set up a verification code and then it will set it up, fill it in, and then it'll auto-fill
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:59.200]   it from then on, which I think is pretty fantastic.
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:00.200]   Yeah, true.
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:01.200]   I like that.
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:02.200]   So next time--
[01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:03.680]   And then we're working on a token system where you're not even going to have to have
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:04.680]   like the password anymore.
[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:08.120]   It's going to generate an authentication token for you immediately.
[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:11.160]   So everyone is pushing towards better and more password free worlds.
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:12.680]   It's just taking a while to get there.
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:17.360]   Yeah, I mean, really, if you think about it, 2FA is about something you have, something
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:19.880]   you know and something you are, biometrics.
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:22.160]   And the phone includes the biometrics.
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:25.760]   So you really got twos already because you've got biometrics and the physical possession
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:26.760]   of the device.
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:30.360]   But it's not even what you know anymore because none of us can remember our 32-bit
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.360]   Sonoma and blogs.
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:32.360]   Exactly.
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:35.400]   Yeah, we've got two things we have basically.
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:40.280]   And if they can reduce that to something that the secure enclave on the chip generates for
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:44.640]   you that's signed by the device that you have in your possession, that'll just make life
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:47.120]   so much simpler for everybody.
[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:53.560]   So if you already have 2FA set up, as I do, and I use Authy, unfortunately, you're going
[01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:56.200]   to have to turn it back off and turn it back on again.
[01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:57.480]   And then you can do it with iOS.
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:01.080]   The only reason I'm not going to do that is because I also use other devices like Android
[01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:02.920]   and Linux and Windows.
[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:04.640]   And so it would be--
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:05.640]   Yeah.
[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:08.240]   I guess I still have to get out the phone.
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:11.240]   So it just really would tie it to my Mac.
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:12.240]   And I'm also--
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:13.240]   Also it works on the Mac too, right?
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:15.200]   Does it work on the Mac?
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:18.000]   It will with Monterey.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.360]   Okay.
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:20.720]   So why maybe I'll wait till Monterey?
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:24.800]   Because at that point, then that's pretty good because I still-- for any two factor, I
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:27.560]   still need a phone that has Authy on it.
[01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:28.800]   So you'd be tied to Safari.
[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:29.800]   Is the only thing--
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:31.560]   Oh, it only works at Safari.
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.560]   Oh, screw you.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:33.560]   I believe so.
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:37.120]   You could go into the password and see the code, right?
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.120]   The 60s code.
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.120]   Yeah.
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.600]   But that's a pain compared to opening up.
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:43.160]   Well, that's why I like LastPass and OnePassword and Dashlet.
[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:44.560]   A lot of those are doing all the same.
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.920]   You can basically pick your weapon of choice at this point.
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:47.920]   Yeah.
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:51.360]   And it's the reason I recommend it generally is because, let's say, you were using LastPass
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:53.720]   and LastPass was doing the authentication codes.
[01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:58.040]   Once LastPass has breached, if it were breached, you'd be out of luck.
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:32:59.280]   So I liked separating it.
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:00.280]   You know, nobody's going to breach my--
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:01.280]   But off the authenticator.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:02.280]   Yeah.
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:04.840]   I'm going to breach my keychain.
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:10.920]   If they do, there's a lot more hazards than just being able to log into my quick.
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:11.920]   Yeah.
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:18.080]   I don't know if it's on the list, but did you see that Google is going to actually start
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:19.520]   using UIKit on the iPhone?
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:20.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:21.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.520]   I just pasted that link in.
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:23.520]   I love this story.
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:25.520]   It was a--
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:29.240]   Instead of material design, their own design language, they're going to use apples.
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:30.240]   Well, they should.
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.240]   Yeah.
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:34.880]   Well, Jeff Farcoigne just tweeted this out.
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:40.040]   He's a staff engineering lead for Google Design on Apple platforms.
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:43.800]   I don't know why this wasn't a blog post, but long, long, long, like Twitter chain,
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:49.080]   in which he was talking about how originally the motive for making iOS apps that look a
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:54.040]   lot like material design apps was, number one, because, well, this is our design language.
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:56.920]   This is what-- we want a consistent sort of interface.
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:01.000]   But also, he was saying that, well, UI-- at the time when we started on this project,
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.840]   UIKit didn't have a whole lot of stuff that we could actually use.
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:05.680]   We had to build what was missing.
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:08.520]   And then it was actually a very nice thread, because he said, well, earlier this year, it
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:14.120]   sort of hit us that UIKit has evolved a lot in the past few years that now we're just
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:18.600]   simply making these things look like Android apps, because that's the way we've always
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:19.600]   done it.
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:22.960]   So now it's time to-- is it now necessary for us to do all that sort of stuff?
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:27.840]   So he announced that, as a result of that, they're moving back into UIKit, partly to
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:32.160]   make things look more natural for Apple users, but also simply because this will be so much
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:36.840]   less work for us if we don't have to keep maintaining and building all of these material
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:40.200]   UI on iOS UI components.
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:41.200]   Nice.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:44.360]   And it's always good to be native on the platform that you're on.
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:45.360]   It's always a better one.
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:48.680]   Yeah, it's an interesting problem for them to have to solve it.
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:54.960]   I think that Google absolutely believes that Google Docs, Google Sheets, all their
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:35:01.480]   Google services, they're a platform in and of itself, so that for the same reason why,
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:06.800]   if you're running Windows inside a virtual window inside a Mac, why would you have this?
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:09.600]   Why would you redress this Windows interface to look like a Mac?
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:14.800]   I think that's part of what they're thinking is that they want people to leap from Google
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:20.440]   Docs in a browser to Google Docs in an Android app to Google Docs elsewhere without having
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:25.360]   to readjust to wait a minute, why isn't there a floating button to create a new document?
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:28.960]   Why isn't this menu bar, this menu hamburger there?
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:33.680]   But nonetheless, they've been getting a lot of blowback from that for a lot of people
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:34.680]   from a lot of people.
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:38.920]   I wonder if Apple will start using material design and messages for Android.
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:40.560]   Oh, never mind.
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:45.160]   Well, I think that the hard part is like I didn't use the Google apps on my phone because
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:47.080]   they looked like they looked ugly.
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:48.080]   Weird.
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:51.800]   They were very unpleasing to use.
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:53.280]   And so as a result, I just stopped.
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:56.400]   I was like, if I want to work on an Android device, I'll work on an Android device, but
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:00.760]   I want it to otherwise just work exactly the way I'm just everything else on my phone
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:01.760]   working.
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:07.280]   If Apple were designing Android apps, I guess they have a couple that they should use material
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:08.680]   design on those apps too, right?
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:10.480]   And I shouldn't make them look like an Apple.
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:11.480]   Yeah.
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:12.480]   I agree.
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:14.480]   You just want to look like it's native.
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:15.480]   Yeah.
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:16.480]   It's the right move.
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:23.240]   It's really at the start, but it's good for the director of this program to say, "Admit
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:27.260]   that, okay, well, we kind of lost our heads there."
[01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:31.360]   In life, in business, everywhere, you always have to ask yourself, "Why am I doing the thing
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:32.360]   that I'm doing?"
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:36.080]   Because sometimes you started doing that five or six years ago for an excellent reason,
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:39.920]   but five years later, that reason is no longer operative, and now you're just wasting time
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:41.580]   and causing problems.
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:42.600]   And the hard part is either.
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:44.160]   Because there's like a...
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:45.700]   Go ahead, Alex, first thing.
[01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:46.700]   Go ahead, good, Renee.
[01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:47.700]   You're on camera.
[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:48.700]   Oh, no, I was just...
[01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:49.700]   We'll save switching.
[01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:53.600]   You sometimes have these issues sometimes where the company wants their brand.
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:56.520]   Netflix wants to look like Netflix, Instagram wants to look like Instagram, TikTok wants
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:57.520]   to look like TikTok.
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.000]   And so they'll make their apps look the same.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.520]   They don't look like UI kit apps.
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:02.200]   They don't look like material design apps.
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:05.640]   So it was like YouTube's supposed to look like UI kit now just because it's on iPhone
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:10.360]   and not be competitive with every other video player that puts their brand first.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:13.640]   Or when you hire a famous designer, they want you to know that it's the famous designer
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:14.640]   doing it.
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:16.940]   And you hire the designer, the brand, and the platform.
[01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:18.580]   It's a lot to navigate sometimes.
[01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:20.660]   And it can make some very confusing apps at times.
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:24.220]   And I think the challenge though, if you're an Apple developer or an iOS developer, is that
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:28.900]   Apple moves really quickly and they're not that committed to backwards compatibility.
[01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:33.660]   So if you start building up your own thing, a good example of Playback Pro is something
[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:37.860]   that in events we used for years, a decade.
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:41.140]   And what they did is they figured out how to write custom code to do the playback so
[01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:43.940]   that it would be more stable and you could have more control over your outputs.
[01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:48.340]   And it was a really good business until Apple changed the operating system.
[01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:51.200]   And then they became less and less stable and other things that were just sitting on
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:56.860]   top of the foundation toolkits just went right past them.
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:37:59.660]   And so Apple will tell you, hey, you should probably write to metal.
[01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:05.660]   And everyone who ignored Apple is now in the M1 world is totally screwed.
[01:38:05.660 --> 01:38:08.420]   Like anybody who said, I'm not going to do that.
[01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:10.020]   I'm going to keep on writing, doing what I'm doing.
[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:14.580]   If they didn't write to metal, they really have a lot of unwriting to do because they're
[01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:15.580]   going to keep falling behind.
[01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:22.060]   And so I think that that's the real challenge is that getting outside of the Apple infrastructure
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:24.620]   is something that just is an enormous amount of work.
[01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:28.620]   And Google can do, but most people can't.
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:32.380]   Let's take a little break, come back more to come in just a bit with Alex Lindsey from
[01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:35.220]   090.media and of course Office Hours.
[01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:39.260]   We'll get an update on what's going on over there in a little bit.
[01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:45.060]   So Renee Richie from his YouTube channel, youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:47.380]   Curious about your upcoming projects.
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:48.980]   That'll we'll do that in a second.
[01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:55.220]   And Mr. Andy Inaco from WGBH in Boston.
[01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:58.460]   I think it was on our club to a discord.
[01:38:58.460 --> 01:39:00.780]   Somebody said, make Andy write more.
[01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:02.820]   I miss his writing.
[01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:03.820]   Seriously.
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:06.060]   Are you writing at all anymore?
[01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:07.060]   I know.
[01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:08.060]   I absolutely am.
[01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:10.660]   I'm about 5,000 words a week.
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:13.580]   And hopefully you will be able to see it.
[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:17.940]   I've been back loading a new project so that when I announce it, it won't be, oh, well,
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:20.220]   here's what I wrote today.
[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:28.780]   So again, when I'm ready to take the wraps off of this thing, I want people to like,
[01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:32.940]   oh, wow, so he's actually been doing this for months and months.
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:39.260]   If you want to find out what I think about something that happened in April or like January,
[01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:42.860]   you will be able to find 1,000 words on that earlier.
[01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:43.860]   Nice.
[01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:44.860]   So that's great.
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:46.820]   I will tell that person they will be very, very happy.
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:47.820]   And thank you.
[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:48.820]   And thank you very much.
[01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:49.820]   Yeah.
[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:52.860]   It was it's difficult to find a place that will just let me do exactly what I want to
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:55.460]   do quite quite correctly.
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:59.500]   It's like when you can just say, well, just trust me, I will give you 1,000 words a couple
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:03.940]   of times a week on topics that will probably not get you sued.
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:09.380]   That's a, that's a, well, maybe it's quite a big shot.
[01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:10.380]   Exactly.
[01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:11.380]   And he won't get you sued kids.
[01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:13.780]   See, I don't think they were even thinking that until you said it.
[01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:15.860]   Now they're thinking, oh, maybe he's going to get a suit.
[01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:17.820]   How interesting that you brought that up.
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:18.820]   Really?
[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:19.820]   Is that happened before?
[01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:20.820]   What's going on?
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:21.820]   All right.
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:25.260]   Show today brought to you by hover.com.
[01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:29.900]   If I were to go through each panelists and ask them how many web domains they own, I
[01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:32.620]   would bet the total would be well over a hundred.
[01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:36.660]   Actually, I think I own a hundred all by myself and they're all on, all on hover, all on
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:40.500]   hover, all on hover, hover, hover is the place.
[01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:47.740]   Look, I, I, having a custom domain is not like, uh, having a custom license plate.
[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:49.780]   It's not optional for a business.
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:53.740]   You don't want to be at Yahoo.com or at, at AOL.com.
[01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:55.140]   You don't want your email going there.
[01:40:55.140 --> 01:40:57.220]   You don't want your website to be there.
[01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:58.980]   You want to have a custom domain.
[01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:00.460]   I would submit even for individuals.
[01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:05.020]   In fact, the best gift I ever gave my kids, uh, when they were born is to get registered
[01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:10.340]   their names as dot coms and I registered it for 20 years, figuring they, they'd want
[01:41:10.340 --> 01:41:11.340]   them by then and they do.
[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:12.340]   They use them.
[01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:15.660]   And I think it's just really having a custom domain.
[01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:17.020]   It's not a custom license plate.
[01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:18.540]   It's a way of saying who you are.
[01:41:18.540 --> 01:41:21.300]   If you're an artist, it's a place to put your portfolio.
[01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:27.540]   If you're a blogger, your blogger, your online store, just, you know, you could even be a,
[01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:33.180]   for a more memorable link to your LinkedIn page, you know, hover.
[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:35.180]   I use, I have custom email domains.
[01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:41.380]   I have custom domains for my servers, everything, my, my private servers, my public servers,
[01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:44.820]   and the best place to register them, hover because they don't bug you trying to upsell
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:46.460]   you with a lot of junk.
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:48.300]   The prices are right.
[01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:52.940]   You've got the best domain names, a huge selection these days, not just dot com, dot net, dot
[01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:56.740]   org, you, they got dot pizza, dot republican, dot democrat.
[01:41:56.740 --> 01:42:01.660]   Uh, I mean, it goes, it's amazing that domain TLDs you can use these days.
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:05.020]   That's what those are called TLDs top level domains.
[01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:10.500]   And email, I think is the very first one you should take a look at email at your domain.
[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:11.500]   Here's the advantage.
[01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:15.820]   First of all, uh, it doesn't ever change because you own it.
[01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:17.420]   So you can do whatever you want.
[01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:21.740]   You can go to any host you want, but you don't have to worry about telling everybody, oh,
[01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:26.140]   I've moved a lot of people moving off AOL all of a sudden.
[01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:31.020]   Kind of hard if you've been in an AOL.com for 25 years to tell everybody, I got a new
[01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:33.660]   email address with, with your own domain name.
[01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:35.020]   You don't have to worry about it.
[01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:37.260]   And by the way, take a look at hovers email offerings.
[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:43.380]   They have a really nice, in its very inexpensive domain based email for all your needs, smaller
[01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:45.220]   and larger, it's easy to set up.
[01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:47.700]   You can add as many mailboxes to your domain as you need.
[01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:51.940]   And the nice thing is when your domain renews, then you could turn on auto renew if you want,
[01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:57.220]   which I do because I don't want to forget your mailboxes renew as well automatically.
[01:42:57.220 --> 01:43:00.900]   Great prices, the most, their most popular mailboxes and no brainer solution for business
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:02.340]   owners.
[01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:03.340]   And it's really email.
[01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:04.500]   You get access from anywhere.
[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:06.740]   You can use any email app you like already.
[01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:09.020]   Uh, and they have web mail too.
[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:10.500]   So you've got web mail.
[01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:15.220]   You've also got IMAP servers for whatever app you want to use.
[01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:18.180]   And hover never upsells you on anything you don't need.
[01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:22.860]   Pro level tools, if you're, if you already know how DNS works and you want to, I do all
[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:25.940]   the time go in there, manage my DNS, you can do that.
[01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:31.300]   But they also have simple tools, things like auto connect features, one button connect to
[01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:36.060]   some of the biggest blog and other sites, Shopify domains like that.
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:40.300]   You need to use whether you're web pro or just getting started, of course, privacy is
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:42.020]   foremost with hover.com.
[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:46.100]   That's why they give you who is privacy automatically with your domain purchase.
[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:47.340]   It's not an upsell.
[01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:48.860]   It's just they know you want it.
[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:53.020]   So they keep your information private, reduce spam, protect yourself.
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:54.380]   Uh, hover connect.
[01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:58.260]   That's the service I talked about that makes it very easy to connect your website.
[01:43:58.260 --> 01:44:02.860]   At hover, most importantly, you're a customer, not a source of data.

[01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:51.940]   Yeah, actually I think about it.
[01:44:51.940 --> 01:44:55.300]   I think many more than a hundred domains I have at hover.
[01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:58.580]   Some I don't use, a lot I don't use, but it's fun to collect.
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:02.340]   Collect all million.
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:06.780]   Let's see, Apple Watch also updated to 8.0.1.
[01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:13.060]   Some bug fixes, particularly for series three watches that we're having.
[01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:16.740]   Software update progress may not be displayed accurately for some Apple Watch series three
[01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:20.500]   users, accessibility series settings.
[01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:23.060]   Also missing, those are both fixed.
[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:28.060]   So if you've got an Apple Watch 8.0.1, I don't know if this is typical.
[01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:31.820]   I could not get to 8 for the life of me, because I was an intermediate update that just would
[01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:33.460]   never happen.
[01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:34.660]   So I just reset my watch.
[01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:36.500]   This is my advice to people who are getting stuck.
[01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:37.660]   I just reset my watch.
[01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:39.020]   It's very easy.
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:43.860]   When I went to iOS 15 and just had it updated at that point, I would jump to 8 automatically.
[01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:44.860]   I don't know.
[01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:48.580]   I think it was something pre-8 that wasn't going through for some reason.
[01:45:48.580 --> 01:45:49.580]   I don't know.
[01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:50.580]   Is that happening to anybody?
[01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:52.980]   It's just me.
[01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:54.980]   It's just me.
[01:45:54.980 --> 01:45:56.860]   More about Apple cars.
[01:45:56.860 --> 01:45:58.860]   Wow.
[01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:00.500]   This is the rumor that it'll never die.
[01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:03.780]   This is from Mark German.
[01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:08.340]   Apple's planned for cars.
[01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:09.340]   It's not their cars.
[01:46:09.340 --> 01:46:10.340]   It's other cars.
[01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:11.340]   Oh, okay.
[01:46:11.340 --> 01:46:12.340]   I get it.
[01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:13.340]   This is for car play.
[01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:14.340]   The other cars.
[01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:15.580]   No, the other cars.
[01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:16.580]   Not the Apple car.
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:20.100]   Of course you use your iPhone and the Apple car, but if you have car play, which I do,
[01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:25.620]   then I love and I live by it and I use Apple Maps because of it and all of that, the company.
[01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:28.180]   I don't know if Ford's going to go for this one.
[01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:33.980]   Is working on technology that would let you access the climate control system, the speedometer,
[01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:36.340]   the radio, the seats?
[01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:39.660]   The initiative is known as Ironheart.
[01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:44.020]   German says it's still in its early stages and yes, would require the cooperation.
[01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:45.620]   Can I add some quick color to that?
[01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:46.620]   Yes.
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:47.620]   Because this is why I love it.
[01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:48.620]   This is why I love the geeky people at Apple.
[01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:51.660]   The car play's code name is Stark after Tony Stark.
[01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:52.660]   Oh my God.
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:55.460]   Ironheart was a protege of Tony Stark.
[01:46:55.460 --> 01:46:59.740]   She is a young African American armor wearing superhero.
[01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:02.500]   So they are just so deep in the lore right here.
[01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:04.140]   There's always a Marvel collection.
[01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:05.140]   So you're a collect connection isn't there.
[01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:06.460]   You just can't get away from it.
[01:47:06.460 --> 01:47:07.460]   That's hysterical.
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:10.260]   I think car play is the greatest thing.
[01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:12.100]   Andrew, I know some people love it.
[01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:13.620]   I don't like it as much.
[01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:14.620]   I have it as well.
[01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:17.060]   But wireless car play is fantastic.
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:19.740]   I get the car and it's just there and it works.
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:22.860]   And also all these extra hooks that they're concerning putting in.
[01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:28.540]   The idea of adding instrumentation to the pot that the car play can have access to, that
[01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:30.460]   car play apps can have access to.
[01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:34.740]   That adds a lot of interesting color.
[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:39.340]   There's a lot you can do with instrumentation to train people to be better drivers, for
[01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:45.940]   instance, to observe if the data is kept securely, to observe your driving habits and sort of
[01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:52.940]   coach you into, here's what I can give you an extra $8 a month and $8 a week in gas.
[01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:57.580]   If you just like every time I'm flashing green, you just take your foot off the gas, take
[01:47:57.580 --> 01:47:59.580]   your foot off the brake, do this.
[01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:01.940]   And there's a lot of potential there that's.
[01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:06.100]   I guess the also, I mean the advantage of car play from the automaker's point of view
[01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:09.620]   is they have such long cycles to design this.
[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:17.300]   And it's rare that these telematics units and cars are up to date.
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:21.100]   The voice recognition, the speech, all of this is usually years behind.
[01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:25.100]   But if you are tied to the phone, it's always updated when the phone gets updated or the
[01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:27.380]   software gets updated.
[01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:30.420]   And by the way, you have a display for car play.
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:34.500]   Why have separate buttons on the display or separate areas in the display?
[01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:36.460]   When it could all be controlled by car play.
[01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:39.980]   And I think another reason this would be valuable and car makers probably should consider it
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:42.800]   is it would know it's me getting in the car.
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:45.980]   So it could adjust my seats, my temperature, my sound, everything.
[01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:46.980]   Everything for rentals.
[01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:49.500]   Yeah, customized as soon as I get in the car.
[01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:50.500]   That's a nice thing.
[01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:51.500]   Yeah.
[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:52.500]   It'll help.
[01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:53.500]   It'll help.
[01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:54.500]   It'll help.
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:55.500]   It'll help.
[01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:56.980]   Yeah, when Lisa drives, it's adjusted for her.
[01:48:56.980 --> 01:48:58.720]   When I drive it's adjusted for me.
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:01.380]   Ford kind of tries to do this with their app.
[01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:02.460]   It's imperfect.
[01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:06.180]   It would be, I think, let's let Apple, let Apple write the software.
[01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:07.180]   Absolutely.
[01:49:07.180 --> 01:49:12.060]   In both cases, whether it's Android or Android Auto or car play, it's hard.
[01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:16.340]   You're trying to sell people a car when it comes down to business and the auto makers
[01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:20.620]   realize that we are no way know how I'm going to be able to sell them the software that
[01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:23.900]   we, the entertainment software that we build for them as a selling point.
[01:49:23.900 --> 01:49:27.260]   They're going to ask if what happens when I get into the car with my iPhone?
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:29.340]   They say, no, it'll be a full support for your phone.
[01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:33.340]   You can get all of your playlists, Apple music, Spotify, everything that you're using.
[01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:36.140]   And you don't have to worry about having to take it back into the dealership or get
[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:41.460]   an honor over the year update to our console in order to just deal with something two or
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:42.460]   three years from now.
[01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:47.700]   I should point out though that Apple has done other similar things with kind of a little
[01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:49.660]   bit of rejection from car makers.
[01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:50.740]   What is it?
[01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:51.740]   Car key?
[01:49:51.740 --> 01:49:52.740]   Yeah.
[01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:58.420]   There's only only some BMW models to this still to this day support that.
[01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:05.740]   I didn't know this, but Apple had put in features in 2015 that could access the car radio
[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:07.740]   GPS and climate controls.
[01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:13.100]   In 2019, it started supporting car plan secondary car screens like digital clusters.
[01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:19.220]   It added the ability to do routing for EVs for the iPhone to sense when it's connected
[01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:21.300]   to an EV and provide charger information.
[01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:24.540]   None of this to this day, no automaker does it.
[01:50:24.540 --> 01:50:26.540]   I would love that.
[01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:31.100]   You know, it's interesting because Ford has its own, it has ways, it has some apps.
[01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:34.980]   They're bulky, they're slow because they didn't put much processor in the thing.
[01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:39.620]   And this is a very brand new electric vehicle from Ford, the Mach-E.
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:42.740]   CarPlay is so much farther ahead even on this.
[01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:48.740]   The brand new thing is even an old vehicle, I mean we have a Honda pilot I think.
[01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:52.780]   And it just works like the whole thing, like I would never use the interface, the Honda
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:53.780]   interface.
[01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:54.780]   Oh no, there he is.
[01:50:54.780 --> 01:50:58.260]   You know, like, and you just plug in because for a while I was just using it with the last
[01:50:58.260 --> 01:50:59.260]   Honda we had.
[01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:03.020]   I used the screen was great because the suction cup would stick to it really well.
[01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:05.500]   And put that on the pad and replace it.
[01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:08.100]   I like a big screen, it's good for suction cups.
[01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:09.100]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:11.660]   And so, and this one actually, it works pretty well.
[01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:14.580]   I think that the one thing I have is this weird thing where it switches when you're in
[01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:17.260]   maps and someone calls and suddenly your map goes away and you're like, that's not what
[01:51:17.260 --> 01:51:19.420]   I wanted because I'm now lost.
[01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:22.100]   You know, like, you know, and so that's the only thing.
[01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:23.420]   But other than that, I think it works really well.
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:26.740]   Well, the reason I use Apple Maps instead of Google Maps are ways both of which I could
[01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:30.300]   use on CarPlay is because my watch.
[01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:35.420]   So I don't like it that I'm listening to a book or listening to music and the voice
[01:51:35.420 --> 01:51:38.060]   comes on and says turn left and 100 feet.
[01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:41.860]   So I turn off the voice and I just let the watch make haptic sense.
[01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:42.860]   It's great.
[01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:46.780]   And I'm like, oh, I just love that feature.
[01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:50.340]   So Apple, you want to go over and Apple Maps is fine, right?
[01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:51.340]   Apple Maps is caught up.
[01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:52.340]   It's fine.
[01:51:52.340 --> 01:51:53.340]   Yeah.
[01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:54.340]   Yeah.
[01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:56.060]   It doesn't have, I wish it did have EV charging stuff built in.
[01:51:56.060 --> 01:51:57.940]   I had no idea Apple offered that.
[01:51:57.940 --> 01:52:00.380]   I will say I've learned for not supporting it.
[01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:01.940]   It's more optimistic than Google.
[01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:04.540]   Like Apple always tell you're going to get there faster than Google does.
[01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:10.300]   Like, you're like, I don't know because I'm, I think I don't drive very far, very often.
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:12.180]   But Apple's been super accurate for me.
[01:52:12.180 --> 01:52:17.940]   Like I can, I'll text, I go down to Sam Rufel to see my daughter every Thursday and I can
[01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:21.140]   text her out of the computer says I'll be there at 1208.
[01:52:21.140 --> 01:52:25.100]   And it's always right to, you know, it knows about traffic and everything, but you find
[01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:26.780]   it not quite so accurate.
[01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:29.340]   Because I find it to be a little overly overestimated.
[01:52:29.340 --> 01:52:30.740]   I like what it's going to take.
[01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:32.700]   I like a happy, happy, exactly.
[01:52:32.700 --> 01:52:34.260]   I think we can do it.
[01:52:34.260 --> 01:52:37.180]   If we put our minds to it, we can be more important.
[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:40.500]   I think, you know, but Apple, Apple Maps is with, with routing and directions.
[01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:46.420]   It's good enough now that I think that a lot of people can and will rely, make the choice
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:50.220]   based on the fact that, ooh, but it looks, the map looks so much more cartoony and readable
[01:52:50.220 --> 01:52:52.020]   and pretty.
[01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:56.460]   I think that Google is going to have to, they're going to have to like hire the, the farm
[01:52:56.460 --> 01:53:00.580]   bill people, hire the Fortnite people to learn how to figure out how to make this look like
[01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:01.580]   more of a card.
[01:53:01.580 --> 01:53:02.860]   And I'm actually, I'm actually serious.
[01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:07.980]   It's like, there's, there's such a skill that's been handed down from map mapers for centuries
[01:53:07.980 --> 01:53:13.500]   on how do you present the correct amount of information in the clearest way with the,
[01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:16.940]   with the greatest economy of ink on the screen.
[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:18.460]   And it's not a trivial thing.
[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:23.820]   It's, we can, we can, we can, we can make jokes about how cartoony a lot of the landmarks
[01:53:23.820 --> 01:53:24.900]   in Apple Maps are.
[01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:28.220]   But the thing is, if you know, if there is a Boston landmark that you're going to be
[01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:34.300]   walking past or driving past, there is no question whatsoever that you are passing by
[01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:38.300]   the Boston Public Library or Fan Hall Marketplace or San Francisco.
[01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:39.300]   Right.
[01:53:39.300 --> 01:53:43.100]   It's like you, you don't have to think about, oh, well, here is a, here is a pixel accurate,
[01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:45.660]   lighting accurate rendering of something that kind of blends.
[01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:46.660]   What's the communication?
[01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:49.220]   Screen anyway, that's probably the best.
[01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:50.220]   Well, no, exactly.
[01:53:50.220 --> 01:53:53.580]   But I mean, you, but you're trying to, if you're trying to get your bearings and you see that
[01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:58.340]   it's chosen to, it's chosen to show you that, by the way, there's, there should be, there
[01:53:58.340 --> 01:54:00.300]   should be a park to your right right now.
[01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:01.300]   That's boss.
[01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:02.300]   That's boss in common.
[01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:05.820]   But if you're not seeing a park to your right right now, that's where you're, that's where
[01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:08.340]   you're screwing up or that's where you're trying to head to.
[01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:09.420]   Waze is very funny.
[01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:10.900]   They, because it really is ugly.
[01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:15.740]   The maps, they don't have anything near Apple Maps or Google Maps looking drawings, but
[01:54:15.740 --> 01:54:20.620]   they do have little side things like you have different voices and they just did a tie in
[01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:22.900]   with Microsoft's Halo game.
[01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:27.940]   So my car is now a warthog as I drive down.
[01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:29.820]   And I think Cortana is the voice.
[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:34.020]   So you can, you can, there's things you can do to make ways a little bit funnier, but
[01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:38.580]   I don't think ways, I think ways you use ways because you like its information and the
[01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:39.660]   crowdsourced stuff.
[01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:43.940]   But I believe Google and Apple really started to catch up even with that.
[01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:46.220]   How would you like Siri in your news, Leo?
[01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:47.220]   Yes.
[01:54:47.220 --> 01:54:52.860]   So this is from a fairly well known, fairly accurate, 75% accurate, Twitter, Apple Leaker,
[01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:58.540]   who says the MacBook Pro 14 and 16 mini LED displays, smaller bezels, no bottom logo,
[01:54:58.540 --> 01:55:02.860]   1080p webcam, which I would love even if it takes a camera bump, I don't care.
[01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:06.300]   Base models will be 16 gigabytes of RAM and 512 gigabytes of storage.
[01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:09.300]   The M1X will be the same base configuration for both models.
[01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:12.940]   Pricing will be similar between the models and there will be a new charging brick.
[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:14.700]   Wow.
[01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:16.460]   Lots of information.
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:18.100]   75% accurate.
[01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:21.100]   So a quarter of what you just heard is probably wrong.
[01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:22.100]   Yes.
[01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:23.100]   That's the question.
[01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:28.420]   But this is always the fun time for rumors because at some point, this is the point which
[01:55:28.420 --> 01:55:34.500]   they have to let in the losers, the Fredos of the family, where it's like, okay, we're
[01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:38.380]   holding this off because you are actually going to be responsible for unpacking these
[01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:40.340]   and putting them on display.
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:42.860]   Now we have to show you what this looks like.
[01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:47.860]   This is where if you hear a rumor that breaks out under a week, more credibility than say
[01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:50.260]   six months before.
[01:55:50.260 --> 01:55:55.900]   So 120 Hertz, which is, I guess not a surprise, right?
[01:55:55.900 --> 01:55:58.740]   If it is, I still can't believe it.
[01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:00.340]   You're suspicious.
[01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:01.340]   Why would it?
[01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:02.340]   I want it.
[01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:03.340]   Yeah.
[01:56:03.340 --> 01:56:04.340]   Yeah.
[01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:05.340]   Why would it for gaming?
[01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:06.340]   But I'm not.
[01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:11.060]   Well, it's great for me because like right now you can manually toggle the MacBook Pro
[01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:15.580]   16 inch between 48 Hertz and 60 Hertz, depending on whether you want to edit for TV or edit
[01:56:15.580 --> 01:56:16.580]   for film.
[01:56:16.580 --> 01:56:17.580]   That's cool.
[01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:18.580]   And it's great because it lets you do that.
[01:56:18.580 --> 01:56:22.620]   But if it just did it, if I didn't have to even think about it, and if I also want to
[01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:26.580]   be able to watch movies and TV shows at the proper frame rates, so it's just like a nicer
[01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:27.580]   experience.
[01:56:27.580 --> 01:56:28.580]   Yeah.
[01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:29.580]   Yes, I'm not.
[01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:36.780]   One of the things is that at 120 frames per second, 24 to 30, 60 all fit evenly.
[01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:37.780]   Yes.
[01:56:37.780 --> 01:56:42.820]   So it's just, you get one to one across all of those rather than some halfway between
[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:43.820]   them.
[01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:48.500]   Also, you know, there's a lot of phones that are shooting 120 frames a second.
[01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:52.540]   So the, and it is, it's a different experience.
[01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:56.620]   Just, you know, when you're watching 120, not playback in slow motion, but playback at,
[01:56:56.620 --> 01:57:01.780]   and the thing is, is that it, when you watch a lot of 120 playing back at 120, it gets
[01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:03.220]   hard to watch other stuff.
[01:57:03.220 --> 01:57:07.700]   And this keeps on getting to where Apple's pushing this experience down the path that
[01:57:07.700 --> 01:57:12.420]   is like when you, when you watch it, it starts to feel different and it starts to, you start
[01:57:12.420 --> 01:57:13.420]   to experience it.
[01:57:13.420 --> 01:57:18.020]   So you start mixing HDR and, and high frame rate and, you know, all those things.
[01:57:18.020 --> 01:57:21.300]   And it, it, it subtly feels different.
[01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:23.300]   Also your mouse works a lot better.
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:24.300]   It really does.
[01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:26.940]   Like when you got a high frame rate, it feels different.
[01:57:26.940 --> 01:57:30.220]   When you go back to like a lower frame rate, you're like, what happened to my mouse?
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:32.140]   So it's, and then we have this.
[01:57:32.140 --> 01:57:33.140]   Yeah.
[01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:35.740]   And, and we have to remember that a lot of things that people don't get, and I think
[01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:40.340]   Apple gets it better than most, is there's a lot of things that you don't notice, but
[01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:41.740]   you feel.
[01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:47.260]   And when you feel them, it's even more impactful sometimes because you're not conscious to
[01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:48.260]   it.
[01:57:48.260 --> 01:57:50.780]   You're just conscious to this feels a lot better and this feels more solid.
[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:52.300]   This feels more real.
[01:57:52.300 --> 01:57:54.060]   And, and you don't notice it.
[01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:56.660]   It's just that when you go to something else, it feels ginseng.
[01:57:56.660 --> 01:57:59.900]   You know, it's, it's the little things like I've talked about in the past with, with keynote.
[01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:04.100]   Keno is better at anti-aliasing and better at curning than most than the other, um, presentation
[01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:05.100]   apps.
[01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:10.260]   And as a result, you can, I can not always, but very often tell who's using PowerPoint
[01:58:10.260 --> 01:58:13.020]   and who's using keynote just because of the way it looks.
[01:58:13.020 --> 01:58:16.740]   You know, and, and PowerPoint has a, you know, a cheaper look to it oftentimes.
[01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:21.900]   And Google's gotten better with slides, but, but it's, um, but it's super subtle and,
[01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:24.380]   and it affects how people feel when they look at it.
[01:58:24.380 --> 01:58:30.020]   What is our, um, there's also like the surface, like they made the surface 120 Hertz, but
[01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:33.500]   based on the reviews, they didn't change the polling rate of the mouse.
[01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:37.260]   So it doesn't pull fast enough to take advantage of the 120 Hertz.
[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:40.820]   So you can't, it has the wrong, like it's skipping frame.
[01:58:40.820 --> 01:58:42.500]   That's a kind of thing I just want.
[01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:43.500]   Yeah.
[01:58:43.500 --> 01:58:44.500]   Yeah.
[01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:46.980]   I want them to attention to detail.
[01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:47.980]   Yes.
[01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:48.980]   Yes.
[01:58:48.980 --> 01:58:49.980]   Apples doesn't have a problem with that.
[01:58:49.980 --> 01:58:50.980]   Most cases.
[01:58:50.980 --> 01:58:57.260]   Uh, I, what is our advice as we get ready for Monday and I start to put money into my
[01:58:57.260 --> 01:59:00.380]   piggy bank on RAM.
[01:59:00.380 --> 01:59:05.260]   Uh, it's been observed that you don't, because of unified RAM and various other things, it
[01:59:05.260 --> 01:59:10.260]   doesn't seem to be, you need as much RAM on a, on a Apple Silicon Mac as you might have
[01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:11.260]   previously.
[01:59:11.260 --> 01:59:12.260]   Yeah.
[01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:13.260]   I push back on that.
[01:59:13.260 --> 01:59:18.060]   You, you think you need it 16, 16, 16, 16 is a nice starting point.
[01:59:18.060 --> 01:59:19.620]   That's probably adequate for most people.
[01:59:19.620 --> 01:59:20.620]   Yes.
[01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:21.620]   But should we buy more?
[01:59:21.620 --> 01:59:24.500]   But a lot of people bought the Mac at eight gigs because a lot of people said, oh, you
[01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:26.140]   know, five memories, eight is a new 16.
[01:59:26.140 --> 01:59:30.180]   And it's not because like it works great, but memory pressure is still memory pressure.
[01:59:30.180 --> 01:59:34.220]   And if you need a lot of things live at the same time, or you're doing something like,
[01:59:34.220 --> 01:59:38.460]   like, like a lot of layers or like, like anything that requires simultaneous, you still
[01:59:38.460 --> 01:59:40.420]   need the actual physical memory.
[01:59:40.420 --> 01:59:45.900]   So like never skimp on memory, like the best way I can recommend is unified memory makes
[01:59:45.900 --> 01:59:48.380]   that memory the best thing that it can be.
[01:59:48.380 --> 01:59:52.580]   But the GPU, the NP, all of that is sharing that memory now still as well.
[01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:55.580]   So get the memory you need or you won't have the experience that you want.
[01:59:55.580 --> 02:00:02.140]   Who needs more 32 gigs for video editors and Photoshop users and photographers.
[02:00:02.140 --> 02:00:06.220]   I like developers using many simultaneous like simulator is a sort of how about you
[02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:07.220]   Alex?
[02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:09.420]   What is your, what is your minimum?
[02:00:09.420 --> 02:00:11.220]   I have, I have a lot of eight.
[02:00:11.220 --> 02:00:13.420]   I have mostly eight actually because I know what I'm using it for.
[02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:17.820]   So I'm using them for remote kits and just run things and we tested them and they're
[02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:20.260]   going to do, they're going to spend their whole life doing probably the same thing.
[02:00:20.260 --> 02:00:22.820]   And so I don't have as a general purpose performance machine.
[02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:25.660]   I have a 16 gig that I use for that.
[02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:30.540]   And so yeah, but, but as a general like, but I'm, but I was, I've been able to work in
[02:00:30.540 --> 02:00:33.100]   a K video on an, on an eight gig.
[02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:34.500]   It just depends on what you're doing.
[02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:41.220]   And then, and things like like motion in using us.
[02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:43.060]   I've been doing a lot of USDZ in motion.
[02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:44.460]   Apples motion.
[02:00:44.460 --> 02:00:46.060]   It really likes more RAM.
[02:00:46.060 --> 02:00:47.860]   So 32 64?
[02:00:47.860 --> 02:00:49.940]   Well, I'm working, I'm working in 8K.
[02:00:49.940 --> 02:00:55.300]   So, so in 8K 3D in motion, 16 is a better, a better choice.
[02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:56.700]   Even 16 is enough.
[02:00:56.700 --> 02:01:01.740]   So I figure if they're starting at 16, they'll offer at least 32 as well.
[02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:02.740]   I think so.
[02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:03.740]   Get 32, right?
[02:01:03.740 --> 02:01:05.460]   I wouldn't be surprised if there was 64.
[02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:07.340]   I wouldn't be surprised if there's 64 megs.
[02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:08.340]   Really?
[02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:09.340]   Oh, gigs.
[02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:14.700]   I think that it really turns, I will say 64 gigs in a, in a mini with a, with an M1X
[02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:16.380]   would be a monster of a machine.
[02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:17.380]   Yeah.
[02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:18.380]   Like just a beast.
[02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:19.380]   A Mac Pro.
[02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:20.380]   A little mini Mac Pro.
[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:22.300]   It would really, really, I mean, it would be.
[02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:23.300]   Absolutely.
[02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:25.740]   If they want to really announce their presence with authority, that's what they'll do.
[02:01:25.740 --> 02:01:26.740]   Okay.
[02:01:26.740 --> 02:01:27.740]   At least with a Mac mini.
[02:01:27.740 --> 02:01:28.740]   Okay.
[02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:30.700]   Oh, this is going to be expensive week.
[02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:34.540]   But you saved so much on the iPhone and Apple watch Leo that you really.
[02:01:34.540 --> 02:01:35.540]   Thank God.
[02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:36.540]   I didn't buy those.
[02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:42.180]   In fact, I girded my loins, so to speak, and canceled the Microsoft Duo phone.
[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:46.180]   That'll save me another 1500 bucks.
[02:01:46.180 --> 02:01:50.900]   I'm preparing myself because I, yes, I know.
[02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:51.900]   It's austerity.
[02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:52.900]   It's austerity Leo.
[02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:54.900]   We're not used to this, but we're, we're with you.
[02:01:54.900 --> 02:01:59.140]   It's like, again, I, I'm, I'm a cheapskate and even I'm like almost a gasket.
[02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:04.060]   How many times have I spent like units of $1,000 on technology this year?
[02:02:04.060 --> 02:02:06.620]   And am I, I'm really prepared to do that again next week?
[02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:07.620]   Maybe twice.
[02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:13.140]   I'm like, I guess, I guess that old mattress can last another like six months.
[02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:20.940]   Well, at least I've already found a taker for my Mac book pro 13 inch, the M one 13
[02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:23.620]   inch Lisa says she'll take that hand off.
[02:02:23.620 --> 02:02:26.860]   I gave her my Mac book here when I got that she's going to hand that off.
[02:02:26.860 --> 02:02:28.460]   We got a new employee coming in.
[02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:32.900]   We're going to slowly it all passes down the line.
[02:02:32.900 --> 02:02:34.580]   There's always somebody needs a little bit faster.
[02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:36.500]   Max, she's actually looking forward to having the M one.
[02:02:36.500 --> 02:02:39.580]   And I, I think the battery life alone will make her very, very happy.
[02:02:39.580 --> 02:02:40.580]   Oh, yeah.
[02:02:40.580 --> 02:02:41.580]   Very happy.
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:42.580]   She wants a travel Mac.
[02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:43.580]   So.
[02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:45.220]   And these will be performance mass.
[02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:46.220]   Max not efficiency.
[02:02:46.220 --> 02:02:47.220]   Max.
[02:02:47.220 --> 02:02:48.860]   So the battery life will operate and see.
[02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:49.860]   Shh.
[02:02:49.860 --> 02:02:50.860]   Cause she's really big.
[02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:52.980]   She's always says, I have to have the fastest Mac made.
[02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:53.980]   Yeah.
[02:02:53.980 --> 02:02:55.980]   Not a Mac pro though.
[02:02:55.980 --> 02:02:56.980]   She's got to move around.
[02:02:56.980 --> 02:02:58.980]   It's not my money.
[02:02:58.980 --> 02:03:06.140]   Just, you know, um, ecobee has rolled out a, I don't know if I want to throw thermostat.
[02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:08.460]   I can say hair Siri too.
[02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:11.660]   It also, and this, I don't understand it has air play integration.
[02:03:11.660 --> 02:03:12.980]   What is that?
[02:03:12.980 --> 02:03:15.500]   I could play a movie on my, on my thermostat.
[02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:16.500]   I don't understand.
[02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:19.740]   Or at least the audio maybe.
[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:20.900]   That's just peak wall speaker.
[02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:21.900]   Weird.
[02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:23.340]   Oh, is it a little wall speaker?
[02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:24.340]   Maybe.
[02:03:24.340 --> 02:03:25.340]   Maybe.
[02:03:25.340 --> 02:03:26.340]   Okay.
[02:03:26.340 --> 02:03:29.420]   It's the smart thermostat with voice control, $250.
[02:03:29.420 --> 02:03:34.180]   You can buy it on ecobee.com.
[02:03:34.180 --> 02:03:36.900]   I guess it's just like your next home pod.
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:37.900]   It's like a home pod mini.
[02:03:37.900 --> 02:03:41.020]   That's the other rumor that we haven't heard of in a while that Mark Gurman said that
[02:03:41.020 --> 02:03:45.420]   they were working on a home pod theater sort of a thing like a hybrid Apple TV home pod
[02:03:45.420 --> 02:03:50.420]   and also a home pod iPad sort of hybrid like a home pod with a screen for the kitchens
[02:03:50.420 --> 02:03:51.820]   and rooms and things like that.
[02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:55.300]   I don't think they'll be ready now, but you know, there are always, always possibilities.
[02:03:55.300 --> 02:04:03.820]   I'm just looking through all of these little crumbs.
[02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:07.660]   Anything that we haven't covered that you think we should mention.
[02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:09.220]   I mentioned Farmville.
[02:04:09.220 --> 02:04:12.820]   I mean, that's a big story.
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:13.820]   I think we're good.
[02:04:13.820 --> 02:04:17.940]   I'll tell you what, unless you guys think I missed something, let's take a break and
[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:21.140]   do our picks of the week coming up next.
[02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:22.140]   Sounds good.
[02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:23.140]   Sounds good.
[02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:24.140]   Sounds good.
[02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:25.140]   Ready.
[02:04:25.140 --> 02:04:26.140]   I'm really happy.
[02:04:26.140 --> 02:04:30.220]   This is a new sponsor to our network and I'm thrilled to have them.
[02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:31.220]   Userway.org.
[02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:35.660]   In fact, I just got a text from somebody who said, "I'm really happy you've got these guys
[02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:36.900]   as a sponsor."
[02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:39.860]   They have a widget, a little tester on their website.
[02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:41.820]   You can see how accessible your site is.
[02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:45.660]   He said, "I just paid a lot of money to make my site accessible and we thought we were
[02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:49.740]   100% WCAG compliant and they found two more things.
[02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:50.740]   Thank you, Userway."
[02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:54.700]   Userway will make your site 100% accessible.
[02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:57.540]   It's not just the right thing to do.
[02:04:57.540 --> 02:04:58.540]   It's good for business.
[02:04:58.540 --> 02:05:04.580]   It opens up your website to around 60 million disabled users.
[02:05:04.580 --> 02:05:06.980]   It also is the right thing to do from the law.
[02:05:06.980 --> 02:05:13.340]   It's the federal ADA, Americans for Disability Act requires equal access to services for
[02:05:13.340 --> 02:05:15.980]   all Americans and your website is a public entity.
[02:05:15.980 --> 02:05:18.180]   The Supreme Court ruled it so.
[02:05:18.180 --> 02:05:21.500]   Pizza Company said, "Oh, Judge, your honor.
[02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:22.860]   We don't have to make our website accessible.
[02:05:22.860 --> 02:05:24.940]   You've got a phone number."
[02:05:24.940 --> 02:05:28.020]   The judge said, "No, that's called separate but equal.
[02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:32.780]   Your public entity, your site, has to be accessible."
[02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:34.140]   Userway is kind of cool.
[02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:36.500]   It makes it really easy.
[02:05:36.500 --> 02:05:40.820]   Every website has to be accessible, but how do you make yours accessible?
[02:05:40.820 --> 02:05:44.100]   Userway has an incredible AI-powered solution.
[02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:51.780]   Tirelessly enforces the hundreds of WCAG accessibility guidelines with one line of JavaScript.
[02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:56.500]   In fact, with that single line, Userway can achieve more than an entire team of developers.
[02:05:56.500 --> 02:05:59.580]   The machine learning is great because there's things like alt tags where you have images
[02:05:59.580 --> 02:06:04.140]   on your site and you were supposed to put a text description of every image so that people
[02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:09.100]   who are using screen readers can know what that big blob on the page is.
[02:06:09.100 --> 02:06:11.300]   You remember to do that, right?
[02:06:11.300 --> 02:06:15.300]   Userway's AI sees that image, says that's the Golden Gate Bridge and adds that tag.
[02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:20.100]   If you want to add the Golden Gate Bridge at sunset, you can do that, but you get the
[02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:23.140]   basic in there just from the AI.
[02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:25.540]   Let me tell you, this is a popular solution.
[02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:33.460]   For a million websites, Userway, Coca-Cola, Disney, eBay, FedEx, Userway's best-in-class
[02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:38.300]   enterprise level accessibility tools are widely used by the biggest leading brands in the
[02:06:38.300 --> 02:06:41.980]   world and now you can use them to small to medium businesses.
[02:06:41.980 --> 02:06:44.620]   It is very affordable.
[02:06:44.620 --> 02:06:46.340]   When they told me the price, I said, "Oh, I can do that.
[02:06:46.340 --> 02:06:47.340]   I was so afraid.
[02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:49.340]   It's so hard."
[02:06:49.340 --> 02:06:50.820]   I put myself in your shoes.
[02:06:50.820 --> 02:06:52.100]   I understand.
[02:06:52.100 --> 02:06:53.100]   You've got a website.
[02:06:53.100 --> 02:06:58.940]   This is a whole additional thing to create an accessibility layer for your website.
[02:06:58.940 --> 02:07:01.700]   It seems like a lot of work and a lot of expense.
[02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:02.700]   No.
[02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:03.700]   No.
[02:07:03.700 --> 02:07:07.900]   By the way, even if you're a small business, as you scale and get bigger and bigger, Userway's
[02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:08.900]   there for you.
[02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:09.900]   When you scale, you need Userway.
[02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:11.700]   They can do Coca-Cola and Disney.
[02:07:11.700 --> 02:07:13.740]   They can hail your site.
[02:07:13.740 --> 02:07:17.220]   The accessible, compliant website is not just the right thing to do.
[02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:19.860]   It makes business sense.
[02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:21.260]   The registration forms.
[02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:22.260]   Are they accessible?
[02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:24.540]   The nav menus, the shopping carts.
[02:07:24.540 --> 02:07:30.380]   You're turning people away because your shopping cart can't be read by screen readers.
[02:07:30.380 --> 02:07:34.740]   Millions of people need Userway to make your site accessible so they can purchase your
[02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:36.660]   products.
[02:07:36.660 --> 02:07:37.740]   You want this thing.
[02:07:37.740 --> 02:07:39.420]   I love Userway.
[02:07:39.420 --> 02:07:44.180]   For years, Userway has been on the cutting edge creating innovative accessibility technologies
[02:07:44.180 --> 02:07:50.580]   that push the envelope of what's possible with AI machine learning and computer vision.
[02:07:50.580 --> 02:07:56.820]   Userway's AI automatically fixes violations at the code level, auto generates image alts,
[02:07:56.820 --> 02:08:02.900]   remediates complex nav menus, ensures pop-ups are accessible, fix vague links violations,
[02:08:02.900 --> 02:08:04.940]   fix broken links.
[02:08:04.940 --> 02:08:05.940]   This is a great one.
[02:08:05.940 --> 02:08:10.860]   You've got your Pantone palette for your company logo and all that.
[02:08:10.860 --> 02:08:17.180]   Userway makes sure that your color is accessible but without changing the color.
[02:08:17.180 --> 02:08:19.700]   It just adjusts the human luminance.
[02:08:19.700 --> 02:08:25.020]   You're true to your brand but on that accessibility layer, they can see your logo.
[02:08:25.020 --> 02:08:28.580]   You'll get a detailed report of all the violations fixed in your website so you'll know it's
[02:08:28.580 --> 02:08:29.580]   working.
[02:08:29.580 --> 02:08:32.620]   Works so easily with WordPress, Wix, Shopify.
[02:08:32.620 --> 02:08:33.620]   It's cost effective.
[02:08:33.620 --> 02:08:34.620]   It's easy to add.
[02:08:34.620 --> 02:08:37.220]   Same goes for AEM and Site Core and SharePoint.
[02:08:37.220 --> 02:08:42.020]   It integrates seamlessly with everything people are using to build websites including hand-coded
[02:08:42.020 --> 02:08:43.020]   sites.
[02:08:43.020 --> 02:08:44.620]   It's a line of JavaScript.
[02:08:44.620 --> 02:08:50.220]   That Userway help your business meet its compliance goals, improve the experience for your users,
[02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:52.620]   and use that scanning tool I mentioned.
[02:08:52.620 --> 02:08:53.820]   Check out the free scanning tool.
[02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:56.580]   You'll see if your website's ADA compliant.
[02:08:56.580 --> 02:09:01.700]   We have a word from the Voice of Siri, the world's most popular voice assistant about
[02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:02.700]   Userway.
[02:09:02.700 --> 02:09:08.620]   It's a great userway as trusted by more than 1 million websites and 60 million users with
[02:09:08.620 --> 02:09:10.620]   disabilities.
[02:09:10.620 --> 02:09:15.580]   Visit Userway.org to learn how one line of code can make your website accessible.
[02:09:15.580 --> 02:09:21.620]   That's a great Susan Bennett of course, the original Voice of Siri who loves Userway.
[02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:25.660]   Userway can make any website fully accessible and ADA compliant.
[02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:30.420]   With Userway, everyone who visits your site can browse seamlessly and customize it to
[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:31.420]   fit their needs.

[02:10:06.580 --> 02:10:09.860]   Userway, thank you Userway for supporting the show.
[02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:12.300]   Times for our picks of the week.
[02:10:12.300 --> 02:10:15.620]   Renee Abreji, kick us off.
[02:10:15.620 --> 02:10:19.940]   So with everything coming out now, we have the new iPhones, we have the new Apple watches,
[02:10:19.940 --> 02:10:22.220]   the new iPads, the new Macs coming out.
[02:10:22.220 --> 02:10:25.700]   I wanted to upgrade my charging and so this was recommended to me.
[02:10:25.700 --> 02:10:33.780]   It's a GAN charger from Hyper that lets you plug in to 100 watt USB-C's and to 18 watt
[02:10:33.780 --> 02:10:34.780]   USB-A's.
[02:10:34.780 --> 02:10:39.220]   And the nice thing about this is it's GAN which is gallium nitride.
[02:10:39.220 --> 02:10:40.220]   Gallium nitride?
[02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:41.220]   Yes, yeah.
[02:10:41.220 --> 02:10:44.460]   Yeah, which is just much more efficient material.
[02:10:44.460 --> 02:10:46.340]   It's hard to manufacture it at a vendor scale.
[02:10:46.340 --> 02:10:50.180]   That's why you don't see a lot of the bigger vendors using it yet.
[02:10:50.180 --> 02:10:54.700]   But for a lot of third parties, there are a bunch of different concerns about the environment,
[02:10:54.700 --> 02:10:56.100]   all these things, absolutely.
[02:10:56.100 --> 02:11:01.620]   But this is a very good, very efficient way to do fast charging if your device supports
[02:11:01.620 --> 02:11:02.620]   it.
[02:11:02.620 --> 02:11:07.500]   I don't think there's any chance that the M1X Max will have the same power draw that
[02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:08.500]   the Intel Max did.
[02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:12.260]   Like the 16 inch Intel MacBook Pro is 99 watts.
[02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:15.460]   I mean, it is like the US Airline.
[02:11:15.460 --> 02:11:19.020]   So that's why you're never going to have to worry if you have 100 watt charger, you're
[02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:20.020]   good.
[02:11:20.020 --> 02:11:21.460]   Yes, because that's the limit.
[02:11:21.460 --> 02:11:23.260]   And this will give you power for that.
[02:11:23.260 --> 02:11:24.700]   It will give you power for your iPad.
[02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:29.300]   Anything that has power delivery, PD, USB, CPD, because these things are so simple.
[02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:32.420]   This will suit you and you can plug in four things at a time, including like your lower
[02:11:32.420 --> 02:11:34.580]   power things like your watch on an old UIT.
[02:11:34.580 --> 02:11:39.340]   The watch can do USB-C fast charging now, but you can plug it into USB-A older devices.
[02:11:39.340 --> 02:11:45.220]   It's just nice to have high quality, high speed, four ports, two USB-C, two USB-A on
[02:11:45.220 --> 02:11:47.460]   one easy, efficient economical device.
[02:11:47.460 --> 02:11:48.940]   And they're not expensive either.
[02:11:48.940 --> 02:11:50.180]   Yeah, they're also sold out.
[02:11:50.180 --> 02:11:51.180]   But other than that...
[02:11:51.180 --> 02:11:53.380]   Boy, this is from the deal.
[02:11:53.380 --> 02:11:54.380]   You can get them.
[02:11:54.380 --> 02:11:55.380]   Like I got mine off Amazon.
[02:11:55.380 --> 02:11:57.580]   They're in stock in other places.
[02:11:57.580 --> 02:11:58.580]   Good tip.
[02:11:58.580 --> 02:12:00.500]   Yeah, I love these.
[02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:02.220]   I have a lot of GAN chargers now.
[02:12:02.220 --> 02:12:07.500]   That's all I use because they're smaller and they don't get as hot, which is great.
[02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:08.500]   Yes.
[02:12:08.500 --> 02:12:10.260]   And you can get a lot of wattage in a tiny package.
[02:12:10.260 --> 02:12:12.540]   So that's great.
[02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:14.060]   Hyperjuice.
[02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:15.220]   And I buy a lot of their stuff.
[02:12:15.220 --> 02:12:16.700]   So I think hyperjuice is safe.
[02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:19.100]   Yeah, they've been around a long time too.
[02:12:19.100 --> 02:12:20.100]   Yeah.
[02:12:20.100 --> 02:12:21.100]   Wow.
[02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:22.820]   Andy, you're not go.
[02:12:22.820 --> 02:12:24.660]   Pick of the week.
[02:12:24.660 --> 02:12:26.100]   My pick of the week is a book.
[02:12:26.100 --> 02:12:31.180]   You can have it on an audio book as a digital book or as a dead tree where Dave Grohl, the
[02:12:31.180 --> 02:12:39.020]   founder of Foo Fighters as well as a foundational member of Nirvana has written a memoir called
[02:12:39.020 --> 02:12:41.500]   The Storyteller Tales of Life and Music.
[02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:45.580]   I'm going to recommend the audio book because he reads it himself.
[02:12:45.580 --> 02:12:48.740]   And it was a really good practical choice for me.
[02:12:48.740 --> 02:12:53.180]   And I had to do a whole bunch of work that, the sort of tedious work that takes like
[02:12:53.180 --> 02:12:57.460]   all afternoon, but doesn't require more than 8% of your brain power.
[02:12:57.460 --> 02:12:59.900]   But you have to sit there at the desk and just do it.
[02:12:59.900 --> 02:13:01.300]   Grime, grind, grind, grind, grind.
[02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:05.900]   And so I just listened to this all but like the last 45 minutes of this in one shot.
[02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:12.140]   It's a really, really great music memoir because he has never, or at least never, he's never
[02:13:12.140 --> 02:13:13.620]   he's never had like a drug problem.
[02:13:13.620 --> 02:13:15.780]   He's never been to had to go to like to rehab.
[02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:18.860]   He has never like caused a band to implode.
[02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:26.940]   And also, so this is not a book about, and then there's a time where I got, I got strung
[02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:33.620]   out and then I woke up and I was like floating the top of an aquarium in Boston.
[02:13:33.620 --> 02:13:37.780]   A lot of it is very, very thoughtful is about the progress of someone who has a very artistic
[02:13:37.780 --> 02:13:47.740]   and creative personality growing up in an environment where she had immense support from his mother,
[02:13:47.740 --> 02:13:52.860]   not quite so much support from his father who was a Republican lawyer who worked in
[02:13:52.860 --> 02:13:54.500]   DC.
[02:13:54.500 --> 02:14:02.300]   And the very, very interesting path he took towards finding his first love of music and
[02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:08.980]   letting that guide him through a couple, his first band through Nirvana, through the creation
[02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:12.380]   of Foo Fighters, through adulthood, through parenthood.
[02:14:12.380 --> 02:14:17.660]   A lot of his best stories are really just about parenthood, about how, gosh, when his
[02:14:17.660 --> 02:14:21.180]   when his daughter like wants to learn how to play drums and he has to think about like
[02:14:21.180 --> 02:14:25.540]   when he took his one and only drum lesson and how that failed him, like what's the best
[02:14:25.540 --> 02:14:27.620]   way to deal with this on and on and on.
[02:14:27.620 --> 02:14:31.100]   Just it's it's telling a cohesive story from beginning to end.
[02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:35.100]   It was a real delight to listen to for eight hours while I was doing this horrible, horrible
[02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:40.900]   like pushing this pushing this huge rock up a hill all afternoon, one day.
[02:14:40.900 --> 02:14:42.780]   What are you working in the backyard?
[02:14:42.780 --> 02:14:45.380]   No, no, it was a rock.
[02:14:45.380 --> 02:14:52.980]   It was it was it was related to it was related to the thing that I was talking about earlier.
[02:14:52.980 --> 02:14:56.140]   I keep rolling back down and rolling backwards and you had to do it again and again day after
[02:14:56.140 --> 02:14:57.140]   day.
[02:14:57.140 --> 02:14:59.380]   And also felt like the rock was made out of Lego.
[02:14:59.380 --> 02:15:03.260]   Like every time you slip like it breaks apart, you have to rebuild the rock.
[02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:05.100]   I'm going to put your meal again.
[02:15:05.100 --> 02:15:09.660]   They basically this is this is every time I try to do like construction or maintenance
[02:15:09.660 --> 02:15:10.940]   on a website.
[02:15:10.940 --> 02:15:13.980]   It's like, oh my f and God, I hate this.
[02:15:13.980 --> 02:15:14.980]   I hate this.
[02:15:14.980 --> 02:15:16.300]   I would much rather either there.
[02:15:16.300 --> 02:15:21.300]   I live like joining to a lot of farms and I'm thinking that while much more pleasant would
[02:15:21.300 --> 02:15:24.580]   it be to be harvesting pumpkins all day today?
[02:15:24.580 --> 02:15:25.700]   Wouldn't that be wonderful?
[02:15:25.700 --> 02:15:27.180]   I wouldn't have to deal with CSS.
[02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:30.820]   You have to deal with, oh, you forgot to separate the permissions correctly on this file and
[02:15:30.820 --> 02:15:32.620]   that's why you have no fonts.
[02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:37.300]   Like, okay, it's probably too late to tell you about my preferred website generator, which
[02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:40.020]   is called Hugo, which is a static site builder.
[02:15:40.020 --> 02:15:43.580]   It's very, very fast and very easy to use.
[02:15:43.580 --> 02:15:49.340]   But I won't mention that because you've obviously I run my own services across the
[02:15:49.340 --> 02:15:51.140]   across the room here running Hugo.
[02:15:51.140 --> 02:15:55.740]   And when I do an update, literally four milliseconds, I mean, it's that fast to do the update and
[02:15:55.740 --> 02:15:57.980]   rebuilds the whole site each time.
[02:15:57.980 --> 02:16:00.780]   So it's static, which is great.
[02:16:00.780 --> 02:16:02.580]   I have an ego.
[02:16:02.580 --> 02:16:07.220]   However, my ego is not so great as to allow myself to be responsible for the security of
[02:16:07.220 --> 02:16:08.220]   my own website.
[02:16:08.220 --> 02:16:10.980]   So you're running your own server and all that?
[02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:12.860]   No, no, no, I'm saying I don't want to have anything to do with that.
[02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:14.860]   You don't want to have anything to do with that.
[02:16:14.860 --> 02:16:18.460]   I know that if I were responsible for the security of the site, it would just be a disaster.
[02:16:18.460 --> 02:16:20.540]   Oh, you know, I just set up Debbie in.
[02:16:20.540 --> 02:16:21.540]   It's easy.
[02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:23.060]   It's a problem.
[02:16:23.060 --> 02:16:24.820]   A bunch of all in your network.
[02:16:24.820 --> 02:16:25.820]   You're good to go.
[02:16:25.820 --> 02:16:26.820]   There you go.
[02:16:26.820 --> 02:16:29.140]   Alex Lindsey, pick of the week.
[02:16:29.140 --> 02:16:32.660]   So I'm recommending something that I don't own yet, but I do know people who do own it
[02:16:32.660 --> 02:16:34.020]   and are shooting with it.
[02:16:34.020 --> 02:16:36.900]   And I'm recommending it because it's really groundbreaking.
[02:16:36.900 --> 02:16:39.620]   And I think that people just keep an eye on it.
[02:16:39.620 --> 02:16:42.020]   So it's only three Alex's too.
[02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:43.020]   It's a great deal.
[02:16:43.020 --> 02:16:44.020]   Exactly.
[02:16:44.020 --> 02:16:46.660]   So it's so much worse than three Alex's.
[02:16:46.660 --> 02:16:49.380]   So anyway, so this is from Canon.
[02:16:49.380 --> 02:16:53.260]   I just want people to pay attention to it because this is going to change for a lot of
[02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:56.220]   us who have done VR and stereo.
[02:16:56.220 --> 02:17:02.780]   This is what we were missing was a relatively affordable lens that we could pop onto our
[02:17:02.780 --> 02:17:04.700]   camera and shoot stereo.
[02:17:04.700 --> 02:17:07.060]   Now, this is basically what it is.
[02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:09.220]   It's a dual, fisheye lens.
[02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:12.260]   And there have been cheap versions and old German versions.
[02:17:12.260 --> 02:17:15.780]   And, you know, people have been playing, you know, with this type of thing for a long
[02:17:15.780 --> 02:17:16.780]   time.
[02:17:16.780 --> 02:17:17.780]   It's really intriguing.
[02:17:17.780 --> 02:17:18.780]   Wow.
[02:17:18.780 --> 02:17:22.140]   And so what this does is this now this works, I believe only on the R5.
[02:17:22.140 --> 02:17:24.820]   Yeah, you'd need to have the, because it's Canon's VR.
[02:17:24.820 --> 02:17:25.820]   Who's the camera?
[02:17:25.820 --> 02:17:26.820]   Yeah.
[02:17:26.820 --> 02:17:27.820]   You got to get the camera.
[02:17:27.820 --> 02:17:31.580]   But the reason they can do this is because it's such a high resolution on the one sensor.
[02:17:31.580 --> 02:17:35.060]   And here's the problem that we've had is a lot of us have used two cameras and where
[02:17:35.060 --> 02:17:39.420]   we use a lot of things and keeping that all in sync and then transporting that along has
[02:17:39.420 --> 02:17:41.500]   been, you know, a thing, right?
[02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:44.580]   Because we have two different signals and we have to keep them gen locked and we have
[02:17:44.580 --> 02:17:49.900]   to keep everything working by taking both images and putting them both onto the same
[02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:53.340]   sensor and basically capturing them together.
[02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:54.940]   It's just so much easier to work with.
[02:17:54.940 --> 02:17:59.140]   And so now all there is is to, you know, have the tools that to unwrap those, which
[02:17:59.140 --> 02:18:02.100]   will, I'm sure will come very quickly after that.
[02:18:02.100 --> 02:18:06.380]   And you know, this is going to, I think, and a lot of us have found, I mean, we love
[02:18:06.380 --> 02:18:11.780]   360, but a lot of us have found that the dual 180 is what a lot of people want when
[02:18:11.780 --> 02:18:16.100]   they come, they like, they're going to go to a concert dealing with a big camera that
[02:18:16.100 --> 02:18:19.380]   are two cameras and all these other things when you have to load in is not something
[02:18:19.380 --> 02:18:20.900]   that any of us want.
[02:18:20.900 --> 02:18:23.400]   We did it, but we didn't enjoy it.
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:27.060]   And so having something that you just pop on and hit record and then you're able to
[02:18:27.060 --> 02:18:30.880]   unwrap it and you're able to take advantage of the camera and the camera can be used for
[02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:31.880]   other things.
[02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:33.340]   It's not like, yeah, you just, uh, yeah.
[02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:34.340]   No, it's not.
[02:18:34.340 --> 02:18:35.980]   It's a really good camera.
[02:18:35.980 --> 02:18:36.980]   This is our phone.
[02:18:36.980 --> 02:18:37.980]   It's a really nice camera.
[02:18:37.980 --> 02:18:38.980]   Yeah.
[02:18:38.980 --> 02:18:42.700]   And then you're popping just as lens, this lens is one of the things that you can do with
[02:18:42.700 --> 02:18:43.700]   it.
[02:18:43.700 --> 02:18:48.100]   And I think that, I think it's really, really fascinating.
[02:18:48.100 --> 02:18:52.300]   You know, I've wanted this kind of lens for a long time and I've had cheap ones and I've
[02:18:52.300 --> 02:18:56.900]   had, again, I've had, I have friends that have old German ones that were built in the,
[02:18:56.900 --> 02:18:57.900]   you know, 50s.
[02:18:57.900 --> 02:19:01.740]   I mean, people have been playing, this is not a new thing, you know, stereo, you know,
[02:19:01.740 --> 02:19:03.460]   180 or stereo imagery.
[02:19:03.460 --> 02:19:08.660]   And so anyway, so I think it's, uh, it's exciting to see it all like finally something
[02:19:08.660 --> 02:19:11.300]   because you just kept on going, if someone just built a real one of these.
[02:19:11.300 --> 02:19:15.940]   And so I wanted to kind of let people know it's there and kind of help push it forward.
[02:19:15.940 --> 02:19:16.940]   Right.
[02:19:16.940 --> 02:19:17.940]   A good friend of mine has, has one.
[02:19:17.940 --> 02:19:19.700]   I don't know if I can mention his name.
[02:19:19.700 --> 02:19:21.580]   So I'll keep in trouble.
[02:19:21.580 --> 02:19:22.820]   But he's been shooting with it.
[02:19:22.820 --> 02:19:25.580]   But Mr. Lucas has been using it for a while then.
[02:19:25.580 --> 02:19:26.580]   So yeah.
[02:19:26.580 --> 02:19:32.380]   So, so it's, but it's, it really changes a lot of what stops us from doing VR has been
[02:19:32.380 --> 02:19:34.380]   the difficulty and acquisition.
[02:19:34.380 --> 02:19:36.740]   And it's a camera you'd want anyway.
[02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:37.740]   Yeah.
[02:19:37.740 --> 02:19:41.060]   Now what you're going to, it only works with Premiere and the software plugin is not available
[02:19:41.060 --> 02:19:42.140]   to only next year.
[02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:43.140]   So it is kind of here.
[02:19:43.140 --> 02:19:44.540]   Well, it only works for Premiere now.
[02:19:44.540 --> 02:19:48.580]   But the chances of it not being supported by Final Cut and Motion are very low.
[02:19:48.580 --> 02:19:51.420]   You know, I don't know, I don't have any insight information, but they're already going
[02:19:51.420 --> 02:19:53.820]   down the VR, you know, pipeline.
[02:19:53.820 --> 02:19:57.820]   I would be really surprised if within, within, you know, and it's still going to take time.
[02:19:57.820 --> 02:20:01.780]   And there's, there are, you know, there's already, um, I can't think of the name of
[02:20:01.780 --> 02:20:08.420]   it right now, but there's already other, um, software companies that, uh, do, you know,
[02:20:08.420 --> 02:20:10.820]   have, well, this is how the Rica Theta works.
[02:20:10.820 --> 02:20:14.500]   This is how a lot of companies, you know, the Theta has dual.
[02:20:14.500 --> 02:20:15.500]   Right.
[02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:17.220]   Fish eye lenses and it has to wait on either side.
[02:20:17.220 --> 02:20:18.220]   Yeah.
[02:20:18.220 --> 02:20:21.860]   They're not, they're not 180 degrees or 360, but someone who's owned lots and lots of
[02:20:21.860 --> 02:20:22.860]   Theta's they're great.
[02:20:22.860 --> 02:20:23.860]   No, we love it.
[02:20:23.860 --> 02:20:24.860]   Yeah.
[02:20:24.860 --> 02:20:25.860]   I love it.
[02:20:25.860 --> 02:20:26.860]   This is good as cameras quality.
[02:20:26.860 --> 02:20:29.060]   But this is, but this means that you could go shoot a, you know, again, you could shoot
[02:20:29.060 --> 02:20:32.220]   a concert and put it up or you could shoot a wedding.
[02:20:32.220 --> 02:20:34.060]   People could see it on the quest.
[02:20:34.060 --> 02:20:35.060]   Yeah.
[02:20:35.060 --> 02:20:36.060]   Yeah.
[02:20:36.060 --> 02:20:40.220]   And people can, and, and so, um, yeah, definitely for the quest, it means that things
[02:20:40.220 --> 02:20:42.980]   like space, or I don't know what they call it now, but you know, the thing where you can
[02:20:42.980 --> 02:20:46.860]   watch things together is, you know, all that stuff is, is there.
[02:20:46.860 --> 02:20:49.380]   And this technology is going to keep on moving forward.
[02:20:49.380 --> 02:20:53.620]   And this is, I just, all I wanted to do is I talk to some folks and I was like, is it,
[02:20:53.620 --> 02:20:54.620]   is it worth it?
[02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:58.340]   Like someone who's actually using it and he was like, yeah, it's game changer.
[02:20:58.340 --> 02:21:01.140]   So, so, and he's one of the smarter people I know.
[02:21:01.140 --> 02:21:06.700]   So, so anyway, so, uh, so, so he, I wanted to, I haven't been able to get, I'm going to,
[02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:10.340]   I'm just now saving up my ducats because I have to buy an R5 and I have to buy the lens.
[02:21:10.340 --> 02:21:11.340]   That's the problem.
[02:21:11.340 --> 02:21:12.900]   The lens is only two grand.
[02:21:12.900 --> 02:21:17.140]   But the R5 is probably like four or five, 3500, 3500 or 4000 or something.
[02:21:17.140 --> 02:21:18.140]   It's, it's real money.
[02:21:18.140 --> 02:21:19.140]   Yeah.
[02:21:19.140 --> 02:21:22.940]   So I'm, I have other things on my plate to buy right now that, you know, that I, so I
[02:21:22.940 --> 02:21:27.220]   haven't bought it yet, but, but I'm going to probably rent it and shoot it sooner.
[02:21:27.220 --> 02:21:28.900]   And this is the kind of thing you could rent.
[02:21:28.900 --> 02:21:33.060]   And I bet you borrow lenses eventually will rent this in like three months for, you know,
[02:21:33.060 --> 02:21:35.060]   three and a quarter of a day, or something.
[02:21:35.060 --> 02:21:37.220]   Manufacturers suggested retail and a knife.
[02:21:37.220 --> 02:21:43.220]   I was three thousand eight hundred and ninety nine delis, but they have new VR firmware,
[02:21:43.220 --> 02:21:44.580]   which is not quite out yet.
[02:21:44.580 --> 02:21:47.460]   So you, you probably, this is something you're going to watch for the next six.
[02:21:47.460 --> 02:21:48.860]   It's just something you want to keep your eye out on.
[02:21:48.860 --> 02:21:53.180]   I mean, I, and it's just, it's a space that I've spent a lot of time in for a long time.
[02:21:53.180 --> 02:21:57.340]   And very, every once in a while, you very, we kind of felt like nothing new was happening.
[02:21:57.340 --> 02:21:59.580]   How much did you pay for the Osmo again?
[02:21:59.580 --> 02:22:00.580]   Not to.
[02:22:00.580 --> 02:22:01.580]   Osmo was really cheap.
[02:22:01.580 --> 02:22:02.580]   The, the, Ozo.
[02:22:02.580 --> 02:22:03.580]   I mean, Ozo was not.
[02:22:03.580 --> 02:22:04.580]   Yeah.
[02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:05.580]   Not the Ozo.
[02:22:05.580 --> 02:22:13.300]   The first, the first Ozo I bought was a 60 grand and the next two, the next two were only
[02:22:13.300 --> 02:22:14.900]   thirty five thousand.
[02:22:14.900 --> 02:22:16.900]   And then the last three were seven.
[02:22:16.900 --> 02:22:17.900]   Yeah.
[02:22:17.900 --> 02:22:19.340]   And I paid them all off.
[02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:20.340]   You pay a price.
[02:22:20.340 --> 02:22:21.340]   You know, like, you're an early adopter.
[02:22:21.340 --> 02:22:22.340]   You pay a price.
[02:22:22.340 --> 02:22:24.500]   Yeah, but it wasn't, I, I made all the money back.
[02:22:24.500 --> 02:22:26.500]   So they were, they, they paid themselves off.
[02:22:26.500 --> 02:22:31.020]   You got to be when you're out that far in front and you buy, you, you, you, when you're
[02:22:31.020 --> 02:22:33.700]   willing to do that, you're one of the only people out there that have them.
[02:22:33.700 --> 02:22:38.380]   So if someone wants that, then yeah, like I got, I got to go dumpster diving behind
[02:22:38.380 --> 02:22:39.380]   your office someday.
[02:22:39.380 --> 02:22:40.380]   I won't.
[02:22:40.380 --> 02:22:42.060]   I, let me be surprised.
[02:22:42.060 --> 02:22:43.060]   Don't, don't tell me.
[02:22:43.060 --> 02:22:44.300]   Or it was, what's back there.
[02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:46.100]   I don't think they're in the dumpster.
[02:22:46.100 --> 02:22:47.580]   I hate to say everything.
[02:22:47.580 --> 02:22:48.580]   Everything.
[02:22:48.580 --> 02:22:51.900]   When my last company closed up, everything happened so quickly and chaotically that there's
[02:22:51.900 --> 02:22:54.060]   stuff in my garage that are stacked in there.
[02:22:54.060 --> 02:22:57.420]   It was like, it's like, it's a little, it's kind of what I found.
[02:22:57.420 --> 02:23:01.780]   I got a really good deal on a Sony, a video camera for Henry actually.
[02:23:01.780 --> 02:23:02.780]   Oh, nice.
[02:23:02.780 --> 02:23:03.780]   Yeah.
[02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:06.020]   You got, no, you got me the, I bought it from you.
[02:23:06.020 --> 02:23:10.060]   I don't remember what I sold you, but that's great.
[02:23:10.060 --> 02:23:12.860]   That's like, I don't remember what that was.
[02:23:12.860 --> 02:23:13.860]   So yeah.
[02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:14.860]   He was all right.
[02:23:14.860 --> 02:23:18.140]   He doesn't use it anymore because he's now using the Canon to shoot and I would have
[02:23:18.140 --> 02:23:22.420]   met, I could see Henry at our five in his future and this one as well.
[02:23:22.420 --> 02:23:23.420]   Yeah, absolutely.
[02:23:23.420 --> 02:23:24.420]   Yeah, absolutely.
[02:23:24.420 --> 02:23:25.420]   Very interesting.
[02:23:25.420 --> 02:23:26.420]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:23:26.420 --> 02:23:27.420]   Thank you.
[02:23:27.420 --> 02:23:28.420]   All three of you.
[02:23:28.420 --> 02:23:30.220]   Alex, what's going on in the office hours?
[02:23:30.220 --> 02:23:33.900]   Oh, you know, we're, it's just crazy.
[02:23:33.900 --> 02:23:38.260]   I mean, it's just that you, every day, we're just getting up and discussing a lot of the
[02:23:38.260 --> 02:23:40.380]   stuff really, you know, it's incredible.
[02:23:40.380 --> 02:23:43.980]   The answer is just on the average day that we're kind of putting together.
[02:23:43.980 --> 02:23:47.580]   We're really getting much closer to what we call office hours 2.0, which is really going
[02:23:47.580 --> 02:23:51.860]   to look much more like a show like this one, but with 16 panelists.
[02:23:51.860 --> 02:23:53.820]   So, this is not even a year old.
[02:23:53.820 --> 02:23:55.860]   You started this, this is week 41.
[02:23:55.860 --> 02:23:59.340]   So this is week 41 for, yeah, yeah.
[02:23:59.340 --> 02:24:02.380]   This is week 41 for the website, I think.
[02:24:02.380 --> 02:24:03.380]   It is.
[02:24:03.380 --> 02:24:04.380]   Okay.
[02:24:04.380 --> 02:24:08.460]   We started, we're, we're episode, I think, five, 60 something or other.
[02:24:08.460 --> 02:24:10.380]   You know, so, because we do it every day.
[02:24:10.380 --> 02:24:11.380]   Right.
[02:24:11.380 --> 02:24:12.380]   So, but it's, yeah.
[02:24:12.380 --> 02:24:13.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:24:13.380 --> 02:24:18.580]   We're running, we'll be two years in March and, and the, but now what we're doing.
[02:24:18.580 --> 02:24:19.780]   I mean, everything's kind of branched out.
[02:24:19.780 --> 02:24:20.860]   There's a lot of shows.
[02:24:20.860 --> 02:24:23.540]   So like, there's a thing called conversations with Tony Mobley.
[02:24:23.540 --> 02:24:26.500]   I think he's on there right now on the website there that you were showing.
[02:24:26.500 --> 02:24:32.340]   Tony is, he's in, so Tony has been, again, has just really come up through the, you know,
[02:24:32.340 --> 02:24:35.940]   from starting with just trying to figure out how to get his laptop and his, his own
[02:24:35.940 --> 02:24:39.780]   show and people, we literally produce his show in AWS.
[02:24:39.780 --> 02:24:41.740]   So everyone connects via zoom.
[02:24:41.740 --> 02:24:47.340]   So like you're doing, like we're all connected here, except that's all happening in, in AWS
[02:24:47.340 --> 02:24:50.940]   with, you know, V mix in the cloud and, and zoom and everything else.
[02:24:50.940 --> 02:24:51.940]   And everyone's just figuring it out.
[02:24:51.940 --> 02:24:54.900]   This is just like something everyone's doing for fun, you know, like to figure this out.
[02:24:54.900 --> 02:24:59.220]   And so Tony interviews people and we have shows and graphics and super sources and everything
[02:24:59.220 --> 02:25:00.860]   else, but it's all happening in the cloud.
[02:25:00.860 --> 02:25:05.580]   And then on Saturday, we're, we're learning to make chai from Dunya, Antigarja, which,
[02:25:05.580 --> 02:25:06.900]   which I'm very excited about.
[02:25:06.900 --> 02:25:10.900]   Like is like, like authentic chai from scratch.
[02:25:10.900 --> 02:25:14.780]   And so that's going to be kind of a, we experiment with this idea of cooking together and using
[02:25:14.780 --> 02:25:15.780]   cameras and stuff.
[02:25:15.780 --> 02:25:19.780]   And then then we're going to take over a, a bar in Belfast.
[02:25:19.780 --> 02:25:24.020]   So the accidental theater, we, and they have a band that we're playing and we're cutting
[02:25:24.020 --> 02:25:25.260]   cameras and doing graphics.
[02:25:25.260 --> 02:25:28.340]   So we're going, instead of going out to the cloud, we're coming in from all over the world
[02:25:28.340 --> 02:25:30.860]   and taking over all the hardware that's there.
[02:25:30.860 --> 02:25:33.940]   And it's just an incredible group of people that just, you know, like, Hey, let's figure
[02:25:33.940 --> 02:25:34.940]   this out.
[02:25:34.940 --> 02:25:35.940]   And then they just start figuring it out.
[02:25:35.940 --> 02:25:36.940]   Yeah.
[02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:37.940]   Every year from Emory on his yacht.
[02:25:37.940 --> 02:25:38.940]   Is he?
[02:25:38.940 --> 02:25:40.940]   I haven't heard from him yet.
[02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:44.380]   Every every every surprisingly hard to reach now.
[02:25:44.380 --> 02:25:45.380]   Yeah.
[02:25:45.380 --> 02:25:47.380]   So it's a lot of bad cell phone coverage.
[02:25:47.380 --> 02:25:52.220]   And he's going to be for the dollars and, you know, you know, you know, disappear.
[02:25:52.220 --> 02:25:53.220]   Yeah.
[02:25:53.220 --> 02:25:54.220]   Yeah.
[02:25:54.220 --> 02:25:55.220]   So, yeah.
[02:25:55.220 --> 02:25:56.220]   So anyway, yes.
[02:25:56.220 --> 02:26:03.140]   Office hours dot global to find out more to see the videos and join their fun.
[02:26:03.140 --> 02:26:05.980]   Live via zoom 24 seven.
[02:26:05.980 --> 02:26:09.900]   As somebody as a Zeph six in the chat room is saying Alex lives in the future and you
[02:26:09.900 --> 02:26:11.820]   get to join it every morning.
[02:26:11.820 --> 02:26:12.820]   We all live.
[02:26:12.820 --> 02:26:13.820]   It does feel like you're living in the future.
[02:26:13.820 --> 02:26:14.820]   Yeah.
[02:26:14.820 --> 02:26:15.820]   Very much.
[02:26:15.820 --> 02:26:18.940]   I spent more time with the people in, in office hours than I have with anyone.
[02:26:18.940 --> 02:26:22.100]   It's actually the nice version of the squid game is what it is.
[02:26:22.100 --> 02:26:23.100]   If you really want to know what the squid game is.
[02:26:23.100 --> 02:26:24.100]   I don't know what that is.
[02:26:24.100 --> 02:26:25.100]   Yeah.
[02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:26.100]   I don't know what that is.
[02:26:26.100 --> 02:26:27.100]   Yeah.
[02:26:27.100 --> 02:26:35.460]   Actually not go WGBH Boston when Friday one PM go to WGBH news.org to stream it live or
[02:26:35.460 --> 02:26:36.460]   stream it later.
[02:26:36.460 --> 02:26:39.140]   Well, that was easy indeed.
[02:26:39.140 --> 02:26:40.140]   Okay.
[02:26:40.140 --> 02:26:41.140]   Thank you.
[02:26:41.140 --> 02:26:46.060]   And Renee Richie, what are you working on on YouTube these days or anywhere?
[02:26:46.060 --> 02:26:51.620]   I have my yeah, I have my Apple event preview up and I just did a deep dive on the pros
[02:26:51.620 --> 02:26:56.220]   and cons of what we're hearing about for the new M1X MacBook MacBooks Pro.
[02:26:56.220 --> 02:27:01.540]   So if you're a fan, you want them to learn about this like this morning, you were fast.
[02:27:01.540 --> 02:27:05.740]   I'm a studio Leo.
[02:27:05.740 --> 02:27:06.740]   You're quick.
[02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:09.740]   YouTube.com/Renee Richie.
