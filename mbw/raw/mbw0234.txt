[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.080]   Hi, everyone.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.240]   Welcome back to Macbreak Weekly.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.040]   This is Alex sitting in for Leo, who
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.880]   is somewhere near Antarctica.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.960]   He's not near Antarctica.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.160]   He's in Peru.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.080]   He's going to Peru soon.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.640]   He's in the water.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.120]   Doesn't have a very good connection.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.080]   He's not in the water by himself, by the way.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.320]   He's actually in a boat with a bunch of other people.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.720]   Hopefully, it's still working.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.160]   And we're going to get Leo back in a timely fashion.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.200]   But anyway, so I'll be hosting today.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.520]   Also with me here is Ron Brinkman.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.360]   Hey, Ron.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.840]   How you doing?
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.240]   Ron is actually in the studio.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.560]   I am the Twig Cottage.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.800]   It's good to have you up here.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.840]   It's great to be here.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.080]   Ron, by the way, has hosted with me
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.000]   on this weekend photography for a long time.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.040]   And used to work for the mothership.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.600]   It's working for a certain company
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.120]   that we'll be talking about today.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.200]   I was just down in Cooportino yesterday catching up
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.760]   with some folks.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.320]   So anyway, so welcome here.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.400]   And then we also have Ryan Block coming in from San Francisco.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.400]   Hey, Ryan.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.920]   Hey, thanks for having me.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.000]   It's great to have you.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.400]   So anyway, we've got a lot of good news coming up here.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.800]   We have Apple unveiling the subscription service.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.600]   So we heard this was going to happen.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.480]   We're going to get some kind of subscription service.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.200]   We didn't know exactly what it was going to look like or when.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.920]   But Apple has finally rolled it out.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.720]   Now, here are the caveats.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.480]   As you can do a subscription service.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.680]   But you need to-- if you're going to subscribe from the App Store,
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.960]   Apple's going to get its 30%.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.440]   If you bring a subscriber in from outside,
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.560]   you get to keep 100%.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.440]   But you have to give the users a choice.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.600]   Ryan, what do you think of that proposal by Apple?
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.280]   Well, so my friends in the publishing industry
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.440]   have told me that they kind of had two major issues with the whole thing.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.840]   One was, before all these details were announced,
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.880]   their issues were, they didn't get to keep any of the subscriber info.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.840]   So they didn't really know who's subscribing.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.760]   And as you might assume, in the publishing industry,
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.000]   that's really important information.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.320]   That's how they sell ads.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.520]   Much more so than we do online.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.760]   So they really wanted that information.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.800]   It looks like they're going to get it.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.040]   They have an optional subscriber information data package,
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.960]   I guess, that they can bundle into the subscription.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.920]   So you can find out a little bit of demographic data of who's subscribing.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.600]   And then the other issue was the split and what
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.040]   happens to existing subscribers.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.840]   But what's not clear to me, I guess, is if you're a magazine company
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.280]   or you're a publishing company and you want to transition subscribers over
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.440]   and still maintain that 100% share of the profits of your publication,
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.760]   what is the mechanism for doing that?
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.400]   That's not really explained.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.600]   Yeah, and I think it might be coming clear.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.200]   Go ahead, Ron.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.560]   Well, it's not explained.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.320]   But they were pretty clear in saying that if subscribers were brought in,
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.760]   you know, not through Apple, but from some outside source,
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.880]   that Apple would not be taking that 30% cut.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.440]   So obviously, they acknowledge that it's only the people that come to their
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.160]   through some Apple mechanism to do it.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.800]   So clearly, they are planning on offering that somehow.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.800]   And I can understand Apple's point to an extent.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.240]   And I think they're just trying to unify this across all their different offerings
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.560]   that if people come in through Apple, they get a cut of it.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.280]   But it's not this--
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.800]   I mean, there was a lot of talk about this being some unilateral--
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.880]   the boom has dropped and you have to buy everything through the Apple store.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.040]   And that doesn't seem to be the case, at least.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.760]   Yeah, well, the argument, according to Mr. Jobs,
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.120]   is that our philosophy is simple.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.200]   When Apple brings a new subscriber to the app, Apple earns 30% share.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.080]   When a publisher brings an existing or new subscriber to the app,
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.920]   the publisher keeps 100%, and Apple earns nothing.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.480]   All we require is that if a publisher is making a subscription offer outside of the app,
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.280]   the same or better offer is made inside the app,
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.960]   so the customers can easily subscribe with a one click right in the app.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.280]   Now, the thing is, is I think that Apple kind of knows this is their buyer patch.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.720]   It is a lot easier to order on.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.400]   I mean, the drug of the iTunes store and the App Store and everything else
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.960]   is that if I could order Campbell's soup on the App Store, I probably would.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.000]   And so because I just don't want to deal with it,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.400]   they have my credit card information, I don't have to put it in.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.880]   Is this telling basically--
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.840]   This is no different than what Amazon does with their MP3 store.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.040]   What Apple does to Amazon with their MP3 store, right?
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.000]   You can purchase songs from Apple or you can go to Amazon and you can buy songs there,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.600]   and then they get--
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.520]   You bring them into iTunes and you can listen to them there,
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.320]   but you're right.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.360]   Almost everybody just says, I mean, I personally go to Amazon
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.760]   just because I'm feeling rebellious.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.240]   But in terms of the ease of use, you can't deny that the one click through the Apple store
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.480]   is the easier way to do it.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.480]   And they know that.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.360]   They're smart.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.360]   Ryan, do you think that these companies that are doing the subscriptions
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.640]   can compete with the Apple store?
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.920]   Yeah, I mean, I don't think that it's really--
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.120]   the competition kind of factors into it.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.640]   I mean, I think that a lot of publishers want to be on the tablet form factors
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.200]   that are becoming very quickly so popular.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.280]   And when the iPad was first launched, actually, the very first thing that I said about,
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.200]   my biggest criticism of the iPad was that there was no magazine
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.240]   or publishing subscription model.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.280]   And that's obviously not that big of a criticism when you think about it
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.200]   because it was a brand new product.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:46.240]   But from day one, I saw a lot of potential in the form factor for this kind of media.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.320]   And I'm hoping the publishers are going to go on onto it really quickly
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.280]   because all of their other efforts between micro-payments online
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:02.120]   and free services online and by current mobile devices just have not been very good for revenue.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.600]   Well, isn't part of the problem is that it's a pain in the neck to try to sign up.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.720]   I mean, that's the thing that's kept me from signing up for a lot of these.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.960]   And that's the thing that the app store--
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.560]   I think that the-- it seems to me that the concern that they have
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.160]   is that it's going to be so easy to sign up on the app store that they're--
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.200]   or from in-app.
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.760]   You know, download the demo, sign up for it, or do it.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.680]   That no one would ever go to their actual site and sign up.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.120]   They're going to lose, you know, many potential-- a lot of money.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.920]   I mean, we're not talking about little dimes here.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.560]   If a million people subscribe, we're talking about tens of millions of dollars
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.520]   that are going into Apple's pocket instead of theirs.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.200]   Well, I think that instead of this is not necessarily a fair statement, though,
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.920]   because like we've seen with the app store on the OS X,
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.240]   you know, there's this potentially order of magnitude,
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.280]   greater number of people that suddenly start buying certain things
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.640]   because it is accessible.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.320]   And that's really the trade-off that I think Apple is offering
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.600]   and that most publishers need to recognize is that very little revenue,
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.560]   even if you're getting 100% of it, is not as good as a lot of revenue
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.560]   where you're only getting 70% of it.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.480]   Well, the other thing to remember is that the cost structure is radically different.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.960]   And for publishers who print paper publications,
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.960]   which, you know, many still do, obviously, that number is decreasing almost by the day.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.800]   But for those that do printing on paper and then shipping that paper out,
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.600]   either via mail or to new stands, is by far the largest expense of the publication.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.480]   And always has been.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.280]   In some cases, even more so than actually staffing the publication.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:42.840]   So, you know, a lot of publications that 50% of their cost structure
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.960]   is dedicated to printing a paper magazine or a Newsweek,
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.360]   you know, even with that 30% that Apple might be taking for new subscribers,
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.000]   I think that it's actually going to work out very much so in their favor.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.600]   I think part of the problem is they need to make that transition.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.080]   And that's not going to be instant.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.720]   And obviously, you know, as many iPads as there are out there right now,
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.360]   even just in year one, we're still not at the level of penetration as, you know, a mailbox
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.480]   and a subscriber card for a time magazine.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.080]   Yeah, and if anybody's going to save the printed industry,
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.320]   and I'm not sure it can be saved, but this is what it takes.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.800]   It takes a big company that makes it very easy to get to this, to get to the content.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.200]   Because you just can't do it once you choose it.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.080]   You can't have every website trying to put something out there.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.600]   So, and one of the issues has been is that everybody is doing it differently.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.280]   So everybody's got their own little system and their own little way of working
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.560]   and this is going to be it and then we're going to give you these points
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.480]   and you're going to sign up on our web page and then you've downloaded it.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.720]   And the thing is, is by unifying all of that, you know, it just changes that whole model really quickly.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.080]   And the subscription model is the key to it.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.200]   And I worked at Amazon for a while too, and I was peripherally involved with them trying to figure out,
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.920]   I was in meetings, you know, trying to figure out how to, because Amazon sells magazines,
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.640]   even though most people don't realize it, but you can buy subscriptions on there.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.240]   And it's a huge win, because once you subscribe to something, you tend to renew.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.640]   People tend to renew.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.520]   So it's a nice, predictable revenue stream if you can get it.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.800]   But it was just so hard to kind of unify that.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.040]   And at least here's an opportunity to do it in the digital realm.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:17.840]   Now that Apple's got a recurring model, so they built this all out,
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.480]   they have a whole way of managing it for subscriptions.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.880]   Do we think that there's Ryan?
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:30.080]   Do we think that there's any possibility that this subscription model might be extended to something like music?
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:37.640]   I mean, I think that the differences in the publishing industry and the music industry are,
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:43.040]   especially within the cost structure, might make that a lot more difficult to do.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:50.880]   When you look at how subscription music works and how the economics trickle down to the record company and the artists,
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.880]   when you're paying per stream versus when you're paying per stream.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.120]   Which is mostly a flow to the record company and then a trickle to the artists, right?
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.880]   Yeah, in most cases.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.640]   It's just the numbers are completely different.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:10.160]   There's actually a really interesting graphic out there that shows how many CDs,
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.400]   if you were to purchase 1,000 CDs at a retail store,
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:22.360]   how much of that slice goes to the artist versus if you stream it on RDO and Rhapsody and Napster.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.160]   And if you bought it on iTunes, you bought it on Amazon.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:33.480]   And in cases for things like Spotify or RDO, you literally have to stream an album millions and millions of times per month
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:38.640]   to even come close to just selling 1,000 physical CDs.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.760]   So I think the cost structure is totally different.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.960]   It's not going to be, "Oh yeah, the publishers did it.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.720]   So now the music industry is going to do it."
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:52.920]   Well, but the reality though is that Apple and Amazon are pretty much the last holdouts
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.480]   for non-subscription services.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.360]   So while they're doing that, there's not that much left.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.880]   There's not many companies left that are doing it.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.400]   It seems like that's the idea of buying our content.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.040]   Alacart seems to be slowly fading into the distance.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.720]   Well, I don't know the numbers.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:14.880]   Maybe Ryan does about, in terms of money though, are these subscription services really
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.880]   even a...
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.400]   Well, I don't know if they're making money, but there's not much left.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.840]   I mean, the thing is, is the reality is, I mean, you look at Netflix.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:26.640]   I mean, as soon as I had Netflix running on my Apple TV2, I accidentally got into the iTunes store.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.400]   And suddenly everything was like $4.99 a piece.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.880]   I was like, "What happened to Netflix?"
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.320]   And then I was like, "Oh, I'm in the wrong section."
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.160]   And I moved back into my happy space.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.960]   And the thing is once you're used to that, it just doesn't seem like you want to go back.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.600]   But you don't consume music in quite the same way.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.320]   I mean, it's not...
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.320]   I don't know.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.840]   It feels like you're going to read a magazine or you're going to read a book or you're going
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.040]   to watch a movie.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.680]   But music is this sort of ambient experience that...
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.920]   Well, I mean, for me, I guess, I know that...
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:01.280]   I mean, I have a Zoom that I actually listen to most of my music on.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.280]   A Zoom.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.280]   I have a Zoom.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.960]   I have a Zoom that I watch most of that.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.960]   That's probably where I listen to 80% of my music.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.880]   I'm going to tell you an outlier right now then.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.040]   Well, because it's just a good solid device that plays a subscription service.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.000]   So anything I'm interested in that I want to experiment with, I mean, I still think that
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.400]   a Zoom is a better music lovers device than the iPhone or the iPod because it's something
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.800]   that my brother tells me, "Oh, this is a really great album."
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.200]   And I just go up and check it out.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.440]   And I download the whole album and I listen to it and I don't have to commit to anything.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.720]   I don't have to do anything.
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.240]   I can just kind of move along.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.960]   And it seems like that is to me, and if I want one single song here and there, if I
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.240]   shizzam something and I want to, you know, I want that song, I'll download it on my iPhone.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.600]   But it's become more and more rare.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:57.080]   Well, and that's exactly why the music subscription service industry is so different from magazines
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.400]   and publishing.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:03.640]   When you subscribe to a magazine, you're subscribing to a single title that's going to come regularly.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.640]   And that's it.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.720]   It's not an all-you-can-eat model.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:12.400]   You don't subscribe to Conde Nast and get Conde Nast Traveler and Wired and all of the other
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.400]   publications.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.080]   You subscribe to one publication.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:19.600]   So if there was an equivalent, it would be like, "I'm subscribing to P&A.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.600]   Whatever.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.600]   Radiohead."
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.600]   Which I would, by the way, I would screw up.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.200]   Radiohead has to release an album every month, right?
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.480]   So it's very, very different.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.400]   It's not all you can eat.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.840]   And you know, they're similar almost only in name.
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:36.600]   I mean, it's almost not fair to say music subscriptions because I think the use of the
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.000]   word subscription, although to us, it makes sense.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   We're familiar with the concept, I think, for most mainstream consumers.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.280]   It could be a little bit confusing because you don't really subscribe to music.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.440]   I think people are used to getting it one album at a time.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.360]   And I think that the one place where I think subscription might not work as well is versus
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.640]   movies because a lot of movies I only watch once, right?
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.640]   You know, like, I don't, you know, with a subscription, I've got something recurring
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.640]   and everything else.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.320]   It works for me with Netflix.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.360]   I don't know if it works for the industry because with Netflix, it's this great open
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.360]   end.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.520]   You know, I can watch these movies and everything else, but I, you know, I tend to only watch
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.520]   them once.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.520]   It really is a continuum, though.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.840]   There's everything from that, "I want to see one thing once and I'm done with it," to,
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.960]   "I want a radio station," which is somebody else curating stuff and just serving up whichever
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.720]   songs they want to send to me.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.400]   And I think there's everything in between where, you know, you've got the, that the
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.640]   far end is the radio station, which is completely random based on somebody else's choices.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.040]   And then there's that intermediate online sort of thing you've got now with the, you
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.920]   can sort of choose a genre or a type of song and it serves up equivalent.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:43.360]   Now, do we think that there is going to be, as the iPad subscription service really takes
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.000]   off, do we think we're going to see, or obviously we're going to see a lot of these publishers
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.600]   moving there, but do you think we're going to see more things like the daily, Ryan, do
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.920]   you think we'll see more things like the daily where it's built for the iPad?
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.240]   It's not even built for print.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.800]   Like there's nothing there, they're just building into that subscription model.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.360]   Yeah, I mean, the daily wasn't, wasn't the only one.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:05.040]   Virgin or Richard Branson had his, I can't remember what it's called, project.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.760]   They don't have, I think, a revenue model just yet.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.600]   I think they're solely on advertising right now.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:16.680]   But yeah, I think, I think as the, you know, as tablets, as a product category, become much
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.880]   more prolific and it seems, you know, pretty well assured at this point that they will.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:30.560]   And as there becomes, you know, better subscription publishing frameworks on other platforms,
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:36.680]   like Android, we're going to see both, you know, traditional publishers moving over
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.960]   and pushing their businesses in that direction.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.680]   But I also think that we're going to see a lot of, you know, publishing start to happen
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.560]   native to the format, which is exactly what we saw happen with the web.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.560]   We saw a lot of old school publishers move on to the web very slowly, but then we saw
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:56.520]   a lot of new publishers taking advantage of the opportunity and doing things that were
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.600]   native to the format.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.040]   And I think that's actually where the real innovation happens.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.360]   What do you think changes when we move to native publications?
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:08.840]   Well, I mean, I think, you know, for start to start, and this is something I've obviously,
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:14.120]   I experienced back in the day with Engadget, which is, you know, we saw it as a publication
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.880]   that was native to the web and we didn't, we have to worry about any legacy stuff.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.600]   You know, it frees you to create something that isn't necessarily within the constraints
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.080]   of a traditional format.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:29.040]   And so I think the daily is actually doing that to a certain extent, even though I think
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:34.480]   that they are kind of using a lot of, you know, kind of old school tropes of, you know,
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.840]   news court publishing.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:42.160]   But, yeah, I mean, I think it's really not thinking about things in terms of I'm going
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.400]   to take this newspaper format and adapt it to an application and, you know, this kind
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.440]   of whole two-axis pivot thing that you're seeing a lot of these newspaper apps do.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.200]   It doesn't make, but go ahead.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.720]   Well, I was going to say and just, you know, treating it as something that is really native
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.280]   to the tablet as a form factor.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:07.680]   Does it make sense for a lot of these traditional companies to think about other like Murdoch
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:13.040]   has, think about creating a whole new thing that's not the New York Times or not the popular
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.840]   mechanics, possibly utilizing some of the resources there, but building something that
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:23.160]   looks completely different, you know, that utilizes their infrastructure, but not necessarily
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.760]   just republishing what they've already done and then protecting both those formats.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.000]   Ron, does that make sense to you?
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.120]   Yeah, I don't think we've seen it yet.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.560]   I don't think we've seen even the daily is still very, it feels very traditional.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.360]   I mean, I haven't spent a whole lot of time looking at it, but it feels like there's so
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.400]   much more you can do with integrated content and integrated video and all that kind of
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.400]   stuff.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.560]   I mean, I'm not even close to being there where you're giving me an experience.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.960]   I think there's a problem.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.360]   They're still trying to replicate a magazine.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.800]   Well, there's no publishing tool.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.040]   I mean, this is the thing that I think Apple is really missing the boat on right now is
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:00.600]   that there is no good way to publish for the iPad.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.840]   Yeah, and we've talked about this that, you know, we at some point doesn't seem like
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:09.560]   IDVD and Final Cut and all this sort of, they end up, they need to change, especially
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.800]   the IDVD to be something that is a content publishing tool, and you can totally see some
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.320]   nice graphics and something where it feels different than your average blog or even your
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.360]   average website sort of thing.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.640]   Someone asked me what my biggest request is for Final Cut Pro Studio.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.960]   You know, the new one that's supposed to be kick ass according to Steve Jobs is, was
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.160]   all I said is I just want to be able to publish to the iPad.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.520]   Like I just want all those tools to help me publish to an iPad.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.920]   And if that's all they did with the new version, I'd be happy.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.920]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.520]   So we'll, anyway, we'll see how that turns out.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.720]   We've got a new news, rumors about a four inch iPhone coming out.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.760]   But before we get to that, I just want to thank one of our sponsors.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.240]   This show, Mac Break is brought to you by Go To Meeting.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:59.400]   Now, Go To Meeting is of course the best way for you to, you know, be able to interact
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.880]   with people, whether you're selling something, whether you're teaching.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.320]   You know, this is something that, you know, we use a lot.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.760]   In the Pixel Core, we just had a big class that we did over the weekend.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.600]   And we have people from all over the world.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:17.280]   And there's only one way to get that all done is to use technologies like Go To Meeting.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:22.120]   And so, you know, the thing is, is instead of having to be able to, and trying to get
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.120]   everybody in the same room, which is almost impossible, we're global production, you
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.360]   know, we're global education, where, you know, all these things are something that
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.120]   happens all over the world.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.040]   So it's not, it's not even a matter of convenience.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.560]   It's just a matter of necessity.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.760]   And conference calls aren't enough.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.280]   I mean, that's the bottom line is, is the conference calls, you said they're going
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.360]   to be able to see the screen, you want to be able to present your, what you want to,
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.960]   what you want to show your clients or your students or your colleagues.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:50.080]   And Go To Meeting is just perfect for collaborative sessions, product reviews, sales presentations,
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.080]   training sessions.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.920]   Just about any kind of meeting that you want to have where you really need to go a little
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.400]   bit further than a conference call, you need to make it easy.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.960]   Now the great thing about this is no one has to use a conference call.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.800]   The voice, you have voice over IP.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.120]   You can answer people's questions.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.240]   You can open up the mic for them.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:08.160]   You can go back and forth and have complete control over that meeting.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.360]   And all that's included in a very low subscription price.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.640]   It's just a really, really great service.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:18.400]   And as I said, it's really easy for me to talk about this because the Pixel Core uses
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.400]   it.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.680]   I know Twit uses it a lot and the Pixel Core uses it every week multiple times.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.880]   And we run our business on it.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.400]   So it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just such a great product.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.560]   So you know, definitely check it out.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:35.040]   It's a one low flat rate.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.520]   It's a one low flat rate.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.520]   No flat rate.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.640]   It's going to handle your phone and voice over IP conferencing.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.080]   It's included for free.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.520]   Just visit gotomeeting.com/macbreak and sign up.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.080]   You can get 30 day free trial.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:54.160]   So you can just go up there, sign up, give it a shot, call some friends, call your colleagues,
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.160]   have a couple meetings.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:59.760]   I mean, it only took us about twice before we were like, okay, we're done.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.760]   And we, we, we, we subscribe and we keep on taking our service and ratcheting it up.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.200]   I don't know how much we're paying now.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.120]   We started with one low flat rate and then we, we need more people.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.120]   We need more people.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.120]   And so it's a really, really, really great.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:16.880]   So once again, go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.440]   Definitely sign up for 30 days and just give it a shot.
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:25.680]   So we've got, it is a, we've got the rumors coming out and the rumor mill has begun.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.320]   You know, new toys.
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.840]   It's, you know, it's, it's, it's the spring.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.040]   It's time to start thinking about these things.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.920]   So there's a pair of reports coming out and this is according to Apple Insider from the
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:40.120]   Far East saying that Apple is looking to have a next generation iPhone and have it down
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.760]   to four inches.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:48.880]   But, but also adding the, the possibly the A5 chip processor and it, it, it's, it's,
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.200]   you know, do we think this is going to happen?
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.200]   Run?
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.920]   It wouldn't surprise me.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.840]   You know, they've, they've sort of hit their market.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.800]   They've got an awesome product in that niche, but why not try to get something to the lower
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.840]   cost market and the cost of these phones, you know, so much of it is in that, in that
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.840]   screen and that display.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:12.880]   And I don't think the user experience would be terribly compromised by going to something
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.880]   smaller.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.200]   You know, it would be a little bit of, you think about it, a lot of the stuff you do.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.200]   You don't need it.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.240]   It wouldn't be as great a gaming platform, but for people that just want a low cost phone
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.600]   that still has connectivity and internet, you know, that sort of thing, I can totally
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.800]   see it happening and want, you know, why wouldn't they?
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.800]   Do something like that, as long as they don't sort of flood the market.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.160]   I mean, Apple's got room for growth and different, different, different sort of a different
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.160]   product line niches.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.280]   Well, I mean, this is, and this is not without precedent.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:44.760]   You know, Apple, Apple starts with, they come in high with a pretty complex product and
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.240]   then they, they take out a lot of the oxygen by releasing other products that are a lot
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.240]   less expensive.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.840]   Ryan, do you think that this is a viable rumor?
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.200]   Do you think that we're going to see a smaller iPhone?
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.040]   I think it depends on how you define smaller.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.440]   I think some of the stuff is maybe a little dubious.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:05.080]   I think the idea is of a phone that gets rid of the home button, a phone that has, you
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.920]   know, half the screen size.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.360]   I mean, I think that their aspects of this just really don't quite add up.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:16.920]   There are a lot of ways that Apple can create phones that, you know, reduce component cost
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.280]   and really get it down there.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.920]   And I think sooner or later they're going to have to.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.400]   I mean, there's just no question about the fact, even though they more or less completely
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:29.000]   own the high end phone market, they have to have something that will compete with those
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.360]   lower, increasingly lower end Android devices that are just so inexpensive and are actually
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.960]   pretty decent a lot of the time.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:42.240]   Now, do you think that this is going to be included also with Apple possibly allowing,
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.920]   you know, going out to more and more different providers?
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.560]   So right now we have an IT&T, of course, we're going to talk a little bit about Verizon.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.120]   It's now available on Verizon as of last week.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:58.320]   Do we think that you make a smaller phone and you make it available on Sprint, T-Mobile,
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:24:59.320]   all the other things?
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.320]   And worldwide.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:04.000]   Does that kind of start to, yeah, and worldwide, does that start to basically blunt some of
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   your competition?
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.920]   Yeah, you've got to do it.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:11.680]   I mean, if they want to expand worldwide, you know, in developing nations, there's, you
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.240]   know, not a whole lot of iPhone penetration yet.
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.360]   And they may actually have a chance to get into some of those things.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:20.280]   And you mean, Alex, you've been in these third world countries where everybody's still got
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.040]   a cell phone and everybody.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.800]   I mean, a lot of people don't have computers.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.800]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.280]   I mean, computers are really the high end thing that people have.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.720]   And usually they're PCs that have been, you know, put together with a variety of different
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.160]   parts and but everybody has a cell phone.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.800]   I had, you know, dinner with a friend last night who just got back from hiking up to
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.240]   Mount Everest Base Camp and he was talking about the porters and they're carrying these
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.400]   huge lows on their head.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.560]   They've also got a little mobile phone and there's cell phone coverage all the way up
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:47.200]   to Everest Base Camp now.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.200]   But those are not going to be iPhones yet.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.400]   You can't afford to do this thing.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.340]   So if Apple, I'm not saying Apple's going to go down to the route of the ultra cheap
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:57.760]   burner Nokia's that you can get for literally like $20 or so.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.560]   But if they can drop that price point down significantly, they can expand their market
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.560]   just instantly.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:08.160]   Ryan, do you think that this creates any kind of complexity when it comes to the formatting
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.240]   for app developers?
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.960]   So you've got, you know, now it would be yet another format that we have to start paying
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:13.960]   attention to.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.320]   You know, I don't think so.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.120]   But I think that kind of goes back to, you know, what do we mean by a smaller iPhone?
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:24.200]   I mean, I think it's possible to remove some components, to reduce the component size of
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.640]   a lot of what goes into an iPhone.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:30.280]   But I think generally, I mean, and this is just me, you know, estimating based on my
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.280]   experience.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.960]   I don't think that Apple is going to reduce the screen size significantly.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:38.360]   I think that that would actually really affect some of the basic usability principles of
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.560]   the iPhone.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.000]   You know, they've been actually very clear and very specific about how people need to
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:50.480]   build applications in terms of pixel ratio to the screen size that they've had for the
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.560]   last few years.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.840]   So if they do reduce it, I don't think it's going to be by much.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:27:02.600]   And I think it makes a lot of sense for them to, you know, continue using the 320 by 480
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.840]   pixel screen format from the old school iPhones.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.760]   And you can certainly get those for cheap.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.360]   Do you think that they maybe just increase once again, just increase the density of pixels
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.120]   and keep it the same resolution?
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.280]   That's what I would think is that it's getting cheap enough.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.280]   I don't think so.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:20.280]   I really don't because if you increase that density pixels and then you make the screen
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.920]   smaller, it makes it harder to use overall.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:27.120]   You have smaller targets on screen, which is why they kept the screen size the same
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.040]   when they increased the resolution on the iPhone 4.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.120]   So I mean, like I said, I think that maybe they'll reduce the screen size a little bit,
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.600]   but screen size is not the only component that they can save money on.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:42.080]   And that component, you know, that that size screen at 320 by 480, it just gets cheap
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.080]   every year.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:50.280]   And you look at how they, you know, they eventually brought the iPhone 3G and 3GS down to $99.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:54.480]   You know, I wouldn't be surprised if maybe, you know, one of their strategies is they
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:28:00.680]   bring, they keep the 3GS around after they introduce the iPhone 5 and make the 3GS, you
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.680]   know, the quote unquote free model, which is.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.400]   I'm happy that I'm surprised at how given how much these these phone manufacturers are
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:11.600]   making, I feel like I'm a little surprised that they're not making a just making the
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.600]   iPhone 4 free.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:17.120]   I mean, they're, you know, they're printing money with these from the subscription service.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.120]   They just seem like, you know, it seems like just giving people a little bit more, you
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.120]   know, a little more edge there to jump on.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.600]   It wouldn't be that big of a deal.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.040]   I could, part of it is probably just do they need to yet?
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.040]   Do they need to do it?
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.520]   Or are they just getting enough uptake?
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.720]   And I think once there are multiple carriers out there, then there's a little more reason
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:32.720]   to it.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.680]   And at some point, now with the Android being such pressure on them, I think they're going
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.640]   to have to adapt a little bit more.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:44.160]   So speaking of multiple outlets, Verizon, of course.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:49.120]   And now as of this week, starting on the 10th, they made it available to the, you know,
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.800]   to everyone, you can get your iPhone 4.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.800]   Not a lot of lines.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.440]   Didn't see a lot of, you know, eye lines outside of Apple.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:01.600]   Ryan, what do you think contributed to the lack of, you know, crazy excitement?
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.600]   I, you know, I don't know.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:09.760]   I'm a little puzzled, but at the same time, I'm also not that terribly surprised.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.000]   What they put out on pre-order online, though, sold out, right?
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.560]   I mean, you were able to get in a free lunch.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.560]   We don't know how much.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.360]   We don't know how many units that was.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.000]   Yeah, we don't, we don't know how many units that was, but, but, you know, it's entirely
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.400]   possible that all the people who really wanted to get it just bought it online thinking that
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.040]   they, you know, didn't want to have to wait all day in line.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:34.680]   And then, you know, what volume I think they expected to kind of get in store was really
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.080]   a lot of people kind of like myself, you know, I have it on AT&T.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.960]   I'm not ready to switch to Verizon, not, not because I don't like Verizon.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.120]   I, I would do it on a heartbeat.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.800]   I have terrible service on AT&T.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.960]   It's like everybody.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.120]   It's just that I'm not, you know, I, I got the iPhone 4 last summer and I'm under contract
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.600]   for a little while and I'm not ready for, for that ETF yet.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.320]   Why, well, you've got the Apple faithful, if you want to call them that, who, who have
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.680]   sort of already adopted it.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.840]   There's people like, like me and like you Ryan and I think, like everybody I know who
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.680]   would love to get out from underneath AT&T.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.360]   But there's a lot of uncertainty in the water right now.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.600]   There's a new model coming and the five will be out at some point here.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.600]   People are under contract.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:15.280]   So I'm not all surprised that they just, you can't get enough traction to get lines
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.000]   at the stores with that much uncertainty right now.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.960]   Oh, and I maybe, but, but weren't the lines that, that, that really happen every year,
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.240]   not just Apple fans?
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:27.160]   I mean, it's a lot, it's mainstream consumers who are interested in the iPhone and I think
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.080]   most mainstream consumers, you know, we not, we watch this stuff very closely.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:35.240]   We all know that there's a new iPhone every summer, but most mainstream consumers don't.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:39.400]   Most, you know, have no idea that, that there is a new iPhone that comes every June or July.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.880]   But isn't, isn't one of the things though, that's, that, that one, one of the insanity
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.720]   of it is that the people who are forming all those lines are oftentimes the same people
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.360]   that formed them last year.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:52.120]   You know, the thing is that what, you know, you know, it's not the issue is, is it's not
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.720]   newbies that are coming to get them.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:59.920]   It's like the, the, and I say this as someone who may or may not stand in those lines, you
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.840]   know, to get the, the iPhone that I can walk in later and just pick up.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.800]   But the, the thing is, is that we are the ones that are, you know, there's this faithful
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.800]   that is constantly coming in and buying those, those new ones.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.800]   And that's why you didn't get a line.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.800]   You may still get a lot of orders, but you're not going to get that big line because we
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.960]   have bar iPhones and, and I think, and we know that they're going to be coming out with
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.760]   something in the summer or we were fairly certain that they're going to come out with some,
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.640]   in the summer and it'll be really cool.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:30.080]   And how big of an issue is it to you guys for the fact that you can't surf the web while
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.360]   you're on a phone call?
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.360]   It's a big issue for me.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.200]   I use that all the time.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.120]   And usually what I'm doing is I'm, it's Google Maps.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.000]   That's exactly what I was thinking as I was driving up to Petaluma, which for people who
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.760]   don't know is a little ways away out of San Francisco.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.840]   And I'm trying to figure out Matt and I'm looking at the map and it was very convenient.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.000]   And then thinking, boy, if I couldn't do this because I was on a phone call at the same
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.560]   time, that would, that would be a big inconvenience.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:56.440]   My, my, my wife though is a perfect example of someone who, who is going to get the Verizon,
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.760]   her, her subscriptions up.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.360]   We've talked about it before.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.760]   And she does, you know, she finally bought, bought an app for her iPhone.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.760]   I'm so proud of her.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.760]   She bought Yelp.
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.200]   She was like, that's the only one she's ever gotten.
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.440]   No Yelp is the only one that the only apps she's ever put on her iPhone, other than the
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.880]   ones that come with it is, and she loves her iPhone, but the only one that she's ever
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.880]   put on is Yelp.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.360]   And that was because she went to the Yelp website and she, and it said, you know, there's
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.280]   an iPhone app for there's an app for this, you know, and then she installed it.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.280]   She goes, this is great.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.840]   It's an application on your iPhone.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.600]   I was like, yes, honey, it's an application for your iPhone.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.680]   So, so anyway, we'll, we'll see how this goes.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:32.360]   Now, one of the things that it looks like people started tearing down, I fixed it, tore
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:38.960]   down the iPhone and it looks like the Qualcomm, the infamous Qualcomm chip is actually embedded
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.480]   into the, into this Verizon phone.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.440]   Ryan, why do you think that Apple didn't activate it completely?
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:50.520]   Well, I, I, to clarify what you're saying for people who might not know 100%, you know,
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:51.520]   how this stuff works.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:56.440]   So there's, there's a basically a world, a quote unquote, world phone or dual mode chip
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.400]   in the Verizon iPhone that would allow it to operate on CDMA, which is Verizon's network
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:06.120]   standard or, you know, GSM, HSPA, which is AT&T in most of the world.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:10.520]   The reason why it wasn't activated, the reason why they just have it operating on CDMA, I
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.080]   don't think is, is anything to do with the components themselves.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:18.280]   If, if you were to just, you know, ask me to come up with a reason, I would say with 95%
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.760]   certainty, it's antenna design.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:26.240]   Dual mode devices, devices that can operate on CDMA and GSM based networks are incredibly
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.080]   difficult to build and the antenna design required to do that in addition to the other
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:34.880]   antennas, like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and supposedly the next version is going to have NFC and
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:40.160]   it's, it's just really, really not easy to do that.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:46.000]   And the frequencies that CDMA operates on are different and the way that CDMA operates
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.520]   is completely different from GSM.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.520]   Do we think that we're going to see that activated?
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.240]   It looks like they, they, they went ahead and engineered it into the phone so that now
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.880]   you have it built into the phone, you only have to redesign, you know, certain pieces.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.200]   Ron, do you think that they're going to, we're going to see this in the next iPhone?
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.520]   Well, first thing I thought of when I saw that was not related to the next iPhone,
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:07.520]   but to that typical model that Apple does offering last year's model as the lower cost
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.880]   alternative and so I was thinking, you know, they went ahead and did the effort, the engineering
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:16.120]   effort to make the iPhone 4, this new Verizon version with the World Band stuff so that
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.680]   eventually that can continue to be their lower cost option when the, when the 5 comes out.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:23.360]   So it wouldn't surprise me if they, they didn't sort of plan all that out to have this be
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.040]   kind of their lower cost entry.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.840]   So it'll be, you know, I, I, I just feel like you know, Apple has to get back to a single
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.840]   phone.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.600]   I mean, the thing is, is that you can't keep on making different phones for everybody.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.560]   So I think that, you know, figuring out, I, I don't, I don't know about that.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:39.520]   I think that they, I think that they can in, in, in certain, in a certain way.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:42.280]   So let's forget the rest of the phone.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.160]   Let's say, you know, moving forward, they kind of unified the internals of the device,
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:50.600]   you know, the screen, the memory, the, the main board, the battery, stuff like that.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.400]   They can, they can kind of unify the internals around a chipset that will handle both GSM
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:35:01.560]   and CDMA and then tune the antennas for each device for, for the appropriate network.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:05.000]   So the inside of the device doesn't really change.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.920]   And that makes manufacturing the devices.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.040]   I mean, you know, it basically is one device on the inside.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:14.720]   The only thing that really changes the antennas because antenna design is so completely non-trivial
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.800]   and I really can't stress that enough.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.120]   I think people really take for granted how difficult antenna design is.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.000]   Uh, do you, if, if, go ahead.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Sorry.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   No, go ahead.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.960]   Well, I was just going to say if, if they have, you know, if the, if the real difference
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:34.240]   is moving forward between the Verizon, uh, iPhone and, you know, the GSM iPhone is just
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.800]   the way that they build the antenna.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:40.960]   And then eventually we will unify again in the future around LTE, but that's still, I
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.200]   think a couple of years out.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.760]   Uh, then in the meantime, they can basically keep the internals the same.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.280]   So you don't think we're going to see LTE this summer?
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.680]   Uh, I really don't think Apple's going to adopt it this summer.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.840]   No, I, I think it's still way too early.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:58.080]   Apple, Apple in, you know, in my opinion is not going to be a very, very early on the
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.080]   bandwagon.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:03.080]   They, they're going to wait for a rollout that is relatively complete in the US before
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.080]   they go there.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:08.120]   Um, uh, Ron, do you think that you will see LTE?
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.120]   No, I kind of, I agree with Ryan.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.480]   It's just Apple's conservative that way.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.240]   You know, and, you know, you know, how hammered do they get when they have issues like the
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.240]   Intenigate issue?
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:21.120]   Uh, they've got to make sure that it's bulletproof and the network is strong and everything.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.120]   So I don't think so.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:26.240]   I mean, I am curious what is the, the big thing that'll be with the iPhone five.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:30.120]   I think it's probably some kind of near field communication chip or something that gives
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.120]   you that.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.280]   I think that's a whole new world that Apple can open up.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:40.280]   Yeah, I think, I think opening up to, I think that being able to use it on, you know, sprinting
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:45.640]   T-Mobile, uh, I have to say I, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say this, but it's their
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.520]   own, it's their own fault of the, they showed it to me, but somebody, somebody may or may
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:54.320]   not have shown me an LTE, uh, enabled Android phone and, um, it was the, uh, most impressive
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.160]   phone I've ever seen in my entire, the most impressive stream I've ever seen in my entire
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.160]   life.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.160]   It was as if it was playing off the hard drive.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:02.480]   I mean, it is as clear as a, as a bell and it was streaming.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:06.880]   You know, and it was just, uh, oh boy.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:11.760]   I was like, I was like, I felt like I was looking, I was looking at a window into a new
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.760]   world.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.800]   You know, you know, it was just, it's, and I feel like Apple needs to be able to, you
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:21.440]   know, they do, but it's not their way.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.440]   It's not the app.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.440]   They don't need to is the problem.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:28.200]   They, they, somebody else will do it first and they'll be pressure, but they can sit back
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.600]   and wait and get it right.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.480]   That's what they do.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:36.360]   Now, AT&T is, has been, uh, starting to, uh, you know, do what they can to hang on to people
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.360]   there.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.360]   We're having reports.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.160]   I don't know if you guys have gotten any of these reports of people getting, uh, more
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.480]   minutes, getting larger, uh, data plans for free.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.000]   It's being kind of, uh, offered to them.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Ryan, have you gotten any extra data?
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.160]   Well, you know, I, I still have the old school, uh, iPhone data plan that's unlimited.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.840]   Uh, I, I've managed not to give that up.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.440]   Uh, and I'm going to, I'm going to hang on to it as long as I can until I, especially
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:05.880]   the first time, I'm going to be a little bit more interested in the future.
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.880]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in the future.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.360]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in the future.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.360]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in the future.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.800]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in the future.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.800]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in the future.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.800]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in the future.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.800]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in the future.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.800]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in the future.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in the future.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in the future.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.800]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in the future.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.940]   to 18t subscribers.
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.020]   But I never got the message.
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:34.940]   I didn't think-
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:35.780]   - I think it's a message either.
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:36.580]   Someone left me out of that memo.
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.740]   - Well, you can still reply to the,
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:42.180]   like if you know the code, and you type in yes,
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.700]   and you reply to the code, I don't remember
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.720]   what it is on top of it but they'll still give you
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.740]   the minutes but you just have to know it right?
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:50.740]   - What is it?
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:51.580]   - I said well-
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:52.740]   - Here we go, here we go.
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.340]   - I did it this morning as I was reading the article.
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:59.120]   - Yeah you just sent a text to 1111-3020.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:03.040]   And the body of the text is just yes.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.720]   That's all you have to do and immediately,
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.260]   I got back a little message from AT&T.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.100]   So thank you.
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:07.920]   - So thank you.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.320]   - Roll over minutes will be added to your account
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.920]   within four weeks, subject to verifying
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.880]   your account eligibility, limit one credit per account.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.680]   So, you know, extra minutes.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.520]   - So this is the bonus from my great wisdom.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.560]   - I'm pretty sure there's some asterisk in there though,
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.000]   that if you look up the asterisk online,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.800]   it says that we've just extended your service plan
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.720]   by three years.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.960]   - Yeah, that's, maybe I shouldn't have been so quick
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.800]   to do this, you're saying?
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.880]   - Right.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.920]   - I did it for the audience.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.640]   And the audience owes me if I signed up for another--
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.800]   - Or they, or they, yeah, you might be in trouble.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.040]   So, you know, but we'll tell you the code is once again,
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.440]   1111-3020.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.280]   And you say yes.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.200]   - That's the number you text to.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.320]   And then you just, the body of the message is just yes.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.960]   And then immediately came back and said you got minutes.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:49.880]   Now I personally tend not to overflow my rollover minutes
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.640]   anyway, so it doesn't really matter to me,
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.960]   but I was curious.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.120]   - I have a hard time using any minutes on this network.
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:57.040]   - That's true.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:57.880]   (laughing)
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.640]   - You know, I was trying really hard this morning.
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.640]   I was on a couple phone calls and it was,
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.520]   oh, right, I was hanging on to it the wrong way.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.000]   Oh, right, I was in the wrong room.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.680]   You know, and now it's like in my house,
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.040]   now that I got my, I kind of rebuilt my wifi connection
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:11.880]   and everything.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:15.000]   And my house now I have this great, you know, Skype coverage.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:15.840]   That's what I call it now.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.200]   It's not AT&T coverage, it's Skype coverage.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.640]   And my Skype coverage is excellent.
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.040]   - I dropped a call driving over the Golden Gate Bridge
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.120]   and I'm like, you would think it's fairly open.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.520]   There's a lot of people that use it, but--
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.840]   - Went in, went in doubt.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:30.520]   I have to admit I'm now gonna have it
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:34.080]   of using Skype over my, my wifi,
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.640]   which is something very wrong about that.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.280]   But so anyway, but it works great,
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.360]   just in case you're wondering.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.840]   So we've got rumors, of course, of the iPad 2
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.440]   and possibly 3 coming out, but before that,
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.040]   let's jump to thank one of our sponsors here.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:55.160]   We wanna thank Squarespace and of course,
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.440]   I was really happy this week 'cause I'm sitting in
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:03.080]   and I wanted to make sure that, you know,
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.160]   that we have advertisers that we actually use
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.680]   in Squarespace, of course, is another one.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.360]   dvgarage.com on Squarespace,
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.960]   pixacore.com on Squarespace,
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:16.960]   bordersac.com, which is my blog is on Squarespace.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.160]   So this is something that, you know,
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.320]   we build a lot of stuff on it.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.320]   Some of them are more complex than others.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.160]   You know, some of them, the bordersac uses
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.080]   absolutely no extra code.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.040]   It's just me fiddling around.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.960]   In fact, it was me fiddling around for about four or five hours
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.600]   and that was it.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.760]   dvgarage has got e-commerce built in,
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.720]   pixacore has got a lot of special stuff built into it.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.800]   So the key here with Squarespace
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.080]   is that it's just a really easy to use UI.
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.080]   It's Wizziwig.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.240]   You just kind of go, okay, I wanna drag stuff over.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.160]   I wanna make this stuff work and it's not something
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.080]   you have to kind of, you know,
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.480]   you don't have to know any coding,
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.280]   you don't have to know any of that stuff.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.840]   You just gotta know what you want.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:55.800]   There are literally thousands of templates
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:56.600]   for you to choose from.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.440]   So you can go up there.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.400]   You don't have to build anything from scratch.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.160]   You can start with something that,
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.760]   I'm sorry, hundreds of design templates,
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:03.880]   not thousands of design templates,
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:04.760]   but more than you need.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.600]   You need one.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.080]   And you can then take them and customize them.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.480]   And, you know, it's all inclusive.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.560]   You have a blog module.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.640]   You have forums, form builders,
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.400]   Flickr photo displays, Twitter widgets, Google Maps.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.200]   And you'll see a lot of those widgets, again,
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.160]   on my site, I started just adding widgets.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.640]   I was like, oh, I want an Amazon widget.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.920]   And I wanna, you know, I have recommendations.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:26.760]   I have all that other stuff.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.600]   And I just kind of threw it in.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.800]   It's just a drag and drop.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.680]   Put it where you want it.
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.000]   Boom, it's done.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.480]   And it's just really, really easy.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.080]   Of course, you can have permission access.
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.120]   You have cloud, you know,
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.960]   one of the big things is I don't worry about
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.560]   whether I'm slamming, you know,
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.920]   right now there's a bunch of people watching Macbreak
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.760]   that are probably going to some of these sites
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.800]   that I just mentioned.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.640]   And, you know, I'm not worried about getting slammed
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.560]   because it's on the cloud.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.960]   It's not, it's not one server.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.760]   It's not something that I'm coloing.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:54.160]   You know, it is something that is going to be able to handle
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.880]   whatever kind of pressure you get put on.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:00.440]   And I've put four gig files on my, on my squares.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.360]   I emailed him, I said,
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.200]   so I'm gonna put some big asking ninja files
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.080]   on one of our, on our Pixel course site.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:05.920]   Is that okay?
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.760]   They're like, how big is it?
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:07.600]   And I was like, four gig,
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.440]   I don't worry more.
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.360]   They would like add, I don't even worry about it.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.920]   So, you know, they can handle the flow.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.040]   And that's something that's really important
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.080]   if you start to break out.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.640]   But this is anybody who asks me,
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.480]   how do I get started?
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.480]   I just wanna put up a webpage.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.520]   I just wanted to work.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.080]   You know, the idea of, you know,
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.680]   if you're getting started with your company,
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:26.960]   with your services, with your, just your blog,
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.880]   to me, this is just really the easiest way to do it.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.440]   You don't have to worry about how to install it
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.440]   onto a server or how to do any HTML coding.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.320]   If you know HTML or CSS, you can do all of that.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.560]   You can add all of those things that you want to.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.800]   But especially even when we're developing sites
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.360]   for other people, a lot of times we've been using
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.400]   Squarespace because I don't wanna have to manage it later.
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.200]   I just wanna help, you know, do it.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.240]   And then let them run it from there.
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.440]   So definitely check it out.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:53.320]   You can get a 14-day free trial.
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.160]   If you go to squarespace.com/macbreak
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.360]   and it's, you can sign up and get a free account.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.600]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:00.720]   You can just try to build it.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:02.320]   So you don't have to believe me.
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:06.080]   Just go up there, go up to squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.240]   Check it out.
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.920]   You know, sign up, put your little information in
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.800]   and then try to build your own website.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.440]   And I think you're gonna find it's the easiest way
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.920]   to build your own website quickly and easily.
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:16.960]   And it looks great.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:21.240]   So check it out squarespace.com/macbreak.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:26.240]   Okay, now we have the iPad 2 is theoretically in production.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:30.480]   Ron, what do you think?
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.480]   - I have heard similar rumors.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.800]   I think it's getting close.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.160]   I definitely wouldn't buy an existing generation iPad right now
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:41.040]   if you're able to wait just a little bit longer.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:41.880]   It only makes sense.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:42.880]   I mean, we're not surprised about it.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.760]   I think the interesting thing about this rumor
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.360]   was not so much that there's the iPad 2 imminent
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.560]   but that there's already talk about the iPad 3
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:51.960]   and not a year away.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.480]   - Ryan, do you think that we have both an iPad 2
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.040]   and an iPad 3 coming out this year?
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.640]   - Well, iPad 2 seems like a slam dunk
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.640]   and that it would be in production right now.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.280]   The timing on that makes a lot of sense
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.520]   in terms of the lead time that you need to produce devices
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:10.520]   like this, especially in large quantities.
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.960]   Definitely larger quantities than we're initially expected
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.160]   this time of last year.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:20.400]   The third iPad, I'm not 100% on what that really means.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.480]   I mean, is that Apple kind of going into even the higher end
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:28.640]   of the tablet space and pushing the hardware
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:32.720]   to create some stuff on there like a retina display.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:35.920]   And I mean, the technical requirements,
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.200]   I think the big thing that people are talking about
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:42.320]   with a next generation iPad is a retina display.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:44.640]   And I think the hardware requirements on that
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.360]   are gonna be pretty significant.
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.400]   So if that's--
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.680]   - We're not gonna get a true retina display.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:54.360]   I mean, that would be like taking a 30 inch display.
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:58.560]   - Yeah, I actually, I wrote about this a while before
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:00.880]   other people started writing about what a retina display
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:01.800]   on the iPad would mean.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.040]   And I think that they would probably do the same thing
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.360]   that they did on the iPhone,
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.640]   which is to double the resolution in each direction.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.400]   So essentially quadrupling the resolution.
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:15.400]   And yeah, that would basically create a 10 inch wide display
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.720]   or a 10 inch diagonal display that has the resolution
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.080]   of a 20 to 24 inch monitor.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:24.080]   I mean, it's not talking about things that are non-trivial.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.440]   That is a non-trivial task.
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.840]   So I mean, I don't know.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:30.080]   I'm maybe a little bit skeptical that it's gonna be this year.
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:33.240]   But if I guess if they were gonna do a higher end iPad 3
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.320]   then that might be where they take it.
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:38.840]   - But the rumors that I've seen at least is that
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:41.640]   the reasoning behind it is sort of listed as they want
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:45.000]   to have something that switches the product cycle around.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.240]   So it's closer to Christmas so that there's an excitement
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:51.360]   building up closer to the holidays kind of thing.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.480]   And the rumors I've seen have discussed potentially
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.680]   it's more like an iPad 2.5.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.200]   So something to differentiate it and have a new model
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.320]   that's toward the end of the year.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.120]   And then they could have their nice release schedule
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.200]   it's a little bit spread out.
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.320]   So you have, you know, the phone is announced early
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.200]   in the year and the iPad comes later in the year.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:13.000]   And I could see that but I don't see a completely new
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.400]   equivalent iPad that comes out and replaces the one
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.160]   that's gonna come out in the next couple months.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:19.800]   That just doesn't make sense to me.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.640]   - What do we think is?
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.000]   - Yeah, I mean, go ahead, go ahead.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   - Well, as I said, I thought the iPad, you know,
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.400]   quote unquote two, the one that was supposed to be coming out
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.560]   in the next couple of months is really kind of
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.560]   kind of be the 1.5.
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:34.480]   So it seems like we're kind of, I don't know.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.320]   I think we might be missing a beat here
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:39.400]   and we're not gonna know until Apple introduces it.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.280]   But I think what we're kind of been expecting
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.600]   in the next iteration of the iPad is, you know,
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.200]   more memory, faster processor,
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.040]   maybe a little bit thinner and lighter,
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:50.320]   but not a, you know, revolutionary new design for it.
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.680]   - Probably cameras.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:52.520]   - Yeah.
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.360]   - We would assume that.
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:55.280]   - Yeah, well, yeah, I think cameras are kind of so much
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.120]   of a given, I don't even think to mention them.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.200]   - Right.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.040]   (laughing)
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.600]   - Yeah, 128 gig storage.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.760]   - Yeah.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.600]   - I don't know, I don't know about that.
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.320]   - Yeah, I think the storage costs on that are still really,
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:07.600]   really expensive.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.840]   I mean, they haven't done 128 gig on the iPod touch.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:12.880]   - Do we think we'll see a smaller one?
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.960]   - That's my question.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.720]   I mean, that's the real question to me is,
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.360]   do they go smaller and spy, you know, these days,
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.960]   Steve tends to deny things and then they show up.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.480]   So in spite of the fact that he said nobody wants
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:27.160]   a smaller form factor for a tablet,
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.280]   you really got to wonder if that's almost a signal saying
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.200]   that they're thinking about doing a smaller form factor
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.000]   for a tablet.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.040]   I think it'd be usable and I think it'd be usable.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.960]   I think it could see a smaller one.
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.600]   - So we'll see how that turns out.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.960]   Now also in the news, Sony is, they're frustrated.
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.840]   - Or Sony.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.840]   - I'm forced Sony, I mean, they're trying so hard.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.560]   But they're a little frustrated here.
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.160]   They're setting up their own,
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.080]   this is according to Apple Insider.
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:54.560]   Of course, they're building up their own services.
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.800]   And, but one of the things that they are, you know,
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.960]   starting to, this is according to,
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:03.160]   I think I believe it's Michael Efron, is that right?
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:06.560]   From Sony, he said, you know, publishers are being held
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.760]   ransom by Apple.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.600]   They're looking for other delivery systems.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.680]   And we are waiting to see what happens
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.360]   in the next three to five years.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.240]   Is there anything to find out there, Ryan,
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.320]   in the next three to five years for Sony?
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.480]   (laughing)
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.800]   - I don't know, I thought this whole quote was a little dubious.
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.720]   I mean, I'm not a hundred percent sure
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:27.720]   of what Sony's entertainment structure is in Australia.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:30.720]   And I guess, you know, oh, she has not really coming
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:31.880]   from the mothership is what you're saying.
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:33.200]   So we don't really know what it is.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.560]   - It's coming from the chief executive,
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:36.800]   Sony Computer Entertainment,
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.720]   which you can replace the word
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.840]   Sony Computer Entertainment PlayStation.
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:44.160]   That's what PlayStation is, Sony Computer Entertainment.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.760]   So I don't really know how much weight
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:49.760]   the PlayStation group has with the music group.
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.840]   And I think it also, it's kind of, you know,
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:53.240]   it's maybe a little bit sour grapes.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.080]   I mean, and-
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:54.920]   - Well, they're personally over the whole,
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.200]   the whole e-reader thing, right?
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.440]   So they, you know, Sony, you know, doesn't want to give Apple
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.440]   30% for the e-reader.
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:02.920]   And they're upset that they didn't get their app, you know,
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:03.760]   inserted.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.880]   - It's just, I find it really amusing because it's like,
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.760]   okay, well, yes, in some alternate reality
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.080]   where we're incredibly successful in the music business
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.200]   by selling it on our own,
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.680]   which we've tried two to three times in the past,
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.600]   each time failing miserably,
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.000]   if we could somehow make it work,
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.560]   then yes, we won't need to go with iTunes.
[00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:22.800]   Well, of course, but that's not the reality.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:26.240]   The reality is Sony's tried this and failed numerous times.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.480]   And, you know, this is the way it is.
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.760]   Now Apple sells all the music.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:31.760]   - Right.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.040]   Ron, do you think there's any, any-
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:36.240]   - I think the real issue here, the real question is,
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:40.080]   is anybody at some point going to be able to challenge
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.720]   iTunes, the actual app that runs on the,
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:45.160]   on the phones and on the computers and stuff?
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.800]   - Is the app really the secret to the sauce?
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.320]   Is that the secret sauce?
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.520]   - You know, will Apple allow something like that
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.160]   to show up on an iPhone?
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:54.280]   I think that's really, as much as they do these things
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:57.240]   that sort of make them look open and allow people to sell
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:00.640]   in app, sell out of app as long as they sell in app.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.680]   The bottom line is they still have that lockdown control
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:08.040]   over the music player itself on the handsets.
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.600]   And that's really the thing that you gotta wonder,
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.000]   you know, is somebody gonna say,
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.480]   we need to make a competitor to that.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.880]   And it can't, but it can't be a Sony.
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:16.240]   It can't be somebody that owns the content as well,
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.400]   'cause I don't think people will trust it.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.920]   It's almost gotta be an Amazon or something,
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.360]   but they certainly haven't had much luck doing it
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:24.560]   with their MP3 store.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.760]   You know, they really have to live in Apple's world.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.520]   - Well, and here's the question I have.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:33.520]   The, is the real power in the fact that,
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.320]   and this is a question for you, Ryan,
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:40.240]   is it really a function of the fact that the iTunes
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:44.040]   and the app store are very well produced,
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:47.600]   internet enabled applications that are not on the web?
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:51.440]   And that do you think a web app or a web service
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:55.960]   can compete with a completely embedded internet enabled
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:59.280]   application that's really designed for exactly what it does?
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.040]   - Well, it's really interesting to say that,
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:03.480]   'cause I was actually gonna say almost the exact same thing.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.160]   I mean, I think that's kind of what we're already seeing
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.000]   right now.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.040]   I mean, where there is innovation in the music space,
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:11.000]   and this goes right back to what we started, you know,
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.160]   we started talking about earlier on in the program,
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.040]   where there is innovation in music space right now,
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:19.600]   it's not coming from, you know, by an album of MP3s.
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:22.320]   It's coming from streaming services,
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:23.880]   things like RDO and Spotify.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.880]   And those are in the app store,
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:29.360]   and you can sync music through Rhapsody and RDO.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:33.400]   And I don't remember if Spotify has an iPhone app
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:36.600]   because they're up right now, so it's a little tricky.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:37.920]   But there are these services where, you know,
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:39.880]   you can stream and you can sync
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:41.240]   and you pay the subscription,
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:44.400]   and it's a very viable alternative to iTunes,
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.520]   and it's on the iPhone now, and anyone can go use it.
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.600]   I think the question is,
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.440]   does anyone really care at this point?
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.680]   I mean, is music the kind of thing
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.960]   that people really are going to be paying for in the future?
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:58.600]   I think most people probably don't wanna pay for music.
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.920]   - Well, one of the things that I think is interesting,
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:01.760]   and we've talked about this on some of the other shows,
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.480]   this week of media and so on and so forth,
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:06.120]   is the fact that part of the problem
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.560]   I think the industry really gets into is this whole process
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:11.240]   of when we have all this content available to us,
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:14.120]   we don't press that much as much for the new stuff.
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:15.640]   Because, you know, we have, you know,
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.840]   we have open access to Netflix, we have open access to,
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.520]   you know, we have our entire library,
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:22.640]   you know, collection that's with us all the time,
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.920]   and, you know, I find that I'm not looking for new stuff
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.720]   as often because I have, you know,
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.520]   I have something to listen to
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.680]   and something new to listen to out of the thousands of songs.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.160]   - No, I don't know if I agree.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:35.800]   I think that there is probably true for some people,
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:39.120]   but I think there's a lot of people that just want,
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:39.960]   you know, for them.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:40.800]   - The next big thing.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.600]   - Yeah, well, it's just, they want something new.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.000]   They don't wanna listen to, they have their old favorites,
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.520]   but really having the latest, you know,
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:48.720]   hot song and having access to it.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.720]   It's a constant thing.
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:51.720]   I mean, they just want the latest and the newest,
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:54.440]   and maybe that is an argument for a subscription model
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.360]   having some real traction there,
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:58.040]   is if it's something that is just
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:00.280]   get the latest top 10 songs or something
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.120]   that you're hearing on the radio or something.
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.680]   - Now, speaking of subscription,
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:06.560]   Apple, there's a rumor floating around,
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:07.720]   'cause according to CNET,
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:10.440]   is Apple is thinking,
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:11.920]   there's a rumor that Apple's thinking about
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.360]   making mobile me free digital shelves
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:17.320]   where you can store electronic books, songs and movies.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:19.960]   Ryan, does this dog hunt?
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.520]   - Absolutely, I think they gotta do it sooner or later.
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:25.840]   I mean, all of these services already exist on the web,
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:27.840]   have for years, they're all free.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.600]   I think the fact that Apple tried to charge for them
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.880]   was almost suicide for the products.
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:35.240]   They gotta do it.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:36.600]   And the sooner they do it, the better.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:40.320]   And I think the better a job they do on the web
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:41.720]   and with cloud services,
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:42.920]   the better they're gonna do ultimately,
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.920]   because, you know, the attitude that these devices
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:49.920]   are not deeply integrated with all manner of cloud services.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.480]   Just does not fly anymore.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:52.320]   We gotta get there.
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:53.360]   - Yeah, there's this hole in between,
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.120]   I know with like, I work as a good example of,
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:57.480]   you know, apps that I use very, very heavily.
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:00.000]   I mean, not numbers and keynote and pages.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.240]   And my one frustration though is that
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:05.280]   when we have this crazy interaction where,
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:09.200]   when we want to develop an app, develop a document,
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:10.760]   it all goes up to Google.
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.120]   And so on Google Docs, we build it all out.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.360]   And then when we get to a certain point
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.720]   where it's almost done, it gets exported to pages
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:19.160]   and then I clean it up and make it actually look nice.
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:21.000]   You know, you know, it's like, you know,
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.240]   'cause I'm not, we don't do any formatting in Google
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:25.960]   because Google Docs is horrible for that.
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:29.280]   So, and then in the same way, you know, like Excel sheets,
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.840]   you know, Google building,
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.320]   building spreadsheets in Google Docs
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.400]   is insanely frustrating,
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.960]   where you go into numbers and you build the whole thing
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:40.080]   and then we export it out as an XLS,
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:43.160]   then we bring it into, then we email it to my Gmail account
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:45.120]   and then it goes into Google and then people update it there.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.640]   You know, it seems like Apple just needs to fix this whole
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:50.640]   backend so that we can use the apps that we wanna use
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.920]   but have them integrated in the cloud.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.720]   But is that gonna open up, here's a question for you Ron,
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.680]   is that gonna open up a can of worms for Apple as far as,
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:58.120]   there's good reasons why it's difficult on the web.
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.560]   - No, I don't think it opens up a can of worms.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:03.560]   Mobile and B has been an embarrassment for Apple
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:04.480]   really since the beginning.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:05.960]   It was an embarrassment when I worked there
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.080]   and I was in many meetings trying to talk about
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:08.920]   what it could change into,
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.280]   but there was never really any clear vision
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.360]   for what it was supposed to be.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:15.280]   And that's what it's supposed to be designed by,
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:16.360]   is but how it's supposed to work.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:20.080]   Every time I've dealt with it still is somewhat unreliable.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:23.120]   So I think if you look at things like Dropbox
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.720]   and how seamless they are,
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:27.360]   that's what mobile mean needs to turn into.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.080]   And I do think making it free is part of it.
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.680]   And then it opens up all the stuff you're talking about
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:33.440]   with sharing of documents, but it also opens up,
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.400]   putting your own music in the cloud and things like that,
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:37.240]   which is part of what some of the rumors we're hearing too,
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:40.240]   is this idea that maybe you'll be able to put all of your music
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.000]   online somewhere and have access to that.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.840]   And again, that's the sort of continuum of owning
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:47.200]   versus renting versus subscriptions.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:49.240]   And then there's also just put everything up on the cloud
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:51.040]   and have it accessible.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:51.880]   - Ryan?
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:57.400]   - Yeah, I think Ron pretty much said everything
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.240]   that needs to be said about it.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.640]   And I mean, I think overall,
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:04.520]   besides the fact that mobile means that problems
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:09.120]   and besides the fact that we know where this stuff needs to go,
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:12.120]   I think the real troubling thing is just that Apple
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:16.160]   is not really been successful in the long term
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:17.920]   on the internet and on the web.
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.320]   I mean, they've had some successes,
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:24.320]   but they are a company that excels at platforms
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.160]   and they're a company that excels at hardware.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:29.000]   And the web and the internet has kind of eluded them.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.840]   So they really need to figure this thing out.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.280]   If you look at Google, they're the other way.
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:37.960]   They're a company that understands the web better
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:39.320]   than anybody.
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:41.360]   They've been able to leverage that fact
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:43.720]   and kind of bring that into the platform side.
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:47.400]   But, you know, Android is not at the level of iOS
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:48.880]   and it's still catching up.
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:51.520]   - Well, they don't understand user interface.
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:52.440]   I mean, that's the problem with Google
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:54.560]   is they understand the whole,
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:55.960]   they don't understand the process of the web.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.840]   They just don't understand how people
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:58:00.320]   wanna actually interact with the medium, right?
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:01.160]   - Well, yes and no.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.840]   I mean, I think that they understand user interface
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:03.680]   in some ways better.
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.600]   I mean, look at the paradigm change
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.560]   that they incited with Gmail.
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:11.200]   Gmail taught people a completely different way
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.800]   to interact with email,
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.120]   both in terms of user interface
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:16.360]   and in terms of, you know, kind of how casual it is
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:19.240]   to just use email almost as like I am.
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:22.400]   So, you know, they get some of this stuff.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:25.160]   I wouldn't give them such a hard time on the UI stuff.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:26.840]   I mean, they're not at the level of Apple,
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:28.880]   but their medium is also different.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.080]   You know, they're a web-centric company.
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:32.880]   So anyway, I guess, you know,
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.400]   to bring it back to what Apple's doing.
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:35.240]   I think that they just,
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:37.240]   they really need to figure out their internet strategy
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.160]   because that's a place that they have to do really well at.
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:42.960]   And they just have not done as well as they could.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:43.960]   - Very good, very good.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:47.640]   Now we have a pics coming up here in just a second.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.400]   So get that ready, but before that,
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:53.920]   we want to, of course, thank audible.com, our sponsor.
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:58.080]   So audible.com, of course, is the best way to read a book
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:59.120]   as far as I'm concerned.
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:03.680]   You know, you have, you know, basically audible has 75,
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:05.920]   over 75,000 titles, downloadable,
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:09.120]   all types of information, literature,
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:12.080]   fiction, nonfiction, periodicals.
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:13.480]   You know, it is, you know,
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:15.360]   if anything you want to listen to,
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:16.440]   you're going to find some stuff there.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:21.080]   And I'm totally addicted until I have to say.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:24.040]   - Audible.com, you can go to audible.com/macbreak
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:25.160]   if you want to get a free book today.
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:27.880]   So if you haven't done this already, you're crazy.
[00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:29.120]   Like how can you be listening to the show
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:30.520]   and not download your free book?
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:31.880]   So definitely check it out,
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:33.560]   audible.com/macbreak.
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:37.480]   And if you need some coaxing as to what you should
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:42.760]   possibly download, Ron, I put Ron on the spot.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:44.600]   Ron has a pick for you.
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:48.080]   - I do, I just finished sort of powering through all three
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:50.440]   of the girls with the Dragon Tattoo series,
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:52.280]   which I know they've been out for a while.
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.120]   But yeah.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:54.640]   - So the funny thing is, is that I got into it.
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:56.080]   I got into the girls with the Dragon Tattoo
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:58.640]   because my dad was listening to it on audible.
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:01.320]   So my dad has listened, he's been listening to
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:04.360]   books on tape for 20 years.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.680]   And then when I got, when I brought him an iPad,
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:10.520]   an iPod Nano or whatever a year ago,
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.920]   he moved to audible.
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.080]   And so he's listening to me,
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:14.920]   he's like, oh, you have to do it.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:15.760]   And I have to do it.
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.880]   And I watch the movies.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.080]   - Yeah, well, and it's almost a shame
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.080]   that you saw the movies first.
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.520]   'Cause the books are,
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.840]   they're just so much richer than the movies.
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.720]   The movies were okay, but the book is just,
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:27.080]   there's this thing that's so compelling
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.520]   about this series is that he builds up these characters
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:33.120]   that you just hate so intensely.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.160]   So when, and the anticipation of knowing
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.880]   they're gonna eventually get it in the end
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.400]   is extraordinarily satisfying.
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.880]   So, and that's kind of truth
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:42.680]   we're all three of the books.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.880]   So I totally recommend it.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.880]   Actually, I got a quick, audible question for you.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:46.720]   - Yeah.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.440]   - Do you listen to normal speed or double speed?
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:52.280]   - I listen to it in, it depends on the subject matter.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.520]   So that's the, you know, for me,
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.760]   that that's the big thing is whether it's going to be,
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:57.760]   and it depends on the speaker.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.160]   So sometimes the speakers are talking,
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:00.040]   if they talk like me,
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:01.560]   I will tend to listen to it at 1X
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.200]   because I'm from Pittsburgh
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.440]   and we tend to squish everything together.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.560]   But if you are, there's a lot of them
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.720]   that have been too slow,
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.320]   and I'll put it, what I really want,
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.080]   and I don't think I can do it on audible.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.760]   I know on quick time I can go 1.5,
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.440]   which is like to be the perfect medium.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.400]   When I'm listening to it on, you know,
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.640]   it's generally 2X.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.800]   - Yeah, if I feel like someone's talking too slow,
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.000]   but when I'm listening to fiction,
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.680]   I kind of want to have time to absorb it.
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.280]   When I'm just trying to pull in information
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.120]   then I want to listen to it.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.440]   - It probably does depend on the book.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.640]   I mean, the Dragon Tattoo books are,
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:33.560]   I'd call them a page turner
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.360]   if they were pages to turn in audible books,
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.680]   but you know, you really want,
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.480]   I mean, just keep going and going.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.400]   And I pretty much started to listen to everything
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.040]   at double speed and your brain quickly adjusts.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:43.880]   Nobody times where I'm--
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:44.800]   - What's funny is you go back
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.320]   and you're like, click on with it.
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.120]   I'm so used to listening to all my podcasts
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.920]   at double speed whenever I caught,
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.520]   when I cast the live version occasionally
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:55.280]   in like the theme music plays for this show.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.360]   I'm like, "Wow, this is really slow.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.200]   What's going on here?"
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.280]   So I'm ready for 3X.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.280]   Somebody give me a player that does three times.
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.120]   I want to try it.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:02.960]   - I can't.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:03.800]   I've tried.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.160]   2X is like the, is my outer lane,
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.920]   but also I'm trying to do something else usually with it.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.080]   So that's usually my other--
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:08.920]   - Yes, for me it's usually--
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.640]   - I'm doing a bike ride or something like that.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.560]   And it's fine.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.160]   Just give me information flow.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.120]   - Right, totally.
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.960]   So now you can pick this
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.840]   or you can pick anything else that you want.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:23.840]   Go check it out, go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.480]   And you can sign up, you can get your free book.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.960]   You can download it, see if it works for you.
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.240]   It is just another, it's just a great way to read books.
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:36.240]   I mean, I am an adamant or very proud multitasker.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.920]   I do not believe in unit asking,
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:41.160]   especially when it comes to acquiring information.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.720]   I like to do that with one side of my brain
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.120]   while my fingers do something else.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.640]   And so it is just awesome.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.360]   And Audible is the key to the operation.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:52.800]   So once again, audible.com/macbreak.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.720]   And we're going to start running our picks around the horn.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:56.840]   And we're going to start with Ron.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.520]   Ron, do you have a pick for us?
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.600]   - I do have a pick.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.600]   I'm not positive that it hasn't been picked on the show
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.440]   before.
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.080]   I know I've picked it on this week in photography,
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.800]   but it's something I quite love.
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.640]   It's called Total Finder.
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:12.160]   It's sort of a modification to the existing Finder.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.280]   And it really does, I guess, three things
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.520]   that it does a lot of little stuff,
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.440]   but it does three things that I love.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.440]   And it's very lightweight.
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:21.080]   It feels like the Finder generally.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.800]   There's another package out there called Path Finder,
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.640]   which I like a lot,
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.800]   really is kind of heavy.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:28.160]   And it really encompasses everything.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:31.280]   Where Total Finder is just a really just
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.440]   extender existing Finder.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.000]   And there's three things that I really like.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.720]   Number one, it gives you cut and paste, true cut and paste.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.760]   So I can actually click on a file,
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:42.000]   and actually cut it as opposed to copying it
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.240]   and paste it somewhere else for moving.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:47.360]   It has tabbed browsing, just like you have in Safari or Chrome,
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.000]   where you can have multiple different directories.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.960]   You just up in tabs and go between them.
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.960]   But the thing I really love about it is then you can kind
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.920]   of double click if you've got two tabs open.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:59.880]   And it makes this dual pane interface into the Finder,
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:02.680]   where you can easily drag and drop from the left half
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:06.200]   of the screen onto the right half of the Finder window.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.840]   And anytime you're doing all this file manipulation and stuff,
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.800]   it just makes life so much faster.
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:14.760]   That's $15, I think, although he says it'll give you
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.560]   free licenses if you come up with a lot of really good feedback
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.400]   or something for him.
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:23.240]   Totalfinder.binaryage.com is a URL.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:27.520]   And absolutely no problem spending $15 or something like this.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.120]   I use it every day often.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.360]   And just one of those experiences where you're like,
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.520]   I just like this.
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.400]   Ron, I actually have a question about Totalfinder.
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.680]   I used to use it.
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:38.400]   It's been a while.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.440]   And I had some problems with it because it's a symbol plugin.
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:45.520]   And symbol is like a UI extension framework for OS 10.
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:48.920]   And it was giving me all kinds of crazy problems.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:51.120]   And that's why I stopped using it.
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.480]   But like I said, it's been a long time.
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:55.200]   I mean, has it gotten a lot better since then?
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.840]   Simple stuff is like a little sketchy.
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:01.120]   It's generally felt extremely bulletproof to me.
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:04.880]   The only time I've ever seen anything weird is when you're
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:07.960]   first logging in and it sort of brings up the windows
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.280]   that you may have had previously open.
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.120]   And then they're separate.
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:10.960]   And then they kind of merge.
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:11.920]   And it takes a second.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:14.840]   But other than that, I've had no problems.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.160]   It doesn't crash.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.480]   It's been rock solid for me.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.280]   I might have to go back and give it an answer.
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.080]   Yeah, I should check it out.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.120]   I just use it constantly.
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:25.840]   And it's just nothing huge, but it's just such a lightweight,
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.640]   easy extension to what Finder does for you.
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:30.120]   OK.
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:34.080]   And Ryan, what is your pick for the week?
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:37.680]   My pick I've been using a lot lately is an app launcher
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:43.160]   and general utility called Alfred, which
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.040]   is if you're familiar with Quicksilver, which
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.520]   I assume most people are, it's a lot like Quicksilver,
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:51.520]   except I found it's been a lot faster.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.760]   It's got some really neat features
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:55.080]   that Quicksilver doesn't have.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:58.400]   And it's just ridiculously easy to use.
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:01.000]   Fantastic.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.760]   So I guess my final pick, I got two picks.
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.960]   I couldn't make a choice.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:11.160]   So one of my picks is handstand.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.800]   So this is the handstand here.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.640]   And here's what it's good for.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.360]   And I somehow showed up without my iPad.
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:18.600]   So I have-- it's a stand for an iPad.
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:19.920]   Do you have your iPad with you?
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.720]   So put it in here like this.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.560]   I opened up my bag and I was like--
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.960]   For those of you listening at home, as opposed to watching--
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.160]   I've got a-- for those of you listening,
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.840]   I have a stand for my iPad.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.400]   Here's what really works about this.
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.920]   So the handstand has a little Velcro thing on the back.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.080]   And it's got this little thing that your hands can kind of grab
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:36.680]   onto.
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:38.800]   But it's got a nice rotating ability.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.760]   Now we use this a lot when we're doing slates.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:45.200]   So we use this slate tool for our--
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:47.120]   when we're doing shoots.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.400]   And we use the Slate app on the iPad.
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:52.960]   And so this is-- what we don't want to do is use both hands
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:53.760]   or whatever.
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.560]   So now we can just sit there and just go like this.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.200]   But if we want to turn it, we can go like this.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.080]   And it just-- you simply just turn it.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.480]   And it'll stay at any angle you want.
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.040]   It also acts as a great little stand
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.160]   because it's got this little handle.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.440]   So you can set it up and it's going to give you a little angle.
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:09.880]   You can rotate it around and have it sit up at just that little
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:11.640]   angle that you want oftentimes.
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:14.080]   And it's turned out to be just a great little holder.
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:14.760]   I'm pretty picky.
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.320]   I don't get into a lot of holders.
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.640]   And I don't use this one all the time.
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.120]   I mostly use it when we're doing production.
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.600]   But having something that I can just grab onto and stick it out
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.440]   there and hang onto it.
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.200]   Or if you want to write on it in a meeting
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.960]   and have it in one hand or the other.
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:28.840]   This works really well.
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:30.800]   I've been using it also with penultimate.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:32.200]   So I have this on one hand.
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.000]   And I have penultimate that I can write notes
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.040]   while I'm standing there in front of the client at an event
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.760]   and write stuff down and make it all work.
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:40.480]   So anyway, that is a handstand.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.960]   The other thing that I wanted to recommend is--
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:44.120]   and this is mostly because of what's
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:47.240]   happening right now in the Middle East--
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.360]   so it's almost impossible to really--
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:53.120]   you're hearing a lot about this crazy network called Al Jazeera,
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:58.240]   which we bombed when we went into Iraq.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.920]   But there is an Al Jazeera English.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:05.160]   And this is what it looks like on my iPhone.
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.360]   And I will argue that Al Jazeera English is probably
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:10.480]   the best global news in the world when it comes to video
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:13.160]   global news that you have access to.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:14.880]   Being able to watch a feed.
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:15.680]   They were put together.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:21.200]   Al Jazeera English was put together in the BBC.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.480]   In conjunction with the BBC.
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:25.720]   So it really feels like the BBC in a lot of ways.
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:29.400]   But it is not Al Jazeera Arabic, which I think is kind of--
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.560]   Al Jazeera Arabic, in my opinion, is kind of like Fox News
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:34.240]   for the Arab world.
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.360]   I mean, it tends to be a little bit more one-sided.
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:39.000]   Al Jazeera English tends to be very open.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.640]   But you can't find it anywhere in the United States.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.200]   These cable operators are--
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.280]   cable operators are--
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.360]   I don't know what's wrong with them.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.760]   Anyway, they're idiots.
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:52.560]   So they won't put this on.
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.760]   And so the only way to get it is actually
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:57.120]   with the iPhone or iPad app or other streaming.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.600]   You can go to their website and check it out.
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.960]   But the iPad app and the iPhone app are awesome.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:03.960]   And I use this all the time.
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:07.560]   And it's just a really, really, really great app.
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:11.200]   And if you want to watch World News, it's great.
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:13.960]   A lot of people are talking about Facebook and Twitter.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:16.800]   And that's cute about what happened in Egypt.
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:19.680]   But Al Jazeera Arabic and Al Jazeera English
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:23.320]   are the reason that this is happening all over the Arab world.
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:25.200]   And it is not about--
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.360]   it really is.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:28.600]   This is the-- so if you want to be part of what's going on
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.080]   right now, you've got to be watching this.
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.840]   It's definitely a big component of what's going on.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:35.360]   We were talking earlier about this is kind of the CNN moment.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.360]   I mean, I think everybody that was around back then
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:40.600]   remembers sort of CNN came into the war during the Gulf War.
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.520]   And it was suddenly--
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.360]   these are the guys that are providing the real coverage of it.
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.160]   And Al Jazeera was sort of--
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.600]   this is their moment for what's going on right now
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.400]   in the Middle East.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:52.240]   And a really good coverage.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.320]   And the interesting thing is it's not--
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.840]   like you said, it's not on cable.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:58.280]   So effectively, these cable companies
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.920]   are pushing people onto the web by not having the kind of content
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:01.920]   that people want to see.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:02.080]   Yeah.
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:04.920]   And this is the only way to see what's--
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:07.560]   the only place you're going to get real coverage, in my opinion,
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.560]   other than just stand-ups, is from Al Jazeera English.
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:14.440]   And so I just wanted to-- only because of what happened last week
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:16.200]   and what looks like it's going to continue to happen
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.480]   for the next couple weeks or months.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.440]   If you really want to see this stuff unfold,
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.920]   this is an application that you have to have.
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:24.920]   So anyway, that's it.
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.040]   Ron, where can people find you?
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:30.320]   Best place is on Twitter, I guess.
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.960]   I signed up for Twitter the first time I came on Macbreak.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:34.960]   Way back there.
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.360]   And you were like, you got to get on Twitter,
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:37.360]   and now's the time to do it.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:42.840]   So it's just @Ronbrinkman, R-O-N-B-R-I-N-K-M-A-N-N.
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.560]   And I'm a good poster.
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.360]   I'm not a heavy poster, but it's high quality content.
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:50.360]   I come in waves.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:55.040]   I think I posted once last week, and then I'll post six in a row.
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:55.680]   I don't know if I--
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:59.280]   I promise never to post what I'm having for dinner,
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.960]   unless it's really good.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:04.120]   Ryan, where can people find you?
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.320]   I'm at gatget.com.
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:07.440]   It's gdgt.com.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:10.680]   Using my list of gadgets at gatget.com/rion.
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:13.880]   And then I'm also at Twitter at @rion.
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:15.040]   Very, very good.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:18.160]   And you can, of course, find me on the Twitter's Alex Lindsay,
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:18.760]   all one word.
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:22.320]   And anyway, this is the end of Macbreak.
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.000]   I think is Leo coming back next week?
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.600]   Leo is back next Tuesday.
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:27.440]   And Leo is the OG crew.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:29.960]   Yeah, the OG crew, yeah.
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:33.280]   So it'll be back to the regular scheduled program,
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.360]   starting next Tuesday.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.560]   So stay tuned for that.
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.760]   And otherwise, get back to work.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:39.920]   Great time.
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:40.760]   Super.
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:47.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:50.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.220]   (upbeat music)
