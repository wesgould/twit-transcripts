[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.480]   This is Mac Break Weekly,
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.320]   Episode 6 for September 12th, 2006.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.880]   It's showtime!
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:28.800]   It's time for Mac Break
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.320]   and maybe this will be our regular night.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.920]   I know we just did a Mac Break,
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.040]   a heart on the heels of another Mac Break we just did,
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.840]   but this is supposed to be a weekly show,
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.600]   Mac Break Weekly, that's the name of it.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.320]   And I'm Leo LaPorte and joining me around the table,
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.640]   we have Merlin Man of 43Folders.com.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.480]   How's it going Leo?
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.200]   Hey, it's good to have you back Merlin.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.520]   Brett Larson from Channel 2 in New York City.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.360]   Hey Leo, what's up?
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.360]   It's so great to talk to you.
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.400]   Brett of course was a regular on call for help on tech TV
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.040]   and left for the Big Apple three years ago
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.200]   and has never looked back.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.360]   From Mac World Magazine,
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.960]   and actually Brett's a Mac World alum,
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.960]   Chris Breen's still there
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.000]   with the author of the Mac 911, or is it 411?
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.440]   It's still 911, it hasn't been reduced in price yet.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.040]   It's still the Mac 911 column and Mac data,
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.800]   also one of the hosts of the iLifeZone podcast.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.880]   And also Alex Lindsey is here, the Pixel Core.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.960]   And-- - Hello.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.360]   - And the spiritual father of this podcast.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.840]   (laughing)
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.920]   - Blessed father, for we have been to Mac land today
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.960]   at 10 o'clock in the morning,
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.240]   right in early Steve Jobs,
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.520]   strode onto the stage for its showtime.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.560]   And let's just get it right out of the way,
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.920]   right up front, no iPod phone,
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.920]   and no widescreen, touch screen, big screen, iPod at all.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.680]   Was anybody disappointed?
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.520]   - You're sad about that.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.360]   - I was disappointed.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.400]   I think we're all disappointed.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.040]   - Well, I need a new cell phone,
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.840]   so I was really hoping that they were gonna come out
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.680]   with the cell phone.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.520]   - I would have liked to see an Apple phone,
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.320]   but I think we all agreed that that was not a business
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.400]   as Steve wants to get into.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.560]   But with the movie store announcement,
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.040]   and we'll get to that in a minute,
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.280]   it seemed logical that he would do a larger screen iPod.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.120]   - Didn't.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.280]   - Yeah, you'd think so.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.520]   I certainly didn't see the iPhone coming,
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.320]   'cause it was, with the announcement saying,
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.320]   it's showtime, it made no sense to be a phone.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.160]   - Right.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.680]   - But still, that was kind of the one thing,
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.280]   and we'll do that in the summation,
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.040]   but I was expecting that that would be a no brainer,
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.560]   that if they were gonna go to the movie market,
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.880]   and obviously they were gonna go into,
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.440]   you needed something that was gonna play widescreen movies,
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.480]   and they had another solution to that,
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.600]   but I was expecting a portable solution.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.640]   - Yeah, and I think that it seems like to me,
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.920]   and is that a little bit of,
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.520]   is probably a technology issue of just getting,
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.720]   trying to stay in the same form factor,
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.200]   but producing a larger screen,
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.640]   and it sounds, I mean, the rumors have always been
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.400]   that Apple's more, is very sensitive
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.560]   about making it any bigger than it is,
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.480]   because it works, so fitting that all in there,
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.920]   I think is probably a challenge.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.920]   - I think it also, in retrospect,
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.040]   looks like Apple is moving very judiciously,
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.840]   it's evolutionary, not revolutionary,
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.280]   it's almost like a chess game,
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.280]   where they've planned their strategy out,
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.400]   and they are slowly squeezing, constricting,
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.920]   no sudden moves, no surprising moves, no risky moves,
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.640]   but every move does seem very carefully calculated.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.520]   At the end of the speech,
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.160]   Steve kind of summed it all up by saying,
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.520]   so as you can see, and we'll go through all the items
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.040]   that he talked about, but this was,
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.000]   seemed to be the import of the whole thing,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.200]   Apple is now in your den,
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.960]   by the way, they didn't say office, they said den,
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.120]   but that's where your Apple computer is.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.760]   Apple is in your living room,
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.600]   and we'll talk about the ITV device
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.000]   that's gonna put it in your living room next to your TV set.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.160]   Apple is in your car, he mentioned that 70% of all US cars
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.200]   will have iPod connectivity starting next year,
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.080]   and Apple is in your pocket.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.520]   And this reminds me so much of Bill Gates,
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.280]   the motto for years of Microsoft,
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.680]   was a computer on every desk running Microsoft software.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.560]   In fact, I think that's engraved literally
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.720]   in the sidewalk of the Microsoft campus in Redmond,
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.800]   and look at this is what Apple's doing.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.720]   Apple, and Apple in every part of your life.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.760]   If you think about the kind of stuff they rolled out,
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.600]   I think that's a good way to look at it.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.560]   If you think about them moving out in concentric circles
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.200]   from what they're strongest at doing,
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.240]   it might have been a little bit,
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.440]   I mean, if they could have pulled out
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.000]   a really cool white screen iPod, that'd be great.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.720]   But then that also might have detracted
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.240]   from the zing of him pulling out that ITV thing.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.640]   >> And I also think that it's a slow constriction,
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.520]   they don't need to make any sudden moves,
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.360]   they can chip away,
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.960]   and they're doing it very effectively.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.720]   I'm just going to run down some of the things he said.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.760]   If you have any comments, just jump in.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.280]   He pointed out the iPod now has 70% market share,
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.600]   60 million iPods sold two thirds of those in the last year.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.800]   He showed an iPod toilet paper holder.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.400]   Is that a joke or was that real?
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.160]   >> No, that thing really exists.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.000]   >> You're kidding.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.600]   I mean, it just shows you the scope of accessories.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.080]   It's a 3000 plus iPod accessory.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.000]   So if you can fit an iPod into your toaster,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.080]   somebody's going to do it.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.920]   >> So this thing is a dock with speakers
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.440]   and a holder for your toilet paper.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.960]   So I guess when you go to the bathroom,
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.600]   you just dock in there and you don't have to be something.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.080]   >> So your music will always be with you, basically.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.920]   >> Or your podcast.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.040]   >> That's what strikes me every year now at Macworld.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.720]   I slipped the Skip Macworld one year.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.560]   >> It's now exactly.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.560]   >> When I came back.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.400]   >> Absolutely.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.920]   I mean, it used to be like little mom
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.880]   and pop database companies and stuff like that.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.120]   And you just see how like all the companies
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.760]   that are based on this now, it's huge.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.160]   >> He actually should add a new line, Apple
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.920]   and your den, living room, car, pocket and shoe.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.720]   The iPod shoe is apparently the Nike accessory
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.600]   has been a big success.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.760]   He said they're 450,000 units in 90 days.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.600]   What is that?
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.440]   >> I don't know.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.280]   >> 150,000 units a month.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.120]   I don't know what shoe,
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.800]   you have to buy a Nike shoe to make this work.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.600]   >> You have to buy the special shoes for it.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.720]   >> It seems like that's a good number then.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.960]   >> Which I mean, it's surprising because runners,
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.640]   I used to run until my knees went bad.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.800]   But runners want to get a shoe that you like.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.840]   You don't change brands.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.560]   >> So for almost half a million people
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.280]   to buy new shoes.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.200]   >> Just so they can run their iPod.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.040]   Pretty amazing.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.320]   >> A friend of mine is marathon training
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.320]   and she went out and bought it the day it came out.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.160]   She loves it.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.000]   >> Wow.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.840]   >> I can't change.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.680]   >> And I think that this gets back
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.000]   into the whole impact on the content industry
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.840]   is that I look at all, as a user,
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.400]   I look at all the other options.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.080]   And it's kind of like, oh, that looks all cool.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.560]   But immediately the next thing that goes through my head is,
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.880]   oh, that doesn't really matter because I'm not,
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.640]   it doesn't really matter because I'm not gonna be able
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.480]   to put it on my iPod.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.480]   So I don't really care.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.160]   You know, like I just filter out every other--
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.680]   >> That's clearly the strategy is kind of a seamless
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.560]   wall-to-wall experience powered by iTunes and the iPod
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.920]   and the Mac, or I guess iTunes on the PC if you want.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.880]   And that really locks customers into your products.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.760]   >> I mean, you just don't even think about anything else.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.680]   >> I agree with Alex and when I hear about new music stores
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.880]   and 10 bucks a month for this, that or the other thing.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.720]   >> Who cares?
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.320]   >> It's not gonna work on my iPod, I don't care.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.120]   And it's not gonna even be when you get into the movies,
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.280]   it's not only gonna be,
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.480]   it's not gonna be just an issue around the DRM,
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.120]   it's also gonna be an issue related to QuickTime.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.760]   So a lot of these players, a lot of the other services
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.760]   are all basing their stuff around Windows Media Player.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.280]   And the issue is, is now you're really creating
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.160]   or if they're really supporting that
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.480]   and they're really not supporting the other options,
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.200]   you're gonna get into a situation where people,
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.400]   if they can't run the Windows Media Player stuff on an iPod,
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.560]   you're not gonna be interested in looking at it.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.960]   >> They did update the iPod.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.920]   And really there's no new top of the line iPod,
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.360]   but they changed some things.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.600]   Screen is brighter, battery is longer,
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.640]   he's claiming six and a half hours for the 80 gigabyte model.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.000]   They say new headphones, they look the same.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.920]   Chris Breen, you have the Nano, right?
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.600]   Have you listened to the headphones, do they sound?
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.280]   >> I haven't, no, I just got this
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.000]   as I was running out the door of the office,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.760]   so I haven't jacked them into my ears yet,
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.280]   but do they?
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.320]   >> Try that now, Chris.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.400]   >> Oh, should I do it right now?
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.600]   Can you listen to the line talk?
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.960]   I'll talk to them about the stuff.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.720]   You just talk it, if you hear it scream, that's me.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.080]   Oh, they're really uncomfortable.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.560]   >> Come back and report, nobody that,
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.000]   I mean, does, I guess people do use the ones
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   that come with the iPod, but I think if you really like sound,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.080]   you're gonna get better headphones, I don't know.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.920]   >> No, I don't, I'm too cheap.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.720]   >> I'm not even on the air and I'm, I'm afraid that I,
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.440]   I splurged on those shurs for me.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.280]   >> Yeah, those shurs.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.120]   >> I know Leo, too, those are great.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.680]   >> $500 shurs.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.840]   >> No, I spent 200, I think.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.840]   I didn't go crazy.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.240]   >> You didn't get the top of the line, in-ear monitor.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.200]   >> No, I got some pretty expensive ones, but not that bad.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.160]   >> So they are gonna do something that seems very minor.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.080]   I think this is one of the things that kept people really
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.520]   from listening to their iPods, gapolis playback.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.160]   Now, this isn't crossfading, but if you like classical music
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.440]   or dark side of the moon, or what was the Genesis album
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.280]   that you really like?
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.480]   >> A Trigga Betale.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.960]   >> Those are all albums that go seamlessly from cut to cut.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.680]   And when you listen on your CD or your vinyl, there's no gap.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.520]   But if you listen on your iPod, there's this,
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.960]   and it just ruins it, you can't listen to a symphony
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.520]   in between movements.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.080]   So this eliminates it, he demonstrates it, and it's perfect.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.400]   >> And one of the things that some people do that are really,
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.680]   really into building their mix tapes, for instance,
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.880]   is I used to take my stuff actually into an audio editor,
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.200]   and I'd build custom crossfades to build a nice mix.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.920]   This nice mix, and then I would add the,
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.440]   I would cut the songs and export them,
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.840]   designed so that they would go out and be, you know,
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.800]   each song by itself would, so that could jump to the different sides.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.920]   >> You're making one big track, otherwise you wouldn't get seamless.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.520]   >> Well, that was the problem, is that, but I would,
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.400]   in the past, I'd, you know, cut them up so that I could play them back.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.080]   But the problem that you got into when it wasn't,
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.320]   you'd hear these little gaps.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.120]   And so now this will, you could build your own custom pieces,
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.120]   and it would work.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.120]   >> And it does work, I tried it today, I was,
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.320]   I took Brian Wilson's Smile album, and it works beautifully,
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.360]   and it works automatically.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.720]   When you launch iTunes for the first time, it asks if you want to do it,
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.760]   yeah, I want to do it.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.280]   It checks through the data and the MP3 files, or within the tags,
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.600]   and it can tell how the frames are set up,
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.680]   if something is meant to go into the next scene.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.280]   >> Oh, it does.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.240]   >> And it just, does it?
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.480]   >> It's magic, it's brutal.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.720]   >> Yeah, this will be used for that grouping tag, finally.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.280]   Isn't that what you're supposed to do with the grouping tag?
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.680]   You want to say like, "Bitch!"
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.600]   Arts of the Symphony all go together.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.360]   >> So yeah, and you can ask it to shuffle by group now,
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.200]   so that mysterious grouping tag finally makes sense, as you say.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.360]   And you can actually take, select multiple songs,
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.720]   pull up the multiple song information window,
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.320]   and now there's a new option in there to make that gapolis.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.480]   So you can take songs that are not related,
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.640]   and make them gapolis as well.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.140]   >> Wow.
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.280]   >> So like compilation series.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:02.840]   >> How that is.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.340]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:03.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.160]   >> How that, "Loya."
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.840]   >> So I should mention that I was at this event.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.040]   I know you were Chris Breen.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.840]   Alex came over with a camera, and we did a wrap-up.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.960]   Is that video up yet, Alex?
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.360]   >> It's up.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.160]   I don't know if it's shown up on iTunes yet,
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.400]   but it is distributing right now.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.240]   >> By the time you hear this, you'll see the--
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.760]   if you want, you can see us talk about this right
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.440]   after the event, if you haven't had enough analysis
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.800]   by the time we did this.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.160]   We didn't have anything to hold up, though,
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.320]   so it was just really our pretty faces.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.440]   "Alphabetic searches."
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.360]   "Merlin man, is this a massive improvement of the interface?"
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.200]   >> Yeah, I think so.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.640]   I mean, up till now, I think it was--
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.640]   I forget maybe "Life Hacker."
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.880]   Somebody had a great trick where you could go in and do
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.720]   this incredibly Byzantine system with creating,
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.040]   you know, all these little kind of fake bookmarks
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.120]   so you could jump through your list alphabetically.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.240]   I think it's terrifically helpful.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.280]   I mean, I'm seeing lots of these little things.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.480]   I know it's not like a Macboy here,
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.040]   but all these little kind of fine things that, to me,
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.520]   show they're really watching how people use this stuff,
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.560]   and trying to really keep the true believers happy
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.720]   with these things that keep you really excited
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.560]   about the experience.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.840]   >> I think it's almost even more than that.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.720]   This and Gapolis mean that there are the holdouts
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.240]   who say, "You know, I'm never gonna use an iPod
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.240]   "because I can't get my symphonies to sound right."
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.680]   They're just knocking these pins down one by one.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.280]   It's clear that their goal,
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.480]   and this is where I think it's a chess game,
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.320]   is to give you no reason not to move to this platform,
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.280]   and I mean an integrated platform.
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.240]   And once you move there, you live there, right?
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.480]   You now have to, 'cause of DRM, you're sucking in.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.560]   >> And I think that this is also why there's so many Mac users
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.240]   that so want the iPhone, whether Apple wants to do it or not.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.320]   I know as an individual, for myself,
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.720]   I'd buy one the day it came out, and I'm waiting for it.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.840]   I'm trying to hang onto my trio as long as I can,
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.960]   and the reason is that I know that it's gonna work
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.320]   with the rest of my environment.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.000]   It's gonna work, if it's an iPod, it'll be able to play music,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.680]   but it'll work with my laptop, it'll work with everything else
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.880]   that I do, and right now,
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.760]   every phone is, there's a bunch of hoops
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.800]   that I have to jump through,
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.600]   and I always end up with doubles and triples
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.000]   and quadruples of people's contacts every time I sink,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.160]   and these are things that no matter what I do,
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.600]   it's still a problem, and I know that if I, with Apple,
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.360]   it's just gonna sort itself out,
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.960]   and I'm just too lazy to figure it out.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.040]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.520]   (laughs)
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.920]   >> And that's what that is. >> They like lazy people.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.360]   >> We're all, we want the computer, it's like we want,
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.720]   when we sit in the car.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.080]   Alex, you'll make Steve Jobs very happy.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.800]   Just cue your cut and consume his file.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.960]   >> Well, it's just that I just wanna--
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.800]   >> Yes.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.800]   >> You know, it's that whole, like, you know,
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.840]   with a Mac, it's drivers wanted, with a PC,
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.080]   it's mechanics wanted.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.760]   >> You know, and that's the difference.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.920]   >> Games, look at this, they've got games.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.840]   So all the people who complain,
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.360]   the Mac doesn't play games, maybe not,
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.680]   but my iPod plays bejeweled.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.520]   >> Woo hoo.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.360]   >> I love it.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.200]   >> I love it.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.960]   >> Tetris. >> I have it on my smartphone.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.040]   >> I can't stop playing it.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:54.880]   >> Tetris.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:55.880]   >> Tetris. >> It's got Tetris,
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.920]   got Pac-Man, got Zuma.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.400]   Texas hold him then for the other side of the content.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.880]   But you know, here's the thing, $4.99 each.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.200]   >> That's kinda pricey.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.320]   >> What?
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.280]   >> I think that's expensive for a game.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.360]   >> Five bucks for a game?
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.200]   >> What do you mean?
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.040]   >> If you bought this for Europe,
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.360]   all of it would be $20.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.200]   If you bought it for your--
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.200]   >> Well, if you'd be 30.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.040]   >> If you bought it from Sprint,
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.520]   you'd be basically leasing it for 99 cents a month.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.360]   >> I think, yeah.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.200]   >> I just, I don't know,
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.640]   it's a song, two bucks for a TV show.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.120]   >> $4.99 for a game.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.200]   You play the game forever.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.040]   Anyway, does, I have to say, as a bejeweled player,
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.080]   it's the same, it looks very close to,
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.840]   or exactly the same as the PC version,
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.880]   with great sound as you'd expect.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.320]   EA, participate, good job.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.800]   Now, this is the big story.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.340]   Prices really drop $249 for the 30 gig,
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.160]   $349 for the 80 gig.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.400]   >> That's actually really good.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.240]   >> aggressive.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.800]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.480]   In fact, it's weird because $249 is what the top
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.040]   of the line nano is costing.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:02.600]   >> It really, it sounds like this just feels really targeted
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.760]   at the holdout.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.600]   >> It is.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.440]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.760]   >> To somebody who's been saying, well,
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.640]   you know, it's, you know,
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.000]   gosh, my first iPod, I'm embarrassed to say,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.320]   I think my first iPod was like almost $500
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.760]   for, you know, I don't know, it was like
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.120]   a two gig or something.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.400]   >> I think I bought two or three iPods at somewhere in there.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.840]   I still have my five gig iPod somewhere in there.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.160]   >> Yeah, $349 for 80 gigs.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.680]   >> That's crazy.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.040]   >> And it's, and I think that the key,
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.120]   and this is, you know, I think definitely what Apple's doing
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.320]   is not leaving any oxygen in the system.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.160]   >> That's exactly right.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.800]   >> You know, that's what I mean by squeezing.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.800]   They're squeezing.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.440]   This is a slow squeeze.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.400]   Not trying to, they're not trying to checkmate
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.120]   win the game all at once,
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.840]   but they are doing the exact right moves
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.880]   to slowly squeeze the market down.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.920]   I think they're, you can't beat them.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.560]   >> I looked at earlier this year on CBS,
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.920]   kidding, plug.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.240]   I looked at the iPod competition,
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.480]   and the one thing that really disappointed me
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.320]   was the pricing.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.440]   The pricing was, you really aren't saving that much money
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.040]   buying one of the competitive products.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.880]   And what you're giving up is, you know,
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.320]   access to the iTunes, music store and the TV shows
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.320]   and all the other great stuff.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.880]   >> At this point, the prices are the same, aren't they?
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.720]   For comp-comprom.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.560]   >> Pretty much, yeah.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.600]   >> The only difference is you might not get a microphone
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.120]   and an FM radio.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.320]   I mean, there are few features.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.560]   They're moving into these other guys.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.320]   >> A lot of that stuff, the average Joe doesn't need.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.640]   And I wouldn't buy one over the other
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.920]   'cause it has a feature that I might use once or twice.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.760]   >> And you want iTunes.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.960]   We're gonna get to iTunes in a second,
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.760]   but before we do, there's a new nano.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.440]   It looks exactly like a shrunk Mac mini.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.560]   I mean, not Mac mini, iPod mini.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.400]   >> Chris has one.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.560]   >> Yeah, it's a mini mini.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.600]   >> It's a mini mini.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.600]   >> It's a mini mini.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.960]   >> It is, it's nice.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.000]   >> In color, what color do you get, Chris?
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.280]   >> I have the black 8GB model.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.120]   >> It only comes in.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:48.960]   >> It only comes in black the 8GB.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.160]   >> Yeah, they learn their lesson from the Mac.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.000]   >> They get it.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.960]   >> Oh, people pay extra for black.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.240]   Okay, we'll make that one in the top.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.520]   How much was that?
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.240]   >> This was $249.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.080]   >> Yeah, right.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:16:59.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.240]   >> See, I think there are people who want blue pink.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.960]   There's blue pink, it's a weird pink.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.120]   It's a kind of a reddish pink.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.400]   >> Kind of purpley pink, yeah.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.400]   >> It's all about the black, though.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.240]   >> Green, silver.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.480]   >> Come on now.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.320]   >> I don't know.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.400]   I think a lot of people,
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.400]   you know, people of the female persuasion
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.000]   might want another color than black.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.840]   (laughing)
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:19.680]   >> Is that sexy?
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.800]   >> Only if they're outside of New York and LA.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.080]   See, New York and LA, it's just gonna,
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:23.920]   that's the whole thing is,
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.320]   New York and LA just fund the black.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.840]   >> They just want the black.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.240]   >> I think that there are a lot of people
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.200]   who want other colors.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.480]   And it's a shame you can't get the 8GB.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.080]   So you can only get the 4GB in the variety of colors.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.600]   And that's 200 bucks.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.040]   >> Oh, it's like the MacBook.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.200]   You can only get the black one
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.560]   if you pay 200 bucks extra.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.840]   (laughing)
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.760]   >> They got a new charger.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:45.840]   Do we like this new nano?
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.320]   Is this compelling?
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.680]   Is it better than the old nano?
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.160]   >> It doesn't mean I have the old nano
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.360]   sitting right here too.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.160]   I think the old nano looked cooler.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.040]   >> Yeah, it's, it's a...
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:58.880]   >> I don't know.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.720]   I don't know.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.560]   When you set them next to each other,
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.360]   the old nano, wow, just...
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.000]   >> You can't do your makeup in the back of the new nano.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.680]   So that's gonna be a bad thing to me.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.520]   >> That's true.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.360]   >> It's a downer for some people.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.760]   >> I have to admit that the problem is,
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.320]   is when you set them side by side,
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.680]   the old one looks, you know...
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.520]   >> It's cooler.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.360]   >> It does.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.440]   >> It looks old.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.280]   >> It looks old.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.080]   >> Yeah, 'cause the new one has got these nice,
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.200]   rounded edges.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.920]   It's very sleek.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.280]   Even though it's retro.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.120]   >> Even though it's retro.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.440]   >> In a way, 'cause it's the mini.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.560]   >> I'm gonna still try to resist the,
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.400]   I'm gonna resist the original.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.520]   I am getting the little one.
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.280]   I'm getting the little mini-me.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.120]   The mini...
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:32.960]   >> We'll get to that.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.840]   Don't get there yet.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.720]   >> Oh, but that's, don't get there yet.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.400]   >> Chris Breen, have you listened to the iPod phones now?
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.040]   The new headphones.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.200]   I put one in my ear,
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.440]   and that was as far as I got.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.720]   Because, well, you know,
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.280]   the conversation was so compelling, I didn't...
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.560]   >> Oh, I want to know if they're better.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.400]   >> You didn't want to leave us.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.240]   >> All right, let's get there.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.080]   >> All right, all right,
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.080]   talk about something dull for the next few minutes.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.720]   >> We'll talk about the shuffle.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.960]   (laughing)
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.800]   >> That's what I'm getting.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.640]   >> Not dull.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.480]   >> Well, that's...
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.320]   >> And it's not dull.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.160]   I can't, I can't break away from that.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.240]   >> You know what surprised me is,
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.120]   he said that they've sold 10 million shuffles.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.000]   It's their, it's the most popular...
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.400]   Well, no, the most popular was the nano, I guess.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.560]   But it's very popular.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.600]   And this to me was like a moment
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.200]   from that Saturday Night Live skit.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:14.880]   (laughing)
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.720]   >> Right.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.800]   It's Piccano.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.240]   It's the size of a quarter.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.400]   Really small.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.720]   It's like, fact, it's exactly the same size
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.760]   as the old accessory, the old remote control accessory,
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.840]   and it has that clip in the back, too.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.800]   >> That's what I thought it was originally when I saw it.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.640]   >> Isn't that amazing?
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.080]   But only a gig.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.000]   Probably has trans flash or something,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.600]   something really small in there.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.840]   >> I think this is really smart.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.760]   I mean, my, when I got my,
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.120]   whatever, my $5,000 iPod I used to have,
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.600]   my wife runs, and I was saying,
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.720]   I want to take this with the in run.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.840]   She's like, first of all, it weighs like 10 pounds.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.040]   It's like three inches thick,
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.240]   and it pulls my whole left arm down.
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.320]   And with this, you can just stick that in a little pocket
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.160]   and hit the road.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.160]   So for athletes, people will--
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.680]   >> People will swallow the thing.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.720]   >> Absolutely, yeah.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.280]   >> By mistake.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.320]   >> But no, I think that's a terrific win.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.680]   The pricing on that, my gosh.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.040]   I mean, 'cause you know what the thing is?
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:02.880]   >> Not dollars, seven.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.600]   >> If you're gonna go hop on public transit
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.600]   and just go someplace,
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.160]   you don't need to be fiddling around, right?
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.280]   You just want to stick in your bag
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.920]   and be able to read while you're gone somewhere.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.080]   >> You know, at 79 bucks, it's almost disposable.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.160]   I mean, it really is,
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.320]   it's not the end of the world if you lose it.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.200]   >> Isn't that the point of the iPod?
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.600]   >> The Mozability, well, you don't have removable batteries,
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.720]   that's for sure.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.800]   >> To make them disposable,
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.120]   so you get a new one every two years.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:23.960]   >> And it--
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.760]   >> I think you were right on, I think Leo, with,
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.240]   I mean, just take it up a level,
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.280]   but I think you were right on with the whole Christmas thing.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.120]   I mean, this stuff all just sounds to me like--
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.560]   >> That's a stocking stuffer.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.920]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.760]   >> Hey, Leo.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.580]   >> Hey, Leo.
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.980]   >> And it has the mini dock, yeah.
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.180]   >> Something, just, can you go to apple.com for a second?
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.620]   >> Okay, I'll go to apple.com.
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.820]   >> By the way, if you look at the nano,
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.500]   I know what you're gonna say.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.140]   If you're looking at the nano, you see Twit,
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.700]   as they're still promoting the 2005 Twit,
[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:50.540]   as with the iPod.
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.380]   >> Just go to the home page.
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.420]   >> Yeah, free download, yeah, okay.
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.260]   Apple, just--
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.040]   >> Do you see anything?
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.380]   >> Watch the webcast, iPod nano.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.300]   >> Oh, that's what you're getting on,
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.140]   that's what you're getting on the main page.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.280]   >> Yeah, what are you getting?
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.460]   >> Nothing.
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.220]   >> I was getting nothing earlier.
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.380]   >> I was getting nothing but a footer.
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.740]   >> A lot of people are hitting it.
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:08.580]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.860]   >> What is the footer situation?
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:11.700]   What is that?
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.580]   >> Well, maybe they're in CNN battle mode.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.500]   >> Yeah, I've never seen any.
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.340]   >> I've never seen any.
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.180]   It's a little bold new story.
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.100]   >> Yeah, this morning, for like half an hour,
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.180]   all I got was header and footer.
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.460]   >> Oh, well, that maybe when they were loading the new stuff,
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.380]   they didn't want you to see it.
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.500]   >> But it's going on right now,
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.700]   and that's why I was curious.
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.500]   >> Mine's loading fast.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.340]   >> Okay, well, no problem.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.940]   >> You know, I broke away to listen to headphones,
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.540]   and they're comfortable.
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.380]   >> Because that was really boring,
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.700]   what you missed was nothing.
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.220]   >> Oh, good, good.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.860]   They were really comfortable.
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.300]   They had to kind of press them in my ears
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.540]   to get more of the kind of bass that I wanted from them,
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.980]   but they are more comfortable than the--
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.460]   >> That's the other ones before.
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.300]   >> The other ones were not--
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.140]   >> Do they feel more solid?
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.780]   Do they feel like they're going to stay in?
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.180]   >> Yeah, they will, because they have little stems
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.780]   on the ends of them.
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.420]   So they kind of hang down through that little divot
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.500]   in your ear.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.780]   So yeah, I think they will stay.
[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.460]   Particularly, I didn't have the foam covers on these,
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.380]   so if you do that, they'll really stay in.
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.060]   But they seem to work fine.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.940]   Now, during your little discussion of the shuffle,
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:14.300]   did anybody mention that you can have that thing engraved?
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.140]   >> Really?
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.380]   >> You have mowing-graved candies.
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.780]   >> Yeah, but I mean, it's the size of like the end of the day.
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.100]   >> Oh, you can say me.
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:20.940]   >> You say me.
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:21.780]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:22.460]   One character.
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.300]   >> You.
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.300]   >> You.
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.100]   >> That would be you.
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.820]   >> It'll be like those heart candies.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:28.900]   >> Exactly.
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.420]   >> That's me.
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.740]   >> It's 1.62 inches long.
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:33.940]   So now when you put it in your pocket,
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.060]   you could say, is that an iPod in your pocket,
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.740]   or are you kind of depressed about seeing me?
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.980]   Half an ounce, 240 songs.
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.060]   >> It's really a great workout.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.900]   I mean, for workout, you know, you're like, oh, it's perfect.
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.540]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.060]   Just amazing.
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.460]   >> See, but it doesn't have a screen.
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.300]   And usually when I tell people about the shuffle,
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.940]   they're like, oh, it doesn't have a screen.
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.140]   I want to see what I'm listening to.
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.420]   >> I'm surprised to hear they sold 10 million of them.
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.300]   I mean, obviously, I agree with you, Brett,
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.980]   but obviously 10 million people think that's fine.
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:02.420]   >> Well, that is 5 million of them went through the wash.
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.940]   >> [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.140]   >> Well, the other thing is, I mean,
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.100]   think about the way people use this.
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.460]   I mean, if you're like me, you just
[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.700]   could do like a little best of.
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.020]   I mean, for me, this is all about smart playlists.
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.500]   And so you just get a whole bunch of stuff
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.380]   you know you're going to like and have it update every day or two.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.940]   And you don't never need to look at it.
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:18.540]   It's just--
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:19.740]   >> It could be a second iPod.
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.140]   >> It's a second iPod, isn't it?
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:21.460]   Yeah.
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:21.940]   >> That's right.
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:22.300]   Yeah.
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.180]   >> I think that's exactly--
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.260]   >> Yeah, I don't think anybody--
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.060]   I don't know anybody who only has a shuffle.
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:27.940]   >> My daughter does.
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:28.980]   No way, she has-- >> Is that it?
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.100]   >> No, no, she has several.
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.020]   She won a shuffle though.
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.980]   She was very happy about that.
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.020]   I tuned seven.
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.740]   This is really the big announcement.
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.180]   I downloaded it right away as everybody did it.
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.580]   Now, I bet you anything.
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.420]   It breaks the copy restriction remover
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.380]   that they just got working for six.
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.980]   So don't you think, Marlon?
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.420]   >> Did they get that J-Him thing fun?
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:49.820]   >> Did they get J-Him working again?
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.420]   >> It wasn't J-Him, but they have-- yes,
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.260]   they got some sort of playfare removal.
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.260]   >> Sweet.
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.820]   >> Ooh, this is me shaking my fist.
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.540]   >> But now, I bet you anything,
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.460]   it's seven changes it all over again.
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.580]   >> Oh, I'm sure, absolutely.
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.580]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.460]   >> Well, then I thought-- >> I thought this was
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.220]   pretty impressive.
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.980]   I mean, I was ready to be typically, you know,
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:08.860]   well, whatever.
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.100]   But this, I think this is an app that I use a lot,
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.380]   and I think the polish to this looks just terrific.
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.860]   >> Run us through it, Marlon.
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.460]   Tell us about all the new features.
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.460]   >> Well, you know, a lot of it is--
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.260]   you know, on first glance, a lot of it
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.780]   is fit and finish type things.
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.260]   I mean, a lot of it is like, there's definitely
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.460]   kind of a new look going on here.
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:26.500]   There's more of this kind of--
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:27.700]   you guys noticed this blue look
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.260]   that seems to be kind of going around?
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.100]   I don't know.
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.380]   >> The kind of grayish--
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.700]   >> Yeah, there's probably a Cupertino name for that.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.660]   >> Yeah, and they changed the icon is a little bit different.
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:37.460]   It's a little bluer.
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.100]   >> Two things, two things you'll immediately notice.
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.340]   I mean, I, for example, I've always
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.540]   found it kind of frustrating to deal with the browser,
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.820]   that thing with the genre artist album thing.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.060]   And I find it kind of confusing,
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:47.540]   'cause once you've drilled down someplace,
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.260]   if you do a search, it gets confusing,
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.500]   and it's only searching that subset.
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.020]   And what they've done is they've done some
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.220]   kind of intelligent pre-sorting for you.
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.140]   We're libraries now broken out into the kinds of media.
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.340]   I mean, really in much the same way that the iPod was--
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.820]   at least my iPod video is broken up
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:01.820]   into those kinds of sections.
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.540]   So you've got music movies and so on,
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.420]   podcasts are in there in an area as before.
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.260]   And I don't know.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.700]   It just seems like it's visually a lot easier to deal with.
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.140]   Then on top of that, they've added a whole bunch
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.740]   of new views for being able to flip through your music.
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.540]   So in addition to the kind of the classic,
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:16.460]   show me everything view, there's now a way
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.220]   to see it all grouped by album with the cover.
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:23.740]   And then the sexy is bringing in this wonderful--
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.460]   what's the name of the company that they picked up cover?
[00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:27.780]   Oh, is that where they got this?
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.340]   I thought I'd seen it before.
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:29.860]   I think--
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.420]   Yeah, the product's called CoverFlow.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:32.060]   CoverFlow?
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.820]   And basically, this is something everybody who has ever seen
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.260]   this ends up putting it on Flickr.
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.820]   It's a beautiful 3D visualization of all the covers
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.660]   of your records that you can surf through.
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:41.500]   And then it's also--
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:41.820]   I just like it, though.
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.300]   TV shows and movies, too.
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.100]   That's right.
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:44.540]   But it's like--
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.820]   It really is in podcasts.
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.100]   --virtual shelf.
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.820]   No, not podcasts.
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:49.500]   Aww.
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.340]   What is it doing for podcast?
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.220]   I mean, I don't know if that in particular
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.500]   adds so much great functionality, but it looks terrific.
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:57.020]   Oh, I like it.
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.220]   And it takes that kind of a lot of the look
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.460]   of the front row, you know, type of--
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.380]   Well, you know what I like about it is--
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.660]   and this is really smart of them.
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.020]   Even if you ripped the CD, even if you didn't buy it
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.100]   from the iTunes Music Store, if you have an iTunes Music Store
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.740]   account, it will go out and download the album art
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:13.740]   for all of these albums.
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.300]   I went out and downloaded 16 other albums.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.060]   That's right.
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.580]   You need to select all of thematically?
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.660]   Yes.
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:20.780]   Select all of them.
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.180]   Like you select all your songs and then say, like, go fetch.
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.660]   No, actually, when you first set it up, it'll do it for you.
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.820]   Yeah, automatically.
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.700]   And then as you're flipping through, it'll update as well.
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.300]   It's on the advanced menu and says, just get album art
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.020]   and it will get it.
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:32.780]   And I love it.
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.300]   That is almost worth breaking the DRM.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.300]   I think it is.
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.860]   And Steve said a good thing.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.300]   I think this is exactly what this does.
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.820]   It lets you kind of serendipitously browse through your albums.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.980]   And I kind of much the same way you did when you had CDs
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.140]   on our shelf.
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.580]   And you see the CD art and there's something different happens.
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.180]   You go, oh, wow, I've entered that in a while.
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.060]   It really is neat.
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.620]   Also, the one thing I love-- this is like a really stupid small bug,
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.860]   I guess, but they finally fix the multiple speaker problem
[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:04.540]   where now you don't get these weird firewall errors when
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.180]   you're trying to send them more than one airport express,
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:09.380]   which is maybe the ultimate first world problem.
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.340]   But that's all working great again.
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:16.180]   I do think this is a significant upgrade to iTunes.
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.500]   I mean, it's something that everybody will probably
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:19.580]   want to download right away.
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.300]   Speaking of a multiple speaker problem,
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.420]   does anyone else have an issue with a Bluetooth phone
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.780]   being near their airport when they're
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.860]   trying to listen to music over their wireless speaker?
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.260]   Well, it's the same frequency I could see.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.340]   I would be a problem.
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.340]   I haven't had that happen.
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.020]   Mine breaks up.
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.740]   And the thing is, the one room will
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.980]   keep playing with the other room.
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.980]   Does this weird digital artifact noise while the music plays?
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.260]   And then it's sooner or later, the base station figures it out
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.820]   and stops playing the musical.
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.300]   Do you do interference robustness on your express?
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.140]   I have to because I have like a million
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:48.980]   Wi-Fi's around.
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.540]   Yeah, you're in Manhattan too, which--
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:51.780]   Yeah.
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:52.420]   That's me.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:53.580]   You know, they just put--
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.820]   They put Wi-Fi in Central Park now.
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:56.620]   So it's--
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:57.820]   Sure, the iPod--
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.180]   Well, shit, the iPod phone won't do that.
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.700]   No, it'll fix all that.
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.020]   Yeah, right.
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:08.220]   Also, the big story, I think in terms of its showtime
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.900]   was that they're going to sell movies.
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.060]   Nobody's surprised by this.
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:15.140]   But here's the deal, in case you haven't heard it.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.940]   It's got to be a Disney movie, which
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:22.100]   means Disney, Touchstone, Miramax, or Pixar.
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.220]   The four labels as Bob Iger.
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.500]   You know, I surprised nobody booed Bob Iger when he came in,
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.540]   given that he's been the guy defending the--
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.580]   Not to get political here, but defending the 911 quote
[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:33.380]   documentary.
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.980]   I guess it was a tech crowd.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.220]   They didn't blame Bob Iger for it.
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.580]   But Bob Iger did speak.
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.780]   So they've got the Disney movies.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.820]   And of course, that's because Steve Jobs is the number one
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.900]   shareholder in Disney.
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:43.660]   They can get that.
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:47.900]   They don't have any other movie company involved.
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.500]   But again, that's how they started with music.
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:52.860]   You know, that's TV.
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.620]   Yeah, I think it works.
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.780]   The movie companies will all line up and say,
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.300]   good, we'd like to be here too.
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.580]   And I think the problem for the movie companies
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.020]   is that it's going to work.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.180]   And the reason it's going to work
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.860]   is because everyone else dealing with them
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:06.740]   keeps on listening to them.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.820]   The thing is, is that the movie companies
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.860]   couldn't create a product that sold on the internet
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:12.740]   to save their life.
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:16.460]   I mean, they're just so concerned with protecting, you know,
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.460]   wrenching every little penny out of this
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:19.980]   and getting every little piece out of this.
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.700]   It's just insanity.
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.620]   It's watching them just shoot their own feet.
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:24.460]   What about the pricing?
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:25.620]   So here's how it works.
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.980]   They'll be released the same day the DVD comes out.
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:28.980]   Of course, it's not a DVD.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.020]   In fact, it's a little bit lower than DVD quality.
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.100]   640 by 480.
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:33.820]   That was a big upgrade.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:39.140]   It'll be $12.99, $12.99, US, only US, by the way,
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.180]   until next year when it goes international.
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.100]   For the movie, if you pre-order it
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.860]   or buy it the day of DVD release,
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.020]   after that it's $14.99.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:50.580]   And then I guess at some point it becomes catalog
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.420]   because the catalog stuff is $9.99.
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.340]   I think that's pretty reasonable.
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:56.860]   It's, you know, if it's good quality,
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.220]   and I think 640 by 40 is better quality than we expected.
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.060]   The only thing is--
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.700]   The big screen, it looked pretty good.
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.980]   I think it's hard to understand.
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.620]   Why can't you burn this stuff to a DVD?
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:08.820]   They've got the iLife Suite.
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.860]   I would think they would want, like your music,
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.180]   that you can burn onto a CD.
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.220]   I would think they would want--
[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:15.820]   They say the same rights that they're--
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:16.860]   Offering for TV.
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.140]   Can you not burn the TV shows?
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.060]   You can't burn the TV shows.
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:19.900]   You can't burn a TV.
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.340]   Which I wish, again, I wish it would be so great
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.460]   if you could buy, you know,
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.700]   because they sell like, buy the whole season of the office.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.740]   I'd love to, but I want to watch it on a TV.
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.820]   It may be that that's a strategy,
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.340]   not something enforced by the television and movie companies.
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:36.700]   I think Apple really wants you to watch them
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.780]   over the, either on your computer, on your iPod,
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.820]   or using this new ITV device.
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:42.820]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.660]   Exactly.
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:44.660]   I was just going to say maybe that's the part--
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:47.660]   Maybe strategic more than it is copy protection.
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:51.660]   Also, it's funny, it seems like they're pretty good
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:54.660]   at getting right up to the edge of consumer annoyance.
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.300]   You know, so we talked last week a little bit about the Amazon store
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.660]   and how onerous it is to use any of that stuff.
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.660]   And I don't know.
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:02.660]   Nobody I know loves DRM,
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.140]   but there's a certain amount of it that you're willing to accept
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.660]   when the price point is right and everything else lines up.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.300]   And I think they've been really smart so far
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.660]   about getting that right.
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.660]   So, you know, if they had made this $20,
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.660]   or if they had said, you know, you can only watch it for a week.
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.660]   I mean, you know, I think they get pretty close stuff.
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:18.660]   How do you think they do that?
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.660]   Chris Breen, you might have some insight into this.
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.660]   Do you think they do a lot of focus group testing,
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.660]   or is it just Steve Jobs' gut?
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.660]   I think a lot of it's Steve.
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.660]   You know, they show stuff, walk into his office and say,
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.660]   you know, after like weeks of preparation for this one.
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.660]   He doesn't seem like a big focus group guy.
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:35.660]   No, I don't think he is.
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.660]   You know, I understand that they run stuff around sort of internally,
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.660]   but you know, they're not bringing in the grandmas from New Jersey
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.660]   to look at this stuff.
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.660]   And it ultimately comes down to Steve.
[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.660]   So they bring something in.
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:47.660]   Steve doesn't like it.
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.660]   It goes against Steve Jobs.
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.660]   We're just really fortunate that Steve has good taste.
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.660]   He does.
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:52.660]   He has great taste.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.660]   And every other reports you hear of Steve,
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.660]   it seems like everything kind of does stop with him.
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.660]   So if somebody did do, you know, six months of focus groups,
[00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:02.660]   it did from what I can gather, just reading around.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.660]   It sounds like one meeting with Steve could change that pretty quickly.
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.660]   Yeah.
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:07.660]   You can just say, well, they're wrong.
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.660]   Yeah.
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.660]   And this is what we're going to do.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.660]   I also heard you can kill people using just his mind.
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:12.660]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.660]   I think actually that Alex has seen him do it.
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.660]   Yeah, I saw him.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.660]   Yeah, it was it was a no blood though.
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.660]   It's just just kind of a silent, quiet slump to the floor.
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.660]   And that's yeah, yeah, it's kind of amazing.
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:26.660]   Yeah, like Darth Vader.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.660]   So you think the price is right.
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:30.660]   I think it's a little high.
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:31.660]   I do.
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:32.660]   Oh, okay.
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:33.660]   Well, no, no, no, wait a minute now.
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.660]   Don't go down.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.660]   No, I'm not saying I'm just saying I think it's actually right.
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.660]   Brad thinks it's good.
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.660]   Alex, why don't you think that's right?
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.660]   It's too close.
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.660]   It's too close to a for me.
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:44.660]   What's the DVD cost?
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:45.660]   Twenty bucks, right?
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:46.660]   Yeah, twenty bucks.
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.660]   And then if I go to Best Buy.
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:48.660]   I'll get it.
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:54.660]   If I go to Best Buy, you know, and I have to admit, I have the convenience that my office is,
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.660]   you know, a block away from six different units.
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.660]   So for twenty bucks more, you get the movie extras.
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:01.660]   You get slightly higher quality, although I have to say this is 480p.
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.660]   Well, I guess for me, the thing is, is that if I'm going to buy, if I'm going to pay that much money for it,
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:06.660]   I want the extras.
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.660]   You know, otherwise I just Netflix it.
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.660]   And for a movie nerd.
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:14.660]   Well, but I think that's a lot of, I mean a lot of people that I know that I see.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:18.660]   I think at this price point, at this price point, I'm in Brett's corner on this one and I think
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:19.660]   it's going to be $14.99.
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:24.660]   Yeah, I think at this price point, ease of access, immediate access, there's a lot to be said
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:25.660]   for that.
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.660]   And by the way, I'm going to buy movies that are $9.99 in a lot of cases here.
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.660]   And also $99 is the price, I think.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.660]   People, people buy different, I mean the thing is, this is a little bit of a strong man,
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:34.660]   because it isn't either or a situation.
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.660]   I mean, if I'm going to buy the Godfather collection, I'm probably going to want to go,
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.660]   yeah, I want to go get the whole, the whole shoot match, but if I'm going to get like,
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:45.660]   you know, Ernest goes to Best Buy, I don't mind spending, you know, $10 to just be able
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:46.660]   to watch it on a plane.
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:47.660]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:52.660]   I think that, yeah, and so I mean, I think it could be, I think they're, again, they're
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:54.660]   just at the edge of what's going to be acceptable.
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.660]   But maybe, you know, I mean, how much do you think they're trying to compete with Walmart
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.660]   on this stuff?
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:03.660]   You know, I think that really what's happening is that I think Apple really, all the rumors
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:08.660]   are one at $9.99 and, you know, the $14.99 is a capitulation to Hollywood.
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:13.660]   And it just shows, to me it just still shows the lack of intelligence in Southern California.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:15.340]   I mean, you know, I think you're going to be surprised.
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.780]   I think that these are going to sell pretty well.
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.660]   I think that this is not so far off.
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:22.660]   It's very easy to do.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.820]   You've got, you don't even, you know, they got your credit card number.
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.980]   You're really just pushing a button.
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:32.900]   Yeah, and I think we're really going to see this when we start seeing simultaneous release.
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:37.580]   So the day cars comes out on DVD and the store, I bet they'll sell a ton of them.
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:38.580]   You bet.
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:42.500]   I mean, they'll still sell more DVDs, but they'll sell a lot online.
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.140]   I think quality.
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:49.420]   You know, I watched some of the iPod or the TV shows hooking the iPod up.
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.620]   I've got a 30 inch high definition TV.
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.780]   The old ones, the old 320 by four.
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:54.780]   Yeah.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.780]   And I watched all episode of Desperate Housewives on that.
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:58.780]   Yeah, me too.
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:34:59.780]   It looked great.
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.780]   And now everything, including Desperate Housewives, everything's going to be so cool.
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.300]   It's 4640 by 480.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.140]   Now, yeah, they've been pulling down episodes all day.
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.980]   So you go up to the store and you look for a while and then like, well, only half the
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.300]   seasons here, you come back an hour, then they're back because they're reencoding all
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.300]   the stuff.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:17.660]   The 4.6.4 ratio Desperate Housewives, 480p.
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.300]   That's as good as you're going to get.
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.300]   Yeah.
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.300]   You're not going to get that.
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.300]   Unless you're watching it live.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.300]   Yeah.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:24.300]   Unless you're pulling it on HD.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.300]   I think it's as good as live.
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.300]   Yeah.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:27.300]   It's 480p, right?
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.300]   I mean, maybe you'll see some compression artifacts.
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.300]   It depends on it.
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.100]   Well, standard versus HD, of course, if you're, I mean, yeah, standard definition,
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.780]   it's as good as it's going to get because I mean, a lot of the stuff that's on my
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:35.780]   cast.
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:36.780]   But I think we're so...
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:37.780]   So, we're so...
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:38.780]   So, we're so used to that.
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:39.780]   No, it's not.
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.100]   That's the poor quality television.
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.420]   And not just in terms of the content.
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.740]   I mean, the actual quality of the picture.
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.740]   But we're so used to it that I don't think people are going to notice.
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:51.780]   I think video files are going to say, yeah, I can see some compression artifacts, but
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:55.260]   you know, Mary Jo Fisher, who lives in the middle of the country, she's going to watch
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:56.620]   it and think, yeah, looks great.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.620]   Do you think...
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:58.620]   And there's just something that...
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:59.620]   I just want to point this out.
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:01.900]   That 480p is EDTV.
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.740]   It's the same resolution as DVD.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:05.740]   It's not...
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.180]   Well, DVD is technically 720 by...
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:09.380]   It's not on your target...
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.380]   You're talking about HD.
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.380]   This is...
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.380]   No, no, no, no.
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.380]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:19.820]   A standard definition is non-square pixel 720 by 486.
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:20.820]   You know...
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:21.820]   Interlaced.
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.620]   It can be correct.
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:24.620]   It can be correct.
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.160]   But, yeah, 4A TV is 480p.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.160]   Well, this is...
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.600]   But if they're saying 640 by 480, it's...
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.600]   It's slightly...
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.080]   It's basically square pixel.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.080]   They're squaring up pixels.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.720]   I think it's as good as most people...
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:38.920]   Anybody who does have it knows TV is not going to see a difference.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:39.920]   Yes.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.920]   No, for standard definition, you're not going to see the difference.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.440]   We used to deliver stuff.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:46.840]   I used to deliver stuff for HBO at 640 by 480.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:48.840]   So this is pretty remarkable.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.840]   It'll work.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.840]   No, it's...
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.520]   Standard TV is 525i.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.840]   Standard TV...
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.840]   It's 525...
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.400]   It's 525i is that's PAL.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.400]   Okay.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.400]   So the NTSC is...
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.400]   It's...
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.400]   Yeah, it's 720 by 46.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.400]   In-lice.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.400]   It's...
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.400]   So it's interlaced.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.400]   So long conversation.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.400]   Yeah, okay.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.120]   But the interlaced versus progressive is a big deal.
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.640]   I mean, having nice progressive image is a reason...
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.840]   What is the highest resolution of the iPod with videos?
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.440]   Is it 640 by 480?
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:29.120]   It's 640 by 480 if you're using...
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.120]   It's not 264.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.120]   No, no, no, no.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.120]   If you're using MP4.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.120]   MP4.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:37.680]   Yeah, because the H264, this gets into how much processor speed it takes and the number
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.560]   of macro blocks that you can...
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.400]   It's actually not a per pixel ratio.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.400]   It's the number of macro blocks that you're loving.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:46.360]   So they're releasing it in a quality that is actually better than the iPod can display
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.960]   so that it'll look good on your TV.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:48.960]   No, I don't...
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.720]   I think the iPod won't be able to display it, but the iPod will be able to replay it
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:52.720]   on your TV.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.720]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.720]   And it'll...
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.880]   I think it's in a way a shift and maybe that's why you didn't see a bigger iPod.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.520]   This is a shift from iPod playback to TV playback.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:05.520]   And the one thing about it is you start throwing these on your iPod and you start throwing
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.520]   these little shows on your iPod.
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.520]   You're gonna fill it up.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.520]   Yeah, you're gonna fill it up real.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.520]   I mean, that's only...
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.120]   Yeah, 'cause these shows are gonna be considerably bigger than what it would have been.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.520]   At least, at least, be in them four times.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.520]   They should be 400 megabytes.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.520]   Yeah, 400 megabytes.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.520]   400 megabytes of piece.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:22.080]   Looking at the store when he was showing him, it was roughly two gigabytes for a movie,
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.080]   a two-hour movie.
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.080]   Right.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.720]   You're bringing long gigs for a movie.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.640]   You know, at least you can save it on a DVD.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.640]   You can't watch it on a DVD.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.640]   Right.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.560]   And you know how long is it before you have a DVD player that can play back H.264 saved
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.840]   as data on a DVD?
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.440]   I think you could probably buy one now.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.720]   I still think this comes back to how long are we gonna be worrying about whether our
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.720]   DVD player is...
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.600]   I haven't used my DVD player.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:44.600]   And I know...
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.280]   Let's talk about it because this is gonna be...
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.200]   I think this is what I'm trying to do.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:55.440]   This code name, ITV, Steve said it'll be out by sometime in first quarter 2007 for a price
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.440]   of $2.99.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:00.000]   It's not a media center in the sense that it's a computer.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.760]   It doesn't have any storage.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.960]   It's really a network interface.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:08.520]   But it has HDMI and component out and also digital audio out.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.320]   I think this is really the most exciting part of what the company...
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:17.680]   Apple is getting in on the business of what half a dozen other companies are already doing.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:18.680]   No, it's not a TV.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.240]   It's not a media center because it doesn't record.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.280]   Like the squeeze box, isn't it?
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.280]   It doesn't have any...
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.280]   Yeah, it's more like that.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.280]   It doesn't have a hard drive.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.280]   Right.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.440]   But you know, it's funny when we were talking about DRMs, one of the things Apple has yet
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:36.800]   to do is let any of these companies like Squeeze Box or Slim Devices play back the Apple,
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.640]   the iTunes Music Store files.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:42.280]   And I think part of the reason they do that is because Apple has hardware that'll do that.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.480]   Apple has the air tunes.
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.480]   So they don't wanna...
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.000]   This is air tune in a way, isn't it?
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.480]   Yeah, if you watch what they're doing with their own hardware and their own restrictions,
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.880]   it kind of gives indication to where they're gonna go.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.880]   One of the things Steve's...
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.800]   And by the way, kind of an improved front row.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.960]   I know Chris Breen, you're not a fan of front row, but did you think it looked a little
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.720]   bit better than the old front row?
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.360]   Yeah, I think it looks better.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:09.400]   I'm not so concerned about front row, but what I am interested in seeing how they pull
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.800]   this off is the whole wireless streaming.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.800]   I mean, Steve said it...
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.280]   It looked good, didn't he?
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.440]   Yeah, he said it's 802.11.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.440]   He didn't say.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.720]   He didn't say what flavor it was gonna be.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:26.600]   And I've streamed video through front row with a mini upstairs in my regular G5 downstairs
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.840]   and it sucks.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.680]   I see how they're gonna do this.
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.720]   I would read the tea leaves here.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:35.280]   I think that he wanted to say N, but N is not ratified.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.560]   It's in draft right now.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.200]   I think they're hoping, in fact, that maybe the hold up.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.080]   Once N comes out, that's fast enough to do it.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.080]   And it does a long distance.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.080]   Maybe they'll do A.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.840]   Did we get...
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:55.080]   That was just a motorcycle going by, I'm sorry.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.080]   Do you think they would do...
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.320]   I would think they would go with N.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.440]   I think they want to go with N, but if N's not ratified, do you think they'll go with
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.440]   G?
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.440]   G doesn't work.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.920]   G's fast enough, yeah.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.760]   They don't have a big enough pipe to do it.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.760]   I mean, honestly...
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:07.760]   Honestly, if you're on the side with Chris...
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:12.400]   Yeah, if you stream it, you have to use Gigabit Ethernet to make this work reliably with a big
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.400]   old show.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.400]   It's interesting.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.920]   I mean, I can't even get it to display AIFF files over the air.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.920]   It's not interesting.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:23.480]   He didn't mention what the Ethernet interface was, but I presume it would be Gigabit.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.720]   Yeah, I would think so.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:28.320]   Yeah, certainly if you have it wired, that makes total sense, but the wireless is the
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.200]   big mystery and it's got to be something big about what they're doing.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.240]   And I think that's why they're waiting.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.960]   I really think that once you get...
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:40.480]   If this actually works well, I mean, this really is the thing that really...
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:44.320]   I don't see... I mean, for me, I don't see any reason to start...
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.680]   I would be downloading everything.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.160]   It's an I would need devices, what it is.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.280]   And it's one that will actually work and that is actually simple.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.280]   It's not a computer.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.280]   Figure out.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:57.400]   And from Apple's point of view, it's one that locks you into the iTunes music store big
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:58.400]   time.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.400]   Yeah, this is...
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.400]   Everything else is the iTunes.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.920]   But isn't that the point?
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:09.480]   Well you could bit torrent stuff, but you'd have to import it into iTunes to play a bag.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:17.520]   I think Apple is quickly positioning themselves as not a content provider in terms of like
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:21.920]   a Disney or a Viacom, but they're becoming sort of the...
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:22.920]   This is working...
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.560]   They're going to be the pipe that delivers all this content.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.280]   Just like you were saying in the beginning, it's kind of ironic that Microsoft has been
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.120]   talking about this forever.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.800]   But Apple's actually doing it.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.480]   Well, and I think the other thing is that this is really becoming a vertical market.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:39.040]   I mean, you're talking about the same company, the same company that where most people build
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:42.800]   their, build the content that's ending up at the end of the pipe.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:48.120]   So whether you're from the time you start playing with iMovie to Final Cut Pro to pushing
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:51.960]   the stuff out, all of that stuff is all ending up inside of that pipe.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:56.120]   I think one thing that this brings up as a question is also, what are they going to do
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:57.120]   with...
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.560]   I mean, this is a little bit of a pro question, but what are they going to do with DVD Studio
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:00.560]   Pro?
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:06.000]   I mean, what you really want to see is that turning into a quick time offering tool, you
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.320]   know, because the DVD is going to be less and less important as far as the development
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.320]   cycle.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:20.800]   I think it's interesting because as somebody who creates content, Alex, and I guess to
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:25.680]   a certain extent I do, this puts us in a way, a parody.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.680]   He showed Rocket Boom.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:30.600]   I mean, and he said he made a little snide comment about how the quality varied quite
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.600]   a bit on these video podcasts.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:37.840]   But I think if you're a videographer or a videopodcaster, it puts you at parody and
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.680]   you don't have to sell through iTunes.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.520]   iTunes has given us a free channel.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:48.400]   Well, and this is what we've been betting on as we built up Macbreak and as we built
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:53.080]   up, the other stuff is that this was going to get to be a tighter connection.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:57.600]   And I think this is going to be a huge boom for video podcasting because it really, as
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.120]   you said, it's going to put video podcasting.
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:04.080]   I can go up and download my video podcast or I can go download a TV show.
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:07.000]   Now the big question is, can you get the video podcast to a point where they look as good
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   as TV?
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.840]   Well, you're trying with 1080p.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:18.320]   Well, yeah, I don't know if look is good will be the criterion for some people.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.240]   Well, be as compelling.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.640]   So I think that there's a lot of them.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:29.320]   The problem right now with a lot of podcasts is the noise to signal ratio is very high.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.320]   Yeah.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.000]   Well, the other thing is that, I mean, like all of these things, I mean, if you're an
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.040]   early adopter, you're going to jump in at the bleeding edge and adopt all this crazy
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.040]   stuff.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.520]   But think about what it would have taken a couple of years ago to do the kind of stuff
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.520]   we're talking about right now.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:48.000]   I mean, you're talking about some serious getting a Linux box and going out and trying
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   all this stuff.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.880]   And have you guys looked like democracy?
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.880]   Have you guys seen this?
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:52.880]   Yeah, I love democracy.
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.360]   And it's the same idea.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.360]   It's the same idea.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:59.240]   Democracy is an application that is in some ways, it's very similar to iTunes.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.560]   But it's primarily, it is for video.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:07.240]   And it's a totally roll your own video viewing application that lets you integrate, it has
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.680]   integrated bit torrent.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:09.880]   It'll let you look at WMVs.
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.560]   It'll do the whole line.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.960]   And I just think it's going to be fascinating to watch how the next to me, the next thing
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:18.160]   Apple or the next thing iTunes is going to be grabbing from is going to be democracy.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:22.560]   I mean, to look at how people can take all that home-rolled video and audio and then
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:26.280]   munch it in different ways and just point it at an RSS feed and say, "Watch for stuff
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:29.120]   with whatever in it and download all of those for me."
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.440]   I think it's a natural Apple script.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:35.000]   Somebody's going to write that we'll just do that and then import it into iTunes and
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.160]   then you've got it.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:39.920]   But what's missing from democracy is the access to the commercial content.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.960]   I think what end users ultimately want is the full universe.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.200]   Not just the commercial.
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.200]   Absolutely.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.200]   Not just the commercial, right?
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.680]   No, I agree with you.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.960]   But I mean, I think like any of this stuff, this is a one point.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.360]   Actually, it's a .9.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.360]   But this last cut of that has a lot.
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:58.920]   I just downloaded it the other day and it's got a lot of polish to it.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.920]   And you know, again, so-
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:00.920]   It feels like a channel guide.
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:01.920]   It feels exactly like that.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:02.920]   But let me put it this way.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.600]   So, I mean, if you are Apple and you are increasingly going to, you want to be the
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:11.240]   go-to place for any kind of media to pass through, then you're going to have to find
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.440]   some kind of a channel for that.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.200]   And you're not going to want stuff like I squint out there anymore.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:18.600]   You're going to want to say, "I'm the one-stop shopping for dealing with any piece of media
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:19.600]   that you have."
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:20.600]   Right.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.600]   Even if it happens to be an AVI.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.800]   And you don't need to worry about that because I'm going to take care of it and I'm going
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.720]   to put it on your iPod and I'm going to put it on your TV.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:29.040]   People may not do it, but I'm sure there'll be third-party solutions that interface.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.040]   You don't think-
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.960]   Well, maybe Apple will.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:37.560]   It's interesting that they're leaving this hole open for free podcast, video podcasts.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.720]   They sell AACs, but they let you put MP3s on.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:41.720]   Right.
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.560]   No, no, no, that's true.
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:47.240]   And really, Rocketboom is at parity with Desperate Housewives.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:50.200]   I mean, from your point of view, it looks the same.
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.200]   That's right.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.400]   I think it's very exciting.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:55.320]   And I think this is the beginning of the revolution.
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.680]   I'm a little worried.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.960]   I hate to see Apple own this outright.
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:04.560]   I hate to see any one company own an outright, but they've certainly earned the right to
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.560]   do it.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.560]   Nobody's doing anything close to its compelling.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:08.920]   Well, I still think this is going to-
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:12.360]   And I know I sound like a broken record here, but I really think that until people really
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:16.840]   start taking on building net apps and not depending on the web to sell their content,
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.280]   it is Apple has no close competition.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:22.360]   I mean, it's just never going to- I don't think it's ever going to work on the web.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.360]   You know, the interface is so-
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.360]   No, I agree with you.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.360]   You need a centric-
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.360]   That's what democracy is.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.360]   It's a centric-
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.360]   Democracy's done it again.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:35.200]   A centralized player that becomes the one place people go.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.280]   Boy, iTunes is so far ahead of the pack.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:38.280]   You're right.
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.280]   I don't see any competition.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:43.040]   And that's the big problem is everyone keeps on trying to- they think that they have the
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.040]   solution.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.080]   They think that just their size, which is enough to make it work and it's not.
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.080]   You know, and that-
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:50.040]   When you say they, you mean Microsoft, obviously.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:51.040]   Or Amazon.
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.040]   Or Goomba.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.040]   Or Yahoo.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:56.600]   You know, it's- I just don't think that's going to be enough to turn it over.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.680]   You know, and- because the quality of the experience is so-
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:03.400]   Well, and maybe it's key that you own hardware as well, isn't it?
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:04.800]   I think it makes it easier.
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:05.800]   You know, but-
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:06.800]   Because you know-
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.320]   Because there's more people using iTunes, there's more people using iTunes on a PC than
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:10.320]   Mac.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:14.140]   That's why I say, I mean, I see like- so to me, like the functionality of democracy that's
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:17.800]   really compelling is just, like I say, that way of saying almost like the way you would
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:22.280]   use like net newswire or news fire to kind of just point it out in an interesting area
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.600]   and say, "Watch this for me."
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.600]   Right?
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:27.680]   This whole area of notifications is something that I happen to be really interested in.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.240]   Now that's missing from iTunes.
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:30.240]   That's right.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.240]   I just-
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.240]   That's right.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:34.280]   Well, iTunes will go out and it'll watch your podcast that you're interested in for
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.280]   you.
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.480]   But I'm saying like to me, like again, they've got you at both ends here.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:42.840]   And if your iTunes was able to go out and monitor, like for example, let me just hypothetically,
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:46.560]   let's say I pointed at YouTube, a YouTube keyword search and it keeps an eye on that
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:47.560]   for me.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:48.560]   It just blows the FLV.
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.160]   It translates and I wake up in the morning and it's on my iPod.
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.160]   My kids would flip.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.160]   Well, yeah.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.640]   And I mean, to me, so they're either going to do that or they're going to seat it to
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:56.640]   somebody else.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:00.440]   Something like if I want to drop an AVI on to iTunes, it should say, or do you want me
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:03.680]   to turn this into a movie and put it on to your iPod?
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.920]   Is there any reason why Apple wouldn't do that?
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.880]   Quicktime Pro.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:09.720]   They want to sell you the $30 Quicktime Pro.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.560]   That's why they wouldn't do it.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.560]   That's crazy.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:13.560]   Okay, give it up.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:15.400]   Don't forget the $30 Apple.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:18.080]   Make this automatic.
[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.680]   Kind of does that with your music right now.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:20.680]   Right.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.680]   You put a CD in it says.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:22.680]   Right.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:25.560]   You just say set playback and it does all the heavy lifting.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:30.400]   Imagine if you could put your DVD into iTunes and say, put this on my iPod.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.400]   That is not going to happen.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:34.080]   I can tell you right now.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.080]   That's crazy.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.080]   This podcast is over.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.000]   I happen on my watch.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.720]   I'm channeling the MPAA.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:46.040]   One more story before we wrap it up and it actually has nothing to do with the big announcement.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.640]   I think it's important to say though, that it started going around the boards and the
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.440]   forums and the Quicksilver forums.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:53.120]   A couple of days ago somebody sent me an email.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:55.080]   I passed it along to Merlin.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:50:01.240]   Apparently, Quicksilver, which is a product, a free product that I love adore, promote.
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.600]   Merlin is the king of Quicksilver.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.880]   He's really done a great job on 43 folders of teaching people how to use it.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.600]   That's where I learned how.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:09.920]   But it was a little scary.
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.040]   People who are running Little Snitch, which is another fantastic application from Little
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:18.280]   App Factory that watches your computer, your Mac, contacting the net and kind of lets you
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.720]   know, hey, somebody's trying to contact the net.
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:24.120]   Little Snitch sat up and took notice.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.080]   Quicksilver was contacting.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.720]   It turns out a rogue Chinese website.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.960]   There was considerable concern about what it was doing, why it was doing it, and whether
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:37.760]   Alcor, the programmer behind Quicksilver, knew about it.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.720]   I sent a note to Merlin and you contacted Alcor.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:44.800]   Yeah, I mean, to me, this is, well, I mean, of course, I'm the John the Baptist to his,
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:48.160]   you know, big guy, so I'm probably the wrong person to ask.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.040]   But no, I think what--
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.440]   Who's salame in this picture?
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:51.960]   Just had a great answer.
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:52.960]   I think he has, yeah.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:53.960]   He has plenty of this.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:57.760]   But yeah, so basically what happened was the way I understand it is that there were some
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.800]   probably some permission issues on files on--
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.800]   He was hacked.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.560]   Well, yeah, that's putting it strongly.
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:09.920]   Yeah, some malicious code got into some files and that went out.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:13.200]   But I mean, so first of all, I think first, you know, the most important thing in the
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:17.800]   story to me is, yeah, run something like Little Snitch because that keeps everybody honest.
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:21.200]   You know, the first day you run Little Snitch, it's a total education.
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.680]   Did you-- have you found that in your experience?
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.520]   Yeah, well, it's like running any firewall.
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.520]   All of us-- but this just monitors outbound traffic.
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:27.520]   It really does.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.960]   But yeah, I mean, suddenly discovering, like, you know, you didn't realize how lightly
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.320]   your screen door was latched.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.320]   Oh, really?
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:34.320]   All these companies are dialing.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:37.280]   So basically, what happened to me, this is a great success story because then Alcor flipped
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:41.360]   it around pretty fast, tracked down the trouble, and I think hopefully a swaged people's fears.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:45.080]   It was kind of scary, though, it was going to some Chinese server and, you know, nobody
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.280]   was really sure what it was doing.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:49.960]   I said it in his note to you that it's all been fixed and you don't even have to update
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:50.960]   it's done.
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:51.960]   I mean, you don't have to worry about it.
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:52.960]   Just remember, kids, 755.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:53.960]   Do not leave your files.
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:54.960]   Not 775.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:55.960]   777.
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:52:02.440]   And I think that for a lot of Mac users, Little Snitch is a really-- just to get, you know,
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:06.240]   as a lesson is a really valuable little tool to see what's going on.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.240]   That's essential.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:12.640]   You'd be surprised how many apps call home, you know, how many apps are calling somewhere,
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.240]   you know, and doing all kinds of checks.
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:18.480]   And I think we actually-- one of the Mac break episodes, like two or three episodes ago,
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.200]   was on Little Snitch.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:24.720]   But it's a really, really great tool to make sure that you know what's going on when you're
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:25.720]   dealing with it.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:26.720]   And we-- yeah, yeah.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.880]   And for people who've never used it before, it's-- I mean, just so you know, it's not an
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.320]   all-or-nothing proposition.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:34.200]   You can say, for example, okay, the first time I launched this app, it wants to, you
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:35.200]   know, run off to this server.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:39.320]   And you can say, okay, well, that's okay at this server, or that's okay on this port,
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.240]   or that's okay just this one time.
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:44.200]   So you maintain complete control of how that communication works.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.200]   I have to apologize.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.600]   I said it was a little app factor.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:47.600]   It's not.
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.600]   It's Objective Development, the folks who do Launch Bar.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.600]   And Obdev.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:51.600]   They're great.
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.600]   I'm Dev.at.at.
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.600]   Obdev.at.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:58.760]   And it's 25 bucks, although you can run it free for a while in demo mode, three hours of
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:52:59.760]   free operation.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:04.080]   And that's not enough probably to get you to pony up the 25 bucks, frankly.
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:08.320]   And in this case, it's certainly earned its fee.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:09.320]   Great program.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:12.000]   So Leo, are you going to talk about the really important thing?
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   What was that?
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   I must have missed something.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   Well, sure.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   The shirt.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   The shirt?
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   Steve was wearing a shirt.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   No turtleneck.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.760]   But not-- is a button up shirt.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.440]   He looked-- he would button all the way to the top.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.520]   He looked like a Canadian for crying out loud.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.560]   What the heck is that all about?
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:28.800]   What is that, Auger?
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.000]   I mean, what can we gather from that?
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.120]   He changes his outfit from time to time.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.840]   It's a couple of every few years.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:36.360]   Do you think-- well, you know he thinks about it.
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.200]   Do you think he actually says, hmm, I'm going to throw--
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:39.200]   I think he totally thinks about it.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.200]   I'm going to throw them a curve.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.720]   I'm going to not use the turtleneck today.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:43.720]   I would hope so.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.920]   I think he's probably tired of all the turtleneck jokes.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:52.280]   And it's blue jeans, not black jeans, and a gray button down buttoned all the way up.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.280]   Sharp.
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.280]   That ain't right.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.840]   And that's-- I think he has a report for the last.
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.760]   Do you think he does-- I think his wife does that.
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:53:59.760]   I've met his wife.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.760]   It's a wonderful woman.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:07.920]   And I'm sure she has some-- Steve may be deciding what bit rate for the H.264.
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:12.040]   But I can tell you right now who's choosing his wardrobe.
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:15.120]   And Brooke's no discussion on the matter either.
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.520]   That about wraps it up.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.520]   We'll find out.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.320]   Maybe we'll get an email from Steve and I rate email.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:21.880]   You guys are all wrong.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:25.720]   I want to thank Brett Larson from Channel 2 for joining us.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:26.720]   Catch you, Brett, at--
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:27.720]   Thank you.
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:30.560]   --to the
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:31.560]   --it is Brett Larson.com.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.560]   It's just recently updated, too.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:33.560]   I updated it this week.
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:34.560]   Fabulous.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.560]   OK, last week.
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:36.560]   I'm using iWeb.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.560]   I really like--
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:38.560]   Oh, don't use iWeb.
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.560]   I know how to do--
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:41.200]   I know how to do HTML and all that stuff.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.200]   But iWeb's so simple.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.720]   Oh, but dude, you're locked into iWeb now forever.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.360]   No, I'll break into it.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.360]   Isn't that right, Merlin?
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:50.360]   You can never get out of iWeb once you start using it.
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.360]   I have never used it.
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.800]   It writes no HTML.
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:56.480]   It's like once you look at what you've done, you cannot go back.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.840]   It's like front page with--
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.000]   It's worse than front page.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   I've never used it in front.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.240]   I think that if you want-- you know, if you just want to throw something up there and
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.640]   get it up there, it's easy.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:07.640]   Oh, it's great for that.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:10.640]   But for anybody who wants-- yeah, you're not going to do any site development on it.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:11.640]   Well, you're locked in.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:12.640]   But I think that--
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:13.640]   I do think that for some--
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:14.640]   I'm not developing some--
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:15.640]   --throwing quick stuff up.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:17.640]   --giant site.
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:21.320]   The thing I like about it is it's-- for the video stuff that I throw up, it's really easy
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:23.040]   to just keep that page updated constantly.
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.120]   Yeah, I think it's a good idea.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.120]   It's great for blogging and podcasting.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:26.760]   In that instance, it's pretty easy.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.760]   But for everything else, I'll admit it's very--
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:29.760]   I just--
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:32.120]   We'll get you a Pearl scraper if you need one later on.
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:33.120]   You might need one.
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:34.680]   We might need to write some code for you.
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.640]   MerlinMan43folders.com.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.560]   What do you use for your back end?
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:41.760]   Well, thank you not to discuss my back end.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:42.760]   It's copious.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:43.760]   I use the--
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:44.760]   I use the--
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:45.760]   I use the--
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:46.760]   There goes the--
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:47.760]   There goes the--
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:51.160]   There goes the clean tag.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.480]   I use WordPress.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:57.480]   And about, I think, 789, 190 plugins.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:00.040]   And it's terrific application.
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:01.920]   And yeah, so I use that.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:06.200]   WP cache, great with the heavy loads.
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.200]   It's a really great platform.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:08.520]   There's a lot of really great stuff happening in WordPress.
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:10.160]   I see so many good things in WordPress.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.560]   I think maybe we should do a WordPress Tumba log.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:15.920]   I mean, like, you look at things like WordPress and Drupal right now.
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:20.480]   And boy, if you haven't touched an open source CMS since today's a PHP Nuke, it's time
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.480]   to give it another try.
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.480]   I think we're going to do another try.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.360]   Alex Lindsey is with Pixel Core.
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:26.400]   And of course, Pixel Core.com is a place to go for that.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.080]   I won't ask him about his back end.
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:32.600]   And Chris Breen is part of the iLifeZone, iLifeZone.com.
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:36.640]   And you'll see his Mac 911 column in every issue of Macworld Magazine.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.240]   Don't worry.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:39.240]   It's good to have you all.
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.240]   This is fun.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.240]   We're going to do this-- start doing this on Tuesdays from now on.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:49.120]   So expect a Wednesday release date for Macbreak Weekly, if I have anything to do with it.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.360]   And Scott Bourn will be back.
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:53.560]   He sent me an email saying, "Dudes, I wanted to be on."
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:54.560]   My apologies.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:57.320]   I just screwed up the scheduling, but I've told Scott to be here Tuesday and he'll be
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:00.040]   here from now on.
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.400]   Anything else we need to cover?
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.840]   By the way, thank you for Dino-Matic.
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:07.720]   My wife, Merlin, my wife says it's just what we needed.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:09.920]   So it's not going to lead to the downfall of society's money?
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.840]   No, I guess I was completely wrong.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:15.240]   Well, I appreciate you saying so.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:16.880]   She just likes the sounds.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.800]   The sound, I know, I do.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.640]   And on that note, we will say good night to you.
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:22.560]   We'll see you next week on Macbreak Weekly.
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:50.200]   Steve Jobs said it had something called Ma-Yong.
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:51.200]   Ma-Yong.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.120]   He was trying to say Ma-jong.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:56.800]   I never heard it pronounced Ma-jong.
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:57.800]   Why do you call it Ma-jong?
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.000]   I don't think he's much of a game player.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:07.280]   I thought maybe he was doing some snobby, like, "Oh, well, it's really pronounced Ma-jong."
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.440]   He had no clue.
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:09.920]   He just did Ma-jong.
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:12.600]   He had no clue.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.320]   Is that what you were there, Chris?
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:15.520]   How did he say it was like that?
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:16.520]   Ma-jong.
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:17.520]   Yeah, it was Ma-jong.
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:22.360]   And I was raised playing Ma-jong.
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:24.320]   And so I was a little offended.
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:29.160]   Well, actually, in Indonesia, it's pronounced in Sumatra, they say Ma-jong.
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:31.960]   No, Abby, he's lost the entire Florida audience.
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:34.080]   And women are 16 over.
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:35.080]   You mean Ma-jong?
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:36.880]   Oh, he plays Ma-jong.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.840]   He plays Ma-jong.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:41.640]   Finally, a reason to buy an iPod.
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.640]   Oh, we're all going to buy it.
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:47.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:49.800]   (upbeat music)
