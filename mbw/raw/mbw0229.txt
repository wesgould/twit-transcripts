[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.800]   Crazy, but joining us in studio, of course, the great
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.400]   Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.480]   It's good to see you, Alex.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.160]   Good to be here.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.400]   You've been here since 7.30 AM.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.880]   Yes.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.000]   We'll talk about why in just a bit.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.280]   Andy Inaco is in his hotel room in New York City.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.080]   Good to see you, Andy.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.160]   Always a place.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.200]   And we have a new person on the panel, Mr. Tom Anderson
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.400]   from Quaketronics.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.920]   Hello.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.600]   Good to see you.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.080]   Good to see you.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.920]   Tell me about Quaketronics.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.080]   Well, it's a small electronics company, really an
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.440]   electronics boutique.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.720]   And we had a few products out.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.080]   We're on somewhat of a hiatus from our manufacturing.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.720]   But it's my garage.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.080]   I like it.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.000]   He's a garage entrepreneur and a longtime Apple user,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.800]   obviously.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.480]   Yes, I am.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.880]   We'll get to the news.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.560]   And there was a little bit of news this morning.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.400]   Just a little.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.600]   And we actually have a great clip of video, which we're
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.600]   going to show in just a moment of Andy Inaco.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.040]   You were at the Verizon event this morning.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.560]   Yep.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.400]   And you could tell that it was hosted by Verizon on not Apple
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.080]   because they kind it perfectly so that we can talk about it
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.000]   on Macbreak immediately afterward.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.080]   Had it been Apple, they'd be doing it right about now.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.600]   Exactly.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.440]   Well, we don't have video of the announcement because they
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.200]   did not stream it.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.760]   And as far as I know, they still have to put it online,
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.040]   although by the time this comes out, who knows?
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.520]   But Andy was there, so I'm going to get your impressions.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.280]   But before we do that, we have some video
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.360]   we're going to roll in of Andy demonstrating the Verizon
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.360]   iPhone.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.840]   And we'll be getting that in a second.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.000]   Thank you for doing that, Andy.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.400]   Just part of my job, man, I'm on the sheriff of intellectual
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.920]   property.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.680]   I'm just going to get to get any pushback from anybody.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.080]   Because you were using Skype.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.360]   So you obviously were--
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.720]   Because there's a principle that my parents told me about
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.480]   called the right time and the right place.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.240]   So it was just at a demo station.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.240]   Obviously, the units were there to be shown off.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.040]   And of course, I was pulling up to make sure that everybody
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.400]   who talked to me knew that we were streaming live.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.640]   So we got to know if it was--
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.400]   And they didn't say, oh, turn that camera off or anything.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.000]   No, but if anything, they complimented me on my clever
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.400]   suction cup mount iPhone camera.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.000]   What were you suctioning company--
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.200]   What was it that you're--
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.720]   Was it a tattoo?
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.280]   Was it a tattoo for your head?
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.960]   You know, unfortunately, I leap off the top of my family.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.760]   For ages of age six, too many pivots in my head,
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.320]   make a suction cup mount stick to that surface.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.120]   No, in general, I find that usually whatever table they
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.880]   use is going to be porous enough that it'll stick well.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.400]   If not, at least it's a wide rubberized--
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   Oh, that's clear.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.720]   I can't kick it out pretty much.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.080]   And as I said, right now, I can just
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.800]   simply stick it to a window and get lighting and support.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.520]   So you come in the door and you plop your suction cup down.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.680]   I've never heard of referred to as a suction cup.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.040]   And you say, ah, I'm in the house.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.120]   Let's get going with this thing.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.400]   You ask quite politely, is it OK if I shoot some video?
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.800]   Hey, Seidenberg, I want to shoot some video.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.560]   Well, actually, Seidenberg wasn't there.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.960]   The CEO of Verizon, it was the CEO of Verizon Wireless.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.040]   And Dapper Dan, we'll talk about the event
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.560]   and we'll show you a little bit of the Verizon iPhone.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.800]   I guess I should say in case you're just tuning in.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.320]   Maybe you were asleep.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.120]   Yes, there is a Verizon iPhone.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.560]   Yes, it is on Verizon.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.680]   Yes, it's an iPhone 4 with a CDMA chip.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.920]   There is no GSM.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.160]   There is no 4G.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.600]   There's tethering.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.240]   And a hotspot.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.360]   Hot spot, hot spot.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.680]   And the antenna has been moved but not improved.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.600]   And that's pretty much the story, same prices.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.720]   Sounded by missing a slightly different place, we think.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.240]   Oh, really?
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.760]   Yeah, so it looks like they're large and make new cases.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.360]   We'll talk about all that in just a moment.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.960]   I do want to welcome a brand new sponsor to the show.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.960]   A company I actually have used for a long time.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.720]   Before I had people, I had fresh books.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.720]   When I was doing it myself, when I was doing my own invoicing,
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.920]   I needed help.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.160]   So now I have literally a staff of several people
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.120]   doing the invoicing, the Frederic and Lisa.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.400]   And we have a CPA.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.040]   But when I first started Twit, it was all up to me.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.920]   And for the first few years, I used fresh books
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.840]   for all my invoicing.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.240]   It looks really fresh books account.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.920]   It's fantastic.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.240]   Yeah, it's gotten better and better.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.960]   It's the easy online invoicing service
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.920]   that helps you keep track of what your own gets you paid
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.600]   quickly.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.520]   Clients love it.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.280]   And you'll love it too.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.920]   If you're a small business owner, a consultant,
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.520]   or a freelancer, it's just the right choice for you.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.160]   You know, the thing about invoicing in general
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.480]   that I've learned since I started my little company
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.920]   is that it's all about cash flow.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.920]   It's all about making sure that's the--
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.920]   That's really good.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.560]   It's not about how much you make.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.440]   It's about when you make it.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.080]   It's about getting the money in the door.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.520]   And having something that's automated,
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.680]   that's going to sort that stuff out,
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.600]   that's going to keep track of it is gold.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.040]   Well, if you go to freshbooks.com,
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.120]   you'll see what we're talking about.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.800]   It was one of the first really web 2.0 sites that I saw.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.000]   I mean, it's just-- it's really pretty, you know?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.920]   And very easy to use.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.480]   You get your logo on your invoices.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.960]   They've got 2 million users.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.240]   There's got to be doing something, right?
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.800]   You can upload your logo.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.520]   Your clients can download a PDF.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.840]   Some clients like getting the invoices via email.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.480]   Some clients, like having a digital version,
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.400]   they can-- and some like printed versions.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.800]   They actually will send them printed invoices as well.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.760]   You receive payments for invoices via PayPal and 11 other
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.960]   electronic payment services.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.280]   They can even use their credit card.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.040]   Of course, they can send you a check if they want to do that.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.040]   There are automated late payment reminders
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.440]   that help with those slow pays.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.960]   If you invoice by the hour, there's
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.040]   a built-in time tracking feature.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.880]   So you can log your hours.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.800]   And I really-- you know, it's funny,
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.600]   because I started using this probably five years ago,
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.240]   when people still wanted paper invoices.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.640]   It was really nice that I could print and mail and--
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.960]   do the invoice online at freshbooks.com,
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.120]   but then have it printed and sent to them,
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.520]   and even with a return envelope, which is awfully nice.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.800]   There's an iPhone app, too, to track your time
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.840]   and invoice your customers when you're away from the office.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.680]   Since 2004, I've been using FreshBooks,
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.840]   and you ought to, too.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.800]   Freshbooks.com.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.560]   You could try it free today for up to three clients.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.600]   For a lot of us, I mean, when I use FreshBooks,
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.920]   I had two clients.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.600]   So this would be free.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.120]   It takes about a minute to set up an account.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.600]   And when they ask you how you heard about FreshBooks,
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.880]   enter the code, and our code is Macbreak.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.480]   Macbreak.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.200]   So that way you'll get it free, and we'll get the credit.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.720]   In fact, every day, get this.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.320]   FreshBooks is giving away a birthday cake to one of you,
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.320]   our listeners.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.320]   Nice.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.520]   Don't get your birthday cake.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.040]   If it doesn't--
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.040]   If it doesn't--
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.840]   If it doesn't, you get an invoice,
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.480]   you get a birthday cake.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.840]   It doesn't have to be your birthday, by the way.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.080]   Every day for the entire month, they're
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.800]   going to draw a name out of the new people who sign up.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.120]   And it will not come with a return envelope.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.760]   And they'll send you a birthday cake.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.080]   And they're going to mail it to you.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:44.560]   That's awesome.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.360]   Isn't that the greatest thing?
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.920]   I think it's the first time any of our advertisers have done that.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.200]   But I love it.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.120]   FreshBooks.com.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.200]   Look, I have been using it for six years.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.680]   When I didn't have people, I had FreshBooks,
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.640]   and it was every bit as good as people.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.840]   Definitely as you're getting started,
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.000]   this is such an important piece of your business.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.960]   The more you do it, the more important you'll get.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.280]   And you really want something handling it, not you.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.760]   FreshBooks.com.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.360]   Enter the show code MACBreak when you sign up.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.760]   We thank them.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.520]   A brand new sponsor on MACBreak.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:13.840]   I love it.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.920]   It's very MAC-ish.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.760]   Yes.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.080]   And the iPhone app makes it even more MAC-ish.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.360]   So let's roll in, Andy and Aco.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:21.920]   You got there.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.520]   How early in the day did you get there for this event?
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.920]   I'm not terribly early.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.320]   The event was an 11 registration start.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.480]   At 10, I hit there around 10, 20.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.600]   Early enough to get the mini muffins and the complimentary
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.120]   waters.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.520]   That's all I care about.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.240]   Was it front like an Apple event?
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.360]   I mean, did it remind you of an Apple event?
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.680]   Very, very much so.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.360]   It was like a press only event.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.600]   There were probably about 100, 120 people there.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.640]   All press and analysts.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.400]   They had one of the jazz halls at the--
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.800]   the next center has a jazz hall at the Club of Circle.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.720]   I believe it was also-- the demo area was also
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.880]   where they filmed the Ellen Show, which
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.360]   was in New York a couple of weeks ago.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.040]   I knew I recognized it from somewhere.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.680]   But that's where it was from.
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.640]   Did you do a little dancing in your sneakers?
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.760]   Not quite.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.280]   It provoked me to want to sit rigorously in a chair
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.440]   and hope to go on the host does not see you or pick
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.840]   up to do anything.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.520]   But it was very much a very by the numbers sort of event.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.880]   I think that they really wanted to get in, get their statements
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.080]   out, get photo ops in there, and then get out again.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.880]   The only difference is the only big difference
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.280]   is that you sort of appreciate some of the finer details
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.160]   that Apple puts into their keynotes.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.960]   For instance, it may be remember why Apple always
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.240]   makes sure that when they do the keynote presentation
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.600]   and there's that big screen behind the speaker,
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.200]   it's always black with some white text on it.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.080]   Because the Verizon one was a big white background
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.480]   with the Verizon logo on it, which
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.040]   was dazzling everybody's image sensors, and forcing it.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.440]   So basically, everybody in the room
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.560]   had a choice between either expose
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.600]   and getting a good shot of a person speaking
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.280]   or get a good shot of a logo, and you could not get both of them
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.960]   and the logo always blocked out.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.080]   That's a stumble.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.640]   That shows that somebody does it.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.520]   It's not a stumble.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.560]   It's one of those details that all you go like this
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.640]   after the fact, you realize, OK, that's a--
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.320]   It shows that they don't do this enough, exactly.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.160]   But it shows.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.640]   But I think it just reminded me, as I was
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.880]   suddenly if my camera setting is trying
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.560]   to figure out how many stops do over exposure.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.480]   You don't have a white background on the stage.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.480]   Apple always thinks these things, right?
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.800]   What surprised me was that they must have--
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.280]   I was talking to the guys earlier about how John Oliver,
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.400]   the Daily Show, he was there.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.720]   And he apparently is doing a bit on the iPhone announcement.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.240]   You'll see it tonight.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.920]   You'll see it tonight, five minutes before--
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.720]   but still, like five minutes to 11,
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.520]   we're all just still making sure that our Twitter feeds
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.880]   and stuff are working.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.960]   And suddenly, I hear from the middle of the room,
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.920]   someone jump up and shout at the top of his voice, F--
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.640]   Yeah!
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.440]   And my first thought was, OK, I saw the mini muffins
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.200]   in the free water.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.000]   I didn't see the open bar.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.920]   Did I not-- did I miss something?
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.920]   Because--
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.840]   It is the corner.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.480]   And it was John Oliver who said that.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.720]   And then demonstrating why I have a big fan of this
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.720]   and why I would not want his job for a million dollars.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.360]   Something apparently technically went wrong.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.680]   So we had to do it again a few minutes later.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.680]   Oh.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.880]   Take two, John.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.320]   Can you get up and annoy everybody one more time?
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.280]   Exactly.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.800]   He proved to me that the guy that I
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.360]   know from the "Bubble Podcast" is the real guy.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.200]   Because the last time I saw him, he was like,
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.880]   trying to make himself look as small as possible in that chair.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.480]   I hope I don't--
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.440]   No, you're not going to make me do it again, are you?
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.800]   You're not going to make me jump up and swear again.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.640]   Oh, cool.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.040]   I'm fundamentally a very nice person.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.800]   We're in reserve for the meat of other people.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.480]   Let us-- or maybe somebody's saying they
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.160]   need coverage for another angle.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.320]   Maybe the crowd reaction to him saying, F, yeah.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.200]   So Andy saw that we'll talk a little bit about that in a moment.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.040]   But really, what everybody cares about is the phone itself.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.200]   There's not a whole lot new in the phone.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.200]   It is, as I said, it is EVDO, not 4G.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.640]   It is not LTE.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.840]   It is not GSM.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.120]   I thought maybe I was hoping they might use the Qualcomm chipset
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.160]   and have both GSM and CDMA in the same phone.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.720]   That would have been a cool thing.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.840]   But no, they'll be making a different unit for Verizon
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.280]   and AT&T.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.400]   AT&T still has the phone.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.840]   Verizon has a contract, they wouldn't say,
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.840]   for how long to sell the phone.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.360]   And it will have only one feature that
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.320]   seems superior to that of AT&T and has the ability
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.480]   to do a mobile hotspot of up to five users.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.440]   And we don't know.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.440]   They say we will not announce pricing yet.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.200]   The phone will be--
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.200]   And they're very, very careful.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.400]   Stay away from any kind of data plan discussions.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.800]   Yeah, which is interesting.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.600]   It sounds like they're still thinking about it.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.040]   That doesn't bode well for us.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.360]   Well, I had a head to around that
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.200]   because there were Verizon personnel, not just
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.040]   the people in golfers.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.480]   I'm talking about people in very expensive suits
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.200]   who were talking to me about price plans.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.800]   And unfortunately, because I could not verify this
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.080]   with other people, I held back on that or dodged around it.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.280]   So I don't know if they just passed something in mind
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.680]   that they can't talk about it yet.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.680]   But clearly, the COO and the CEO of Verizon Wireless
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.160]   is the person that you would believe on that.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.120]   Well, now that you've given us that caveat, what did they say?
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.200]   Basically, the takeaway was that he felt as though the exact same
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.200]   data pricing plans were going to be available for the iPhone
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.000]   4 as were available on all others.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.520]   This was also part of the conversation
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.640]   in which I was trying to get out of them.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.800]   Is there going to be the unlimited plan available?
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.720]   And he said, yes.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.480]   And I asked him a question two or three times to make sure
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.880]   we both understood it.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.400]   And he said, no, no, it's going to be the standard plan
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.080]   that we've got on all other phones.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.840]   And he named the price a bit.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.320]   I'm sure I'll get it wrong, so I try to remember it up the top
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.120]   of my head.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.680]   And so that's something that I flagged at, OK,
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.120]   follow up on that later.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.760]   So I'm not sure if any of that is actually true or whether
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.160]   this person was just trying to answer your question.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.080]   No idea if it's unlimited, unlimited, or five gigabytes,
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.600]   unlimited--
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.600]   He said it was unlimited, unlimited.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.520]   So if he had the speed dope, I haven't
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.720]   named him, I don't want to repeat it.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.920]   It'd be my guess that he knew and didn't know
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.760]   that it was embargoed, to be honest with you.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.880]   And that's good news.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.880]   That's low up less positive.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.080]   And it's kind of--
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.480]   you know what?
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.200]   It's credible because there's a lot of AT&T iPhone users,
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.080]   like you, Alex, who are grandfathered into that
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.320]   unlimited, unlimited plan.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:32.720]   Who wouldn't--
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.680]   And we hang on to that.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.960]   That's very valuable.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.640]   So if they're going to get people to move from AT&T,
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.080]   they need to be offering them that.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.800]   You also have to recognize, though,
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.040]   that the CDMA limitation of, you can't have voice-on data
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.320]   at the same time, that's going to affect anybody who's
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.840]   using that wireless hotspot feature.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.960]   Because it's not a problem for me,
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.760]   because one of the reasons why I have a computer is so
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.400]   that people will not be phone-made for coming.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.840]   But that means that during the hour, you're
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.080]   spending getting your email or watching a video or whatever.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.080]   That's an hour, which nobody can call you.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.360]   It'll be very--
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.720]   well, I wonder, will it reject calls
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.320]   or will it knock you offline and take the call?
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.040]   They said that there was a question from a crowd afterward.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.600]   And they answered the saying that the experience would
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.040]   be the same as what you get on any other Verizon phone.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.720]   So I assume that if a call comes in,
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.440]   it gives you the option to be their second, that call,
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.400]   and turning off the data, or simply ignoring
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.400]   and sending to voicemail.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.640]   So you'll have the choice.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.080]   I mean, the big deal is that this would be a big deal.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.320]   If Apple was terminating their agreement with AT&T,
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.040]   now Verizon is going to be the sole character.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.120]   But the idea is that you do get a choice between,
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.080]   would you rather have this network under these conditions,
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.000]   or would you either have this network on the same other
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:38.400]   conditions.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.360]   So that's fine.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.160]   Before we get to your show and tell,
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.400]   anything else people ought to know?
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.800]   It's a same price point as AT&T for the phone itself.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.280]   Pre-orders are February 3rd, but you
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.600]   won't be able to get one in a store until February 10th.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.120]   Apple stores will stock them, as well as AT&T stores.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.680]   That's February 3rd for existing Verizon customers.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.240]   Verizon customers will get a weak head start on everybody else.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.600]   Oh, you can't pre-order unless you're an existing customer.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.520]   Well, on February 3rd, you can be
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.280]   dependent on pre-order if you're an existing Verizon customer.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.160]   Everybody else can start pre-ordering it
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:12.960]   on February 10th.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.320]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.720]   That's a little thank you for people who are existing subscribers.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.000]   Oh, I happen to have a Verizon account somewhere lying around.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.800]   But there's an interesting question.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.400]   Is there any compelling reason to move to Verizon,
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.240]   unless you have lousy AT&T service?
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.520]   And in fact, I think even if you're in San Francisco
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.880]   where it's notoriously bad, you might want to wait and see
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.360]   because maybe enough people move to Verizon.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.000]   I think that the argument is if you're
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.720]   in the middle of a contract with AT&T,
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.320]   and a lot of us who have got iPhone 4s
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.760]   are probably in the middle of some--
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.880]   in the beginning of a contract, I think
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.080]   there's a real wait and see there.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.840]   I think if you've been waiting for a long time
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.520]   and you don't care about having the newest version,
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.160]   because I think the issue is I think they are going
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.000]   to rev it this summer.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.600]   So I think that if you're buying one now,
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.360]   you're buying two years into a Verizon phone
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.480]   that you may want to replace in six months.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.840]   But let's not forget there's a pent up demand.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.960]   I think there are probably a significant number of people
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.080]   on Verizon who didn't buy iPhones.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.800]   And also don't care that the iPhone 5 is going to come out
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.640]   probably the same.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.840]   That's the other issues.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.800]   And that's why Steve Jobs wasn't at this event,
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.600]   is that in three months or four months,
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.160]   they're going to announce an iPhone 5.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.040]   We would assume.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.520]   And that'll be on Verizon, I would assume also.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.640]   I think this summer we're going to see an iPad,
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.080]   an iPad, and a Verizon, and a new iPhone.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.280]   And they will be, by the way, they intimated,
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.880]   there will be Verizon iPads as well.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:32.360]   There aren't.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.320]   No announcement yet.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.760]   That was part of it.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.040]   There are a couple of recurring themes.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:44.760]   And everyone from both Verizon and Apple hammered home
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.760]   that this is a multi-year ambitious partnership that
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.880]   would-- it was implied, spread way beyond just simply
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.680]   having the iPhone.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.160]   So obviously nothing was announced.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.720]   But anybody who thinks that the iPad will not
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.600]   be coming to Verizon any time, that's
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.560]   a good chink in that argument.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.480]   And it actually made me think about their products and services
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.960]   that they could push through Verizon
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.640]   if they're getting this level of health.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.320]   But remember that this is the whole reason why you bring three
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.600]   very, very top level company officers into a room with 100
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:16.960]   analysts.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.320]   You want to have those statements coming back
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:25.040]   to the analogy of when a NASCAR driver switches to a routine,
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.440]   they have to be that photo op or they thank sponsors
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.920]   and how exciting this is and how they're
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.760]   going to do great work together.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.480]   So we'll see how much this actually pays off.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.440]   But it's interesting to have a bi-camera legislature,
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.600]   so to speak, for networks.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.960]   I mean, if Apple will be able to certainly say,
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.760]   we've got this great idea for multi-homing video
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.440]   conferencing, however it needs some support on the carrier side,
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.840]   does that mean that they can simply
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.600]   tell both of these characters as well if you
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.880]   have to add to your network?
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.520]   Or will they simply say, guys, if you
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.760]   want to be the one network that doesn't support this great
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.880]   feature that we're going to be at three times an hour
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.520]   during all of these things, then be my death.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.200]   But we think you're going to want to add this feature to your network.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.880]   Francis Shamo, who's CFO of Verizon Communications,
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:14.000]   told Bloomberg that there will be a native Verizon iPad,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.640]   an iPad from Verizon with a 3G chip in it.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.840]   So that is going to be--
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.120]   CDM 8 chip.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.360]   No, well, no EVDO chip.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.920]   They won't CDM 8s for the full voice.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.920]   So it'll be a 3G chip.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.240]   I would imagine an iPhone 5 on Verizon
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.400]   would be an LTE, would be a fourth generation network iPhone 5.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.560]   And I guess on AT&T--
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.040]   unless AT&T--
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.960]   I mean, all they have is HSPA+.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.760]   Well, they probably want them to start and not have everybody
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.920]   jump on LTE at once.
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.960]   That's all the unknowns about the demand it's going to cause.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.680]   And with 93 million customers, Verizon is probably also
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.520]   going to be a great gateway to more Apple products
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.280]   as people pick up the iPhone for the first time.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.560]   That's who really benefits here is as Apple.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.520]   I mean, it's just another channel.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:12.760]   And the analysts are saying 7 to 10 million Verizon iPhones
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.960]   will be sold in the first year.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.920]   And that's 7 to 10 million more phones
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.080]   that they wouldn't have sold otherwise.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.160]   I don't think it'll do well.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.920]   Here's an interesting question.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.880]   Do you think it will cut into sales at AT&T?
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.040]   Or will they continue?
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.480]   I think it'll absolutely cut into--
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.320]   I don't think they're going to see a lot of people
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.360]   jumping ship from AT&T to Verizon.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.800]   But new iPhone users.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.520]   But I think new iPhone users, I think a lot of them.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.160]   I think that the big decision they have to make
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.120]   is do they want to be able to use the data and the voice
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:38.960]   at the same time?
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.400]   If they do, then they're going to still pick AT&T.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.200]   If they don't care and they want to have great phone calls,
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.440]   then they're going to go to Verizon.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.360]   I'll tell you what I'm waiting for.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.640]   That's where it comes down to.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.120]   I want somebody--
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.200]   I'm not going to buy it right away.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.640]   I want to hear how it works on the Verizon network.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.320]   Does it drop calls on the Verizon network?
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.080]   Oh, I have a piece in the Sun Times, obviously.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.160]   Just from now, it's only about 90 minutes old.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.040]   And unfortunately, I had to come down and simply say
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.240]   that we don't know really what we can say about this
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.240]   until we get lots of these in the field
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.520]   that we can do real world tests on how it deals with calls.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:12.720]   But the throughput is--
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.240]   I did see one person successfully download
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.440]   a speedtest.net app to the Verizon iPhone
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.520]   and do some speed tests between the iPhone
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.360]   between the AT&T and the Verizon phone.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.160]   I'm not sure if that's a valid test
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.400]   because we don't know what trucks, fries, and might have set up
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.160]   outside of calling the circle in some alleyway
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.160]   just to make sure that all the people can get coverage.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.960]   I mean, it's not that they would be cheating or anything,
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.200]   but you just never know what kind of environment you're in.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.120]   It's only when there's--
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.120]   Never know.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.200]   It's only when there's the first quarter million of these
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.080]   out there, and we can get a good broad spectrum of what kind
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.160]   of speed people are getting and what kind of reliability
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.160]   are getting.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.120]   I would predict if I've had enough AT&T phones and Verizon
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.120]   phones come through my office to suspect that the difference
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.680]   will be that on the AT&T iPhone, the highest speed
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.120]   you will be able to get will be faster than the highest
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.120]   speed you can get on the Verizon phone.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.520]   However, you'll find fewer places when you can't use the Verizon
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.400]   phone because of the coverage.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.960]   That was a critical, very important statement
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.880]   I want to repeat because that's exactly how it needs
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.680]   to be phrased.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.640]   The theoretical maximums are better on AT&T than Verizon.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.600]   But your mileage will totally depend on where you are
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.960]   geographically and what kind of network coverage
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.680]   the either company has.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.520]   It's totally--
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.320]   And this is why--
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.960]   It's like having a Ferrari in a traffic--
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.460]   Yeah.
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.880]   And it doesn't do you any good.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.640]   And in fact, it might not even--
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.880]   it will vary not merely geographically, but by conditions.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.480]   So we were unable to use 3G on an iPhone at CES
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.920]   because everybody at CES had an iPhone using 3G.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.600]   Am I my phone?
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.480]   Is that an AT&T problem or just the fact
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.680]   that you've got 160,000 iPhone users all jammed in one area?
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.560]   Well, here's the question, though,
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.960]   is that when people start dropping calls on Verizon,
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.880]   will Apple blame-- will people say, well, Verizon wasn't
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.560]   really ready for it?
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.320]   Or will people start going, well, the iPhone maybe--
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.360]   It's such muddy waters.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.320]   There's so many variables.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.080]   But I have to say, that's what I'm waiting on.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.880]   Would I jump just to Verizon?
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.600]   Because it's Verizon?
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.720]   No.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.360]   But if there is evidence that the iPhone works
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.880]   better for phone calls, that's the only issue, really,
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.240]   in my mind.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.560]   The solution, though, is the Picocells and--
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.280]   I'm not buying a FEMTO cell.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.480]   I'm not buying a FEMTO cell to give AT&T better service.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.600]   And I'd like to say, I have one.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.080]   I bought one.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.480]   They'll set them up.
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.280]   You pay for it, and it's using your bandwidth.
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.160]   Malay, I have a microcell in the office.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.160]   So I have the AT--
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.080]   Because you have to.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.720]   We spend $150 on it.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.240]   And it is crap.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.080]   It is not usable.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.400]   So what happens is you get full bars,
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.400]   and you answer the phone, and you talk for 30 seconds,
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.400]   and then you hear this--
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.360]   and then you're gone.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.080]   And it happens within two minutes.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.240]   We lose every single microcell crawl.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.080]   And it's ugly.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.760]   You know, it's like this ugly dropout.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.320]   And we paid $150 for it.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.960]   And yes, I am bitter.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.880]   Now, I got to say, people are saying,
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.280]   is this iPhone today or Mac break weekly?
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.440]   Well, certainly, we are going to talk about the Mac
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.000]   because there was another big development
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.560]   of the Mac during CES.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.680]   On January 6, the App Store came out.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.560]   And we'll talk about it.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.560]   I've got some reviews and some thoughts,
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.120]   and I know you all do.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.200]   But I want to get to Andy's hands-on on the Verizon iPhone.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.640]   We're going to cover this a little bit more.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.720]   It is, hey, there's no doubt it's the big story.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.600]   In fact, had this broken at CES--
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.320]   and I think this is why Apple and Verizon declined to do so--
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.280]   it would have been the big story at CES--
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.160]   over all others.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.040]   This is a big story.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.880]   We've been waiting for this phone for a long time.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.760]   But we, yes, there is a little bit of Mac news.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.960]   And we're going to get to that in just a little bit.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:51.680]   Before we get to Andy's hands-on with the iPhone from Verizon,
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.160]   I do want to talk a little bit about our friends at Gazelle.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.360]   This is when they make their big bucks.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.080]   This is when they justify their existence.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.480]   There's a new phone out.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.720]   What do I do with the old phone?
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.720]   You don't sell it.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.360]   You gazelle it.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.400]   You have an iPhone 4.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:09.040]   You can probably get most, if not all, of the $200
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.880]   that you'll be spending on that new iPhone back
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.720]   by bringing your iPhone to gazelle.com.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.920]   Of course, this is a very cool site.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.440]   The way Gazelle works--
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.240]   go there right now, gazelle, g-a-z-e-l-l-e.com.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.360]   You enter in your gadget-- and by the way, 20 categories,
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.320]   200,000 unique items.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.160]   Most of the gadgets out there are available.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.520]   If you go to gazelle.com right now,
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.280]   it'll tell you what they'll pay for.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.360]   You tell it what conditions and what parts you have
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.360]   and all that stuff.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.760]   Based on that, they'll give you an estimate
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.400]   of what it's worth.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.560]   You get a box.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.640]   You throw all your junk in the box.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.400]   They send you a mailing label so you don't pay for shipment.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.640]   And then you send that box to gazelle.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.600]   Their experts look at it.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.680]   They wipe all the data.
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.600]   You don't even have to wipe the data from your old phone.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.120]   They'll do that for you.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.520]   And then they'll confirm their estimate.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.240]   In some cases, by the way, it goes up.
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.520]   I've received email from a number of people
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:12.720]   who say they actually have received more money
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.120]   than the original estimate, which I think is really great,
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.640]   really cool.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.920]   In some cases, it'll go up.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.480]   Oh, I guess you have to have Snow Leopard to get the new Mac App
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.040]   store, don't you?
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:24.960]   Which I have.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.840]   That sucks.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.560]   I don't have Snow Leopard.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.120]   We can't for compatibility reasons run Snow Leopard
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.160]   on either one of these machines.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.400]   I was just trying to get--
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.040]   because I wanted to-- I bought some stuff.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.000]   I wanted to show you some stuff.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.800]   Oh, man.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.800]   Including my pick of the week.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.560]   Oh, man, sorry.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.560]   I didn't mean to interrupt you, gazelle.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.120]   Sorry.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.040]   Gazelle.com.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.720]   Now, if you go there, you get the estimate.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.640]   By the way, they show you a graph of the value of the--
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.440]   I think I'm curious what the value of an iPhone is.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.080]   I was just trying to get to that right now.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:53.880]   I was looking for it.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.320]   A lot of people going to gazelle right now, since.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.120]   Most of the time, when the new iPhone comes out,
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.680]   Gazelle will give you close to the $200.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.240]   But you'll see the graph, and it'll be going down quickly.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.840]   So don't waste any time.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.280]   And here's a way to get a little extra money.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.440]   If you use the offer code MAC break on checkout,
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.320]   they'll give you 5% bonus over and above.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:13.800]   Are you--
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.400]   Someone on the forum says 345?
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.880]   No.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.840]   Wow.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.320]   Which is your-- by the way, that would be-- if that's true,
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.480]   I'm not sure if that's actually-- oh, someone's at 430 now.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.920]   Anyway, so let's try it with my name.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.720]   But if that's true, that means that would
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:31.280]   cover your AT&T penumbly cost.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.280]   And a lot of your iPhone 4, if you wanted to go to Verizon,
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.160]   you could just trade it--
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.360]   It does depend, as you can see, as I--
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.560]   Oh, it's 345 for a 16 gig.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.880]   Leo, I'm not seeing any video here.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.880]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:45.760]   430 for a 32 gig with cables.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.280]   Offer-- yes, we're seeing a lot of $430 for--
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:48.800]   What?
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.160]   --32 gig plus cable.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.760]   So that's your 340--
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:53.920]   Well, it's 345.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:54.720]   There's 45--
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.640]   I'm on a slam right now.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.960]   It's everybody who runs there.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.560]   Gazelle.com, I'll tell you what, don't sell it.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.160]   Gazelle, it's really a great deal.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.320]   And this is a good time to get rid of that old iPhone.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.040]   If you want to go to Verizon, there's just
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.000]   no better way to do that.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.680]   Kindles, Nooks, and other book readers about $100.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.760]   iPhones range from $20 to $200, depending on condition.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.240]   Mac books, about $600.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.360]   It's a great way to upgrade.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.560]   And boy, we all have gadgets lying around.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.320]   Gazelle.com, use the offer code, Mac Break.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:29.400]   All right, let's go to the video we have of Andy and Playtime.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.600]   In-- it's about 10, 15 minutes.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.240]   Playtime at the-- they always have a demo.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.160]   Apple always does this.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.440]   I've never heard of Verizon doing it.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.080]   This is clearly an Apple event, right?
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.920]   Andy got an invitation, but I didn't.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:40.800]   Gizmodo didn't.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.320]   It was an Apple event, obviously, right?
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.320]   Not that he's better.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.520]   No, I'm not better at all, but that's
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.360]   kind of how I knew that it was going to be the iPhone.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.840]   Because Verizon surely would have invited Gizmodo,
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.680]   but they didn't.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.680]   They were obviously working off an Apple list.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.600]   And because it's an Apple event, they had the little demo
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:58.920]   booth.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:03.320]   And Andy Inako took his iPhone and his Skype
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.840]   and gave us this report.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:09.360]   It would show up the name that you've given your iPhone for,
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.120]   or the right one.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.040]   And then it would show up.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.600]   And you would just type in the password
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.240]   and you would actually view what I was talking about.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.800]   So what I mean is that if I have--
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.400]   if I had looked at an airport extreme based station,
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.200]   all the things I can do if I have an airport extreme
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.680]   based station in the room mean, except for expecting
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.240]   the internet.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:30.080]   If I wanted to do like a eye chat between my matchbook
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.600]   and my Mac in the room, it will just function
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.760]   as a database station.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.600]   Like, finish all that.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.120]   I see it.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:36.960]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.480]   That's how it works with the MyFi.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.440]   Very good.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:46.480]   And I'll just explain that from where I'm on to my connection.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.040]   Bye bye.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.920]   Now, is there any pricing information on whether or not
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.920]   that will be an added feature or whether that's just
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.600]   something you get with your data plan?
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.880]   So that is a great question for Verizon.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.040]   OK, so you can see me?
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.040]   And I have an app for you.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:58.480]   Oh, hi.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.440]   Very good.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.600]   I'm just looking at my Android I'm
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.680]   adding an iPhone streaming this to the Mac for a week.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.920]   I'm just trying to spend time.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.680]   I doubled it.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.000]   So I'm talking about the personal hotspot feature.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Now, is this going to be an add-on feature?
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.520]   Or is it going to be part of my basic charge
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.960]   part of my basic data plan?
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.720]   I'm going to have to pay extra to get the personal hotspot
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.320]   feature on the iPhone 4.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.200]   I believe it would be part of the basic plan.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.800]   So no added password.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:25.800]   I understand.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:26.480]   OK.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:30.840]   Well, here, do you have any information on what changes
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.800]   apart from getting ready for all this extra data
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.240]   and all these extra consumers did rise
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.960]   have to make them a network in order
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.520]   to get ready for the iPhone?
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.040]   Because for instance, there's so much on the AC&T launch,
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.760]   they talked about how to get the visual voicemail working.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.440]   They made it, they added extra infrastructure
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.160]   so that we know how to process an iPhone transaction,
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.560]   a voice transaction like that.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:53.000]   Do you guys have to make any sort of change like that
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.640]   at your network level to make sure that added features
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.920]   on the iPhone would come to an ARK?
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.720]   I think the major thing we did was just
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.240]   off of the capacity.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.200]   And we've been doing that for years.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.800]   From our perspective, it's really the demand
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.160]   that we're trying to stay ahead of.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.320]   We have enough headroom.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.720]   So I think from our perspective, the second system
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.160]   is best of the year after year.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:21.040]   Make sure when we do have the official customers on,
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.120]   we're able to meet the demand that we're going to stay.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.280]   So we know what's going on.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.920]   OK, but it is feature for feature the exact same experience.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.920]   Apart from the extra feature of the personal Wi-Fi hotspot.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.280]   I'm going to let the gentleman bring us to that.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.360]   I could talk to the never-go-be so I like to.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.360]   I'm sorry, I didn't get your hands on.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.080]   Sheldon Joe.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.840]   Thank you for making sure.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.160]   So it is one of its features for feature
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.080]   of the exact same experience.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.280]   iPhone 4.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.400]   This is an iPhone 4 on Verizon.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.800]   All of the great hardware features from the beautiful Red
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:52.400]   M.S.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.600]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.200]   The cable processor inside, all the gyro school.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.600]   The Mac you've got by-mix with cameras that you know,
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:05.200]   iPhone 4 that you have in your 18-10 for now.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:10.320]   It takes HD video.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.320]   But in the other hardware, you'll see on the bottom
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.680]   it's got this thing bigger.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.440]   My 30-pin connector for the iPhone 4 system.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.520]   It's not a iPhone 4 on Verizon.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:25.480]   So FaceTime, I can be election and I wouldn't.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:30.760]   So what happens if I'm having a phone call over FaceTime,
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.960]   excuse me, regular voice phone calls?
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.760]   Well, I still have to tap a button and go to FaceTime.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.080]   If you're in a white microphone.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.560]   OK.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.600]   So that's not a fact about CDMA and limitation,
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.960]   I guess, or whatever.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:48.680]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.680]   I don't think I'm on my phone.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.160]   It's the same thing as on the iPhone 4.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.160]   It is nice.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.160]   It's nice.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:59.160]   That's what it's like to tell them to do about the earlier
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:33:59.840]   forums.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.680]   This is the stunning display of about a hard industry
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.440]   analyst looking at exactly the same phone that they've been
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.560]   talking about for the past week.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.160]   Not really much.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:11.680]   Now, one thing I did notice is that the bottom is missing
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.320]   by the international certifications like the CE market.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.760]   Is that just a US-only phone or is it a production sample
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.720]   that hasn't actually been certified yet?
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.320]   Yeah, the marketing business of audio production--
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.320]   OK, so it isn't correct.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.680]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.320]   OK.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.000]   Those markings are there for this phone that's on Verizon's
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.160]   CDMA there.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:30.640]   OK.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.560]   Now, you will notice the market price.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.760]   You notice that as you noted, the markings
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:35.760]   are slightly different.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.280]   OK.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.880]   That's because the hardware is on different networks
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.560]   and it has the markings for different pieces
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.080]   around it, so most markings in the AT&T
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:50.320]   are like one of the different regions.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.840]   I did notice this not a trace.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.960]   It's like the AT&T phone.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.560]   There's not-- it's the only place you can see the Verizon
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.320]   logo is in the carrier.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.680]   A lot at the top of the menu, so it's not like you--
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.880]   there's a ad logo added to the actual artwork on the case.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.840]   There's still just the Apple logo, and that's it.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.080]   Exactly.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.560]   Thanks, phone.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.040]   Great.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.400]   Any other questions from the studio?
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.520]   Yeah, we have two questions that people are asking.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.560]   One is, is there going to be a white iPhone?
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:17.320]   And number two is, is the unlimited plan truly unlimited?
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:21.840]   Of course, question is, is anyone who's on a white iPhone?
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.440]   There's actually-- some pointed out earlier
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.000]   that on the Verizon site with the first information
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.680]   about the Verizon iPhone, they actually
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.800]   showed images of the white iPhone and the black iPhone,
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.480]   leading some people to think that you guys are going
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.880]   to have access to the white iPhone before anybody else.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.720]   So is there any news about the white color of the iPhone
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.120]   being an option for Verizon users?
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.120]   Spring.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.120]   Spring.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.680]   What I thought was coming in for an update version.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.080]   You previously-- OK, sorry.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.240]   That's from Apple, not from Verizon.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:49.880]   Spring.
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:50.600]   OK.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.920]   So no news except for just regular what they're saying
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.000]   about white iPhones coming in spring.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.440]   And what was your second question?
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.160]   The second question is, is the--
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.280]   they have an unlimited plan listed on the website,
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.360]   and people are curious about whether unlimited is really
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.880]   going to mean unlimited.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.040]   Actually, it's probably another Verizon
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.720]   question that on the website, there's a limitation.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.160]   On the website, there's a percentage of options.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.320]   There's also a notation of an unlimited plan.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.560]   So is it going to be possible to get unlimited data
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.760]   for the Verizon iPhone?
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:21.880]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.800]   Yes, that's going to come close to launch.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.300]   OK.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.080]   Not but a pricing aside, will it be possible to purchase
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.000]   that with her price on the limited data?
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.200]   Not sure.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:31.720]   OK.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.160]   There's-- on the website-- my video is telling me
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.440]   that they've looked at the Verizon website for the paid
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.160]   information placed by the iPhone 4,
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.800]   and that among the options of the data plans,
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.400]   is that one option will be unlimited.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:43.800]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.280]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.200]   OK.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.880]   Now actually, it comes to mind that when I reviewed
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.960]   a previous pricing phone, they told me it was unlimited,
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.640]   and I made sure I knew exactly what that meant,
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:59.200]   and said it had limited to then 5 gigabytes cap for mine.
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.640]   As you know, that means unlimited data,
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.640]   meaning I can watch Netflix videos all day long.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.040]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:07.540]   OK.
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.000]   So the current smart-- I'm sorry.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.400]   What's the name?
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:14.160]   The current smartphone plan is 29, and that is unlimited.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.480]   Meaning start on day one, and start streaming Netflix,
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.880]   stop on day 30, and they don't care.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.380]   OK.
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:25.800]   So that's-- like I said, I mean, that really is it.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:29.520]   Again, it is completely-- but I suppose the fair thing
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:33.600]   to say is that it is remarkable in how unremarkable it is.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.160]   That it is, again, just a plain-- just a regular iPhone,
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.680]   including the gap of depth.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.280]   It was no commercial-- the antenna redesign, except for
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.080]   it being redesigned specifically for CDMA.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.640]   Again, the only difference is that you can really see
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.240]   are the lack of boilerplate on there,
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:52.040]   and I'm told that that's not necessarily because this
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.640]   is the USA-only phone, but because it's
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.920]   the phones that are here.
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.720]   I happened on the demo stand.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.680]   There are a bunch of third-party apps,
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:02.080]   Arrangian folders, but I'm told that the--
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.360]   I read that the shipping phone will just come
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.760]   with standard suites of iOS apps.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.840]   There won't be any special Verizon apps.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.080]   There will be a FISAP pre-installed.
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.680]   It will be bogged standard exactly the same experience
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:17.640]   as when you take out an AT&T phone on the box.
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.200]   Fantastic.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.640]   So thanks, Andy.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.040]   Do you have any last thoughts about it?
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.440]   It sounds like it's pretty much the--
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.840]   what we have is a iPhone 4 that can answer phone calls
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.560]   anywhere.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.800]   It's a crazy thought.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.800]   It's a brand new tech breakthrough that you have an iPhone
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.200]   phone that works as a phone.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.120]   We're pretty excited about that.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.360]   For those of you who want your phone to be a phone,
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.160]   I think that's the important thing here.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.160]   Well, that was very cool.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.960]   The magic of editing, we just stuck that in there.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.760]   That was very cool.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.440]   So after you played with it for a while, Andy,
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.160]   did you have any thoughts?
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.880]   I mean, look, there's a little antenna
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.240]   line different in a different spot,
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.560]   but it must have felt otherwise pretty much the same.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:01.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.480]   There's really just no difference between just some
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.240]   of the iPhone 4 that most of you guys
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.200]   already have your pockets.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.560]   So don't run out and get one.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:12.200]   Yeah, I mean, if Grand Six will, all you people
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.640]   waited three years for this, can you not wait another five
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.280]   months to get the iPhone 5, which will almost certainly
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.560]   be available on the Verizon network?
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.440]   That would be my suggestion, right?
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.640]   Is there already on it?
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:25.280]   If you've got an iPhone 4, stop.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.160]   Although it's having some conversations,
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.480]   I think all of us in this conversation have had heard
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.520]   from every friend and every relative and every friend
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.960]   of a relative about the rumors.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.960]   Oh, God, yeah.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.320]   And I think it's kind of do the do the do the.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:40.680]   And something that I've sort of been picking up from this
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.000]   is that a lot of people like to have all the family members
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.920]   phones on the same carrier and on the same plan.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:51.040]   So that might be a really big mover into people switching--
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.040]   That's true.
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.040]   --adopting these.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.480]   So there's so many people who are like a husband and wife,
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.560]   they both want to be having the exact same phone.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:59.920]   I was talking to a couple last night,
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.840]   who was exactly like that.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.720]   One of them is Matter of Fact for Christmas.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:07.280]   Got a gift card and was trying to figure out how to use it.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.520]   Then there's a Verizon iPhone.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.360]   Any bit.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.120]   We all get it.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:10.960]   It's got iPhones for the family.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:12.960]   [CHEERING]
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.600]   So there's so many dimensions to this,
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.280]   especially with FaceTime as a way of sort of underscoring
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.480]   that it wouldn't be nice for everybody in this whole family
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.560]   to have not only the networks that we've
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.000]   been having for a while, but also to have this new technology.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.360]   Does FaceTime matter anymore?
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.560]   I mean, you filed that report via Skype.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.440]   You can use 3G and Wi-Fi, which you can on FaceTime.
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.160]   You still have the same capabilities.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.840]   But it's Skype so everybody can use it.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.640]   Isn't Skype kind of Trump FaceTime?
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.640]   Not really, because FaceTime is a button on the phone
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.640]   that appears every time you make a phone call.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.200]   Skype is an application that clever people
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.360]   have to tell you exist and then show you exactly how it works.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.000]   So for us, clever people.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:50.960]   It's mood.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.640]   I wasn't necessarily including myself in that.
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.160]   Although I will say that this is the first time
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:00.520]   that I will be sending real love to Skype.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.720]   I've said nasty things about them in the past.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.920]   That's the fact that I'm able to do this and be
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:06.920]   part of this show without having to bring
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:08.920]   the most big laptop, which I normally
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.720]   have to do just to do this.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.880]   This is a 100% iOS business trip.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:18.000]   And I have a Skype, at least partially the thing for that.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.080]   That's pretty awesome, I am.
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.800]   I think that I think Apple has missed an important window
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.920]   and is missing an important window with FaceTime as they--
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.120]   What could they have done to preserve their lead?
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.600]   They need to make it something that's widely available
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.080]   to developers to be able to incorporate FaceTime
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.040]   into their applications, incorporated it through Skype
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:36.720]   or whoever else.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.000]   But anybody who wants to build a video application,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:39.680]   it should be easy.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.520]   It should be a library that they can simply say,
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.360]   and then I want to get a FaceTime call.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.160]   And boom, I've got access to that.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.560]   Rather than make it this kind of--
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.960]   I think the test case is going on too long.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.680]   I think that's the thing that Apple has really missed
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:53.600]   the boat on.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:54.560]   And I don't know how--
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.120]   Tom, do you use FaceTime ever?
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.640]   No, I'm still on the 3GS.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.680]   Oh, Tom, you're like me, still back with Leopard.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.280]   Well, I'm waiting for Verizon.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.400]   We can't use all the new--
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:05.880]   were you?
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:06.720]   Will you switch?
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:07.880]   Oh, interesting.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.120]   So we do have somebody else switch.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:09.840]   Sure.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:10.440]   I'm ready.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.360]   Like February 3rd, as soon as it's available.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.760]   I guess you have to wait till February 10th.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:16.280]   I think so.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.720]   Are you under contract?
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.120]   No, I waited.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:19.620]   I see.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.280]   So you're an example.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.240]   I've been eligible for a new phone for--
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.480]   Since the force came out.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.920]   See, this is what's really interesting,
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.600]   is I think there are a lot of people like Tom.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.480]   I think there is pent up demand.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.040]   It should be a better phone, because I actually
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.960]   make phone calls.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:33.760]   That's crazy, Tom.
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.760]   That's why I'm waiting, Tom.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.280]   I don't know.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.760]   It should be a better phone.
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.000]   If you say that it's the network,
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.200]   but it may be the hardware.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.240]   Yeah, will you let me know?
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.440]   Sure.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:48.440]   Because I'm not buying it until Tom says it's OK.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.360]   I'm waiting for you, dude.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:50.800]   I'm waiting.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.520]   I'm getting one for Carly to shoot.
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:53.320]   We'll have Tom's.
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:53.800]   Well, Tom's.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.080]   Well, we can make a small call between him.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.080]   He's crazy.
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.080]   He's crazy.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.720]   He's making face time and everything.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.000]   So there is other news.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.440]   Let me just-- I'll go around.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.760]   Any final thoughts on the Verizon iPhone?
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:07.840]   Start with Alex Lindsay.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.600]   If you're waiting-- if you were waiting,
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.040]   this is the time you can go ahead and get it,
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.880]   unless you really want to make sure you have the newest one.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.080]   You wait until the summer to make sure
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.720]   that the newest one doesn't come out.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.200]   If you already have AT&T, I would just
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.720]   stay with what you got and see how things go.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.200]   Tom, any final thoughts on the Verizon phone?
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.960]   Just accept F. Yeah.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.000]   Well, having a CDMA phone is just great.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.120]   I'm looking forward to--
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.440]   You don't travel, obviously.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:34.000]   You don't go out overseas.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:34.720]   Not much.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.680]   I mean, it's funny because I have a Droid X,
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.800]   as my-- was my primary phone now, it's an XSS.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.000]   But when I went to France, it was a Droid X.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.960]   I had to carry the iPhone because I needed to travel.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:47.000]   And then Verizon phone, unless you get a world phone.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.840]   And this is not a world phone.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.880]   I spent two months a year out of the country.
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.240]   That'll be a good excuse not to travel.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:54.760]   I like it.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:55.880]   My phone doesn't work there.
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:56.480]   I can't go.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.360]   Oh, you're looking for excuses?
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.160]   Sure.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:03.920]   Andy, not go any other thoughts on the iPhone 4.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:04.760]   You're the one who's held--
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.960]   Yes, actually.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.880]   Just as-- I think that this change is nothing for anybody.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.200]   Because I think that if you're an existing iPhone 4 user
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:18.040]   and you're on AT&T, you're probably OK with AT&T by now.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.440]   If you're one of these people who has been holding off
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.120]   and buying the iPhone because no way in hell
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.600]   are you interested in getting in the contract on AT&T.
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:27.680]   Well, Grace, I can go on Verizon.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:30.240]   I just don't think that it's a situation where
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.120]   it's going to be a game changer for people leaving AT&T
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.320]   for Verizon.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.880]   And I don't think it'll necessarily convince people
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.120]   who were going to be getting an Android who didn't really--
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.000]   who-- I don't think there are people who looked
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.920]   at an Android device, looked at the iPhone,
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.480]   didn't see the big deal about the iPhone,
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:47.080]   and went for the Android on the carrier of their choice.
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.440]   Are going to be swayed by this or anything else.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.240]   Again, I'm glad that it's just the exact same iPhone,
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.640]   the exact same software, just not a different carrier.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.600]   That's exactly the way that I would have wanted Apple
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.280]   to have played this.
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:03.120]   I guess it pretty much indicates that their exclusivity
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.800]   with AT&T ended on December 31st.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.800]   Because if you're Apple, you would really
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.920]   like to do this when you release the iPhone 5,
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.560]   or last year during the iPhone 4.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.880]   It's kind of not the ideal time.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.120]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.080]   I don't know about that.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.240]   There's a real sense from Apple that they've been leaving money
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.400]   on the table for the past two or three years.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.680]   That there-- they could be selling so many more of these
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.800]   if they could put it on other carriers.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.440]   And so I'm not sure why they would--
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.600]   if they had the ability to get six months worth of sales
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.400]   in before they switched to the iPhone 5,
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.080]   you may as well start shoveling in that money.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.880]   It's a nice way to put it.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.760]   Oh, shoveling the money, kids.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.480]   We got an iPhone 4.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:44.960]   Who's the big winner here?
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.720]   Who's the big winner here?
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.400]   Apple.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.960]   Apple.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:50.480]   Apple.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.320]   That's how it always works.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:51.920]   It's like Apple.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.160]   Apple's partnered with someone.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.080]   Who's the big winner?
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.000]   Apple.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   Apple.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.160]   Well, also, they also-- afterward,
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.360]   if you went back upstairs for the mini muffins board,
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.360]   they had those beef sandwiches.
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.160]   I'm not a loser in all this either.
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.840]   I think Gazelle is the other winner.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:07.440]   Gazelle.
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.560]   Yeah, they made some money.
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.960]   So the other big story happened during CES.
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:12.680]   Apple-- you know, it's funny.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.280]   Apple does not go to the Consumer Electronics Show.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.720]   But it always somehow they managed to kind of be a
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:19.040]   specter hovering above the show.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:23.920]   In 2007, the iPhone last year was the iPad.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:27.280]   This year, Apple Verizon's iPhone was one.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.720]   We thought they might announce it.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.600]   And the other story, of course-- and a huge story-- is the
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.160]   App Store.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:37.080]   And on January 6, Thursday, day one of international CES,
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.560]   Apple launches the App Store.
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:41.840]   So what do you think, gentlemen?
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.080]   It's pretty cool.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.440]   Here's one real advantage.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:45.440]   I logged into my App Store.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:46.680]   I do have a snow leopard machine.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:47.840]   I logged into my App Store.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.080]   I go to purchases.
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:52.240]   And oh, look, lo and behold, I bought some
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.880]   software on some of the other systems.
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:59.120]   So I could just install them on this one, too, including an
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:02.040]   $89 aperture.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.080]   Gotta love that.
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.280]   That's a big drop in price for aperture, isn't it?
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.640]   So this means that it'll now let you do it across the
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.640]   system.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.400]   Now, I assume that it has the same five-computer login
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:13.400]   limits.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.400]   Still.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.400]   I mean, it used to be--
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.400]   That's a lot.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.400]   That's-- well, that's--
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.920]   So when is the aperture less than half price, you're not
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.760]   getting enough to put it on all my computers?
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.760]   I didn't even realize that part.
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:25.760]   I got the store.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:26.760]   I wanted to see how it works.
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.760]   So I got the store and I downloaded Twitter.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:29.760]   Yeah, well, everybody downloaded Twitter.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.760]   Well, I was resisting Angry Birds, 'cause, you know, I'm
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.760]   trying to keep my addiction in a truck.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:34.760]   Oh, that was the big crash.
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:35.760]   And it crashed.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:36.760]   And it crashed.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.320]   Oh, that was the big crash.
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.960]   What's the number one app still today?
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.880]   To this day, the number one app is Angry Birds on--
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:46.320]   Turns out Bitterness is very popular.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.000]   Do not buy Angry Birds if you have anything to do.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   No.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.280]   I didn't buy it 'cause I've got on every other thing.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:56.160]   I'm just trying to keep it corralled into certain areas
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.320]   and not on my--
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.560]   when I-- place I have to work.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.120]   Hey, Alex, everyone knows you can't corral birds.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.280]   They just fly away.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.280]   Yeah, probably.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:08.600]   I have to say, the app store is very compelling,
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.920]   and that's why I'm hating it.
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:11.440]   It's really easy.
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:13.120]   It's too good.
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.520]   Developers are going to love it.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.760]   They get 70%.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:16.760]   They don't have to think about it.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:17.760]   They handle their DRM.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.040]   Handles DRM.
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.800]   Now, updates are a little bit of an issue.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.240]   It does-- you can go to updates,
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.040]   and you can see if you have any updates available, just
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:27.000]   as you can with the iOS store.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.360]   But, of course, those updates have
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.280]   to be approved by Apple.
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:32.120]   So it does slow down your iteration on updates.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.080]   Oh, but I think it'll--
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.520]   as someone who has to build updates,
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.240]   I think it's going to definitely speed up
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.400]   the intake of updates when you will fix something.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.720]   Because now, like with my iPhone and my iPad,
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.800]   I just-- I get it to a Wi-Fi connection.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.360]   I just go, oh, check press updates.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:45.120]   Let's see what we got.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:46.120]   I'm not going to update all of them.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.360]   60 different websites.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.080]   And from a security point of view, that's great.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.640]   I mean, one of the reasons that the bad guys on Windows
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.000]   are now moving to third-party apps
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.040]   is because the update experience is really simple on Windows
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.400]   itself, but nobody knows how to update third-party apps.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.520]   You have to explicitly do it.
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.160]   So that's where the bad guys go.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:05.760]   Well, this handles that concern.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.720]   I think, as you would expect, it's really gorgeous.
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.400]   So end-user goes going to like it,
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.520]   because it's easy to update.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.560]   It's easy to purchase.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:15.640]   The cost of software is generally a little bit lower,
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.280]   it seems.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:17.760]   I mean, aperture for $90.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.400]   That's a real loss leader.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.160]   And--
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.160]   I didn't even know about that, because I already
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:22.880]   have aperture.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.760]   The app store already knew it was installed.
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.400]   So it was sort of hiding the price from it.
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.360]   Get this.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:31.120]   I already bought aperture too, and I bought it again.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.360]   Because it was only $89.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.960]   And now I can install it on all my systems.
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:38.400]   And now it'll automatically update.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:42.920]   It's that much better that I was willing to pay an additional $90,
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:43.640]   because it's better.
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:46.720]   And this is what scares the hell out of me.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:50.560]   Because the more compelling this is for developers and end-users,
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.520]   the more likely it becomes the dominant, if not only way,
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.680]   to buy apps on a Macintosh.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.720]   I think five years from now, I think--
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.160]   I don't think Apple's ever going to have to say,
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.800]   we're not going to allow you to install it.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:03.760]   They don't need to.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.960]   It's just going to be an empty area that maybe high-end
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.760]   developers like Adobe and an Autodesk,
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:09.440]   maybe still a pull-on.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.520]   Maybe still a professional apps.
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:12.360]   A handful of those.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.200]   Maybe outside of that.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.440]   No GPL apps on this.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.160]   They pulled VNC--
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:17.960]   or VLC, I'm sorry--
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:20.880]   from the iOS store, because GPL, everybody now
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:24.280]   agrees, is incompatible with Apple's own license agreement.
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.400]   So you're not going to see open source software on here.
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:28.440]   That means they'll always be that kind of ecosystem
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.960]   unless Apple shuts it down.
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:30.560]   But you're right.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.200]   They're not going to.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.080]   They don't need to.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.760]   Most users will just say, this is how I buy apps.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.360]   Well, let's not forget that developers have a good reason
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:41.640]   not to want to be part of the app store.
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.080]   When I hear complaints from developers about the app store,
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.240]   it's always about the layer--
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.600]   the artificial layer that Apple puts between themselves
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:50.120]   and their customers.
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.240]   Whereas if you're a completely independent developer
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.800]   and you're selling all your software, three or one website,
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.360]   or three target system, you all
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:59.600]   always have a list of everybody that is using your software.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.680]   You can collect all kinds of information about them.
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.960]   And here, we're not talking about marketing information.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.160]   You can then send to shady home re-mortaging companies.
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:10.000]   We're talking about information about how they're using your app,
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.440]   why crash-- where the--
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:12.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.400]   You need to get crash reporting, I believe, through the app store.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:17.800]   But they believe that the idea that they don't have a list
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.320]   of all their customers, that they can get in touch with to say, oh,
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:21.720]   by the way, we found a problem with this.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.400]   And we're fixing-- here's the reason why we're fixing it.
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:25.840]   Please go to this page for a full explanation.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:30.280]   By the way, Apple is characterizing this as beta.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.320]   But they did push it out in a system update.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:34.160]   And they didn't say what else was in the update.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.960]   So most people who are security conscious and reliability
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.800]   conscious do all the system updates.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.680]   So even if you didn't want the app store,
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:45.200]   even though you might say, it's beta,
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.720]   you're going to get 10.6.6.
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.720]   I mean, nobody's going to turn their back on it.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:49.560]   I was kind of surprised.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:51.400]   I thought they might do app stores a separate download.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:54.680]   But by bundling it into 10.6.6, they're
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:57.440]   really saying you must get it.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.040]   And it's a great--
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:51:59.960]   There's no reason not to--
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:00.920]   Just be like iTunes for apps.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.600]   It doesn't seem unreliable in any way.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.040]   I mean, there's no reason not to get it.
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:06.120]   So the only barrier is snow leopard?
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.880]   You have to have snow leopard, which is an interesting barrier,
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:09.800]   isn't that?
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:11.880]   Yeah, it's going to force me to switch.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.400]   Well, and this is part of the advantage of the ecosystem
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:18.040]   is you're telling developers, we--
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:20.440]   you don't have to worry about older versions of the OS,
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.600]   either.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:23.160]   We will kind of promise you that it's always
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.320]   running on a certain kind of platform.
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:26.440]   Well, and here's the question I have,
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:30.680]   is that as Apple starts to take 30% of every purchase of every app
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:35.640]   that is made in the OS, are we going to, as users,
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:39.520]   see the end of pain for any OS update?
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:40.880]   We're getting iOS for free.
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:41.640]   But as well.
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.600]   It seems like, I think, as we get $10.7, I think--
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.520]   $30 is virtually free.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:47.280]   And I think $30 is what we're probably
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.520]   going to see $10.7 be not $1.29 or whatever.
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:52.320]   And I think that by $10.8, it's free.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.480]   There's nothing-- because Apple's going to make so much money
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:57.080]   on the apps, they don't need to sell us--
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:58.880]   they don't need to sell us the--
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.080]   Oh, in other words--
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.680]   I haven't looked at the Apple stock price,
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:03.440]   but it went up about $10.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.600]   It's going to--
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:05.760]   They're going to pass X on by April.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.000]   That's $400 by the end of the year, easy.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.160]   If I wish Scott Born were here, I could ask him.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.800]   Because Scott was the guy who said, on this show,
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:15.800]   oh, $200 easy.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.160]   When it was $600?
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.920]   Yeah, Scott.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.320]   And who knew?
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.920]   $300 easy.
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.840]   $400 probably before the--
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:24.760]   Apparently they asked me.
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:26.440]   She said, should we put money into--
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:29.320]   Well, by the way, do not take stock advice from us.
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:29.800]   No.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.200]   Please, please, dude.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.600]   I don't buy tech stocks.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.800]   I don't own Apple stock.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.520]   Nobody says you can't, but I--
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:36.520]   I don't.
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.840]   --for reasons of editorial integrity.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:40.000]   I don't.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.840]   And boy, if you took stock advice from me,
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:43.880]   you'd be making a huge mistake.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:44.640]   Or for Mandy.
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:45.880]   Or for Alex.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:47.120]   But I don't know about you, Tom.
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:50.520]   I have no advice, but I think that Apple will continue
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.920]   to do well.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:55.400]   It opened at $344.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:55.920]   Is that right?
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.400]   Did it open at $344?
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.560]   It can't be right.
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:53:59.400]   No, no, no, no.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.120]   It can't be good.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.320]   It can't be right.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:02.240]   No.
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.840]   But I have to think that--
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:07.120]   I mean, there's one negative in the price.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:10.480]   There's one thing that you should be aware of.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:13.920]   It all relies on Steve at this point, right?
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:14.920]   At the moment, yeah.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.840]   I mean, I think that if Steve left,
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.880]   I think there's like a three to five year trajectory
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:21.040]   that Apple, you know, is already planning products.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:21.880]   They're already doing stuff.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:22.640]   340 at the moment.
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.640]   I think it might hit 400 before the end of the day.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:29.880]   Market cap that I'm seeing right now is 312.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.640]   Cheese billions.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.120]   Billion as far as their market cap.
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:37.200]   There's only one company in front of Apple, and that is Exxon.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:41.680]   And I think they're at-- I want to say 340?
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.400]   340 billion?
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:43.840]   Is that right?
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.360]   Wow.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:49.240]   So let's look at the five day graph for Apple,
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.280]   just real briefly to see how it--
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:51.640]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:53.280]   Exxon is 380 billion.
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:53.840]   So Apple is--
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:55.000]   Apple's coming close.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:55.720]   Apple's--
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.160]   But that-- those two--
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.000]   But isn't that just-- I mean, that's just a silly.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:54:59.480]   That's just a silly--
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:01.000]   Well, I think I realized what the market cap is.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.520]   Apple is not the biggest company
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.080]   or the second biggest company in the world.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:04.880]   People make a mistake.
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:07.320]   The market cap is what people's opinion is of you.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:08.160]   Well, that's true.
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.800]   It is not how much money you're making.
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:13.080]   So this is the stock price jump.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.560]   It was $336.
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:17.800]   It went up to 341, $5 today.
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:19.880]   I mean, I'm sorry, Monday on news--
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:22.440]   presumed news of the iPhone 4 has now gone up.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:25.840]   It was as high earlier today as 343.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:28.480]   It's currently hovering around 341.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:31.000]   Well, I spend a lot more on Apple than I do on gasoline.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.480]   That's for sure.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:34.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:37.520]   If Apple were to make an electric car, I'd buy it.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:38.280]   I would.
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:39.360]   Yeah, of course you would.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:40.320]   Who wouldn't?
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:42.000]   It could look like a little red apple
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.800]   like going down the road.
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:44.520]   You'd buy it.
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:46.480]   It would have to be candy apple red.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:47.720]   I think you're right.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:51.400]   Your little VW would be like a '60s looking roundy.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:57.320]   Shareholders petitioned strongly to get a succession plan
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:01.200]   in place for a post Steve Jobs apple.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:04.280]   They will vote on that, I'm sure, at the stockholders' meeting.
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:08.840]   But Apple's strongly worded response was, no way.
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:09.520]   We don't need it.
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:12.880]   We're very happy with our existing executive team.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.640]   Tim Cook is, I guess, the number two guy.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.240]   He had a good year.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.040]   Yeah, he was paid, I think, a million and a half,
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:20.200]   but had about 45 million in stock options.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:22.120]   Let's do it.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.320]   Well, everyone-- I mean, everyone
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:24.760]   who's been at Apple for a while, you know,
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:26.920]   has a choice of them that has done pretty well.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:28.240]   They're doing OK.
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:30.960]   No one's pressing.
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:32.600]   I need nobody to collect these clothing
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.120]   and canned goods for the Apple people.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.400]   I think one thing that's kind of telling--
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:39.360]   by the way, the Motley Fool today asking the question,
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:42.200]   will Apple hit $450?
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:43.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:47.280]   That's the target price from Jeffries and company analyst,
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:48.200]   Peter Mysek.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:54.160]   He bumped it up from $365 to $450.
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.080]   Well, you keep on thinking that it's going to Peter out,
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.760]   but Apple keeps on doing more stuff.
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.280]   I didn't think it'd get to 200.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:04.040]   Scott Bourne, you know, I mocked him, which is why I do not
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.280]   buy stocks.
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.360]   I buy-- you know, I have investments,
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:11.640]   but they're all market index baskets of no-load mutual funds.
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:13.480]   I don't trust myself.
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:14.480]   I don't trust myself.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:17.640]   I probably have tech stocks, but I don't know,
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.320]   because I don't know.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:22.040]   I just buy the index fund.
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:25.800]   Wow, that's a pretty impressive jump.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:27.760]   Dude, actually, on the subject, you
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.840]   think that that's significant.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:33.200]   That's why Tim Cook was representing Apple here instead
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:33.840]   of Steve.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:34.360]   You bet.
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:36.040]   Well, first of all, you're not going to--
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:38.240]   I think they're looking for more chances to give him more
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:38.840]   face-to-face.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:38.840]   You bet.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:40.360]   They're not going to let Tim--
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:43.040]   Steve, come to an event like this, because that would be an
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:46.800]   admission that AT&T sucked.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:49.280]   I think it would just steal the thunder.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:52.560]   It's sort of like having-- we've got Frank Sinatra, and we've
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:54.560]   got-- they host him, Haulabaloo.
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:56.360]   And we've got someone who got cut by the New York
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:57.360]   mess.
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:58.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.560]   You can eat, get out, try, and get out, put him on stage.
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:01.880]   Yeah, of course he is.
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:03.680]   But I don't think Apple cares about that.
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.760]   Why would Apple care about that?
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:09.120]   Does Apple care if they outshine Verizon's executives?
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:11.120]   I don't think so.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:14.080]   I don't think that-- I think if Apple thought it was that
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:15.000]   important.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.880]   I think they want to make sure--
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:21.200]   I think they want to make sure that that doesn't look like a
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:24.520]   big announcement, that it looks like a medium announcement.
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:26.200]   Was there any Apple-- anything there?
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:29.400]   Was there any Apple-- did you see Apple PR there?
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:32.480]   Yeah, some of the usual cast from Apple PR were there.
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.120]   I bumped into a couple of different people.
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:35.240]   I didn't feel sure.
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.320]   I'm told it was also there.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:39.120]   I didn't see him, but another journalist I was talking to
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:42.040]   said that he saw him and tried to buttonhole him.
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:45.000]   So there was definitely an Apple presence there, but they
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.320]   certainly weren't doing the full court reality distortion
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:48.960]   press there.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:49.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:51.400]   We've drifted into iPhone territory again.
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:53.080]   Back to the Macintosh.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:54.520]   It's gravitational pull.
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.440]   We're not drifting.
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:57.640]   Back to the Mac.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:01.600]   The App Store launched with 1,000 applications.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.480]   That's about half the number that Chrome
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:04.960]   has launched with last month.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:08.320]   But you're never going to hear anybody tell that story.
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:09.360]   Of course, there are better apps.
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:10.680]   They're not HTML5 apps.
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.680]   They're true apps, including Angry Birds,
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:18.640]   Bejewel3, Aputure3, The Entire Eye Life, and EyeWork apps.
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:21.000]   No Photoshop.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.160]   I cannot imagine Adobe selling Photoshop in the App Store.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.040]   Can you?
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:28.080]   I think they're going to resist it for as long as they can.
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:31.200]   I would say never-- I think that the issue you're going to
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:37.040]   have is that companies, people doing stuff like some image
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:41.160]   editing programs on Pixelmator, those types of things.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.040]   Yeah, they jumped on that.
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:42.720]   And they should.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:43.880]   And they're going to make a lot of money.
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:46.320]   They're probably going to make more money in the next month
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:48.320]   than they have since they launched Pixelmator.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:50.280]   And this is why developers will love this,
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.160]   because they're suddenly in the spotlight.
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:52.880]   They're in the limelight.
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:53.560]   It's less money.
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:54.600]   I believe $30.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:56.040]   I don't think Pixelmator is a little bit more expensive.
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:57.880]   Well, the pricing is interesting, because, of course,
[00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:01.200]   the temperature $80, that's $120 bucks off.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.160]   But I photo, I'm moving garage band,
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.760]   if they're $15 each.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.440]   So yeah, that gets us less than the $70 bucks
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.120]   you'd pay for the Eye Life, right?
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:13.600]   Pages, keynote numbers, $20 each, less than the--
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.400]   whatever it is for--
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.800]   Pixelmator when it came out.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.200]   The last time it was reviewed, I believe it was $60.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:21.240]   So it's half of the price that it was when it was on the web.
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:24.880]   Is anything more expensive on the Mac store than it was before?
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.440]   I think that would be suicide.
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.600]   But then there's weird stuff, like--
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.640]   and some really, by the way, overpriced stuff.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.280]   There's some games I saw and stuff that--
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:34.240]   $20 or $30.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.640]   I think that the pressure is going to be on--
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:39.640]   because we're used to the prices of the iPhone store.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.960]   The pressure and the iPad store-- the pressure
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.360]   is going to be on these guys to lower prices.
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:45.400]   But I think also, with a centralized DRM,
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:46.480]   I do think that--
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:46.880]   Why not?
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.600]   --you're going to get-- you're going to actually make more
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.520]   money with a lower priced app, because you're
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:51.920]   going to have less piracy than there are--
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:52.920]   Even if there are five installs.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:53.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.160]   That does come to mind another complaint
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:58.080]   that I've been hearing from a lot of developers that Adobe
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:01.160]   might just be saying that they don't want to put their prestige
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.160]   product in the scrum of existing app store reviewers.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.480]   Yeah, because somebody might say it's better.
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.040]   It's all not just app.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.640]   But there will be people who say, why is this cost $500?
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:12.680]   It should be free.
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.080]   It's basically preview with layers.
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:19.160]   Why is this $500 when there's other app that costs $10?
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.160]   Adop.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.120]   They don't-- this isn't something that I've been hearing consistently.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.760]   It's not just the fact that someone could just
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.960]   torpedo with a really stupid one-star review.
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:31.920]   But also, you as the developers don't have the opportunity
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.880]   to respond to that.
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.120]   When I had my books out on Amazon,
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.040]   if someone gives me a one-star review,
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.000]   I'm very interested to know exactly how badly I screwed up.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.440]   And if it turns out that no, this guy was just--
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.440]   he didn't read the description word.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.160]   He thought he was buying something else.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.720]   He gave me a one-star review.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:52.760]   I accidentally say, I'm not asking you Amazon to pull this down
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:55.760]   and I'm not asking you to read this and see that if this one-star review makes sense.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.600]   At least you have some form of redress.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:02.480]   And I at least have the ability to end up that minimum post in that conversation saying,
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.120]   here's why I don't think that's accurate.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.240]   I am sorry you aren't correct, but I don't think that's--
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.320]   so you have to give up a lot of control as a publisher over discussion of your own product.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.360]   I can see why I have Photoshop when Adobe wouldn't want to do that.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:14.840]   Although, look at Autodesk.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.720]   They put this incredible program up for $30 Sketchbook Pro, a free version.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:24.160]   Sketchbook is-- I talked to Autodesk at the New York Conoco for about an hour.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:28.880]   And they really see Sketchbook as one of their premier sources of pride.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:34.080]   The amount of work that people are doing via Sketchbook now, they're very, very pleased
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.280]   that they're creating a new digital tool that so many digital artists are very--
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.280]   It's fantastic.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:39.280]   I wish I could draw.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:40.280]   I think I could--
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:41.280]   I wish I could draw.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.920]   I mean, basically it's Photoshop for freehand drawing.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.880]   I mean, it's gorgeous.
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.360]   And for $30.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.160]   So Autodesk sees this as an opportunity.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.760]   I think anybody who's not a doe.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.880]   An Autodesk for quite some time has been experimenting.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.280]   You know what we're not seeing yet is-- we'll know Autodesk is committing when Smoke for
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.560]   the Mac is on the App Store.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.560]   Smoke for the Mac is $15,000.
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:00.560]   And by the way, App Store--
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:01.560]   So when--
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.920]   So when you stop putting its Pro apps on here either, you don't see Final Cutz do you?
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:04.920]   Not yet.
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:05.920]   But we're expecting an update.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:10.240]   According to Steve, a kick-ass update will be on the App Store.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.600]   Will Apple put its money where it's--
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.000]   I think Apple has to.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   I think Apple has to.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.800]   When they're supposed to release it before April or May, I mean, according to Steve Jobs,
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.280]   he responded to somebody's emails.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.280]   And we're going to--
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.280]   I think it's very interesting.
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.040]   I think Apple has to put their money where their mouth is.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:29.240]   I think if they say this is a Mac App Store and everyone should be using it, they're going
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.480]   to put their own Pro apps on there.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.120]   And I don't think it's that big of a risk for Apple because I think that the Pro apps
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:36.360]   are not where Steve-- the Steve I is focused.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.560]   So I think he-- I think using this as a--
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.560]   He doesn't mind doing that.
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.560]   Well, they almost have to.
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:41.560]   You know?
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.880]   They'll have to really scrub their code for all the GPL.
[01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:44.880]   They're--
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:45.880]   That's a big issue.
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:48.880]   I mean, even the developer tools have--
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:49.880]   GCC is--
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:50.880]   Xcode is--
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:51.880]   But it's free.
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:52.880]   But it's free.
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:53.880]   But Xcode's free.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:54.880]   But to put it on the App Store--
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:55.880]   All right.
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:56.880]   Well, and this is a question.
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:00.080]   We should get even mowgown or somebody on-- he crafted GPL3.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:03.440]   I'd be very curious what-- and he's an attorney what he says about that.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:09.000]   But it seems to be the consensus among people like the creators of VLC that there is a
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.160]   disconnect between the App Store and GPL.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.320]   I know, Andy, you got to get going.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.920]   So we're going to move right.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:15.920]   Don't leave yet.
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:16.920]   Can you stay--
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:17.920]   I'll leave yet.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.240]   Can you stay five more minutes?
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.520]   I can give you five more minutes.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:25.840]   I said quarter to four because that will make sure that I am out of here by four.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.840]   I will get--
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:27.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:28.840]   I will give you-- here's what I'm going to do.
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.560]   Here's what I've just done now.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:33.400]   I have just removed the power connector.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:34.400]   OK.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:37.400]   So when your iPhone dies, so do we.
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:41.240]   I'll give you-- I'll give you five more minutes, but realize that I'm actually like
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.240]   tying up my tables and getting ready to go.
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.240]   All right, all right.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.120]   Let me quickly-- we're going to get our picks of the week in just a bit.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:49.480]   I have a pick from the App Store that I thought was really cool.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:54.800]   But before we do that, I do want to thank the folks at Ford who were so awesome at CES.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:59.600]   I thought it was just really fantastic and very telling that a major American automotive
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:06.160]   manufacturer would announce a massive new car line at the Consumer Electronics Show and
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:10.840]   not at the Detroit Motor Show, which is coming up in two days.
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:16.000]   The all-new 2012 Ford Focus Electric is my next car.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.560]   I cannot wait till it comes out.
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:22.520]   I sat in one beautiful-- I mean, very, very nicely equipped for the price.
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.520]   When is it coming out?
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.920]   They say next year.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:25.920]   OK.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:29.240]   Not going to happen.
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:31.080]   I'm just looking at a note that has been handed to me.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.080]   We don't have time.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.200]   Can we get Paul Kent on next week?
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.200]   I'd like to.
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.200]   I'm sorry.
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.480]   We were supposed to do Paul Kent via Skype, but we're running really, really late on
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.280]   this.
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.280]   So we will defer.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.320]   That'll know Andy wants to talk to Paul.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:46.080]   But so we'll do that next week.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.720]   Sorry, Paul.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:48.720]   But let me get back to this.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:51.120]   If you go to Focus Electric Power, you can find out more.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.040]   I cannot wait to buy this car.
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.800]   I was talking to Jennifer and she said, "Yeah, yep.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:55.800]   That's our next car."
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:58.080]   First of all, it's beautiful.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:03.760]   It is the Focus body and they're going to make-- this is talking about brilliant.
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:04.760]   It looks awesome.
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.000]   I interviewed Alan Malali.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.480]   I just have so much respect for this guy, CEO Ford.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:15.760]   One of the decisions they made on the Focus is to have a single design globally that he
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:16.760]   calls them top hats.
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:19.840]   They can have slight design differences on the stuff on top.
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:23.120]   But basically, fundamentally, the automobile is the same worldwide.
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:24.360]   That saves a lot of money.
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:32.640]   And the assembly lines are capable of doing gas, diesel, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.320]   on the same assembly line.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:38.920]   This solves a huge problem because you want to make these cars, but you don't want to
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.760]   make them if there's no demand.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:46.280]   And demand ramps up slowly, but you can exactly match, match demand with on-demand, just-in-time
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.280]   production.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.120]   I mean, Ford is amazing.
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:52.320]   Fordelectricpower.com, find out more about the Focus.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.080]   Gorgeous body.
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.240]   I took a look at it.
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:58.600]   They're going to make it really easy for you to get the electricity into your house.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.680]   Best buy will come over.
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.160]   The Geek Squad will install it.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:07.160]   Three affordable chargers, three hours charging, three hours charging.
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.160]   By the way, this has me stalling because I'm on the-
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.160]   Don't buy now.
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.280]   I was on the wait list for the leaf.
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.280]   Yep.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.960]   And I saw this and I was like, "I might wait."
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:19.640]   They have an electric vehicle app for all smartphones that do things like give you achievements
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.240]   for smart driving.
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.240]   Brilliant!
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:30.800]   I'm telling you, this car company is in the words of Gary Vaynerchuk crushing it.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:36.400]   I mean, you got to go to Ford, I'm sorry, Focuselectricpower.com and read up on all the
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.400]   features.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.400]   No keys.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.400]   No, of course no keys.
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.800]   Look at the charge port.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.800]   It lights up.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:47.800]   It's just- They're the apple of car companies now in terms of just attention to detail.
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.000]   They're just brilliant.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   And of course, you know it's got sync with my Ford Touch.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.120]   Of course it does.
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:59.960]   It's the most amazing in-car technology out there.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:04.440]   So you're driving a state-of-the-art consumer electronic device as much as a car.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:08.040]   And of course that's why they are at the CES announcing this.
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.040]   My next car.
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.680]   Battery management, entertainment, climate control, phone and navigation all through
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.240]   my Ford Touch.
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:18.640]   You can make calls, play music and manage your battery with your voice.
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:22.360]   10,000 commands and all when they started I think it was a few hundred.
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:25.240]   They're up to 10,000 commands, sync understands.
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:27.480]   We thank Ford so for taking us to CES.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:32.480]   They sponsored our coverage and for making this big announcement at a consumer electronic
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.600]   show, a tech show, not a car show.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:35.600]   But you know what?
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:40.000]   This is the most amazing technology I've ever seen.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.800]   You know, I actually went up to Scott Kelly.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.160]   I said, "Can I get in line now?
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.160]   Can I get in early?"
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.160]   You're going to get me an early one, right?
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.560]   I'm going to be the first one to drive.
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.800]   And he said, "Well, you can go to Madrid and drive it."
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:49.800]   I said, "I can't.
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:50.800]   I'm in South America."
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:54.120]   So we are sending John C. Devorect to Madrid.
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.880]   He will test drive in February.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:01.320]   He will test drive the Ford Focus as we'll sum of you because they haven't announced
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:03.520]   the winners yet.
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:07.760]   All I can say is, and I'm really excited.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:11.680]   I wish I were going to Madrid, but Johnny C will go.
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:15.400]   And I'll tell you, if you get a chance, go to focuselectricpower.com and take a look at
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:16.400]   what Ford has done.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.680]   It is amazing.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:19.680]   And I cannot wait.
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:21.880]   I actually don't yell at me.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:23.760]   I may trade in the Mustang for the Focus.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:24.760]   I would.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:29.080]   I think the Mustang is pretty amazing, but I'm not buying another car like my CRD.
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.680]   This is the sweetest car I've ever seen.
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:32.880]   Last gasoline car I've ever gone about.
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.120]   And I'm telling you, fully equipped, I think it's $25,000.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.760]   I mean, this is just amazing.
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.720]   I'm sure the electric cost a little bit more.
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:40.120]   Should I go hybrid, plug in hybrid?
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:41.120]   I want to go all electric.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.120]   I'm going all electric.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.120]   I don't want any more gas.
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.120]   No more gas.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.120]   I like the smell.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:46.120]   I'm so...
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:52.080]   And the technology in this thing, 23 kilowatt high voltage lightweight lithium ion battery
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:56.920]   system regenerative braking charges with either 120 or 240.
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:02.800]   But if you got 240 charges in three hours, focuselectricpower.com.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.360]   Now it's time for your picks.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:05.360]   That was my pick.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.080]   I can't wait.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.080]   But no, I have another pick.
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.520]   Annie and I go, we're going to let you do your picks so you can get the heck out of
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:12.520]   Dodge.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.520]   What do you got for us?
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.520]   Well, it's quick.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.520]   It's stupid.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:16.520]   It's simple.
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:19.600]   Since we're talking about out of depth and other art apps, some people are not in sort
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:24.200]   of artistic league where they can have multiple dynamic heads.
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:27.560]   And so this is a program called C64 paint for the iPad.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.040]   Wait a minute.
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.560]   Commodore 64?
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.560]   C64 paint.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:39.440]   It is basically a version of like a really, really hugely fat bitch image editor for the
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:41.000]   iPads based on a commerce.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   So the idea is that it will actually let you want to have those sort of like landscape
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.400]   mode bits that were on the Commodore 64.
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:53.680]   So the idea is that it's kind of operate drawing with like a giant light bright where
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:11:01.120]   instead of like half instead of having like a million brush tips, it's just like big,
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.080]   huge pixels you turn on or turn off.
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:09.960]   And so maybe you can't draw like a map into freehand, but just a number of pixels available,
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:13.520]   you can just sort of like, what can I do with 32 dot version?
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.520]   It makes any idea look good.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:20.520]   Exactly.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:26.520]   I'm just going to try every single brush stroke imaginable until I get the Mona Lisa.
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:36.520]   But with 32, but it's not a minimum of like Mac, like 4.2 icons size 32 dots by 32 dots.
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:40.400]   You can just keep like selectively turning things on until you have the best model to
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:49.120]   be able to put in a 32 by 32.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.520]   And I've actually been finding it a lot of them.
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:55.560]   I'm waiting for trains and stuff is used trying to see what I bet I can.
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.160]   Let's see if I can capture the train station using 32.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:59.960]   Yes, I think I feel the inspiration.
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:03.680]   I think I feel the inspiration coming through.
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:05.680]   You crack me up.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:06.680]   Oh, thanks.
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:07.680]   I do.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.480]   Thank you, Andy and I co.
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.760]   How much is this app just out of here?
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:14.160]   I believe it's like cheap is free.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.040]   I think it's like a 99 cents to two 99.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.040]   It's you feel it.
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.040]   Every penny.
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.600]   You live in this economy.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.160]   You won't even see.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.320]   Andy, take off.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:23.320]   Great to talk to you.
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:27.120]   Thank you for your sterling coverage from the iPhone Verizon event.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.120]   That was just awesome.
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.120]   Central country boy.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.240]   I was trying to do my job, man.
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.240]   You rock.
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:32.240]   Andy and I go.
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:34.560]   Chicago sometimes and dub dub dub dub dub dub c w o b dot com.
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.560]   We'll see you next week on Mac.
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.560]   Brick Weekly Andy.
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.360]   Next week's take care.
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:44.760]   Mr. I guess, you know, we should I should have I should have given our guest Tom Anderson,
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:49.840]   the first pick, but since Andy had to go, I'll give Tom second pick.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.040]   That's almost as good.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.040]   Okay.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:56.760]   Well, we were talking about some open source before and I really like socks, the sound
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:57.760]   exchange.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:58.760]   I don't know that.
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:04.480]   And you can look at socks dot s f dot net or dot source orge dot net and it's a Swiss
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:11.080]   army knife or sound files and it allows you to convert between all the different formats.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.320]   It's command line only.
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:14.120]   So you have to enjoy the command line.
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:15.120]   I used that.
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:16.920]   It was it was a Unix Linux.
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.160]   It was a Linux.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.160]   It's a multi platform.
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:26.920]   You can get source or you can get executables for Mac, Windows, Linux.
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:33.720]   You used to have to have Xcode to get the Mac version to run, but that's no longer required.
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:39.560]   They pulled in all the libraries from their distributable and I use it all the time.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.120]   It works great.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.440]   It's S O X or SOC X.
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:46.920]   It's S O X dot s f dot net.
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:54.640]   Yeah, I used it when I was trying to do a an answering machine for they might be giants
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:59.240]   and they and it was so that they could take a dedicated Linux box, put a CD of their songs
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:04.360]   in it would automatically rotate through the songs and play the song randomly.
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:09.400]   And the problem was the songs are on CD and I use socks and a number of other programs
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:13.280]   chained together with a bash script to pull it off and quote it because it had to be an
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:18.640]   unusual encoding for the Zysell modem, the voice modem and there's pretty much the anything
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:19.640]   to anything.
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:20.640]   It is anything.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:23.680]   It's a great little tool and it does a lot more than just conversion.
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:26.040]   You can make things like test tones.
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:30.560]   Or if you want to so if you want a thousand here stereo or something like that and you
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:36.840]   want to check frequency response, it's very easy to hack together a little mp3 file that
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:39.880]   makes all sorts of bits and beeps and boops.
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:40.880]   I'm glad to know it's still around.
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:41.880]   That was a really useful.
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:44.160]   I could it was the only way I could solve that one.
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.160]   Thank you, Tom.
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:52.360]   Tom Anderson is at quicktronics.com or Tomacorp.com T O M A C O R P. That's correct.
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:53.360]   Not a corporation.
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.360]   We are not a corporation.
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.160]   Just sounds like one.
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.880]   Alex Lindsey, you'll pick of the week, my friend.
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:01.480]   So I forgot to bring my pick of the week, but I'm going to tell you about it anyway.
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:02.480]   You suck.
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.480]   I know, I know.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.480]   I remember mine.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:05.480]   I know.
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:08.800]   I realize I was looking around and I realized I grabbed the wrong bag.
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.680]   Anyway, so I am going to pick the alley.
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.760]   We talked about it a little bit, but I didn't make a pick.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:19.520]   So I ran into an alley on the show floor and I interviewed him with our live view because
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.600]   it's so cool.
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:24.240]   So everybody, I think I probably sold like 20 of them at CES.
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:25.240]   Were you using it?
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:26.240]   Oh, I used it.
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:31.640]   So if you go to Alex Lindsey P X C at YouTube, just go to YouTube and do a search.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:32.960]   I didn't make it to my blog, by the way.
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:36.440]   People who went to my blog, I'm afraid that I just put them on YouTube and it was, I didn't
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:39.400]   actually Doug Dalton put them on YouTube and then I was like, really all you need.
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.600]   That's all I need to do.
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:45.040]   So if you go to YouTube and you search Alex Lindsey P X C all one word, you know, I got
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.960]   to get better about my SEO.
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:51.520]   But you'll see some of the footage that I shot with it.
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:55.280]   So you had an iPhone four and this thing is a big heavy metal frame.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:56.280]   It's a big frame.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.680]   It's got a wide angle adapter on it.
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:00.760]   So it's got a wide angle lens, which makes things feel a little bit smoother.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.920]   The heavy piece makes it a little heavier.
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.320]   And then I was able to pop my head foot in.
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.440]   Now the audio isn't very good.
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.960]   I'm going to improve that at Macworld.
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.880]   By the way, we're going to be at Macworld like two or four.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:09.880]   So we're going to have.
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:10.880]   We'll talk about that.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.080]   That's why we were going to get the whole kit on.
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:14.080]   Right.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.880]   So I was testing it at CES to see whether I was.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:16.880]   It's done with an alley.
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:17.880]   This one?
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:18.880]   Yeah, this Yeti was done with an alley.
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:19.880]   Look at the quay.
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.440]   First of all, we're here.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.440]   Look at the quality.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:23.440]   Set it to 720.
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:24.440]   Look, we posted it.
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:25.440]   It's not even 360.
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:26.800]   Yeah, but look at 720 and I can't.
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.720]   You know, this is this is kind of mind boggling.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.680]   How good the iPhone is on video.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:31.680]   Look at that.
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:33.480]   So we're here a blue microphone.
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:37.560]   That's better than the I have to say that picture quality is better than the cameras.
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:38.560]   We're using.
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.400]   But look how nice it's.
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.400]   Now how's the audio?
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.520]   It does come with a microphone that goes into the jet.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.840]   So I didn't use that.
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:47.200]   I used a headset, which I need to improve.
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.480]   So I'm going to use a microphone.
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:50.120]   The microphone that comes with I think is very good.
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.520]   I should have done that.
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:54.520]   It was right next to my mouth and I thought it would be better but it was a little overdrawn.
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:55.920]   But you're going to see something.
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:56.920]   That's one hand.
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:57.920]   That was one hand.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:58.920]   It's good enough.
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:01.040]   So I'm holding it with one hand and I'm using my other hand to point stuff out.
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.720]   Now do you have the old alley or is there an iPhone 4 out?
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.320]   I guess mine is for the 3GS.
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.320]   So there you have updated it.
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:12.520]   Yeah, so that you can get it for the 3GS or the iPhone 4 and it is $169 retail and it
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:14.800]   has now they have an XLR adapter for it too.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:19.240]   And I'm going to be playing a lot with sound and I did like 40 of these little one minute
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.240]   videos.
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:23.040]   It really is pretty amazing.
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.240]   And it was especially if I go to 720p.
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:30.320]   Yeah, and I just felt like it was so easy and with the iPhone 4.
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:33.000]   Who needs to be accredited press anymore?
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.800]   You know, you just bring your phone with you.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:38.440]   Well, the thing is that one of the things that I found interesting was that I was able
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.920]   to with your iPhone 4, one of the things you can do is you can be sitting there tapping
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:45.080]   and refocusing and re-changing the exposure while you're talking.
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:46.080]   Right.
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:48.720]   So they're tapping on the phone like, oh, I want to I want that to be in focus.
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:49.720]   I want this to be in focus.
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:50.720]   Oh, that's kind of neat.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.720]   There's a mirror of him holding the alley.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:54.520]   Move it over so we can see the alley.
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.840]   I didn't think of that.
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:59.520]   So the the audio is the one thing.
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.840]   But that's what I'm going to fix on the next one.
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:02.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.920]   And so my next he's too good a camera operator.
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.560]   He's making sure he's not seen in the mirror.
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:07.560]   You use.
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:08.560]   I'm afraid that I was ruined.
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.560]   You ruined it for me.
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.560]   Maybe I'll show up in this one right here.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.560]   There it is.
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.560]   Let's go back.
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:13.560]   Let's go back.
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:14.560]   Wait a minute.
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:15.560]   Quick.
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.560]   Quick.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:17.560]   So there's the alley shot right there.
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.560]   Wow.
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:21.240]   And and man, it was just it turned out to be perfect.
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:23.360]   It was kind of an experiment like, oh, let's check it out.
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:27.800]   Actually, what happened was I was talking about it and somebody twittered me and I can't
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.160]   find their thing right now.
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:32.600]   But so, hey, if you want if you want to get one and I had actually ordered one, but it
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:36.760]   hadn't shown up and the owner of Ali actually lent me that one to you.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.560]   So it has a wide angle adapter.
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:39.560]   Got a wide angle adapter.
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:40.560]   Does it have other lenses?
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:41.560]   Yeah, I guess you could screw anything.
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:44.960]   Yeah, somebody who's making a 35 millimeter adapter for the alley.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:46.920]   So you use existing 35 millimeter lens.
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:47.920]   Yeah.
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:48.920]   So we talked about that last time.
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:49.920]   We just crazy.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:52.520]   But but the wide angle one that comes with it, I thought was fantastic.
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:53.520]   There it is.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:54.520]   So that's.
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:55.520]   So that's.
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:56.520]   Call it the boo-boo.
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:57.520]   The boo-boo.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.160]   And and it it worked really, you know, surprisingly well.
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:02.000]   I guess I have to update because I have the 3GS version.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.520]   And it's although I, you know, it's close enough probably if I had the right, you know, it
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:06.520]   comes with a bell can case.
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.000]   Someone told me there was some way to make that work.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.640]   It's probably a case that you could put in.
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:13.360]   But as I said, I was really, really happy with it.
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:14.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:17.120]   You know, and I didn't try the mic because I want, I thought my headset mic would be
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.520]   good and it turned out to be not.
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.520]   That's one of the things I like.
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:20.520]   They don't make the mic.
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.000]   They, I can't remember whose mic they're using.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000]   It's actually a pretty good mic.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000]   I should have.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   I just should have used that.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   It's fairly directional, which is what you want.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   Yep.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000]   Yep.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   Owly.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.760]   It's 169.95 for the iPhone 4 version 159.95 for the 3GS version.
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:39.600]   And that's everything you see here, including microphone, something.
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.320]   Something else in a bag.
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:45.880]   The lens adapter, which really is important because you can get in pretty close.
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:49.360]   What happens is also is not only is it that you can get in close, but because it's a
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:53.320]   wider angle lens, it feels more stable too because you're not, you know, you know,
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:54.320]   a good point.
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:57.720]   So you're getting in close and it just feels like a much more stable shot.
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.760]   So it's not merely the heaviness of the hand.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:01.360]   It's the fact that it's held.
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:04.520]   It's the point 4, 5, wide angle adapter on top of that.
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:05.520]   Makes sense.
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:09.200]   And as I said, I mean, it was, it really was pretty key.
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:11.200]   You know, I was, I was pretty happy with it.
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:14.040]   Well, it's kind of neat that you go to a quarter inch twenties.
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:17.840]   It's got like, you can go to a trade show and get and really shoot everything.
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:18.840]   It's funny.
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:22.100]   I end up using my phone to take pictures of stuff I wanted to remember for radius and
[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:24.000]   Kelly and so forth.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.200]   And lately I've been, you know, I post for pictures for people, you know, at events like
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.200]   this.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.280]   Usually several hundred people end up taking pictures.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:32.280]   We started doing this.
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:35.080]   Of course, when tech TV started in 1998, and that was all film cameras, you know, there's
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.240]   a little instrumented cameras.
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:39.800]   And then the tech TV era ended up going through the digital transition, which is extremely
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:40.800]   painful.
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.040]   You know, somebody with a film camera comes up, take the picture and you're done.
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.040]   Right.
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.320]   It was really painful.
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:49.160]   You know, they have a mavica that has to write out to floppy disk or the battery doesn't
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.160]   work.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:51.400]   It was always, it got slower and slower.
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:52.400]   Then digital got faster, faster.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.400]   And then it pretty much was like film.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:59.800]   Now 80%, maybe 90% of the people who want me to pose for them with pictures are using
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:01.240]   phones, camera phones.
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:04.840]   And it's slow again, because they go, they give it to somebody say, where's the button?
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:05.840]   Oh, you're bad.
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:06.840]   It just turned off.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:08.840]   What it means is painful.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.920]   And what's happened for me is that it'll get better.
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:12.720]   All of these little videos, this is amazing.
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:16.320]   I've been doing this for about a year and a half, where I take little videos to remind
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:18.840]   myself of what I want to cover the next day.
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:22.480]   And I just decided to throw up on YouTube this time around.
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:23.400]   And that's incredible.
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:28.440]   And it just, and it turned out, here's your visit to MakerBot, to Brie Pettisis and MakerBot.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.440]   So they sell this as a car.
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:32.640]   A wooden, I mean, come on, here we are at CES and he's got a wooden printer.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.880]   And it works and it was huge.
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:35.880]   It's good for Brie Pettis.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:41.880]   But it's great because you have this kind of personal, yeah, personal journalism.
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:44.960]   And I have to say, the quality is spectacular.
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.960]   Video quality is great.
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.360]   Now, the booths are fairly well lit.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.200]   This probably doesn't do that well in low light.
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.280]   Yeah, you probably know less.
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:55.520]   I know that there were a couple places where it was a little grainier.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:56.960]   But I got to say, when it's well lit, it's...
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.400]   I love the tap to focus.
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.160]   Yeah, it works really well.
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:03.920]   And it just, and not only just focus, but just exposure.
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:06.640]   And so you're sitting there kind of doing all that stuff really quickly.
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:07.640]   Anyway, it was...
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:08.960]   So the alley really made it a lot.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:10.240]   I thought a lot better.
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.080]   So go to pix.
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:15.000]   youtube.com/alexlindzpxc.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   Yes.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   Sorry, it was...
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000]   Like I was going to put it on my blog.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   How many videos did you put up there?
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   I think I put like 40 of them up there.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.640]   And I was going to put it on my blog because that's why it's kind of like my...
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:27.880]   That's like my internal YouTube thing and I was going to put it on my blog.
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:31.680]   And then I'm afraid that I was so tired at CES and I was like, oh, these got to get
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:32.680]   up.
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:34.720]   So Doug put them up and I was like, oh, it's not put them on the blog.
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:36.120]   It was just not put on YouTube.
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:37.880]   The power of now.
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:38.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:42.520]   Well, and what I didn't do, which I'm going to be doing at Macworld, is posting them while
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:43.520]   I'm actually walking.
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.520]   Right.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:45.520]   So I'm going to do them and then I'm going to upload them.
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:48.280]   You know, I'm going to upload them during the day rather than...
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:49.440]   And I'm going to get a better audio.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:55.960]   I got a really overkill audio plan with a little sound devices mobile pre and a headset.
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:23:01.280]   So I want to show you a pic that I think a lot of you will probably already know about,
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:07.240]   but I was the app store that introduced me to something called and yet it moves.
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:08.880]   Now this has been out since 2007.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:11.080]   It was a student project.
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:16.040]   They put it on we using we wear PC, Mac and Linux.
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:20.440]   And it was one of the first apps to enter the app store.
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:21.440]   And you know what?
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:23.400]   It is so...
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:24.400]   It's a platformer.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.880]   It is so beautiful.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:29.400]   I think and so fun to play and so interesting.
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:30.600]   I think you're going to like it.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:31.600]   So there's my guy.
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:34.360]   He's just going to walk through this rock area.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.320]   He jumps with W.
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:37.320]   What is this?
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:38.320]   This is called and yet it moves.
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:41.560]   It is a platformer and I can't remember what's like five bucks.
[01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:43.480]   It's not very expensive.
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:44.480]   So I'm learning.
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:45.480]   This is the very beginning.
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:46.480]   Now you rotate the...
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.480]   This is what makes it interesting.
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:49.480]   You rotate the world like that.
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:50.480]   Whoa!
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:51.480]   Whoa!
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:52.480]   Whoa!
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:54.960]   Crash.
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:58.240]   So this is an absolutely fun game.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:23:59.240]   I have to say.
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:00.360]   I really love it.
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:03.320]   The sound effects and the soundtrack is great.
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:06.240]   And you know, it's a hand drawn.
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:07.600]   It's a physics game.
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:09.120]   And the problems get fairly complex.
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:11.480]   I mean really at the very beginning.
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:12.480]   But you know what?
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:17.080]   Because I've installed it on all my Macs because it's an app store and install.
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:18.080]   And so...
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.080]   Oh, now I got a problem.
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:20.240]   See those rocks are in the way.
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:22.120]   So you know what I'm going to do?
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:23.120]   Watch this.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.520]   Boom, boom.
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:25.520]   And...
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:28.280]   Oh, there they go.
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:29.280]   Now let's see.
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:30.920]   Jump over to this one.
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:31.920]   Whoa!
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:32.920]   Whoa!
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:33.920]   Whoa!
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:34.920]   Whoa!
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:35.920]   Crash.
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:36.920]   Anyway, you get the idea.
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:42.680]   It's really a fun game.
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:44.600]   It's called, and yet it moves.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:48.280]   And it is very addictive.
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:53.360]   And what I like about it is it's Genesis as a student game that was then kind of put
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.920]   out on Linux and Mac and PC.
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:58.480]   It's also on Steam if you want.
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:00.560]   But they basically put it everywhere.
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:01.560]   But I love it.
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.560]   It's one of the App Store games.
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:07.120]   And I found it because it was very highly rated in the App Store.
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:09.080]   And again, there's the advantage of the App Store.
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:10.280]   And that's why I fear it.
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:12.520]   I fear the App Store.
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:14.480]   I think it's going to be so compelling.
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:15.880]   Resisting is futile.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:16.880]   It's resistance is futile.
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:20.800]   It's going to be so compelling to developers and users that I love the discovery.
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:23.360]   I would have never found this app unless somebody told me about it.
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:27.600]   But now I just go to the App Store and I go through the games and it's one of the top
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.600]   selling games.
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:36.160]   And it's such a good experience.
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.000]   I fear for us all.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000]   Padawanbana.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.560]   Let me just go into the games.
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:46.080]   And Angry Birds is top, but there are actually a number of, there's and yet it moves.
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:47.720]   And there's just some really interesting stuff.
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:50.400]   I've got to say, if you're an app developer and you're getting it out now, you're really
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:51.400]   going to be.
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:52.400]   Absolutely.
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:53.400]   Happy camper.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:54.400]   Launch sales 70% off.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.400]   They say for a limited time only.
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:57.560]   I bet they keep it 75% for, you know.
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:01.400]   I'm sure they're going to make a ton of money in a game more than I bet you will talk to
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.400]   them.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.640]   I bet you they're going to make more on this game than they have on all previous platforms
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:05.880]   in the last four years.
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:10.080]   Hey, that wraps it up for this edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:14.440]   A very big thanks to Tom Anderson for making a, making his way here.
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:15.600]   We really appreciate your coming in.
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:18.200]   Tom, anything you want to plug as long as you're here?
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:19.680]   No, not really.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:22.040]   I like that.
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:24.560]   Somebody with no axe to grind.
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:25.560]   Thank you for being here.
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:26.560]   We appreciate it.
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:30.800]   I also thank you for being here from the Pixel Corp, Pixel Corp.com for that multimedia
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:33.360]   guild of artists living, working and learning together.
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:34.840]   No, there's no living involved.
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:39.160]   I'd like to, I'd like to plug red, blue, 3D glasses.
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.160]   Oh, shut up.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:41.800]   No, no, I'm going to shut up.
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:45.640]   I'm going to be streaming stuff from, I call them an athletic shot glasses, but they're
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:46.640]   really, really.
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:49.040]   If you haven't gotten them before Macworld, you've got to get them before Macworld.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.320]   You're going to shoot in 3D.
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:52.480]   We're going to try to stream in 3D.
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:53.480]   Shut up.
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:55.760]   I was pushing the edge right now.
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:58.880]   You know, it is not because there's any good business models, so people keep on asking
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.880]   models.
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:00.880]   There's not even a good visual model.
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:01.880]   It's just stupid.
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:02.880]   We're just having fun.
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:03.880]   We're just having fun.
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:05.920]   So if you want to have fun with us, you need red, blue, you can get paper ones, you can
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:06.920]   get plastic.
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:07.920]   Can you buy those?
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:09.920]   I mean, on Amazon, you can get a set of three.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:10.920]   Search for animals.
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:11.920]   And on Tana's.
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:12.920]   They look like six.
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:15.040]   Now I have to wear glasses that are not only red and green, but they're going to say
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.040]   Hannah Montana on my forehead.
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:17.040]   No, I'll say anything on them.
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:19.200]   They're just, for some reason, they're called Hannah Montana.
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:23.960]   It's because they're prime, but you can buy a lot of different red blue ones on Amazon.
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:27.120]   And the reason that we're using red blue and not polarize is because then everybody
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:28.120]   can watch it.
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:30.960]   And we're going to be posting a bunch of, we're going to be doing tons of 3D this year.
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:34.640]   And we're going to start doing it in Macworld and you such a sellout.
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:37.120]   I'm having some, you know, I'm having fun.
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:38.120]   What camera are you going to use, a TD1?
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.120]   No, that's not it.
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:41.280]   We're testing a red rocks rig.
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.480]   I got two cameras on a rig.
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:44.720]   What kind of camera?
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:47.440]   I just have HP 40s on a rig running live.
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:49.480]   We figured out how to key through a mirror.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:50.480]   Nope.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.480]   They're just next to each other.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:52.480]   I guess she does.
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:53.480]   I don't want to see it.
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:54.480]   I'm going to be heavy.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:55.480]   Heavy.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:56.480]   We're not going to do handheld.
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:57.480]   We're just going to have a headache.
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:59.920]   If you want to get a headache, get those glasses now.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:00.920]   Come have some fun.
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:01.920]   Come have some fun.
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:02.920]   That's all I have to say.
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:03.960]   Actually, I guess it could be kind of cool.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.200]   It's just, you know, it's just fun.
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:07.200]   Only you, Alex.
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:08.200]   Yes.
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.200]   Only you.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.640]   I am working on HDR streaming too.
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:11.640]   That I'm interested in.
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:12.640]   We talked about that the other day.
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:13.640]   That I'm interested in.
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:14.640]   We're working on both of you.
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:15.640]   The technologies are remarkably similar.
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:16.640]   Yeah, yes.
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:17.640]   Two cameras.
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:18.640]   I'm going to do it.
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:19.640]   Yeah.
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:20.640]   So we're doing the same thing.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:21.640]   I want to do HDR from our new studio.
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:24.360]   You have my word, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:27.040]   We will never do any of our shows in 3D.
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.680]   Let Alex do it.
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:29.680]   4K?
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:30.680]   Yes.
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:31.680]   3D.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:32.680]   I'm working on 4K in 3D.
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:33.680]   HDR.
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:38.600]   If it's 4K, you don't need 3D because your eyes, your brain says, "Oh, that's real."
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:40.080]   It does it automatically.
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:42.280]   The problem is you don't have any, there's no monitors that show.
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:43.280]   We did a 4K.
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:46.160]   If you go to Matt, if you go, if you search "Mow," you're shooting at Matt Brake, "Sow"
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:49.320]   on YouTube and you'll see a 4K, but you can't view it.
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.360]   Because most people don't have a monitor.
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:55.960]   I will be here next week in the week after, but I'm going with "Sow" on a long cruise
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.800]   to South America in February.
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:00.880]   So I think you'll be doing host duties in February if you don't mind.
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:03.080]   Me and Andy are going to be tag teaming.
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:06.680]   And Macworld is when?
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:08.680]   Macworld is not next week, but the week after.
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:16.240]   So a week from next Thursday, we're doing Macworld Live at Macworld.
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:17.880]   And we are going to be streaming fools.
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:18.880]   That's all I got to say.
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:19.880]   We got live news.
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:20.880]   You're not going to do...
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:21.880]   Wait a minute.
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:23.080]   You made me a liar already.
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.920]   Is that Mac Break Weekly going to be in 3D?
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:25.920]   No.
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:26.920]   Oh.
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:27.920]   Sure?
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:30.160]   Well, if you want it to, you just said nobody will never do in 3D.
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.160]   I could do it in 3D.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:32.160]   Okay, let's do it in 3D.
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:33.160]   Here's what we'll do.
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.160]   We'll do a separate...
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:35.160]   We'll do it.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:36.160]   We'll do it.
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.160]   That's how idiot I am.
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:38.160]   How do you see it?
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.160]   You streams in 3D?
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:42.280]   What we'll do is we'll do a separate stream that's just 3D.
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:45.720]   I was going to mark the calendar and say, "This is the day that..."
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.720]   That Leo's lie got to...
[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:48.720]   Right, so...
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:49.720]   So we...
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:51.320]   Well, I didn't have to even mark it on the calendar.
[01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:52.320]   So a minute.
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.320]   We'll do it for you.
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:58.760]   I said, "Yeah, that's how we'll do one camera view that's in 3D from Mac-worldly."
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:01.920]   So January, I guess that's the 27th to 28th.
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:04.800]   We will be live with Mac Break Weekly on a Thursday.
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:08.840]   So we'll flip flop on normal Tuesday record time with Windows Weekly.
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:09.840]   That'll throw the Mac people.
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:15.600]   They'll tune in for Mac Break Weekly on that Tuesday and it'll be a Windows show.
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.800]   And where will we be in 3D?
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:18.880]   And then where will we be?
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:19.880]   Where will this be?
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:20.880]   We're in...
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:24.320]   We've got a booth on the floor in West Hall.
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:29.840]   And Paul, we'll get you on to talk about Macworld Expo next week.
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:30.840]   That's exciting.
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:31.840]   So you're going to be there all...
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:34.000]   Yeah, and we're going to be doing some stuff from the floor.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.400]   We're going to be doing a lot of 3D from the floor because we're doing a lot of 3D stuff
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:38.400]   at our booth.
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:41.600]   And then we're going to be wandering around giving people a real live...
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:43.960]   I'll have all the information next week.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:47.000]   But people are going to be able to ask us questions as we go from booth to booth and we'll
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.960]   be able to ask people while we're doing it.
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:55.440]   So we're going to be doing streaming a lot of streaming from Macworld and going from
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:59.280]   not maybe every booth, but a lot of the booths and letting people play along with us.
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:01.800]   So it's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:03.040]   So 11am we're doing...
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:06.400]   On the 27th we're doing Mac Break Weekly.
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:07.960]   We have iPad Today.
[01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:08.960]   We'll certainly shoot it there.
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:09.960]   Can we stream it?
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:10.960]   Yeah.
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:11.960]   We're going to have a live view there.
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:12.960]   Okay.
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:13.960]   So...
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:14.960]   Well, we'll have a live view too.
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:15.960]   I'm just...
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:16.960]   Okay.
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:22.360]   So we're going to have both Mac Break Weekly and iPad Today from Macworld Expo January 27th.
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:26.400]   It's coming to San Francisco January 26th through 29th.

[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:35.000]   Macworld Expo.
