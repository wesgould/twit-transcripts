[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Renee Ricci is here, Andy Ennaco and Alex Lindsey,
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.800]   and we're all waiting for Apple's quarterly results. We'll tell you what to look for, what not to look for,
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.040]   and why not to worry about the Apple-is-doomed headlines that are all coming out now. It's all coming up next.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.000]   Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.040]   Netcast, you love.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.040]   From people you trust.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.080]   This is Twit.

[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.320]   from Apple. And it is a full panel today starting with Andy Ennaco from the Chicago Sun
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.360]   Times. Wonderful to see you. Wonderful to see everybody on the panel today.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.480]   Let's get together every week and talk about all this stuff. So is Renee Ritchie from iMore.com
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.240]   and Montreal. Nice to see you Renee. Nice to see you too, Leo. It's a bright shiny apple earnings day
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.280]   and about to watch the market crash in burn. When will the earnings, I know you'll be keeping
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.960]   an eye on it. When will the earnings come out after the market closes? The press release usually
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.760]   hits around 1.30 p.m. Pacific and then around 2 p.m. they start the conference call.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.240]   Okay. So we'll keep an eye out. We'll probably just as usual, although this was supposed to happen
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.960]   yesterday, normally they do it on Tuesday. They were supposed to happen on a Monday.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.680]   Yeah. And Bill Campbell's funeral was that day, so they moved it day over so as not to conflict.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.320]   I see. That makes sense. Coach, did we, we talked about Coach's passing last week, didn't we?
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.800]   Oh, also here look from our nation's capital, Alex Lindsay reporting.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.040]   From the Pixelcore and you have a beautiful. I don't know what else to put back there, you know,
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.360]   because I'm in DC. I actually am in DC, but you know, I feel like you put a picture behind
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.760]   DC behind you say, yes, I'm here. So I can think of this. So you could put a,
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.320]   I could have put a spaceship back there. You could put anything back there. I think it's kind of
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.280]   nice, appropriate signal where you actually are. I thought that would be the way to go.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.520]   Alex, please tell me you weren't in DC like all weekend or at least not until not yesterday.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.800]   Why? Why? Yesterday? I was here yesterday. Oh, because I was, I left DC at 4 p.m. Yesterday.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.400]   And we could have had a coffee. We could have. I was, I was here all day.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.040]   It was, it was, it was, well, actually, actually, I just posted, I just posted something to Instagram.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.440]   I rather, excuse me, I just pasted an Instagram link to Jason probably should have in the,
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.200]   in the Skype chat that so I was probably within, I might have been within a few feet of an office
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.400]   building that you were inside, attending to one of my own personal work projects that I don't
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.000]   like to have to explain to people. But what were, what, what, what street were you on?
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.440]   I was, if there's a Northern street and a Southern street, I was on the Northern street of the two
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.000]   of that, of that office building. Not the, not the one with the, they both have a water feature.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.160]   One has a smaller one. I was with the one that had the smaller water feature.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.480]   Right. These guys are talking to some sort of spy code. You guys got spycraft going on.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.080]   Yes. Part Lit for America.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.120]   Part Lit for America. That's the president for you and me.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.920]   So I now have parody briefly. I don't have parody. I'm sorry. I don't have parody with,
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.320]   with Renee Richie, because we got the pink MacBook. But now I realize you have two, you son of a gun.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.960]   I can never catch up.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.840]   Two hands, Leo.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:20.160]   So this, this is the one we got for Lisa and nominally for testing before we hand it off to Lisa.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.320]   She really loves her MacBook. I love the Mac too.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.400]   It doesn't, again, rose gold is, I think, not as pinky as pink would be.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.640]   But so tell me about your, your tests and the benchmarks and so forth.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.000]   So I mean, it's got an upgraded Skylake processor with the upgraded Intel integrated graphics,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.720]   which are okay. I mean, Skylock is the talk to the tick that was brought well. So they did the
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.360]   die shrink down to 14 nanometers last year with the original MacBook. Now it's, it's got the new
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.920]   architecture and it's, you know, it's a little bit faster. 25% faster on graphics. The thing
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.280]   that's really impressive with this though is the new IO. It's just so fast. I'm hitting, I think,
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.800]   700 and 900 and over 900 on input output, which is scary fast on the SSD chips.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.360]   So that to me is, it's not a huge, it's still PCIe, right? Yes, it's basically chips on a board.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.240]   Chips on a board. It's not M2. I'm not too, is that I don't even know what that means. I know we put
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.560]   an M.2 in our PC and that was a separate slot than it was. It's still PCIe.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.360]   Yeah, I have that some. I have all the details somewhere, but it just, it scores really fast for
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.040]   that. It's about 25% faster on graphics. You know, if you use that, but I still, I put 4K video on
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.480]   this and it kind of looked at me and stared. And then I did it on the A9x packing iPad Pro and it
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.280]   just went through three streams. So I don't have a lot of sympathy left for the core M series.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:52.640]   Yeah. Having it on the PCI Express bus probably makes as much of a difference as M.2 would.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.800]   Apple has its own apparently high Apple. Hi, Apple. Hello, hi, Apple.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.400]   And that's in the MacBook, it was in the MacBook Air starting in 2013 and I'm presuming
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.240]   that that's what they're using. They're getting really good at storage controllers.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:18.400]   Yeah. Hi, Apple. Hi. All right. And so you think now, is it a worthy upgrade for an existing
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.120]   MacBook owner? Probably not. No, I mean, well, the difference is that if you really love,
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:29.200]   if you really love the MacBook form factor and price is nowhere near the top of your feature list
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.480]   and you were just sort of curtailed by the lack of power in the original. This was like,
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.280]   a little bit over that if it was like close, if you're saying yourself, if this only were 20%
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.880]   faster, I could really use it, then this would be the right thing. Yeah. And again,
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.760]   if money is nowhere near the top of the things that you're worried about in life,
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:51.120]   this I was shocked when I, you know, this is the top of the line 512 gig hard drive in a M7
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.680]   processor 1849 with tax. Of course, we're not waiting though. Like if you were waiting to
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.680]   get a MacBook because you thought they would get faster with Skylake, then you're good to go.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.600]   Better. What about battery life? Battery life is an hour better. That's mostly due to the
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.000]   efficiencies in Skylake. It's more efficiency processor. So you get 10 hours. So before it was
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.360]   all day battery life, we're all day meant nine hours. Now that all day means 10 hours.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.680]   So you and you verified that that is in fact the case. I mean, I tried to run it down in coffee
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.400]   shops three days in a row and I closed the place down before it ran out. So I was super happy with
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.640]   it. It'll take a while. One of the problems are if you just bring over an existing system,
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.000]   then there's all sorts of quirks in that. But if you start fresh, that's not realistic because
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.080]   most people don't have a freshly installed computer with them every day. So initial
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.520]   battery tests are fine, but I want to see how it does a month from now, two months from now.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:43.680]   This has no moving parts and is probably the thinnest and lightest out there. I mean,
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.200]   there are others that claim thinner at the edge, but I think nothing is as thin all the way through.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.480]   You know, the HP Spectre is thinner at the edge, but then when you get to the little middle,
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.120]   because all of them are kind of like, yeah, boat, it's thicker. They're all silly thin. They're
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.960]   close to two dimension. I'll leave it. We can't get as thin as you need it to be. And two pounds is
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:08.000]   as light. I think extra battery life helps a lot. A little extra power helps a lot. Some of the
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.040]   things people don't like about the MacBook were not fixed. The keyboard is the same, right? Yeah,
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.120]   and I quite like this keyboard. Other people hate it with a fiery vengeance. I make a lot of
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.600]   mistakes on it, even though it's my main laptop at home. I still make a lot of mistakes on it.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:28.720]   Nevertheless, the the keyboard is outweighed by the lightness and the thin. My problem is that
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.320]   it's not consistent. So I've gotten so used to it. When I was using the MacBook Pro full time,
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.280]   it was the same as the keyboard I had on my iMac was the same as the keyboard everywhere.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.600]   I never had any learning gaps. Now I use the MacBook a lot. And it's just different. So then
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.160]   when I go back to the MacBook Pro or the iMac keyboard, it feels weird again. Well, that's the
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:49.200]   problem. I don't just use one keyboard. I use probably a half dozen keyboards day in day out.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.680]   So including the iPad Pro keyboards. Yeah. So any different keyboard is just always just a
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.360]   little bit of mental adjustment. Yeah. And it's just to me, the short travel for some reason seems
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:05.840]   to affect my accuracy. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. I turn off that autocorrect
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.960]   thing almost immediately too, because that just never gets it right for me. No, it's always wrong.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:15.520]   Yeah. Well, anyway, it's out and it's there and it's available. And we got ours yesterday. I ordered
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:23.280]   it that I think doing Mac Pro back break weekly rather than I ordered it. So that was a week. Not bad.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.760]   And it's in rose gold now. So if that's what you've been waiting for, you can get it.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.760]   Pink. I own the word pink. So the only difference is is that the role because it's rose, like it's
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.520]   a metallic color. It really gets it has almost a deepness to it and different light. It looks
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.760]   copper. It looks bright pink. It looks deep. It looks gold. It looks silver. And that to me just adds
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:47.360]   a lot of depth to the color. It is not pink, pink. It is it is so weird. It's a it's a Chanel pink.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.520]   I think it's like that looks gold, right? If I tilt it this way, that's gold.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:58.480]   So I just I think it really it just it's I like it. I mean, it's not bad and it's not so pink that
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:03.200]   you go, wow, you have a pink computer. Do you? And the other one's not yellow. The other one,
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.960]   they call it gold. So I mean, whatever, it's just a marketing term for me. But I like it. I think
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.200]   it looks really nice. I've been one over and I suppose it's the Apple Coolade or something,
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.640]   but that's everything I get now. Even if it's an Android device, I'll get gold if I can get a
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.920]   rose gold. I'll get rose gold. I like kind of like gold. But you know how it's fat. It's
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.560]   fashion is a fad. The next year, it'll be silver. You know, gold is the new black, whatever.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.960]   Sapphire or something. Exactly. And everybody'll go, oh, I have to have that. So
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:39.840]   lightish red. Some people say, I don't think it's lightish red. All right, we're going to talk
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:45.120]   about Apple's earnings call what to expect. Some say this is going to be a bloodbath in the
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.560]   sense that it's going to be the worst quarter Apple's had in over a decade. We'll find out what
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.760]   our panel thinks about that. And an excellent article by Ben Thompson is trajectory. He calls
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:03.040]   Apple's organizational crossroads. Apple kind of led the way in organizing its executive team and
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:10.880]   its divisions along functional lines. But is that the right way to go? And good on Apple for
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:18.240]   refusing China, not for one, but for two years in a row, the source code, the family jewels.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:24.080]   Do we have it? No, can we have it? No, no, no, no, no, you can't have it. You can't have it.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.920]   Our show today brought to you. Actually, you know what? We can keep going. I have one at,
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.680]   oh, let's do it now. And then that way we could just swing into the show
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:38.800]   with that with full force and vim. We're doing our homework on the first day of the long
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:45.360]   weekend. It is. It's like that, isn't it? We go sledding all weekend and on Monday too.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.400]   Let's do some homework and then we can have fun. Okay, boys.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:55.520]   What does it sound good? Yeah, I tried to teach the kids. It's easy hard, hard, easy. It's better to
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.480]   do hard, easy than easy, hard. It's more fun. Does that make sense? I don't know. Yeah,
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.440]   and every job that must be done. There is an element of fun. You find the fun and snap the jobs
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:11.280]   again. You were right. It was rhyming right right to the end there. And it fell. And every
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:17.040]   task to undertake becomes a piece of cake, a lark or a spree. It's very clear to see that a spoonful
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:22.160]   of sugar makes the world go around. Actually, it makes the medicine go down. Medicine go down.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:30.800]   Medicine go down. But a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down in a most delightful way.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.720]   Andy Enaco is our own built in rap genius, ladies and gentlemen. We thank you.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.520]   They can't sue if we don't use the music. It's just lyrics. Really? Is that true? No.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:47.840]   No. I have to say, I didn't think Mary Poppins right away. I thought that sounds like E coming.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:53.760]   So that was impressive. Our show today brought to you by ITProTV. We know a lot of you are ITPros

[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.040]   important. For those of you who want to be getting those certs, getting that information in your
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:12.240]   noggin is the beginning of a great new career. And in both cases, ITProTV is the place to go. ITProTV
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:17.840]   is exactly what I think what you're looking for. Certainly what I'd be looking for. Instead of
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.640]   pouring through boring books or going to a technical school, it can cost an arm and a leg. You subscribe
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:28.880]   to ITProTV for a low monthly cost and you get access to more than a thousand hours of content.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:34.080]   And new courses added weekly. They've got two studios. They do what we do. You can watch them
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.200]   live nine to five Monday through Friday as they do their new stuff. And course topics include,
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.680]   of course, plenty of Apple stuff, including Mac integration, basics, Mac management, basics,
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:49.520]   Apple certified support professional, Apple certified technical coordinator. You can get those
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:54.480]   certs, but you can study many more things as well and really expand your capabilities and
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.600]   your knowledge from networking to security. You can get the certified ethical hacker
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.680]   cert. Wouldn't that be just to have? I want that. Learn about crypto,
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:12.320]   wire shark from Apple to Amazon to Cisco, the Coptia, the ISC squared. Of course,
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:18.160]   all the Microsoft certs too. They're all in there and more all the time. You can watch free
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:24.720]   live and they have a chat room just like us so you can participate there. But they have so much
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.880]   more when you subscribe, including the virtual machine labs that allow you to set up and run
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:36.800]   Windows Server and Windows clients on any browser HTML5 browser, you can do it from a Chromebook.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.560]   You don't even need to own Windows. They have the practice exams from Transcenter. That's
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.440]   worth 109 bucks. That's free with your account. So you can take the exam before you take the exam.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:51.360]   That's a great way to prep. And because you're paying a low monthly fee, it's very affordable.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:57.040]   And because they're geeks and they know the thing they hate, the thing we hate, when it's hard to
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:02.560]   cancel anything, it's a renewal thing. So it's easy to cancel because they know you may get the
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.320]   certs and say, "You're done." I have to say though, they're a lot of IT pros who never cancel.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:12.000]   They told me the other day that the Harvard University IT department all subscribed to IT
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.800]   Pro TV because they want to keep their skills up. They do have corporate and group pricing
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:22.880]   available and universities galore use IT Pro TV, not just Harvard, but MIT, UCSD, Stanford and more.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:31.120]   Normally $57 a month, $570 a year. We got a special deal. Of course we do. You could try it free for
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:36.720]   seven days when you sign up using our code MAC break 30. Check out their courses, the live stream,
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:42.800]   the Q&A sessions, which are kind of like study groups. But you'll also get 30% off your account.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:47.040]   That makes it less than $40 a month. Or if you buy a year and if you buy a year, there's an
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:52.160]   advantage to doing that because you can download everything and watch offline. $399 for a whole
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:57.120]   year is an incredible deal. But you have to use the offer code MAC break 30. And oh, did I mention
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:01.520]   that's forever. That's not just for the first year. That's forever. I think a lot of people just
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.920]   keep watching IT Pro because the instructors are engaging. Tim and Don and the crew, they're fun,
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:11.040]   they're funny. And you learn and you, but you have fun. You can watch it on your Roku, your Chromecast,
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.960]   your Amazon Fire TV. Yes, they have an Apple TV app. There they are at the Twitch studios.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:21.600]   Built by fans of Twitter for fans of Twitter, they say go to it pro dot TV slash Mac break.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:29.680]   M A C B R E A K. Use the code MAC break 30 to try it free for seven days. 30% off. We love them.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.760]   Good friends. We've and I feel like we've built that we've built the business together.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.800]   It pro dot TV slash Mac break.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:43.760]   Let me just ask this question from the chatroom Ryan 94 in the chatroom because we had the question
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:49.520]   on iOS today yesterday as well. I have an iPad Air 2. Is it worth upgrading to the pro?
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.120]   Do you use it? Yeah.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:59.280]   Everybody. I think we all say yes, right? Absolutely. iPad Air 2 is old enough. It's not always just a
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:04.000]   speed upgrade. It's also the fact that you're getting pen input. You're getting touch ID.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.280]   You're getting the larger, you're getting Apple pay. You're getting
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:12.480]   new CPU architecture. There's just no reason not to to keep waiting at this point. You're going to
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:16.720]   such a you're such a big win out of it that it's going to be you're going to be very happy with
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.720]   it. Yeah. And I don't even use the pen and I agree because I never use a pen. Now if you're
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:27.440]   somebody like Alex or Renee or Andy, you all use the pen. You draw and stuff. Well, and I guess
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:32.560]   I don't it's not that I'm drawing like cartoon. I think about using the pen. It's not that I'm
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.440]   drawing art. So pieces of art that I'm going to put on the wall or anything else. What I'm really
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.360]   doing is sketching out ideas. And so number one is when people send me stuff, I can very quickly
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.520]   just grab it and draw on it. Say change this move this over here and update things and circle them.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.520]   And it's just so much more organic. The second thing I do a lot of is I draw little sketches to
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.800]   throw into keynote. Like I'm working on a presentation and I'll sit there and just sketch. So this is
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.880]   what I'm going to put in there. And then I just you know, just drop it in. And those are the things
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.280]   that were just that that quick. I'm going to just throw something together just so I meant
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:06.240]   hectic a mental note on it was what I just couldn't do with my iPad. Yeah. And and it's just and it's
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.480]   why I carried around a little whack. You know, the bamboo tablet was so just so I could do that on
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:16.640]   the plane. And now I don't need to. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, for sure. If the pen is a thing,
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.720]   I like the keyboard. Of course you could use a keyboard with your air to a Bluetooth keyboard,
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:27.440]   but I really like the keyboard. And let's not forget what an improved screen this is.
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.320]   You saw the display made article. I think we talked about it last week that really said they've
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:37.600]   done this right. Is this the best? I'm talking about the 9.7 by the way, not the 13 inch Mac Pro
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.040]   Mac iPad, whatever the hell. iPad Pro.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:48.400]   This the new 9.7. In fact, that's probably the one I would get. I'm a little nervous about the
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.160]   bigger one. I think it's a little too big for some people. I know a lot of people say, yeah,
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.360]   and I also know a lot of people love it. If you want it as a primary computer, you'll probably
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.920]   want the 12.9. But if you're if you want an an ancillary computer, a secondary computer,
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:04.560]   then the 9.7 is probably fine. You know, I agree with that. You know what I want to order right now
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:12.960]   from Logitech. I did not know that you could use the connector on the bottom to charge.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:18.640]   And you apparently you can. So Logitech has made something called a Logitech base.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:25.760]   Yeah. L-O-G-I-B-A-S-E, which is a stand for the iPad that charges.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:32.000]   But it doesn't charge you notice the lightning port's empty on this image of it. It charges
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.240]   through the smart connector or whatever. This stand looks really cool. It also one size fits all.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:45.680]   So you could get it for either the 9.7 or the 13. It really looks like a sleek device. I'm
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.800]   going to order it and we'll have one. I'll review one up. I think a three in the morning Daniel Bader
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.920]   looked at it for us and he really loved it. He said it's the closest thing to wireless charging
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.720]   for an iPad. Yeah, exactly. I love the wireless charging on other devices. Just the sensation that
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:02.720]   you're just simply dropping a device on a place as opposed to even if there's a connector that's
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.640]   embedded into the stand itself, you're seeding it, you're wobbling it, you're making sure it's
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:11.280]   pushing down all the way. It's just drop it, you're done. And it works with some cases too because
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:18.160]   as long as the port is exposed and you can get the base, how hard is it to
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:24.320]   mate it up with the smart connector? Because it's just it's got a magnet, right? So it goes
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.400]   it's got a positive. Yeah, I'm going to try it. But every smart connector device I have used has
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:33.840]   been stupid easy to. Yeah, I really like this idea. And that'll free up your lightning port for
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.520]   outputs and things like that. Well, exactly. On an ethernet connection.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:42.800]   Yeah, let's not forget. Either that we're going to get our computer back, you know, one way or
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:49.360]   another. I still think anybody who hopes to make this a full blown computer really
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.760]   has to think hard about it. I don't think that Apple's correct is in positioning it as a laptop
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:58.640]   replacement. It's an iPad. My mom just got one. She hasn't set it up yet, but she's replacing her
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.400]   older iMac with it because she just never she stopped using her iMac and she uses her iPad
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.640]   continuously. But she would sit there and sort of peck out emails. And when she saw the keyboard,
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.240]   she was just like, yeah, this is the next, she called it. She says it's her next computer. Yeah.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:16.000]   All right, some people, but I'm just saying it's not, it's not a given. It's not for everybody.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.960]   We're not running space anymore. I keep on trying to move away. And there's definitely things that I
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:26.160]   do that I really enjoy. I think it's it is I'm like, oh, you know, building certain things, but you run
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.480]   into walls all the time. If you're doing any kind of heart, you know, heavy use. But I think that
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.320]   for my parents, I think it's fine. I think that for my kids, it's fine. I don't think my kids are
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:39.760]   ever going to really interact with a computer. Yeah, that's a good point. You know, they're just
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:46.560]   not used to it. Yeah, I'm just an old timer. So I still think of computers as the end all and be all.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.680]   We're going to be like, back when I was your age, I didn't have, I had a keyboard. I couldn't just
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:56.320]   talk to the computer and just have it do things. Yeah, that's going to be good. I mentioned before
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:01.440]   the show started yesterday, we had Bill Atkinson came back. My new personal close, close best friend,
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:07.280]   Brill Atkinson, came back to do a how to, we helped him do a how to for his photo card app.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:13.840]   And we were talking at the end after the show. And I was asked, I said, I would love to do
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:19.840]   something with you about your kind of mindset about engineering and, and you know, because he's
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.440]   one of the greatest programmers of all time. He was one of those brilliant guys. And he said,
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:28.800]   well, you have to understand, I'm not really into computers. He said, it's just a tool for me. I
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.160]   have, I have, I want to create. And he is an artist. You know, he's a great photographer.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:37.680]   I don't, I don't, I'm not, I'm not obsessive. I don't fetishize to use President Obama's terms
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:42.400]   technology in that way. It's just like a hammer. I don't get excited about a hammer either.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.680]   It's just a tool for the thing I'm really excited about, which is the creation. And I realized that
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:53.760]   I am not that way. I'm, I'm really, I'm, I'm in love with the computers and the technology and
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:23:00.080]   the iPads. And it's the, the things that, that we, the tools, I love tools. Some people love tools.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.880]   Maybe they're not great woodworkers. They just love tools. I'm a tool guy, but it doesn't,
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.040]   but that's interesting. So I guess I bring that up and saying that's just clear that people have
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.120]   different, what, what is a computer is, is has a different meaning for some people.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.120]   The reason I'm reluctant to like, Oh, computers is because I'm in love with that.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:22.240]   And an iPad is just too constrained for me, but your kids don't have that feeling about it.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.440]   I think, I think the thing you have to ask yourself is, are you the kind of person that likes to go
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:31.600]   to Staples and Office Depot and home to yes, I love it. Like I love just go, I just love going
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.360]   and looking at all the things and thinking about the things that I could do with those things.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.440]   And I never actually do them, but I like the things that I like. No, no, it's all aspirational.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:44.960]   I like going to tools, tools, I like going to hardware stores and looking at
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:50.560]   the machete tools. I couldn't, I would, I would give me a skill saw. It's chopped my hand off.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:54.400]   I have no idea what to do with it. I got a hardware store so I know how normal people feel when they
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.240]   go into like technology stores, like Best Buy or Apple stores. Oh, interesting. So you,
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:03.120]   you humble. Oh, because you don't understand it. I know, I know. Think about any of some of them
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:07.200]   spin some of them cut some of them poke. Yeah, right. They all look dangerous to me.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.120]   Yes. I was trying to have a conversation with my, with my car with my mechanic and he was telling
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:16.320]   me something about the, I don't know the things, the coils in my car. And my gingers. And I was like,
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:21.360]   so it doesn't run right. That's what I know. Like when I push the gas, it goes,
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.800]   and I was like, that's about as all that's all I know about this car. Yeah.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:32.720]   So, there you go. So if, if you're not fetishized, you know, about compute, like,
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:39.440]   I collect opera. I have in my bag USB keys with a bunch of different operating systems.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.440]   Am I going to, I mean, I don't even, I have more operating systems in my bag than I have computers.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:49.600]   That's a fetish. That's not real. I collect programming languages. Do I write them?
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.680]   You know, I write small little things to show that I, you know, help me understand it,
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.320]   but I don't actually am I a programmer. So that's just a different attitude. And I think
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.880]   you're right. I think people who think of a computer as an appliance or a tool,
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:06.400]   an iPad is probably adequate for them. This is a piece of operating system.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:14.800]   That's a Debian stretch. This one's free BSD. This is Debian Jesse. I even have different
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.840]   versions of the same operating system. There's arch Linux. Here's one pattern unencumbered.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:25.360]   At least I labeled them for a long time. I didn't know what it was. I put it in. I don't know.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:33.120]   Oh, this is like a super secure Zeus guard. And this is my PGP keys. And there it's all in my bag.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:38.240]   Like I'm going to use that. But I carry it around with me at all times. You never know.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:47.600]   Don't show that. Get away from that. Mocking me now. So,
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:56.480]   this is the day that Apple releases it. Which quarter is this? Apple's not in a calendar system.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:03.200]   I think this is isn't this Q1? I love the track. Maybe two two two two two two two six.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:10.640]   So they're one quarter ahead. Yeah. So the second quarter is traditionally not a big quarter,
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.200]   right? Q one is a big quarter. It's yes. And this is usually like everyone's bought there.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:20.240]   Christmas holiday gifts. And now they they realize in horror how much money they spend.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:26.080]   And then don't buy anything. So we would normally expect a kind of a slow quarter, right? Yeah.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.760]   But it's year over year that they're looking at. And one of the I'm pretty sure we're going
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.600]   to actually hear this on the call. It's going to say, you know, Apple, you've sold an iPhone
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:37.280]   to pretty much everyone on earth. And we're really shocked in the poll that you've shown
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:41.760]   absolutely no strategy for getting Apple stars on to Mars. So we're just going to burn your stock.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:50.160]   So it is apparently widely agreed by everybody that their results, even though Apple is not
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.720]   announced anything that their result probably what Apple's done is leaked this. So right to kind of
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.960]   they set expectations as they always do. They do like forward looking statements in the previous
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.240]   quarter in their guidance. I'll let people to believe strongly that they were going to have
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:06.000]   their first year over year not they were not going to exceed year over year for the first time.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.280]   January cooks sales growth was one percent in January cook said at the January call,
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:15.680]   the last quarter call. He thought phone sales would fall for the first time ever.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:22.880]   But in general, the market is expecting Apple's worst quarter since 2003.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:28.560]   Well, I think we need to put perspective where the quarter is 2003. We need to compare that to
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:34.000]   what they're talking about as your year over year growth given that I'm not sure what the exact
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.160]   numbers are, but I'm willing to guess that the quarter this quarter will equal the yearly income
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:46.480]   of 2003 in that in that whole year. I was trying to find it before you before that came out, but
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:51.040]   it's not the worst quarter that Apple's had since 2003. It's just the worst year over year growth.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.280]   And it's like this is predictive because we don't know yet. We'll find out in an hour.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:00.160]   It's sort of like on top gear when they show you the Veyron on a track and they're accelerating
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:05.040]   and it goes from zero to 100 in no time flat. And then James May starts going, the air is like
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:09.120]   toffee. The air is like toffee and the car just you you expend so much power trying to get even
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.840]   just a little bit faster. You're all your all your rapid acceleration, which is what Wall Street
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:19.200]   wants. They want growth. It happens when you go from almost zero to millions and then once
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.640]   hundreds and hundreds of millions people and there's a billion devices on the market,
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.600]   that growth takes an enormous amount of effort for very little gain.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:34.080]   Just go back to that in perspective. For 2005, I couldn't find it back to 2003.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:42.880]   There quarterly was 3.24 billion. And now it's going to be what 50?
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:50.800]   Just a little bit more. It's a OK. So I mean, it's not time to panic is what everybody's saying.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:54.480]   Wall Street with panic. But the stock's going to tank, right?
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.920]   Or they'll buy on X because they usually sell when things are good and they buy one.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.400]   Yes. All right. So it's hard. It's psychology Leo.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.720]   It has nothing to do with reality. It's the real point.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:10.320]   Well, for investors, it does. Because I mean, you know, as well as anybody else that the market,
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.320]   if you're if you're gambling with other people's money and their retirement funds and their stability,
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:19.120]   it doesn't matter that you recognize that Apple is a perfectly strong company. There's no reason
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.560]   for them for a bad quarter to set them back at all. But you do know that a
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.600]   cajillion people are going to be selling selling off on based on that and now the value of your
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.480]   own holdings goes way down. So you have to make the choice based on what the numbers for all of
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:37.680]   your other investments. Does it pay for you to stay put? And I'm not worried about it. Does it pay
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:44.320]   for you to buy now that the stock is devalued? Or is this a bad time for your holdings to be
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.320]   suddenly worth three or 4% less than they were before?
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.800]   Now, as tempted as I am to ask you guys for buy sell signals, I'm not going to say that because we
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:58.880]   do not a you'd be crazy to take any stock advice from me and I would guess from any of the other
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:04.320]   panelists. And so we and we don't want to be in the situation of making investment recommendations.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.680]   We talk about Apple as a technology company from a user's point of view.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.280]   We put our money in atoms not in stocks now. We clearly have no strategy.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.400]   No, we don't have a strategy. We just buy more Apple crap is what we do.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:19.280]   So let me give you what the stock market's expectations are. This could be your scorecard
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:24.560]   because of course if Apple beats expectations, even if it's down, it will go up. If Apple is
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.560]   lower than expectations, expect a severe drop in the stock price. I think that's a point
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:33.040]   spread in gambling. Yeah, it's the over under ladies and gentlemen. Here's the over under.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:41.680]   So consensus expectations. iPhone sales down 18%. Now, that still means they sold 50 million as you
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:51.120]   say. So don't freak out, but 18% drop. iPad drop 20 20% and that's on many drops quarter after
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:56.240]   quarter after quarter. This would be the ninth straight drop, ninth straight quarter. Max sales
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:04.080]   flat, but Mac is a small unit wise, a small portion is just 4.6 million units. On the other hand,
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:08.400]   they're expensive devices, so it's a significant amount of money. The PC market is down so much
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.960]   that the Mac looks good by comparison. Yeah, the Mac looks flat is great.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:19.520]   Flat is great when you're in the PC market. Profit will be down 18%. A mere $11 billion profit
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:26.080]   in three months. Tighten belts. Remember last quarter, it was the most profitable quarter
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:33.280]   in the history of all mankind, not of Apple, but of all mankind. So it's going to be down
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:38.240]   because well, how could it not? It's never been a quarter more profitable since man discovered gold.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:45.280]   But it would be the first profit drop since not last year, but 2013, last quarter of 2013.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.440]   So, you know, they've been on a roll, but every all good things was done.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:56.720]   Sales down 10%. I don't know if that is that all sales? I don't know. First quarter sales,
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:05.360]   let's see. Current quarter sales, second quarter forecast, $47.4 billion. And first quarter of 2015
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:11.680]   was $58 billion. First quarter, the forecast is for first quarter to $52 billion. That's
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:16.880]   the most previous quarter. And then the the the advisement Apple's expected to give is
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:24.080]   another drop to $47 billion next quarter. So that just so you know, that's what the
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:28.960]   analysts are expecting. So what does it mean? Anything?
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:36.480]   It's just, again, it's an acceleration thing. It is very easy to have a hit product that takes
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:42.160]   off and is growing. The iPhone started on one carrier in one country, and it's since gone on
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.800]   to become one of the most popular consumer-like kind devices in history.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:51.280]   If Apple is stagnating, it's still even if there's a good reason for it, like they've sold
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:55.440]   devices to everybody who could ever buy one, it's still stagnating.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.840]   Yeah, the question is what's next? I mean, that's the question they already want to know.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.320]   Like the iPhone fine, you could do the iPhone. What are you doing for me next?
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.160]   Yeah, the point of view that's really late.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:07.520]   Yeah, Apple has a lot of time, even if they didn't sell anything, they would have a couple years.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.840]   But given that they're going to keep on selling, keep on making a lot more money,
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.960]   for quite some time. They have a lot of time to figure out what the next thing is. They don't
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:20.320]   have to come up with it next quarter. Obviously, we're assuming they're going to do something in
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:26.000]   the car area. There is still augmented in VR reality that people are talking about,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.560]   which we'll still not make in my opinion, will be kind of a small note for what they're doing.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:37.840]   I think that when you look at the car industry, if Apple goes down that path, if they choose to,
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:44.960]   I think that's a whole iPhone level growth that's available to them, even with Tesla's success,
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.600]   and even with everybody else. I think that there's a large market that if Apple did it right.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.200]   Sure. There's a lot of ifs.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:56.720]   That's a big one. That's a whole new market. So you just don't know.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:01.360]   So it's not that there aren't possible upsides. Everybody would agree. There's potential upsides.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:06.240]   Of course. The only people that really have to worry about this is
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.680]   other people that are trying to figure out is their stock going to go up. And should they keep
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:14.480]   Apple's stock, I think that and Apple may be doing more buybacks or dividends and all those
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:20.240]   other things can affect that value. So I think that those are the only people that really should
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:25.360]   worry from a stagnation perspective. Yeah, it's stagnation, but it's at a stagnation at a level
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.200]   of revenue that is kind of breathtaking. If you really think about it.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.800]   That's a between investment and speculation, really. If there were anybody who's trying to get into
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.800]   Apple because they know that they're going to make 10% of their money over five years,
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:46.240]   that's stupid. If they're investing because they know that they're a stable company with not only
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:51.680]   a great many successes behind their belt right now, but a great many assets to develop in the future
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:57.680]   and a management team that isn't willing to just be happy that they're selling the iPhone that
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.600]   they're also trying to. They're also experimenting and trying to decide what they want to do next.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:07.360]   Yes, it's not something for the average person to talk about this. Really, this is like draft day.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:14.240]   Nobody who does that actually. It doesn't affect anybody who does not work for that company or
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:19.520]   in that industry. But if you enjoy talking about it as a hobby, you can talk about it, but just
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:25.840]   don't worry about it. All right, well, let's address Ben's article, Apple's organizational
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:32.080]   crossroads. Ben Thompson, who is really one of the great analysts for us.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:37.280]   More to Apple University. Yeah, I mean, he's a smart guy. He knows his stuff. He knows Apple.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:42.960]   He's a big thinker. Of course, a regular on Twitter, I'm proud to say. So Ben says,
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:47.440]   Apple is unique. I mean that objectively, forget about products for a moment, about which
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:52.480]   reasonable people can disagree, leave aside the financial results, which are certainly unprecedented
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:56.480]   and ignore the people you know so well, folks like Johnny Ive or Phil Schiller.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:04.000]   Rather, the structure of Apple organization, he calls it the Unitary Organizational Form,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.960]   or UForm, which is a B school, a business school term, sometimes known as functional organization.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:15.600]   The organization, the companies organized around expertise, not products. Remember,
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:21.760]   that was the big reorg a few years back, where John, for instance, Johnny Ive now is suddenly not
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:27.440]   just in charge of the design department, but he's in charge of UI look and feel across the board.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:35.600]   Product marketing is one group under Phil Schiller. Instead of having separate silos for
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:41.040]   marketing, COO Williams is the group for operations.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:47.520]   And so you don't see in the org chart, you don't see, oh, I'm in charge of iPhone and you're in
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.440]   charge of Mac. Well, it's sort of true, but iTunes has its own marketing and its own event
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.400]   team and Apple. Like iTunes and the Apple stores are almost big enough to be their own businesses.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.840]   So they have a lot of those things as well. So it's mostly true, but like many things,
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:04.800]   there are a few exceptions. And Ben points out this didn't start with Apple. In fact,
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.240]   Microsoft did this in 2013. Bummer did this.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:15.360]   He says, "When Bummer or reorganized, Microsoft to be somewhat more functional,
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:21.120]   I criticize the move as an introduction I described. I have the multi-divisional form,
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:26.880]   which is how Microsoft used to be." And it started with DuPont in the 1800s. This is interesting
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:34.720]   DuPont, which was a small company designed to provide gunpowder. Yeah, they made gunpowder,
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:42.640]   bombs. But they started to diversify into other chemical stuff. And what they did at first
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:50.480]   was to do this kind of functional organization. And it failed because it turned out that the
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:56.000]   man, even though the manufacture of these other chemicals was similar to manufacturing gunpowder,
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.760]   the sales and marketing was completely different. It was completely different. And so they had to
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:08.240]   reorganize along divisional lines. They're making paint instead of gunpowder. So even they started
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.360]   making paint because they, well, we know how to make gunpowder. It's really similar to make paint,
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:16.240]   but they realized selling paint is very different than selling bombs. What a surprise.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:24.800]   So this again, Ben, with some great insight in here. So I'm, the question is, is this kind of
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:31.120]   functional organization serving Apple that he says, the problem for Apple is that while
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:37.120]   iPhones may be gunpowder, services, which Apple's moving into big time are paint. Isn't that true?
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:40.480]   And isn't that interesting? We've always said Apple's bad at services.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:45.280]   I think they're bad at it. They're also iCloud. They're really good at things like Apple
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.040]   care and Genius Bar. So there's different kinds of services.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.920]   Remember, we're talking about online services, online software, software,
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.800]   or software as a service.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:54.000]   This was the conversation that they had in the last earnings call, right? They said,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.200]   get ready because services are going to start to be a big part of our revenue.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:02.160]   Okay. They also said a lot of good things about Apple music.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:08.640]   It's, there's something you can say about the difference between philosophy of different
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:13.440]   companies, what they think that they're good at. One of the reasons why I think Google is so
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:18.160]   good at software services at Google Docs at the calendar, all that sort of stuff is that
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:23.840]   they are absolutely willing to put out a product that they don't think is completely finished or that
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:31.840]   they don't necessarily believe is we sincerely believe this is the best calendar app that's
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:37.280]   ever been made. They're willing to put out a version that is we've here is every single thing
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:42.320]   that we wanted to do with this release. We've done it. And now it's time for us to watch people use
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:46.800]   it and figure out where we screwed up that what they often will do.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:51.840]   They'll wire up the software so that they really know what features are being used,
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:56.240]   what features aren't being used. They'll often actually do a secret beta test where
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:02.720]   you're using Gmail and you didn't notice it, but a certain button has been moved someplace else or
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:07.120]   color has been changed. And that's not a global change. They're just testing it with some people
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:11.520]   that they're trying to figure out how come people aren't using our wonderful automatic
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:16.640]   associative calendar feature to automatically create appointments. Do they not see the features
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:20.400]   or way we can make the feature more prominent or okay, they see the feature, but maybe they
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:26.000]   don't see the button. So that's how they manage to get all these services. They're not like Apple
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.120]   Maps maybe where if they really decided to say that this is the best mapping system we've ever done,
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:35.200]   it would be falling flat in its face. It's just that they keep iterating, iterating, iterating.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:40.640]   Apple really has to be in the position where they're able to say this is Apple music.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:45.280]   This is our first cut at it. We've got years and years of plans of it. We can't wait to grow this
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:51.120]   thing. They can't really do that. They have to have the hour-long dog and pony. We really think
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:56.480]   it's the greatest subscription music service that's ever been created. And I think that's where they
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.160]   can fall flat in their face. Yeah, that's in fact exactly what Ben says. He says,
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:06.560]   you know, when the iPhone is soaring as it has been, you can ignore these other problems. But now
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:11.520]   that they're going to be looking to services for significant revenue, it's going to be a big issue
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:19.440]   because services have a different business model. Services basically are effectively free on a
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:26.000]   marginal basis. The real costs are fixed, which means that they make money on volume. And Apple's
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:32.960]   not good at that. He says, the problem is Apple's culture is just not set up to excel. Apple values
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:38.720]   integration and perfection, Andy, which results in too many services being overbuilt and thus
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:45.440]   more difficult to iterate on or reuse elsewhere. Service releases and software, by the way, are
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:50.080]   tied to hardware releases. That's not how it needs to be done. It needs to be an iterative process,
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:54.400]   continual improvement. And Apple's focus on secrecy means many teams. I don't know about
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.640]   if I agree with this one. Many teams end up building new services from scratch instead of
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:06.400]   reusing components. So he has a prescription for how Apple can excel at services. He says Apple's
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:13.760]   actually at its DuPont moment. I definitely think they have to rethink how they're doing
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:18.480]   services. I mean, I don't know if they're DuPont moment, but I think there's a lot of things in
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:23.280]   front of them that they can be developing. But I think that they, I definitely think that the
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:29.360]   way services work is frustrated. I mean, we, and I have to admit, I run my, pretty much run my company
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:36.240]   on Google Box. Everything is organized in that process. And so, and I try to go back and use some
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:41.840]   of the cloud services that Apple provides. And it's just very difficult. It's pretty,
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:46.320]   but it doesn't work. I mean, I think we all agree. We understand for as users what the problem is.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:51.040]   And I think Ben has done a good job of explaining why structurally it's a problem in Apple. Something
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:54.800]   that's always been a mystery to me. It's like, why? Well, don't you just hire programmers and make
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.960]   it stuff? Just fix it. And it's, and it's simple things like they, I don't think that like they're,
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:05.920]   I mean, a good example is your, your iPhoto library or your photos library updating, you know, your
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.840]   stream. And there's no feedback to telling you when it's actually happening. You know, so you want
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:13.040]   to open it up and you want those photos to be there because you just took them. And you don't know
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.400]   when it's actually going to do that or how that's going to work. And there's no little dial that's
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:20.800]   saying this doing something. And I know that they want it to be just invisible to you, but it's
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:24.560]   when you're actually trying to use it, it's really frustrating. You know, and I don't, and I think
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:30.400]   that this focus on ease of use sometimes really undermines them. Ben quotes a book about the DuPont
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:38.640]   issue called Denial by Richard Tedlow. He says, the top management at DuPont didn't get the problem.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:44.320]   They were tied to this idea of functional. And it was the middle management, the people who were
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:52.160]   really more on the ground and seeing the problems who were wanting to start reorganizing the company,
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:58.080]   top management didn't see it. And it's also unclear sort of what you gain by what you
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:02.720]   sacrifice. So like it might improve services, but historically, other companies have not achieved
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:07.520]   Apple's level of success using that model. So with that, with that effect, Apple's product business,
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:13.280]   which, you know, while while maybe aging is still peerless in the industry, like what effect would
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:17.680]   that have company wide? Or do you need two companies, Apple product and Apple services?
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:22.160]   And then how are those companies coupled? It, it, this is one of those things, and I love Ben,
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.920]   Ben is brilliant, but it's one of those things we're saying this kind of stuff super, super easy
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.840]   implementing that Apple scale, not easy. And Ben would be the first to say it, of course.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:35.200]   Yeah, absolutely. But it's also helpful to have somebody who is not, you know, in the reality
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:40.080]   distortion field who's a little bit distant to say, well, here's what I see. He could, you're
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:44.080]   actually really right on with what you just said, because the conclusion comes from Tedlo.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:48.720]   It's extraordinarily difficult to bring out change in a big company. Leadership, it has been
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:54.560]   said consists of using minimum problems. So acknowledging, yeah, this is going to cause problems to
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:59.920]   create maximum positive change. By that standard, DuPont did well, but it could have done better.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:05.360]   Because only when the firm was on the brink of disaster, in the midst of a crisis produced by
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:09.040]   one of the worst years in its history, was it able to reconcile itself to the fact that yesterday's
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:13.040]   structure was a problem. Well, and I think that that's the case for most companies.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.280]   Right. I mean, companies change their culture when only when they have to.
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:19.200]   When they have an existential threat. You know, I mean, and, you know, it's way,
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.000]   our government works. It's the way, you know, we think that it should work some other way,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.520]   but that's, that's when you make the change. Is it too early to say Apple is faced with an
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:29.600]   existential threat? Yeah. Oh, yes, it is. It's way too early.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.040]   Way too early. On the other hand,
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:37.120]   I mean, you, you know, if you wait till the, you don't want, you don't want to get down to your
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:42.560]   last hundred million dollars. Yes. And say, well, we got three months of runway. I mean,
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:48.400]   as Apple has, and there's no achieved jobs working in another company that you could bring
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.680]   in to save the company at this point. Well, that, I mean, that's, that's kind of the point
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:56.000]   that I was thinking of just now that the only problem that I see for Apple long term is that
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.320]   they're not a company that can, excuse me, they don't seem to be a company that would
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:08.480]   let themselves be convinced to do something that's totally out of their nature.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:13.360]   Because they are one of their great strengths is that they're so consistent. They really do move
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:19.360]   not on an individual, on an individual basis, but on the basis of themselves as a company.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:24.960]   They really do tend to move as a focused unit. But it, that makes it very, very hard for someone
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:30.960]   with a different mindset, someone with a different attitude, someone from a different culture to
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:36.000]   really come in and say, no, actually, here's how we should develop products from now on. Or,
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:43.280]   yes, this is a cheap, as, as heck, $22 gadget that does one little thing. And, and many ways,
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:48.720]   it's tasteless that it's $22 and only does one thing. But we need to start thinking about how we
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:54.640]   can do things for less than $730 per unit. We have to figure figure out how to solve small problems
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:59.440]   and satisfy people at that level, not just at the people of level, people who have a thousand bucks
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:04.400]   to spend on a laptop. And it's going to be just, just like time and time again, you have stories
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.480]   about successful companies that in retrospect, had they just had Polaroid decided to go into
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:12.480]   digital early on and they could have owned the market. But the fact of the matter is,
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:17.120]   you're making this pitch to this company at a time when they are making money handover fist
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:21.520]   with something else. And you have to tell them that making money handover fist is a problem for
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:25.440]   you right now. You have to stop doing that. You have to take, you have to put money into
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:28.720]   something very, very risky that you don't know how to sell yet. That's never been something that
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:32.080]   you've ever been really good at. And that's your answer to the Marspace computer.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:39.680]   Yeah. I mean, you wonder about which Steve Jobs is getting a tour of Apple because they're
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:45.280]   they're like, that's part of the licensing deal for a codec or something is that you get to,
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:49.200]   you get to actually get a tour of Johnny Ives factory, you get to get a tour of this, that,
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:55.920]   and the other and walking away with the idea that a smaller, more agile company whose corporate
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:00.400]   philosophy and corporate culture has not been defined yet, can take advantage,
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.840]   but which any company of Apple size and age can't do.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:10.000]   So well, and obviously everybody should prepare themselves because this is,
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.520]   this is a minor discussion compared to the Apple assumed headlines you're going to see.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.000]   Yes.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:14.480]   In the back.
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.040]   Realize it.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.240]   We're talking.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:21.040]   Look, think about how deep we have to dig to find what any of us consider a viable
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:27.280]   problem that Apple is facing. We have other companies that are like, wonder, which,
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:31.920]   do we sell the desks or the chairs? Do we let them sit and be comfortable and work on their
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:35.200]   labs or stand and work on the desk? Oh, my God. Apple only made slightly less double digit
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.240]   billions this quarter.
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:40.960]   Well, and as somebody said in the chat room, they do have 200 billion plus dollars in the bank.
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:45.200]   It's not like they don't have a fairly long runway to solve these problems.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:49.840]   Yeah. I think, I think Apple, I think probably spends more time discussing how to deal with the
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.920]   extra cash in the bank and it's a big problem.
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.880]   And the, I mean, right now that's what they're going to deal with. And that's probably what
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.680]   they're going to deal with for the next 10 years, no matter what.
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:01.680]   So we're really talking in a discussion about where do they, where do they go in 10 years?
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.800]   Because I think that they're going to continue to grow through here. I mean, we're talking about
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:07.600]   sure they might have more trouble in China, but they're building up in India and they
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:12.720]   haven't even touched Africa. So there's all these areas that are still wide open.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.600]   They haven't sold a phone to everyone yet.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:20.640]   Let's talk a little bit about the car. One of the venues that Apple perhaps is looking for a new
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:25.200]   market. And there's been a lot of stories about Apple going to Germany of all places.
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.120]   They have an office there, right?
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:30.320]   The office is all over the place now. It's amazing.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.480]   Well, not just at an office designing cars.
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:33.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:37.280]   That's, they have offices designing cars all over the place.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:41.120]   Well, I mean, the cars are going to be interesting to roll out because it's not just like a computer
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:44.640]   or a phone. They're going to have to get FDC approval, absolutely. But to put
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:49.600]   any significant car on the road, it takes a lot of interfacing with those countries.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:53.440]   Apparently, Daimler had been talking with Apple about an I car.
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:58.560]   And according to Huntles Blot, which I just like saying the name of, Huntles Blot,
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:06.560]   Daimler rejected Apple's overture to jointly design a car. So did BMW.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:12.400]   So the German manufacturers apparently are not interested in partnering.
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:16.320]   Well, I mean, this is the very similar. Verizon turned Apple down when they wanted to,
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:20.240]   to, Apple had this idea of this phone and they wanted to control.
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:23.760]   And the same thing. They wanted to control the user experience.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:27.200]   They wanted to control the data and Verizon was like, no, no one's going to do that.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:31.440]   Yeah. And at the time, Apple was not known for being able to make something like a
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:36.080]   smartphone, but they certainly were able to show that they could do that. But the phone is not a car.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:40.640]   Apple, I mean, building a car might be a challenge, yes, or no.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.000]   No, I think it's definitely, I mean, I think they're both very complex.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:44.960]   You know, so much.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:50.960]   I think the reason before the iPhone is, well, is, is, okay, is, is a car more,
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:56.720]   less complex than an iPhone? Maybe, I think the issue is that the, the, the stakes are higher.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.800]   So when your iPhone crashes, it's not as big of a deal.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.080]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:02.800]   So I think that, well, there's a lot more metal is a lot more,
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.560]   it's more expensive to build a car.
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:06.000]   There's more systems.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.040]   Yeah. Yeah. And each of them has to be, is regulated in each one is the safety thing.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:16.640]   But also it's about they have, they don't know how, they don't know how a person,
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:20.720]   a consumer reacts to a consumer product that they climb into.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:24.720]   They know how to design something that people hold onto and put in their pockets
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:29.920]   and have that sort of contact with. But I have a person's relationship with the car is a really
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.400]   special thing that they have to really get worked out.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:38.240]   And there's so, as with any time we talk about Apple car rumors, there's really almost any reason
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:43.360]   for anything. One of them could be that they hired, they hired a team that, that could deliver
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:49.280]   expertise that they didn't have. But this team said, yeah, we really don't want to live in California.
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:53.200]   We want to live here where all of our, where all of our kids are in school.
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:57.520]   And also we have the resources that we need. You're going to buy us a nice pretty building with
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:02.880]   a, with one of those hot and cold water dispensers and we're not moving.
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:10.400]   And I think they're probably emboldened by Tesla because Tesla had no experience building a car
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:15.680]   either. Of course it took him 10 years, but Apple's willing to go for a long time.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:19.280]   Well, and I think that, I think that also the pre-orders for the new Tesla
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:26.400]   has, tells you that there's pent up, you know, pent up interest in something other than what is
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:30.960]   coming out of Detroit, or Japan or anything else. I mean, the first Tesla was a Lotus, wasn't it?
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:34.960]   It was. It was a Lotus Elite that they just made the drive train.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.600]   And so they did it incrementally. They learned how to do that.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:43.280]   And then they, and so, and then they made a very, very expensive Model S and then a very,
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:48.480]   very expensive Model X. And then they started looking at, as was their plan all along a low,
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.160]   a Ford, a more affordable.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:54.320]   And Apple helped make a razor and then they made an iPhone that had no 3G and no GPS and then they
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:55.280]   made a version.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.960]   Oh, I see when you're talking about the razor, you're talking about that horrific iTunes phone.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:52:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:00.720]   That was terrible.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:01.200]   The first one.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:01.680]   The rocker.
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.160]   It was terrible.
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:03.120]   The rocker.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:03.600]   The rocker.
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:04.080]   The rocker.
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:04.640]   Sorry, the rocker.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:05.680]   Leash.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:13.280]   Well, I didn't, didn't, how much did they help make it? I think they just, didn't they just like
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:19.120]   write code for, for the chipset that would actually let it play content for iTunes?
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.880]   From plays. Yeah. Fair play.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:26.800]   But it was, clearly it was, it was designed to get them a toe in the water, right?
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.960]   To kind of understand this business. I would bet.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.320]   Which is sort of like car play too.
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:38.160]   I think we know from people who have been interviewed since then that jobs hated that phone.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:43.760]   It's hard to get, it's hard to get any indication that they develop, Apple decided to develop that
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.880]   phone with the idea that they're going to have a partnership with Motorola.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:52.080]   So it's possible that they did do, it is certainly possible that they did it with the idea that
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:56.880]   we're going to have close, a close relationship with Motorola and we can ask them lots of questions
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:01.440]   I get at because they're trying to woo us into making a special phone for them.
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:07.520]   They will give us all kinds of data that we, that only Motorola has about markets, about
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:12.240]   penetration, about networks, about efficiencies that will help us build an iPhone. I wouldn't be
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:12.960]   surprised at all that.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.840]   There's also that fear that Alex was talking about where you see that people's music listening
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:20.560]   is moving from unilateral, a unit tasker, iPods to multitasker, converge devices and
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:23.680]   people are carrying their phones and really want to carry a phone and an iPod.
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:27.280]   So if you start getting onto phones, even if it's rudimentary in the beginning, it's the same
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:32.080]   way you can start getting into cars, even if it's through a car play system, it helps move them
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:33.600]   into the general ecosystem better.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:41.440]   I think it gets them into the social ecosystem, which is valuable. A lot is, it's underestimated
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:47.440]   how important it is to just have your executives and your engineers socializing with and talking
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:52.080]   to executives and engineers from other industries and other companies because that's how you get
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:54.480]   a really deep understanding about how a certain business works.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:55:01.440]   I don't know exactly the reasons for doing the rocker phone, particularly I didn't understand
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:07.760]   after I started using the rocker phone. I got my loaner unit, but I don't know, it's also possible
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:11.680]   they're trying to flag about if we don't know what we're going to do with phones yet, we're
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:15.520]   definitely developing something we don't know what we want to do yet. Let's try on an experimental
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:19.840]   basis what it would be like to write software for someone else's hardware product.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:28.000]   Like could we simply add iTunes functionality and create something like car play for phone devices
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:33.280]   so that if anybody wants to have iTunes compatibility, we will quickly be able to build them what they
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:39.680]   need for that. Who knows? But there's just so many variables associated with this.
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:45.920]   Building a car is going to be so difficult, not just because of the complexity of the actual
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:52.400]   thing they're trying to build, but of who Apple is. Tesla is an unfounded, when they started
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:57.200]   making cars, they were a brand new company that never shipped anything. So they could make a huge
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:04.480]   win by simply saying we're going to build you a really expensive luxury sports car that accelerates
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:09.520]   like stink. It's like you will blow everybody else off the line with this because it's a purely
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:15.840]   electric car. And also if you are a true car nut, if you are a true motor nut, we will give you
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:20.320]   a really cool electric car that doesn't look like it started off with a golf cart or something
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:25.040]   bought at Toys R Us. Then they built that into we're going to build a luxury car that's a practical
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:31.920]   sedan that's also going to be appealing to people who A have lots of money and B are going to appreciate
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:35.840]   being one of the first to have a practical electric car. And now it's three or four generations and
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:41.200]   they could just build and platform as they go. What would happen if Apple creates an Apple car?
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:46.240]   They are not and designed to design it with the intention of selling to consumers.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:53.200]   And they designed it the way they designed the Mac Pro where, okay, we built you a cylinder,
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:58.720]   a tube. And we're going to try to impress you with the cooling system,
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:03.600]   because we know that the thing that you really gets you all excited about spending $3,000 on
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:08.480]   a powerful computer is the cooling system. And this wonderful tubular shape. And the rest of the
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:13.600]   car people are going to be like, we absolutely don't care about the manufacturing process you
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:19.120]   came up with for making those fenders. We don't give one quarter of a dam that how much we how
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:24.640]   much recyclable materials are going into the tires. We'd use this to drive to work every single day.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:30.800]   We spent two and a half stinking hours on stinking I 93 every four five stinking days a week to try
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:35.200]   to get to work and back. And you have given us something where whenever we tell you that this is
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:40.080]   not this isn't good for us. We don't enjoy this. We think this is ugly. We they you want to show
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:45.520]   us a video of a head on a white background talking about chamfer angles. Yeah, but I think that I
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:49.840]   think that there's I think that the the fighting the the battleground for cars I think is pretty
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:53.840]   well defined at this point. And and that is that they have to be self driving they have to be electric.
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:57.760]   I think there's there's definitely a market there that in somewhere that wants the other
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:02.000]   stuff the one that drive their own and have gas cars. But the growth market is in the is in those
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.280]   two areas. And I think that you know everybody knows that at that point. What Apple has to do is
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:09.680]   implement that well and then they can add all the design. And I think that you know I think that
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:13.440]   that is where we're going to continue to see growth and right now it's very disruptive because
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:17.440]   you've got a bunch of manufacturers that are trying to figure out they're in the same place
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:21.360]   that Apple's in. So if you look at Detroit or you look at Japan, you know they're trying to figure
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:26.880]   out in Germany like how do I you know move into the new market that I know I have to be in but I
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:30.880]   can't figure out how to get out of the market that I'm in. You know and I think that that's going to be
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:36.240]   something that we're going to see. So it's it is a disruptive moment where this if Apple's going to
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:41.200]   get into this market, it's going to be in the next I think probably the next five or six years.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:44.000]   You know I don't think it needs to be any faster than that. But I think that after that,
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.080]   you know I think we look 10 years down the road and you know it's going to be mostly electric
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:52.000]   and mostly self driving. You know I think that because I think people have especially when you
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.080]   see that that groundswell of what happened with Tesla. You know people don't want to drive any
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:59:00.080]   more they want to text. You know and they and they don't want to and they don't want their hands to
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:02.480]   smell like gas. I mean I don't think it has anything.
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:07.920]   But boy that's really living in the future because there's a whole lot of I mean it's easy for us
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:13.120]   to say this is exciting but that's years off. Well I mean there well it's not that far off. I mean
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:18.080]   the wrong. I think it's I think it's fun. Well I'm buying one. I'm not saying I'm not into it but
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.600]   I feel like that's going to be a long way off. Well let's just say the people who buy new cars.
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:24.720]   You know like like you know like like there is a you know when you're looking at where is where's
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:28.560]   your next market going to come from and how is that going to look. You know there's there's definitely
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:32.320]   a group of people that I mean probably your largest group of people that are going to buy them
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:36.160]   for their own individual use. They're going to be looking for that. You know and I think that
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:42.160]   you know like my kids are older than 16 and my older kids are older than 16 and they have no
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:46.800]   interest in driving. You know like they like they drive a little bit here and there but it's not
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:52.320]   interesting. It's the car makers cry. Well they don't want to they don't want to they don't want to
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:56.240]   drive. They don't identify themselves with their car the way we did when we were when we were younger
[00:59:56.240 --> 01:00:00.160]   they identify themselves with their Facebook page. You know and so it's a much different
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:06.240]   view and that is what's coming. You know and you know so I think that is a it's a huge shift and
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:11.920]   it creates the instability that's required to move into the market in a way that hasn't been
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:16.080]   available prior for the last 20 or 30 years. Well that raises another problem that really hadn't
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:20.480]   occurred to me before. If that's true what you're describing people who don't have an emotional
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.160]   connection to their car they're just they just want to Facebook while they get from here to there.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:30.560]   Apple has never really made the statement that we make practical functional. We sell
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.400]   all millions and millions and millions of these because they're simple they're practical they're
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:39.440]   functional they're not terribly exciting. It's always because we we know how to create a
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:44.480]   a device that people will actually form an emotional connect connection to an emotional commitment to.
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:50.480]   So if that's true then they might be giving away one of their biggest advantages
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.080]   by trying to build a true self-driving car. I do think that there's a difference between
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:58.880]   self-driving and simply assistive car technology. I think assistive car technology will definitely
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.200]   see it almost everywhere in the next five years. We already have I think legislation that says that
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:07.200]   every car has to have some sort of collision avoidance technology built into it.
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:12.880]   It is as simple as a front facing radar that if the person driving the car does not stop in time to
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:19.120]   just avoid rear-end in the car in front it will stop the car itself. We can get 95% of the way
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:27.920]   with technologies that can do things like hit a turn signal to merge onto I-95 and from the point
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:32.960]   at which you enter the on-ramp to the point at which it's time for you to start to enter local
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.640]   traffic again. It's doing all the lane changes is keeping up with traffic is doing all this sort of
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:42.400]   stuff for you. That's 95% of this is solvable but the last 5% is the stuff that kills people if
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:48.560]   it's not working. I don't think we can just can't I'm not comfortable predicting when we'll get like
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.880]   a first 100% self-driving car. Well I don't think I don't think we need to I think that I think
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:57.120]   one of the problems that Tesla and Google and all these other companies have is they're trying to
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:01.440]   solve that last mile when most of us would be really happy if it just got on the highway and I
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:06.160]   didn't have to think about this anymore. Like most of us don't care about going from the highway to
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:11.440]   my house. What I care about is the hour and a half I'm going to spend between quarter Madeira and
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:18.480]   the Presidio. That's where we're really trying to solve for most
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:23.520]   of us. And I think that they're trying to solve a problem that I think they could solve iteratively
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:28.240]   over a longer period of time. Then trying to make it completely self-driving.
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:33.680]   The other question is so if they're going to enter into a market that's really completely
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:38.240]   new to them. The phone was not completely new to them. It was a type of computer with a smaller
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:45.440]   screen. The iPad was not totally new for them all this sort of stuff. Why would they pick cars
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:51.120]   and not anything else? Why not create cookware? Why not create housing?
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:56.320]   I thought they were all around the systems. Yeah. Well, of an addition where you can
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.920]   ever get the door open because it's made of 18 karat gold or sorry rose gold.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:05.120]   There's so much about that that's puzzling. And here I'm not saying that any of this stuff
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:11.120]   is ridiculous. It's that I'm in one of those positions where I have to be humble and admit that I have
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:16.240]   no idea why they would be really interested in doing a car. I have no idea why a company like
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:21.280]   Apple would even think that if they're pursuing that because they think it's an interesting product
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:26.560]   or an interesting problem to solve. I have no idea why they would think that a car would be the most
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:32.400]   interesting way to solve to create a transportation product that's poised to be to take over the
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:37.280]   next 10 years. I just don't have no. We've talked about this before that I think that if they were
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:43.200]   to create a $5,000 to person electric vehicle, something like an electric motorcycle, but more
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:48.240]   key towards people who want to just ride safely between five and 20 miles from their house,
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:52.560]   that is a big idea. That could be revolutionary. That could sell to a lot of people who were,
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:56.960]   like you say, are not terribly interested in buying cars anymore. It's just an electric car
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:00.720]   seems like such a boring idea to me. Well, I think that I think that when they started doing
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:04.640]   the development, I think it wasn't probably as boring as Tesla has made it. You know, I mean,
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:10.000]   because they're figuring this out. But I think that when you look at what market you want to go
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.160]   into, typically what you're looking at is what's broken and something that I think I could fix.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:18.640]   And cars are kind of backwards. I mean, they haven't changed very much for a long time.
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:23.840]   The idea that they're burning up all this gas while they're just sitting there,
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:29.600]   it's kind of insane. The interface hasn't changed in a long time. It's very similar to cell phones.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:36.640]   Nothing had changed. And so it's easier to disrupt. I think TVs are another place that are
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:41.920]   easier to disrupt. Although, I don't think that's something that Apple's probably continues to look
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:48.480]   at. Really? You think so? That wasn't just some strain? No, I think that those are, I mean,
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:52.320]   because I mean, I'm sure they're looking at a lot of things. Oh, I think they're looking at it.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:57.440]   But I mean, I got to tell you, I would just want one TV to do everything. I'm tired of all
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:01.040]   like I pick up this controller for this and this controller for that and this controller for this
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:07.280]   and I can't get this to work. And you know, it's just it is so after. So, so, so, so here you are
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:12.880]   with a product that's inside your home already, a way to integrate so many different gadgets and
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:18.960]   services that Apple is really kind of dressed without having to change any laws anywhere.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:26.400]   They don't have to hire. They don't have to hire a 23,000 and 3,341st lobbyist to work in law,
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:32.720]   working for Washington for the interest. It's again, electric car is just here is a car that the old
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:38.720]   fashion and the wrongness of the car is based on how we design every town and every city to be
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:44.720]   beholden not to human beings, but to automotive to automobiles that we are giving up so much real
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:51.520]   estate to roads. We're giving up so much real estate to parking of cars. The revolution could be,
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:56.720]   let's try to make great a world and create cities in which every single major road has
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:02.960]   one green lane for every two vehicle lanes on it. And that's that's a big idea. That's that's
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:06.960]   incredible. That's something that's worthy of the attention of somebody who knows that they have
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:12.960]   $200 billion and they could be an unsuccessful company for a mighty long time until the the cat
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:18.800]   aliens arrive and enslave us all before they would run out of money. It's just it's just a boring
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:22.800]   idea. It's it's it's like the Apple Watch. It's a product. It's one of those you can
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:27.520]   our computer for your wrist. Sure. I'll quit queen's try it. Yeah, let's do that. And now
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.520]   congratulations. You made one of those. It's not a new one of those. It's not a different one of
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:37.680]   those. It doesn't emphatically solve any problem that anybody else hasn't solved in a less pretty
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:42.320]   way, but just as easily before. But you made one of those good for you. And it's a very pretty
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:47.040]   one of those and two, that's why it would be I don't know if I have no idea what kind of car if
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:51.520]   Apple is going to make a car of no idea what kind of car it would be. If it is something like we
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:56.080]   decide we'd looked at Tesla and we decided to build one of those boy would I be disappointed.
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:03.840]   Yeah, but it's well cars hard to think of something new. Alice Cooper loves the Apple Watch. Take a look.
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:21.360]   Alice playing golf in a weird Johnny I've golf universe. Perfect day Apple Watch. So Alice Cooper
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:28.880]   now joins the list of celebrities. Plug in Apple products. You know what I noticed though that
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:32.960]   the you see a lot of celebrities who like were wearing them for the first two weeks, but then
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:37.760]   it's disappeared. The thing is Jay Leno is definitely an Apple Watch fan because he had this.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:44.560]   I watch his YouTube channel. I love his car videos. And so he had this gorgeous Seiko like speed
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:48.480]   master or whatever watch that I had to look up because it was so pretty. That's like a $3,000
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:54.720]   watch. And now I never see a video which he does not have his Apple Watch stainless steel with the
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:08:00.240]   with the serpentine band around. Interesting. So like him, I would guess I would guess has
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:04.240]   hundreds of watches, right? Yeah, control all his car. It's like Ray Donovan. He pulls out his
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:08.800]   watch drawer and has to decide which is what is he gonna wear today? But if he stays with the Apple
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:13.360]   Watch, it's interesting. That's that's telling. You should call you should call him and ask. I
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:20.560]   bet he would return the phone call. Jay. There's so many stories of like a review back of
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:25.360]   well, I'm talking like a like a review of writing something about the show, the show he's done
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:29.440]   and then getting a phone call back from him to talk about the thing. Hey, this is Jay and I just
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:36.560]   be pretty funny actually. He's not that busy. It's got a little time now. There have been a number
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:40.960]   of articles about the Apple Watch because it is the one year anniversary, right? Or this week was
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:46.000]   the one year anniversary, including a gizmodo article titled my God awful year with the Apple
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:52.160]   Watch, which that's not a clickbait. That's not a clickbait at all, is it? That's just sums up the
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:57.520]   present. That's all and gadget a little bit more straightforward. The Apple Watch one year on
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:02.320]   now. Come on, and gadget, you got to step up your game a little bit. It's funny because like
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:06.480]   my sister still wears hers every day because as she gets pages for the hospital floor that she's
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:11.200]   on, my mom wears it every day because it lets her answer phone calls and texts when her phone is
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:15.360]   in her purse or in a different room. My best friend wears it every day. My boss wears it because,
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:19.280]   well, one of my bosses wears it because you can control his Tesla with it or they turn it on and
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:24.320]   things. The people around me are still wearing it. I don't have any, and I'm infectious. People
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:28.480]   around me will just like, you're enthusiastic for it probably. Yeah, it goes over. But I mean,
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:32.960]   like they've had seen less tolerance for gadgets over my time too. Yeah.
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:38.320]   The vendor of Harder War writing says, "The best thing I could say about the Apple Watch is
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:44.320]   I still wear it." That's true. If you still wear it, that's pretty solid recommendation. Unlike,
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:49.280]   you know, a lot of things like a computer, a watch is something, you know, that's pretty personal.
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:52.480]   If I leave my Apple Watch behind in the morning and I've done it like once or twice, it's just as
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:56.400]   bad as leaving my phone. I look at it. I don't see it. I start like keep looking at my wrist and
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:00.080]   it's not there. And I get upset every time and all these little things that I've gotten so used to,
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:05.440]   like the notifications and I have off the on it. My patterns of behavior are built around it now.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.760]   And I think it's probably the most important device I have other than my phone, which sounds
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:15.120]   ridiculous because I can't do anything nearly what I can do on a Mac or iPad on it. But it just became
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:21.760]   part of my behavior. Yeah, for me, I think that being able to just get slack notifications and
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:25.840]   text notifications is pretty much, and then also having my phone sit around and have it ring.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:32.080]   And my watch is telling me that somewhere my phone is ringing. I think that it doesn't, for me,
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:36.080]   it doesn't have to be any more complicated than that. I think that it has a lot of room to grow.
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:41.680]   But those features by themselves are enough for me to just not wear a regular watchkin
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.160]   or any other watch because it ties into my iPhone well.
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:49.840]   DaVindra does go on to say, I still can't recommend the Apple Watch. It's a device for a particular
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.920]   lifestyle of digital addiction. By its very nature and price is just not for everyone.
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:58.240]   I think I kind of agree with this assessment, but I wouldn't call it an outright failure as
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:04.800]   so many have. Analysts estimate Apple sold about 12 million. So just by sales alone, it's not a
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:11.360]   failure. So just like today, Apple went outside and had a bad quarter. There's a different definition
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:15.920]   for an Apple bad quarter. Right. 12 million watches means it's the most successful.
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:20.320]   As companies would give their own, oh, no, oh, no, a week after they released it, you could actually
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:26.320]   go into the store and buy the mall that you wanted. All right, I'm sorry. The price drop helped,
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:32.800]   according to one study, it gooseed sales. This is from Apple Insider Goose sales. 250%.
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:40.160]   This is actually slice intelligence. Slice knows because, and I use slice, it's an app
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:44.880]   that tracks your purchases and then tells you when they're on their way. But they also get some
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:51.760]   really valuable information about what people are buying. Slice also said the iPhone SE is
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:56.480]   popular among people moving away from another operating system, mostly Android.
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:03.200]   Apple's nylon bands performed well. 60% of first-party strap accessory sales.
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:11.360]   And extra band sales among buyers who purchased the accessory now stand at 1.3 bands down from
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:16.240]   1.6 in March. That's when Renee bought about 3,000 of them and really messed up the
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.400]   statistics. Oh, I just got this one, Leo. Oh, what's that one? Leather? That's the Hermes
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:27.360]   Fuzz French for fire. Fuzz. It's quite nice. I was much more
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.800]   impressed with it than I thought I would be. Good. It's free. It's
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:37.280]   I think that a lot of things that we think of that are not big successes that Apple has,
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:41.040]   you know, they turn out to be, you know, there's a certain level of inertia that Apple has, you know,
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:46.080]   so the maps, you know, were a disaster when they released them. But I still think the number is
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:50.960]   something like 60% of iPhone users were using it. It's just it's what is installed, you know,
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:56.800]   and so so it overall was successful. I think that when you look at the Apple music, you know,
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:01.520]   they're doing okay, you know, I mean, they may not be doing the number that they had talked about
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:06.400]   or what everyone wanted to, but I would have had to choose between. I mean, I have to admit
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:10.640]   that I test a bunch of these, so I have a lot of them, but I but choosing between like Spotify
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.720]   and I'm using the only reason I haven't dropped Spotify is because I haven't moved all my
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:19.920]   playlists over, you know, and there's not any thing that it adds that the music doesn't do. And what
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:23.280]   music has is like, and sit there and just say, I want to listen to a song and it just, you know,
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:27.680]   the exception of a few artists like Beyonce streaming music services are pretty much a commodity.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:31.120]   They're all the same, right? Exactly. And that's that works to Apple's advantage. If it's a little
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:35.920]   bit built in, it's built in, it's a little easier. Yeah. You know that, you know, and so and I think
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:40.480]   that the watch is in the same, in the same respect, they don't have to, it's not explosive, but it's
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:44.400]   still something that, you know, it's part of an ecosystem that Apple can continue to develop.
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.560]   And I think that I think it gets into the same thing with the car is building this ecosystem of
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:54.000]   all the things that we kind of touch a lot is useful for a company like Apple, where the
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.960]   ecosystem's everything. You know, and the iPhone SE, not a huge seller, you know, like 4% of the
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:03.200]   overall sales or something, but it's the right phone for a certain segment of the population.
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:06.880]   And I'm sure for Apple, it's still a billion dollar business and it's fine, right?
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:10.160]   That's the thing with growth. When you start hitting really large numbers, you don't excel
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:13.920]   anymore. Like you're like going to Verizon was a big jump for Apple, going international was a
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:18.000]   big jump, going to big screens, going to China mobile. These were all big jumps. Once you've done
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.240]   all those, there's no, like again, a joke, but Apple stores on Mars. You can't do that. So what
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:26.080]   you do is you start segmenting your market. And they said, I think it was 30 million people bought
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:30.160]   the iPhone 5S. And that's that, you know, compared to Apple numbers, that's not a lot. Like compared
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:34.320]   to most phone manufacturers, and especially the amount of profit that generates is ludicrous. So
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:39.040]   if Apple can have the smaller phone for those who want it and start to break out really valuable
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:43.440]   niches, then they grow that business maybe not exponentially anymore, but incrementally.
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:47.120]   And again, at Apple scale, that's a lot of money. Well, it also keeps the weeds down,
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:51.520]   from Apple perspective. I mean, you know, like, like, you know, continuing to push that segment
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:55.280]   that was profitable away, you know, it means that every other manufacturer has to live inside
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:59.680]   of this world where there's not, you know, there's, they're working on razor thin margins. And
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:03.440]   as Apple does that, it puts more, a lot more pressure on everybody else making phones.
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:07.840]   And I think, you know, they'll continue to do that. And not being left out of something. I mean,
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:12.240]   I think, you know, Microsoft, you got, you know, thought that the internet wasn't going to be what
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:16.480]   it was, you know, and stayed out of it, I think getting into that. Surprise, surprise, surprise.
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:20.640]   But we know making a watch is partially, I think, just protecting the space as well.
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:25.920]   Hey, I saw some good news. Jim Dowlrimple is going to do a big party with you, Renee Ritchie,
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:31.200]   at WWDC next month. Yeah, it's one of those things where Jim calls you up and he has that laugh.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.400]   And then he says, we're doing a party at WWDC. And you go, of course we are, Jim.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:40.800]   Is it first? Have you guys done this before? So Jim has run the beard bash, not beer bash,
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.280]   which is what Apple runs, but beard bash, which had the for the last three or four years. We
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:49.680]   did an I'm more party two or three years ago. But he was looking to expand. He's traditionally
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:53.520]   done it at a smaller venue, but he wanted to do it at the mezzanine, which is really, really big.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:57.920]   I think around a thousand people big. So we decided to do it together. And he's traditionally done
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:06.640]   karaoke, which is great for the Daniel Jalkuts and Jean, sorry, of the Apple space, but he wanted
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:10.880]   to have like really big bands. So we have Department of Rock and Airplane Mode are going to be there.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.920]   Oh, fun. I've wanted to see Airplane Mode for some time. Yeah.
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.320]   Yeah, I mean, they're great. Steve Wiscus and Joe Chuplensky, who do,
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:19.600]   you know, they are Apple. They'll hit me for saying this because they're actually rock stars
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:23.440]   now, but they came from the humble roots of iOS designers. We've got apps on the apps
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:29.680]   store. They've assembled a great band. And that's gonna be a great party. How do people get
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:34.320]   invitations to that their party? So we're going to do it in blocks. Jim has taken care of that,
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.800]   but we didn't want it to be one of those things where you announce all the tickets and then
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:41.920]   people are still asleep in one or another country and then we lose out. So I believe starting in a
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:45.200]   couple days or so and Jim wanted to wait until people actually knew they were going to have
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:49.440]   tickets for Doug because we for some people that that's the way to hear.
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:52.800]   We're not right. Yeah, that was last Friday. So he's got all that set up now.
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:57.200]   And then over the next week or so, I believe he's going to be releasing blocks of tickets and then
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.960]   he'll tell people in advance and he'll be able to reserve. And then it's just once you have your
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:05.360]   ticket as first come first serve because bouncers and fire marshals ultimately decide how many people
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:09.760]   get in. So if you do get one of the tickets, just come early and hopefully it'll be a lot of fun.
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:13.440]   I kind of stole your pick there. I didn't realize I was going to be your pick, but that's going to
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:19.280]   be a good party. I'm really glad to. Is there a website we should go to? Should go to loopinsite.com
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:22.480]   or we're going to have it on loop. We're going to have it on iMore. We'll have it up on both of them.
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:26.720]   I'm sure it'll be on Facebook and all the other. As soon as the tickets are available, we'll have
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:29.840]   all that up. Right. And they'll just be an app in your Apple wallet.
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:34.320]   Is it true that Mark Gurman knew that you were going to be hosting this party before you did?
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:40.960]   I can't confirm or deny, but he probably has a multi-part series on it up somewhere already.
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.440]   If Mark's there, hope he comes too. He's awesome.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:53.520]   That has the beginning of our pick segment. And I'm going to say Renee has done his pick,
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:57.840]   right? Unless you have something else you want to talk about. I usually have an ad break when
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:02.560]   I scramble to get to the end. I know. I know. It's taken you off guard today. So and the
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:06.000]   problem is I actually left it behind, but that's why I will probably do it next week. But Apple's
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.640]   got this new section in the Apple stores that feature photography accessories for the iPhone.
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:14.320]   And there's a lot of really, really, and I will spoil it, but there's a lot of really, really good
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:20.880]   stuff in there from adapters to floaters to tripods. I mean, there's just they're doing a really
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:24.480]   good job of carrying that collection. I'll have a couple of picks. Cool. Cool.
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:32.560]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, you have a pick for us? Yeah. So last week I was doing it was all VR.
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:38.800]   All VR all day. And so we were streaming from from NAB. You read it.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:44.960]   Ozos. No, I couldn't. I was there very briefly. It was actually the first, it was the first
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:53.520]   multi-camera 4K 3D spherical live stream. So and we were doing that. Well, next VR had
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:57.520]   an empty truck without any wires that was the first truck evidently, but the Arzels and the truck,
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:02.080]   it was a trailer. So anyway, but so, but one of the problems that we had was putting graphics on
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.600]   it. So the problem you get into with spherical is how do you get the graphics to look normal
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:09.040]   when you have the goggles on? So, you know, you put whatever you're going to put on there,
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:14.000]   and you have to basically stretch all the all your graphics out so that you have like a nice
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.720]   little thing floating here. It looks normal when when your DK2 is on or your Crescent Bay,
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:23.280]   but you know, it will look all bent when you actually look when you're actually working with it. So,
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:28.720]   one of the things that we use to add those graphics, you know, is something from Dashwood
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:36.400]   Cinema Solutions, Dashwood3D.com. And they, Tim Dashwood makes a lot of different plugins, but
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:42.560]   one of them is the 360 VR toolbox. And it does a lot of different things. You can reorient your
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:46.960]   sphere. Sometimes you shot it, you know, the wrong way. You can, you know, deal with fisheye
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:51.440]   sources. There's a lot of things that you can do there, but what we use it mostly for is A
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:58.400]   to place flight elements into our, into our sphere, as well as to be able to look at this
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:02.400]   stuff. So you can be working in Final Cut and actually look at it inside of your DK2.
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:07.040]   So it is a, it's a great little plugin. I mean, it's, I think this is the, you know,
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:12.800]   the best one out there right now. And, and so if you're, if you're thinking about how do you solve
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:22.720]   this problem with adding graphics to your, your VR production, and you're on a Mac, and, you know,
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:27.440]   this is the, in my opinion, this is the best solution. I feel like Alex has now moved onto
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:33.040]   another plane. And I'm like a dog trying to understand a human. I just,
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:41.360]   it's cool. It's cool. It's nice. You want to play Frisbee?
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:50.880]   I just like whatever he said, I'm sure it's cool. Are you saying it's a camera that takes
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:59.520]   pictures, but you don't need a roll of film? What the? What the what? And it takes pictures
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:03.360]   all around you. What's your verdict? Without any film. What's your verdict on the OZO?
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:07.360]   You're now, are you working for Nokia? Are you, I mean, can you talk honestly about it or not?
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:13.040]   Yeah. So, so we are working with Nokia. Okay. So, and I don't want to get in between you and a
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:18.640]   and I fly. So, you know, so we're, we're working with Nokia. We're also, you know,
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:22.080]   we do a lot of VR work. So, right. So, with a lot of different people. So,
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:25.200]   you're going to buy that, you think? I have a one. You have a one.
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:31.600]   So, I have a. I was a, I'll be fondest, a little disappointed with the, the image quality, I thought.
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:35.760]   Well, the image quality right now is, I think, is partially also limited to the technology to get
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:41.520]   it. Stitching. Well, yeah, well, and the, well, also just the technology to get it to your headset,
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:45.200]   right? Oh, okay. Is a limitation because, you know, the, we're kind of stuck with,
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:52.480]   for streaming, we're kind of stuck with a 4K. And even that, I mean, the, the streaming 4K video
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:58.960]   takes and coders that, you know, you know, would cost a Tesla to, to, you know, there's,
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:03.280]   there's, there's an Alex and then there's a Tesla and a Tesla. And that's an increment of about $100,000.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:08.400]   And so, so each, each one of those encoders cost a Tesla. And, and, and, um, wow. And so,
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:16.000]   so having those, you know, so, so getting that technology, but what you really want is 4K by 8K,
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:22.320]   you know, so you have stereo 4K. And that's still probably a little ways away as far as bandwidth,
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:26.800]   as far as the technology to support that. So all of those things are still, you know, kind of,
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:30.800]   you know, working their way through it. I think from, you know, we, again, we use lots of lots of
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:35.840]   different, you know, VR tools and VR cameras. We built rigs, we print rigs, we do all kinds of
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:39.760]   other stuff. But when it comes to just like, I want to go out and shoot some footage,
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:44.960]   you know, the, the Ozos, the, the most, you know, production ready to do that. You know,
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:49.600]   I was, uh, over the weekend, I have, you know, I was driving through Maryland with a, with an
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:55.040]   Ozo because that's what everybody does, right? And, um, and, uh, I decided to stop at Antietam,
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:23:00.640]   you know, which is Battlefield. And I went out into the cornfield and I sat down the tripod and
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:04.560]   I, where can I see that video? I don't, I don't have it done yet. I mean, you know why?
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:09.520]   Because it takes four hours to stitch every minute. It does. It does. Well, I'm on the road. So,
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:14.560]   uh, it does take some, some horsepower to do it correctly. So, uh, but, um, but anyway, uh,
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:18.080]   but I will put some stuff up. I'm going to probably stop at Gettysburg over the weekend. And so,
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:23.280]   um, if you'd shot it with a Theta S, you'd have it up and running in no time. Yeah, and it'd be a
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:27.600]   postage stamp compared to one. It wouldn't look as good, I guess. But again, I feel like for that
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:32.240]   price, it should be, it should be like, I guess it's just the, it's the tool chain isn't there yet.
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.840]   Well, yeah. And I think that the, the, the, to shoot that kind of resolution. And I, the Theta S is
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:42.160]   great. I mean, I, I was talking to the Theta engineer and didn't realize that when you put the tools
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:46.320]   on the Mac, for instance, you can actually stream from your Theta S. Oh, I didn't know that. So,
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:51.120]   there's a, there's a Theta Stitcher that you can download from, from, uh, Rico's site. And I
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:55.120]   haven't got it quite working yet, but, but it was working at NAB with the engineer. So, we're kind
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:58.480]   of talking, you know, I'm talking through that with him. Well, let me get that working because
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:05.840]   there you go. That's a $350. Yeah. And so, but it's 720p, you know, it's not, you know, that's,
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:11.280]   that's tiny in VR world. Yeah, I understand. So anyway, but when you're talking about an actual,
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:16.160]   I want to do something like when, when we looked at the live stream of what we were doing, and,
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:20.080]   you know, at NAB, it was probably, it was the best, you know, in my opinion, the best quality,
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:27.680]   live streaming 360, you know, 3D that I've ever seen, you know, and so it's not that it's perfect,
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:31.280]   but, but we're still in early days. And just the fact that you can turn all the cameras on and
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:34.720]   transport stuff and everything else. That's why we, that's why we like that. But I think that,
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:37.840]   you know, the technology is going to keep on moving. There's going to be lots of cameras and
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:42.160]   lots of opportunities, but we're excited about that one for now. Cool. Very cool.
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:51.680]   Mr. Andy Naco, your pick of the week. I was in Washington, DC over the weekend, and I was using
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:57.600]   my, excuse me, Apple's iPhone 6s plus which I still have on loan as one of the cameras.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:00.800]   I was a, a bopping around with us. I wanted to test out a whole bunch of different apps.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:05.360]   One of the things that makes the iPhone 6, the iPhones, some of the greatest cameras in the world,
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:10.480]   are not even necessarily how good the pictures it takes are, but the fact that you can keep adding
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:16.240]   features via the greatest library of mobile photo apps you can possibly get. And one app that I was
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:21.120]   using a hell of a lot was Slow Shutter Cam. There are a lot of apps that do this sort of thing,
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:25.520]   and they are called Slow Shutter. The one that I'm talking about is the one you're actually showing
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:31.040]   right now by CojaTap software. It's got a Chajillion reviews, all of them, pretty much all of them good.
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:36.240]   Buck99. What it does is instead of opening the shutter, exposing the sensor to light, closing the
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:43.520]   shutter, right at JPEG, it works by keeping the sampling hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:50.080]   pictures and then averaging them together to create a synthetic final image. And I just dropped some,
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:56.560]   I dropped a few of the pictures I took over the weekend into the Skype chat if you happen to
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:00.640]   grab them. So one of them is to do the sort of things that you've seen there, which is it will
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:05.280]   mimic the effect of a Slow Shutter. You can tell it to please keep the shutter "open for 8 seconds"
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:10.240]   or "30 seconds" or "minute". So if they're moving objects, they will be blurred and they'll look really,
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:15.920]   really cool. And if you're doing light painting, if you want to move an LED light through, you can
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:21.760]   draw things like that there. But it also has a couple of extra really cool things. You can do,
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:26.560]   for one, you can do things that have traditionally been able, you've been able to do with cameras,
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:32.640]   such as if you're taking a picture of like a fountain and they never look cool in a picture
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:37.520]   because it freezes it. And so you get like a one-five hundredth of a second, you see this
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:42.960]   collection of droplets that isn't nearly as cool as what you actually saw. And so I actually,
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:48.400]   that one I shot, that's the World War II Memorial, I shot one with the Slow Shutter Cam, one with
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:54.800]   the built-in camera. And you can see that on the Slow Shutter Cam version, all the water is slightly
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:01.360]   blurred. So you actually get an idea of the motion of the water instead of seeing frozen shots.
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:07.840]   The other thing is when you're shooting at night, even an iPhone is, I wouldn't call it useless
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:17.440]   shooting in super darkness. But it has to just amp up the sensitivity of the sensor so high that
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:23.520]   it really is like dumping glitter on top of a decent picture. It's just so noisy, it's useless.
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:29.920]   But with Slow Shutter Cam, it's take, because all that noise is pretty much random, it is average,
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:35.280]   the app is taking, if you leave the shutter open for a long time, it's taking an average of all of
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:41.440]   these shots. So any pixel that isn't there from shot to shot to shot is probably noise,
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:46.320]   and that gets averaged out. So a picture like this of the Lincoln Memorial, and it really was
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:52.560]   exactly, there is no light whatsoever, except for on the Memorial itself, gets to be not as good as
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:59.280]   what you get with a real camera, but still very, very little noise, a good deal of tonality. And
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:05.200]   if a plane happens to fly into the shot, you will get a bunch of little blurs blips as it flies.
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:11.440]   As it flies over the thing. So as, but the thing is, it's $2, and it's like having a lens that you've
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:16.640]   got in your camera bag, where you will be out and about over the next two or three years with this
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:21.840]   camera, you'll take a picture using the iOS built-in camera app that won't turn out really well.
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.040]   And then it'll occur, you know, oh, wait a minute, maybe I should try taking the same picture with
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:29.440]   Slow Shutter Cam, and then you will get the shot that you actually wanted that you couldn't do with
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:37.440]   the regular camera app. So my pick is, there's only one thing that I really miss about not having an
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:42.080]   iPhone in my pocket every day. And that's all of these little tiny apps. I don't even necessarily
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:47.760]   miss the camera app. It's just the ability to have apps like this. I've been searching and searching
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:54.320]   for an app that's like this for Android. And the closest thing I've found does maybe one fifth of
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:29:00.240]   the job, and it's all adware supported. So there's always this floating ad at the bottom of the
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:05.120]   screen. And you're holding your, of course, you're holding your camera like this, you could almost
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:10.560]   can't avoid but tapping on the ad at the bottom. So you wind up being taken to a webpage. And it's
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:15.520]   just, yeah, exactly. And even so even if this, even if this app for Android did five times as good a
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:21.040]   job, I still wouldn't use it because it's just so damn annoying. But Apple, you iOS, you buy for
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:27.520]   $2, you can have a beautiful app that doesn't annoy you. I like that. I do. Well, we are, we've
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:32.720]   come to the conclusion of this fine episode. Now, while you were talking, I try to install the Theta
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:43.280]   S blend, it's called Blender software. Yeah. So now it's, I did the Mac version. So I hadn't,
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:48.560]   I hadn't really seen that this existed live streaming app. And I downloaded the Mac version.
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:52.240]   I registered the camera. So the first thing you do is you run it and use, and it sees the camera
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:57.360]   and it registers it. But it does hold, you have to hold the power button and the mode button at
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:01.600]   the same time, and you'll a little live button will a little live light will appear on the front
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:07.680]   of the theta. Oh, see, they don't give you instructions. So the power button and while it's plugged in
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:12.400]   and while it's not, it has to be plugged in, right? Or no, you can do a wild plugged in. Okay. So in
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:15.600]   the end, this is the mode button. So I'll hold these both at the same time. It's off right now, but
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:22.720]   yeah, it'll come on and the little, you should see a little blue live. Yeah. Hey, that was there all
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:29.520]   along and they didn't tell us. Sneaky, sneaky, sneaky Pete's now what? So now, so this is the part
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:35.840]   where I'm stopped yet. So I'm still working on this. So what you should be able to do is even open
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:40.880]   something like quick time. And when you open quick time, you should be able to see like if you do a
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:45.760]   new movie, you should see the theta, like SV, whatever, don't use the data as.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:52.080]   Okay, so it should show up kind of as a connected like it like a webcam, quick time player.
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:56.880]   Yeah, quick time player can see any can see your FaceTime or it can see your any camera. So it
[01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:05.920]   should show up as a camera now. Yeah. Okay, so a view window show movie inspector new movie. No,
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:10.480]   no, no, no, no, you're in quick time, quick time X. Ah, that's the problem. I'm in quick time player.
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:14.480]   I don't know. Quick time player might do it. But if you go up to the right
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:20.320]   under file and there should be like new movie. Yeah. And when you go to that, you should get a
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:25.440]   selector. And I don't know whether the old quick time will work. New movie recording is the only
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:29.120]   choice to have it. But I guess this would be recording. Okay. And then yeah, and then you.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:35.360]   Oh my God. There you have it. Oh my God. Now what now? What do I do? It is
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:42.320]   it is live. It's a live view from the theta. Right. And and so it works much faster for you than it
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:45.440]   may either restart my computer. I haven't done that yet. Oh, I just did this while you guys were
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:52.080]   talking. I know. What now what's more interesting about that is that you could it'll show up as a
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:57.920]   camera for a wire cast. So if you have wire cast on your computer, there's also a so I could record
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:03.920]   this and then process it with the theta streaming stuff. You could you could also could I somehow
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:10.320]   get this to YouTube so people could watch it. You could. Yes, you could. And if you use the
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:15.440]   sounds like he has a secret method though. Well, no, no, you just upload it. But no, I want to do
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:21.520]   it live to YouTube live. You yeah, you should be able to do that with wire cast. Okay.
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:28.560]   The you should be able to do it with wire cast right now because your wire cast would be the
[01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:34.720]   the input. Now it's only 720p but it's still pretty cool. It looks pretty good to me. And I
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:40.400]   didn't pay $60,000 for it. Yes. Yes. It's like here in Lothian Las Vegas.
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:47.840]   But now see now we were wondering if this had the live capability and so they had a stealth
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:51.680]   live capability in this all along. Well, and well, the big thing that a lot of us are pushing for
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:58.880]   is for them to open up the the the HDMI, which would also let us stitch a 1080p rather than 720p.
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:02.800]   But see now Leo, think about if you wanted to add ads or graphics or anything else,
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:07.840]   that's where the plugin that I was talking about. It adds it to this view so that it looks normal
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:12.640]   when you actually put on goggles or you look at it in a spherical thing. That's the 30, 60 degree
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:18.400]   ads. Well, or 360 degree lower thirds logos or you know, whatever, whatever you're going to put
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:23.200]   in there. So yeah, lower thirds heads up displays, you could have things pop up this case. You know,
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:27.680]   Leo's winning, you know, that kind of thing. So well, there you go. So it, you know, if you have a
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:32.480]   three go theta S the latest version of the and if you don't have a regot theta S five one should.
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:40.240]   Yeah, for 350. I can't. Alex, I promise you I came so close because I was in time for my
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:45.840]   Nesus wedding. They asked me to shoot the service. I came so close last week to like it's two days
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:51.360]   before I have to leave. If I buy if I have if I want to buy the theta cam, I have to do it right now.
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:56.800]   Just the idea of just having this somewhere prominent and be able to shoot 360 video of the
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:59.840]   service event. And then just choose whatever camera angle I want.
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:04.720]   You see after I get back home, did you see the photo I put up on Facebook? You should check it out.
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:10.880]   Jason, you if you if you can, of the anteater or? No, no, no, I put up. This is this is with the
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:15.920]   theta. I took a picture. So my parents had a 70th birthday over the weekend. They're both
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:21.520]   their birthdays are really close together. So we had this big 70th celebration. And on the,
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:26.800]   what I did is I just took the theta and I just set it on a table and had the entire family because
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:30.480]   it was all my brothers and sisters and all of our kids and everything else. We all just wrapped
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:34.080]   around the table. And then I with my iPhone, you know, I logged into my theta and hit, you know,
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:38.960]   took a picture. And it's there. There you go. Jump into it. But that's unprocessed.
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:45.200]   No, no, no, you should be able to double click into it. There you go. Oh, I see that's right. If
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:49.760]   you zoom all the way out, it does that. That's right. Yeah. Oh, that's awesome. How fun is that?
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:56.800]   Yeah, that was but the issue really is you have to go to, you know, theta360.com to view it. You can't
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:01.360]   right now. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, that's why I like the video because at least that works on
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:06.080]   YouTube and Facebook. Right. I think there's a way to get these images up there to do it in
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:10.480]   Facebook and I just can't quite figure out why it's not there must be. Huh? I mean, I'd be surprised.
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:15.120]   How did you trigger it? I'll go with my iPhone. So you can log into it. Yeah, you just put it on
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:20.240]   the table and then you have iPhone. So I just make it go to go away. So it
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:27.760]   disappears and so awesome. It's just a cool way of, it's a cool new way of taking pictures.
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:32.800]   If you want to play with 360 and you don't want to spend $60,000 on an OZO, these are really
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:36.160]   an amazing. You have to. I mean, if you're interested in 360 and you're thinking about it,
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:40.400]   it is the best way to think about it, experiment with it, take photos, you know, play around with
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:44.640]   things that work and don't work. Yeah. So I'm amazed. I'm getting live video out of here. This is
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:51.600]   incredible. It's like, so I have to figure out what I would love to do. Zoom out on it. You're
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:58.320]   always zoomed in on it. Zoom out on my screen. It's full screen now. Thank you. So
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:05.360]   yeah, just leave it full screen. Because then you could see that you're seeing everything.
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:09.600]   The issue, of course, is pre stitching. And you put goggles on. I mean, if you put,
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:13.600]   you know, your VR or something else on it, it's going to look like web video,
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:18.640]   you know, like web video, circa 2005. Yeah, that's unfortunate, isn't it? Yeah.
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:22.480]   But well, that's that's the cost. But but it's available right now. It looks fine on
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:28.080]   stream. This is what's bothering me. Is this looks very good quality when I'm looking on the
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:32.400]   screen? It looks fine. But your field of view is only going to be a very small second. You're
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:36.240]   zoomed in on it. You zoomed in on it. So it looks fine all the way around. But when you
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:40.720]   see, you zoom in on it. Yeah. See, there you, as you start to zoom in on what you actually see,
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:44.640]   things get much softer. That's the that's the give up. That's what you give up on 720p.
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:51.440]   It's still cool. And it's live. And you save 50, 59,000. There's that there is
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:58.720]   dollars. There's that. That dimension of four hour to one minute rendered time. Well,
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:04.800]   can the Ozo do live like this? Well, there's there's a piece of machinery that makes that
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:10.000]   everywhere. The large piece of it takes that that makes I have a quick pick that is 200
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:16.080]   Alex's. Yes. If you want to go to lunch with Tim Cook, charity auction at charity buzz,
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:22.240]   currently a hundred thirty five thousand dollars. You get two VIP passes to an Apple keynote. Oh,
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:27.120]   wouldn't that be funny if I bought it? And I got to go to the keynote. Hey, Tim,
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:33.200]   video encoder, you remember me? Bring the theta with you. You're worst nightmares back. And I
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:41.360]   got a better camera lunch with Tim Cook at Apple HQ. God, I had lunch with the iTunes guys and
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:49.440]   didn't cost me anything at Apple HQ. But this is for a good cause. Okay. Charity buzz.com.
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:55.680]   And they have other charities too with lots of famous people. Does it say what charity this
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:38:04.560]   goes to? I'm sure somewhere it does. Mere hundred thirty five thousand dollars and 18 bids.
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:10.160]   So I feel we're not done yet. Eight days left in the auction. Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:15.120]   Well, I could buy this or my Tesla. It would be it's this or that.
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:22.640]   We do the show every Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC. If you'd like to
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:27.040]   stop by and say hi, we have a great live audience. Thank you for being here. Just email tickets

[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:38.320]   I think most people, that's how they watch because who's got time on Tuesdays? Download it. Watch
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:48.640]   it at your leisure audio or video. Twit.tv/mbw or on youtube.com/twit or any podcast or you
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:53.680]   at podcatcher you choose to mention, including all the great Twit apps created by friends of Twit.
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:39:00.400]   Thank you very much. And we will be back next Tuesday. Watch, stay tuned. Renee,
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:05.040]   the the any press releases from Apple yet? Ten minutes, I think. All right. Any minute now,
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:16.480]   we'll talk about it next week. Now back to work because break time is over.
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:25.600]   We had PAX East in Boston over the weekend. Oh, fun. So, so we so the the subway was packed
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:30.800]   with athletes mostly with Cheetos in their in their beers. Actually, actually, those actually
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:36.160]   know those people are generally like they're like they're like Greyhound lean because they do
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:40.800]   they do nothing but like they don't get to endurance for these things. Yeah. What do you do?
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:46.560]   Do you do eat those in their beards? Cheetos in their beer? Well, no, not that I'm saying.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:52.240]   Do I need to look that up on Urban Dictionary? All I'm saying is like it was interesting
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:58.080]   interesting, comparing contrast because the week before that was the Boston Marathon.
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:03.120]   And so I'm going down I'm going downtown just to like do something at the library or just to
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:09.440]   meet someone and around every street corner there are like 18 people who are like fitter than 18
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:16.240]   of me is not and just like running in place at 18 miles an hour just like carrying on conversation
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:27.680]   and there you go. So not Cheetos and their beards Cheetos in their beards. Yes.
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:30.480]   Thank you
