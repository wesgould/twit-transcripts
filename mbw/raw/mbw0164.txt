[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.040]   Join us right now in the studio, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.480]   Hello, Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.160]   The star of our show.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.520]   Having a little cup of tea, I see.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.600]   This way, I have a cup of tea.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.640]   We have a pulse of tea.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.160]   I love it.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.920]   Alex has really tried to upgrade the studio here
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.880]   by bringing in a very high-quality teapot that boils it
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.840]   exactly 212-- well, everything boils it to 12.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.320]   But if you wanted green tea, for instance, you'd only want 185.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.840]   Yes.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.080]   So this pot does that.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.560]   And it does.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.000]   For French press, you wanted a little less.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.520]   I think it's like--
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.200]   Yeah, I thought French press would be--
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.720]   for me, boiling water tea, boiling water coffee.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.080]   But no.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.200]   No, you don't want to boil it.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.720]   You want to be just short of boiling for five minutes.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.160]   That's the whole one.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.720]   And he bought a pot, which looks like the pot.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.000]   The sun pot.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Isn't that-- doesn't it look very much like the canonical 3D
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   pot?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.240]   The 3D pot.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.760]   Yes, I think this is actually very close to the 3D pot.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.240]   It's about as close as you can get.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.740]   Yes.
[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.560]   And it's very cool.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.400]   But you have to have a pot.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.160]   It's just not-- well, you have to keep on making it--
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.920]   because I don't like just one cup of tea.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.560]   No longer do we not have a pot to brew in.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.480]   You know that I'm getting frenetic at about 4 o'clock
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.160]   in the afternoon, too, because it's crazy.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.640]   I don't want to miss my tea.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.800]   He's gone British on us.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.400]   Andy Inaco will never go British on us.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.640]   In fact, he's from Paul Revere town.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.240]   Exactly.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.080]   We turned out those damn lobster backs right back
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.360]   where the hell they came from.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.400]   Don't you forget it, Bally.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.600]   Andy's with the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.280]   And his website is the Celestial Waste of Ben
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.280]   with CWOB.com.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.360]   Hello, gentlemen.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.240]   Has anybody tried the new hardware that came out last week?
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.600]   No, I want--
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.960]   We were very lucky we talked about it.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.440]   Are you excited about the 26?
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.200]   I'm waiting for the big one.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.000]   So there's one that hasn't been released yet.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.200]   There's one that's not shipping yet.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.800]   It's the 27-inch--
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.280]   I ordered it.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.760]   --in your quad core.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.400]   I ordered it.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.240]   And you had a comm yet.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.840]   Yeah, of course.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.400]   How much range?
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.360]   I seven.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.200]   I think I got eight.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.360]   Yeah, I think eight is a good number.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.880]   I think 16 is a little pricey.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.640]   It's very pricey.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.640]   But I was impressed that Apple didn't completely
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.040]   gouge on RAM prices.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.520]   But it's a quad core 2.8, which is going to have some--
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.320]   It's a nice seven.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.760]   It's got a great graphics processor.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.520]   And the thing that I'm really--
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.160]   I think I'm going to get one from my house,
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.880]   but I'm really looking at getting that one instead of it.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.880]   I was going to get a 30-inch monitor.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.400]   Yeah, 27 is good enough.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.080]   Well, I mean, well, it's the same width, the same pixel width
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.760]   as your 30-inch.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.480]   It's just a little--
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.680]   Oh, well, that's perfect, then.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.680]   It's 64.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.180]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.000]   Oh, that's perfect.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.560]   In fact, I never liked this aspect ratio of the 30.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.060]   Right.
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.600]   So it's a little squarish.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.600]   It's the same number of pixels across.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.440]   And so I'm actually very excited about--
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.440]   we've been looking at getting--
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.360]   I'm trying to figure out what I'm kind of curious about
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.080]   that I haven't figured out is how do you switch between monitor
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.520]   mode and computer mode?
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.440]   And can the computer be running in the background?
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.920]   Because as we pointed out last week, it has input.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.360]   The mini--
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.800]   You can input a display port.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.160]   I need a split port.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.520]   And so I'm looking at getting one from my house.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.400]   And literally, it's going to be my iMac
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.600]   that I just plug my laptop into when I'm at home.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.200]   This is the thing.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.000]   And then I have the house computer doing whatever it's doing.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.560]   And then I can pop that input in, which I think is pretty exciting.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.480]   Andy, have you tried any of the new systems yet?
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.720]   Nope.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.520]   I haven't even tried the new mouse yet.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.920]   You haven't.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.360]   Yeah, I ordered a couple of those too.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.240]   But they haven't come yet.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.000]   I've talked to people who've used them who say they like them,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.320]   including Tony, our editor.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.440]   I don't believe it.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.920]   I believe Tony when he says that he believes--
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.520]   --after very good.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.720]   Tony, this is a place of peace and comfort.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.320]   No one's here to threaten you.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.400]   We would never want a second guess, anybody who thinks.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.920]   It's an interesting idea.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.920]   Having a touch surface on top of a conventional mouse
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.680]   is an interesting idea.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.760]   I just don't know how practical it's going to be.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.920]   I think you did.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.400]   I was very pleased that we wound up
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.680]   putting out the greatest ad whatsoever for the great cheap
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.200]   Microsoft basic mouse.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.240]   We're going to make an ad like, hold up your mouse.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.880]   Hold up your mouse.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.480]   Smash to day.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.120]   Show us your mouse.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.360]   I'm a Mac.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.560]   But my hand thinks I'm a piece of it.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.760]   Don't tell my hand.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.400]   That's all I got to say.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.920]   Practical.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.360]   This is Apple.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.920]   Well, I think if you've used the iPhone,
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.200]   you're going to have a better results,
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.240]   because it kind of comes naturally.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.960]   I've talked to a number of people who sent me email
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.480]   after our show last week and said, no, Leo, really.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.320]   I went to the Apple store, and I liked it.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.760]   I bought it, and I've gotten used to it.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.800]   Took me a day.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.200]   And now I couldn't live without it.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.760]   I love the pinch.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.600]   I love the squeeze.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.320]   I love the pull.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.320]   I love the tug.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.820]   Wow.
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.120]   I've maybe gone a little too far.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.960]   I don't think there's a--
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.960]   It's a show title.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.600]   It should be earlier than usual.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.800]   I don't think there is a tug gesture yet.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.400]   So maybe we were a little hasty, but we'll have to try it.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.240]   I'm willing to give them the benefit of that sphere.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.960]   There have been a lot of things I thought Apple was crazy about,
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.360]   and then later found out many is the time.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.320]   Yeah, and usually when anything comes out new from Apple,
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.160]   I think it's crazy.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.080]   Um, ZFS.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.080]   We hardly knew you.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.440]   This is kind of a sad story.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.280]   Apple has pulled the plug on the ZFS development,
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.640]   and it looks like it's because of Oracle.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.680]   Oracle, of course, purchased Sun, which
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.680]   created this incredible file system, the Z file system.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.280]   I guess they created it for Solaris, for open Solaris.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.640]   But Apple was in development with Sun to put it on.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.480]   In fact, I think they put a preliminary version on the server,
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.560]   didn't they, for one point?
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.080]   I think there was a test at some point.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.800]   But they've pulled the plug on it.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.760]   They've killed the forums.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.600]   They've killed development.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.720]   They've taken the source code down,
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.760]   and all because now that Oracle has it--
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.200]   I thought that Steve and Larry were friends.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.120]   It's not so much that.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.840]   Oracle has its own file system.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.840]   And we'll probably deprecate ZFS.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.400]   And then there's going to be patent issues.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.000]   There's going to be license issues.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.600]   It's a different license.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.680]   And I think Apple just felt like we just
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.720]   can't afford to create an encumbered file system.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.880]   It's really unfortunate.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.040]   Why were you looking forward to ZFS?
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.160]   Well, I think that the thing about ZFS,
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.120]   the promise of ZFS, was the ability
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:23.320]   to have a whole pile of drives that are all connected.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.680]   And it's a cloud of data.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.560]   So I can take the older drives out,
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.080]   but the newer drives in.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.000]   I'm not-- and I don't have to-- it's
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.520]   figuring all of that stuff out for me,
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.880]   and so that I'm constantly upgrading my system.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.920]   I mean, that was the opportunity,
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.080]   was that I can constantly upgrade my storage system
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.080]   without really doing anything.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.920]   Now, this is, I would say, probably good news for Drobo.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.520]   And companies like that, because that's the kind of thing
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.840]   that would be less important if you had ZFS.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.480]   And now will continue to be important,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.960]   because the idea of being able to constantly and seamlessly
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.760]   pull out storage and add new storage
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.080]   and add larger storage just as it gets cheaper
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.440]   was something that, for someone who goes through as much data
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.840]   as we do, or for a company that goes through as much data
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.720]   as we do, would be a big deal.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.880]   It was also-- it had to roll back the kind of system
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.800]   restore stuff features that Windows has built in.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.400]   And there were a lot of nice features.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.560]   I played with it a little bit on Solaris, Open Solaris,
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.720]   and I was very impressed with it.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.120]   Yeah, so I think it's-- it does sound like it's
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:28.280]   some kind of licensing thing, but it's just really frustrating.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.040]   And Apple just-- the lawyers said,
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.600]   you can't take a chance on this.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.920]   You can't do any more development here.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.000]   This is a bad idea.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.080]   Well, it's hard, because it's hard to develop for something
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.800]   that you-- it's a lot of resources.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.720]   Right.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.120]   OK, well, we've really used up all the stories of the week,
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.760]   so I think it's time to get to our fix of the week and go home.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.680]   All right, I got a story for you.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.880]   Tell us a story.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:56.440]   What's a fun time and a land far away long, long ago?
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.200]   The iPhone was dominant.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.120]   Rule the roost.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.000]   It had every ecological niche and then some.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.040]   But a long came a little critter, a little droid-like
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.520]   quid critter from a Verizon.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:14.240]   I'm now hearing that there are at least two droid-labeled phones
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.400]   and maybe more to come.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.320]   Not only is there the Motorola Sholes, which
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.080]   is the Droid Phone 1, I guess we could call it,
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.640]   but I'm hearing from my contacts at Verizon
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.160]   that you might even want to pay more attention to the HTC
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.920]   Eris or the Desire or the Droid Eris,
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.640]   as Verizon's going to dub it, which will come out shortly
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.480]   after the Droid, E-R-I-S.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.920]   And it's the same Android 2.0 operating system.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.000]   But with my contacts at better hardware, a little more robust
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.200]   hardware, he was a little underwhelmed of the original Motorola
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.520]   hardware.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.280]   I'm kind of in a mode where I have to see it
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.040]   to believe it anymore.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:55.960]   Yeah, well, soon.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.040]   We'll see it soon, I think.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.360]   I think that at the player that I--
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.720]   every phone that comes out is going
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.880]   to be the next iPhone killer.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.680]   And then-- Well, we've seen quite a few.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.080]   And the storm didn't do it, and the instinct didn't do it.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.000]   The Palm Free even didn't really do it.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.560]   No.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.960]   But there's a big difference.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.120]   Palm isn't simply giving away the operating system
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.520]   to anybody who wants it.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.640]   I mean, it seems like one of the very three press releases
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.000]   that relate to a really cool handheld device these days
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.880]   can contain the words powered by Android.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.080]   I finally got my Arco's 5 tablet a few days ago.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:29.480]   Oh, good.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.680]   What is the--
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.720]   And so I've been using it, trying to use it pretty much
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.320]   as nonstop as I possibly can.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.400]   Let's see if we can get it to actually do anything.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.600]   The reflection is stunning.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.280]   It's so beautiful.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.600]   You can see this tracking the screen very, very nicely.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.200]   Look at how it's smoothing.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.640]   Well, I've been using it a lot.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.280]   Perhaps I've been loving it a little bit too much.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.360]   Oh, wait, here we go.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.760]   And it's an Android 1.6 device.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.200]   It works not quite as well as an iPod touch does,
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.160]   but you get a big, awesome screen.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:07.760]   You get one of these, which is a memory card slot.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.360]   You get one of these, which is an HDMI port.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.640]   You get one of these, which is a USB port, which
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.400]   will dock it to just about anything.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.920]   As a matter of fact, I took a card right out of my camera,
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.880]   dumped it into here, looking at photos and video almost
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.720]   immediately.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.760]   It's a very nice little device.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.280]   It reminds you that Apple seemed to put a lot of work
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.800]   into just the simple process of making sure
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.400]   that when you touch the screen, it touches back, so to speak.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.560]   There is almost every Android application I've used,
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.240]   including on the R-Coast 5.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.520]   You don't simply scroll like this.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.680]   It means that you are--
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.760]   by doing this to the screen, you are indicating your desire
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.360]   for the screen to scroll down.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.120]   And then when the operating system recognizes that gesture
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.360]   and processes that and hands it to the right application,
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.920]   the screen does indeed scroll down
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.280]   by a certain amount that may or may not
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.360]   have been correlating to the amount at which you tap the screen.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.560]   So it's not as sophisticated.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.520]   It's not as elegant.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.480]   But it's a $200 device that does from a simple spec sheet
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.240]   point of view a lot more than the touch does.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.200]   I like it a lot.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.760]   I haven't used it enough now to really make a decision one
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.960]   way or another.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.160]   Partly, I've been having a problem finding really good
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.240]   applications for it.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.080]   Unfortunately, it doesn't use the Android store.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.760]   It uses a special-- because the Android store does not yet
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.200]   have the full range of applications
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.360]   that are designed to use this much larger screen.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.560]   And I don't think that their replacement for the Android
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.360]   store is as easy to use.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.000]   There's a search feature, but I'm not convinced
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.040]   that I've seen everything there is to see there.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.720]   But I've got Pandora on this, so I'm doing streaming audio.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.960]   Obviously, all the Google--
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.960]   all the Google--
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.920]   All the Kajagoo songs.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.120]   We love that Google.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.120]   Kajagoo songs.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.800]   All my Kajagoo songs.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.440]   Not Lady Gaga, Kajagoo.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.480]   OK.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.680]   But yeah, I mean, it does this.
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.120]   And when you do that, the browser does that as well.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.360]   See?
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.160]   It's interesting how iPhone is really set the standard.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.120]   There's certain things you have to do.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.400]   You have to, if it's a phone, when you hold it up to the ear,
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.760]   it has to go off.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.880]   It has to sense that.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.160]   It has to rotate when you rotate.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:17.520]   Look at that.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.040]   That looks pretty good.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.920]   What browser is that using?
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.720]   It uses the regular Android basic browser.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.000]   And of course, all the Google apps
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.920]   are very well optimized to work through this browser.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.600]   So doing Google News, doing Google Reader through it
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.000]   is great.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.160]   Google Docs works just fine.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.800]   All their other online Docs services work great.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.320]   Is the main difference between the five and the seven,
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.400]   just the screen size?
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.240]   I believe so.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.400]   I'm focusing on the five because it's the best
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.560]   alternative to an iPod device.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.120]   It's bigger, and yet it's small enough that you can easily
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.920]   toss it into any shirt pocket.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.840]   So it has some sort of cockamamie idea of GPS.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.560]   It does have GPS built in.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:06.000]   But there's only one GPS app that it comes with.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.640]   And you have to subscribe to a service
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.840]   to get access to the routing information.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.720]   It does have Google Maps built in.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.680]   But it doesn't really exploit things as well as it should.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.800]   It doesn't have-- I'm sorry.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.640]   I might have misspoke.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.400]   I don't believe-- maybe it doesn't even have Google Maps
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.800]   built in.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.240]   I'm open to see a map.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.840]   I do find it interesting that at least with the seven
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.680]   that you can record, you can record video to it.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.680]   Which is--
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.800]   I'm not trying the seven, so I don't want to miss speaker.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.600]   I got impatient.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.520]   And I couldn't wait for the Apple tablet.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:47.280]   So I ordered the Nokia N900, which is--
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.800]   Nokia-- now this is an Android.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:55.360]   It's MAMO or MIMO, which is a Debian based UI.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.280]   So it's also kind of Linux based, like Android.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.520]   It's a phone, though.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.880]   Apparently a very competent phone.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.560]   5 megapixel camera shoots a high quality video,
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:13.200]   32 gigs of storage, and an SD card, replaceable battery.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.200]   How much?
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.680]   Oh, you don't even want to know.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.840]   You don't-- it's almost 600 bucks.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.480]   But-- and it's not subsidized, of course,
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.880]   because it's an unlocked phone.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.480]   But T-Mobile has that new Everything Plus plan.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.800]   Have you seen that?
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.920]   I think T-Mobile kind of said, we--
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.200]   look, they're the also ran.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.960]   You got AT&T and Verizon slugging it out.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.600]   Sprint dying on the vine.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.840]   And T-Mobile, who's T-Mobile?
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.160]   But I always had a T-Mobile account
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.440]   because it's a GSM carrier.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.480]   And I could take that chip and put it in any unlocked phone.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.000]   So I'm right now using the Google G1,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.240]   but I ordered the 900.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.640]   It does work on the T-Mobile high speed data network,
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.360]   1700 megahertz network.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.520]   And they've added this new plan.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.160]   It's called the even more plus plan
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.360]   where you don't have a contract.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:10.280]   So you pay 79 bucks a month for unlimited calls, unlimited data,
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.680]   unlimited text, and no subsidy on the phone.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.520]   So you bring your own phone, essentially.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.960]   But month to month.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.440]   Wow.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.280]   79.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.480]   They got to do something.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.600]   They got to do something.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.880]   So I think they said, look, we're
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.800]   going to be the enthusiast.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.840]   Unfortunately, they don't have the best 3G network.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.920]   I don't know if it's even 3G up here.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.640]   It might just still be edge.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.880]   But I think that this is--
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.600]   anyway, I ordered the 900 because at least I'll
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.160]   have something to compare with the R-coast that you've
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.120]   got, Andy.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.320]   And by the way, it's now called the Ice Slate.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.280]   We've decided.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.120]   Did you know that?
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:45.840]   Is it Ice Slate?
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.480]   It's Ice Slate.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.560]   Ice Slate.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.600]   Because I pass--
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.240]   Yeah, as an isolate.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:51.880]   Isolate.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.360]   No, it's not an open format.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.360]   No, you can't bring your own content on board.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.120]   No, you can't just write it on.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.880]   And you have to go through the iTunes store.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.880]   That's what I think of the--
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.280]   The challenge for all of these, though, is that--
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.040]   and this gets into this--
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.880]   it's almost a timing issue is that while the Android
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.480]   has to do well, is that the--
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.840]   I really feel like the application depth
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.720]   that you have with the iPhone and the--
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.880]   Well, you know, the 900 will run any Linux app.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.380]   Yeah.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.440]   And it comes with a--
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.280]   But I'm going to be an even more--
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.440]   It comes with a--
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:26.120]   with a Firefox, portable Firefox, and Flash 9, full Flash.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.120]   Right.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.280]   Now, what would you pay?
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.400]   Well, the thing is, I think that the iPhone poses more
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.760]   of a threat to Flash than Flash poses a threat to iPhone.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:35.760]   Really?
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.920]   The thing is is that--
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.520]   HTML5, is that what you're thinking?
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.920]   Well, what you're putting your money is that--
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.200]   is that the horse you're betting on?
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.800]   No, I was-- I think I talked about this in a previous show.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.120]   But there was-- I was talking to someone who builds--
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.480]   does the online development for a large corporation
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.800]   and the CEO bought an iPhone and couldn't get to their website.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.440]   You know, he couldn't get to his own website, his own company
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.920]   and came back with just a--
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.880]   so I need to be able to get to the website with my iPhone.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.480]   And you need to do whatever you need to do to make that happen,
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.240]   which means that they had to rebuild the entire website
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.720]   without Flash to get it working.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.960]   And the thing is, is that as the iPhone becomes
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.840]   a larger and larger player in online surfing,
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.320]   and theoretically the iSlate or the iPad or whatever,
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.560]   I think that has a real threat that I think Adobe
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.400]   has to pay attention to.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:26.360]   And wrap arounds of being able to compile your Flash game
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.160]   into the iPhone is not going to solve that problem.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.440]   And I think that's a real risk for them.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.640]   I don't think Apple needs to do anything in that area.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.800]   And I don't think they will at this point.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.800]   Andy, any thoughts?
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.800]   I mean, I really think that there needs to be some sort of
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.800]   a Darwinian kneecapping of Flash sooner or the better.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.800]   I've never been--
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.800]   It's easy to say that it's bad, blah, blah, blah,
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.800]   but it's everywhere.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:57.800]   Yeah, well, yes.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.800]   I mean, so is H1N1.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.800]   That doesn't mean that we approve of it
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:01.800]   and that we want it to flourish.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.800]   We have--
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.800]   Has there ever been a situation in anybody's life
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.800]   where as a visitor to a website,
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.800]   they said, "Oh boy, Flash content is coming."
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.800]   Yes.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.800]   This is going to be so totally worth it.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.800]   The Timbuk 2 bag.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.800]   Hulu.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.800]   Well, the Timbuk 2 bag.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.800]   No, I'm not talking about being able to stream stuff.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.800]   I'm talking about--
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.800]   If you go to the Timbuk 2 website,
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:27.800]   they have a bag-configurer that is just, I think,
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.800]   one of the best examples of--
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.800]   Maybe--
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.800]   It's in Flash.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.800]   But with a little effort,
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.800]   could it have been done in Canvas and HTML5 and SVG?
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.800]   Maybe.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.800]   I have to wonder to myself,
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.800]   there are two bag sites that use a lot of Flash.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.800]   One of them is notorious for having set up a Flash site
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.800]   to act as the most in-depth, horrifying barrier
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.800]   between yourself and your desire to buy a bag.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.800]   Because there's something that--
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.800]   I don't know whether it's either that or Crumpler.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.800]   I can't remember which one it is.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.800]   Where I just want to see--
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:00.800]   I want a bag for my--
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.800]   A friend of mine showed me a Crumpler bag
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   or Timbuk 2 bag they had
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.800]   and I thought it was really, really nice.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.800]   What do you have that's appropriate for a laptop?
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.800]   But no, you're looking at a sort of a game-style vending machine.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.800]   I think this is the one.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   I think this is--
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.800]   No, no.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.800]   See, it's a good thing for--
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.800]   I don't think that's the one.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.800]   Let me take a look at Crumpler bag.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   Oh, I just made something really ugly.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.800]   No, Crumpler's bad too.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   You're right.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.800]   See, I think this is great.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.800]   Because being able to totally customize your bag,
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.800]   and I think it's--
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.800]   I think it's--
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.800]   You know, you can stick all the stuff in it that you want.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.800]   Oh, I can't even say I'm a lefty.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.800]   I love that.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:36.800]   So it gives you all that,
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.800]   and I think that it's fairly responsive.
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.800]   It is actually--
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.800]   Much more responsive than if it was an HTML site.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.800]   Right.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.800]   You know, because you mean--
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.800]   I'm clicking right through it.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.800]   All right.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.800]   Well, that's how many Windows do you have open
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.800]   and how recently have you restarted the browser?
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.800]   Yeah, it's pretty fresh.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.800]   If I usually have about a couple dozen Windows open,
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.800]   got so many tabs and it's been up for three, four, five days.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.800]   And when it's like,
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.800]   I just wanted answer to the question.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.800]   What bags do you have for laptops?
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.800]   How much do they cost?
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.800]   And many-- I mean, we're fighting.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.800]   This is a paper tiger because--
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.800]   I've just-- I've just-- I clicked on the clump crumplerbags.com.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   Yeah, oh, God, this is it.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.800]   Oh, this is horrifying.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.800]   And it took me-- it took 45 seconds.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:22.800]   And now I still don't see any bags.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.800]   Now I finally see the vending machine
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:25.800]   with all these different bags.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.800]   Oh, you're right.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.800]   It's doing it right now.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:28.800]   I'm more--
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   And there's nothing that says,
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.800]   "How about a button that says,
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.800]   "Bab--" Oh, this is horrible.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.800]   Bags.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.800]   I don't even know what I'm looking at.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:41.800]   I needed to buy my beloved Tenba bag that I've had for like 12,
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.800]   13 years, finally give up the ghost.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.800]   I was there at the site practically with cash in hand
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.800]   because I bought other kinds of crumpler bags
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.800]   before at Mac world Expo and loved them.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.800]   And I finally said, "I give up.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.800]   I'm not-- you're making it too hard for me to find what I want
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.800]   and give you my money.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.800]   I give up.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.800]   You win.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.800]   You get-- you get not to have to worry about packing this up.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.800]   You can stay in your little sofa chair
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.800]   and play your Nintendo at the warehouse like you want to do.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.800]   Because you don't want to sell me a bag, obviously."
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.800]   No, it's--
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   But-- but-- but-- okay.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.800]   Fine.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.800]   But that's not the-- what we're saying here.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:17.800]   Flash is everywhere.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.800]   It's ubiquitous.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.800]   It's on Hulu.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.800]   It's on YouTube.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.800]   It is how people play video.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.800]   If nothing else.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.800]   I admit there's--
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.800]   Flash was my flash design sites.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:25.800]   Flash was YouTube.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.800]   But they've been moving and I believe they're not moving else.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.800]   They can do something else.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.800]   Yeah, well, they still show it in Flash to the consumer, though.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.800]   Right.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.800]   But I mean, everything is backing up.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.800]   I mean, it's not-- H.264 is the engine that is streaming video
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.800]   at this point.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.800]   Right.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.800]   And so Flash is that front end, but it doesn't happen.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.800]   That's a wrapper.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.800]   Well, I would love to see Canvas and HTML5 and whatever video format
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.800]   that HTML5 ends up deciding on, because it's unknown.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.800]   I guess it's Aug Theora is the inside track right now.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.800]   I would love to see that become successful.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.800]   But I don't know.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:04.800]   I mean, it's hard to take on that much inertia, that much momentum.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.800]   Well, I mean, look at the iPhone.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.800]   It's gotten along great for the past two years without supporting Flash.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.800]   It hasn't really been a hindrance.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.800]   There are probably a couple of sites that I wish I could use directly
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.800]   like streaming video sites, streaming media sites.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.800]   But more and more of these sites are switching to different standards
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.800]   that Apple is interesting and covering.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.800]   Right.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.800]   So I mean, I don't care about Flash.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.800]   Really?
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.800]   So do you guys really think that Flash on the phone is not going to go anywhere?
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.800]   I don't sure if it's not going to go anywhere.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.800]   I just think that when you start to look at a mobile handset,
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.800]   you have to ask yourself, is Flash the best solution for the sort of content
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.800]   we want to deliver to this device?
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   Right.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.800]   I've never seen an argument that says that Flash is better than any of four different technologies.
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.800]   Well, I think it's easier to-- I think the key has been there's other technologies
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.800]   that can deliver that content.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:58.800]   There's not a lot of other technologies that can author the content easily.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.800]   So while you can talk about SVG, we can talk about all these other things.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:08.800]   They require a lot more code and a lot less, you know, artistry, so to speak.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.800]   You know, so the thing is that's the big problem.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.800]   I mean, there's a lot of Flash designers and there's a lot of people who can put something together
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.800]   fairly quickly that looks reasonably good.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.800]   There's nothing out there if you want to do it and these other things other than code code.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:27.800]   And that I know of because we've looked and, you know, it's kind of a bleak area out there.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.800]   There's a lot of possibilities.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.800]   I mean, Apple could do something.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:35.800]   They could take DVD Studio Pro, which is making these, you know, kind of-- I don't think they didn't even bother to update it
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   the last time or barely updated it.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   You know, you make that something that can export interactive content rather than DVDs
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.800]   and you have something that's really interesting.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.800]   Mmm.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.800]   Mmm.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.800]   All right.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:48.800]   Well, we'll see.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.800]   We'll see.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.800]   I'm going to show you this Nokia.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:55.800]   I'm going to show you this Nokia and it's going to be running Flash 9 and it's just-- it's an easy way out, right?
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.800]   The phone has, you know, a very hot processor in it.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.800]   It's got a lot-- well, not a lot of RAM, 256 megs of RAM.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.800]   Well, maybe I don't have some money to throw around.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.800]   I mean, they got that big lawsuit.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.800]   I can see Nokia doing it.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.800]   Let me see Nokia's little--
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:08.800]   They're suing Apple.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:09.800]   What's that all about?
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.800]   It's one of those, you know, we patented the right to walk.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.800]   You know, how dare you walk.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:22.800]   If you connect with a-- I think it's like if you connect with a GSM phone, I mean, you know, it's like one of those insane patents that is--
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:33.800]   I can't remember the details, but it was like one of those insane patents that is all--
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:40.800]   And I'm sure that Apple is attempting to say, "Well, let's take this one-- we're willing to take this one to court and see how it's going to--
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.800]   They're going to fight it.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.800]   They're going to fight it.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.800]   We're going to fight it.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.800]   There was something that happened since we've met last.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.800]   This upstart little company in Washington State released an operating system.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.800]   I think they're calling it Windows 7.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.800]   There is no 7 Windows, but it's the seventh one they've decided to call it that.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:01.800]   So we'll talk about that in just a little bit as we continue with the fabulous Mac, Break Weekly crew.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.800]   But before we do that, I do want to mention our friends at GoToMeeting.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.800]   The folks at Citrix have done it again.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:15.800]   They've made GoToMeeting the world's finest remote meeting software available on the Macintosh
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.800]   and available free for the next 30 days just for you.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.800]   So I want you to try it right now.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   Go to gotomeeting.com/macbreak.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:29.800]   The next time you're sitting there on a conference call saying, "Gosh, if I could only show you this keynote presentation, all would become clear."
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:36.800]   Or if I could only show you these drawings or this 3D image or this website or whatever it is you're trying to talk about.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.800]   Life is visual.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.800]   You don't have to go places.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.800]   You don't have to bring the computer to your customer or your colleague.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.800]   You can do it with GoToMeeting.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.800]   I want you to try it right now.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.800]   Absolutely free.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.800]   It's going to cost you a lot less than flying across the country, even driving across town.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:56.800]   Just $49 a month for unlimited meetings as long as you want, as many as you want.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:02.800]   Then it includes free voice over internet and telephony and conference calls.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:08.800]   You can do it for training because you can show them a program and then they can take control and use it.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.800]   They can give you control of their computer.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.800]   You can collaborate.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.800]   I mean, you've got to try it.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.800]   Go tomeeting.com/macbreak.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.800]   Thank you so much for their support of MacBreak Weekly.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.800]   Please try it today.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:28.800]   So Windows 7 came out and we knew it wasn't a surprise.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   We knew it was coming.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.800]   They didn't leave us in suspense.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:34.800]   No.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.800]   It was much as we expected.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:43.800]   I have to say, if you're an Apple part of ZAN, perhaps you were hoping some horrible, horrible thing would happen when it came out.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.800]   Something like you create a guest account and it deletes all the data when you come back or something like that.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.800]   But no, I'm afraid so far.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.800]   No showstoppers.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.800]   Apple, however, did respond with...
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   Did I show you this ad yet?
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.800]   Did we do this last week?
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.800]   I've never seen it before.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.800]   The broken promises.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.800]   Oh, I love this ad.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.800]   All right, let me play a little ad.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:06.800]   This is the...
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.800]   John Hodgman, Justin Long, the latest...
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.800]   Hello, I'm a Mac.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.800]   And I'm a PC.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.800]   Hey, Mac, did you hear the goodness?
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:14.800]   Windows 7 is out.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.800]   And it's not going to have any of the problems my last operating system had.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.800]   Trust me.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.800]   I feel like I've heard this before, PC.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.800]   What?
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:22.800]   Windows Vista's here.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.800]   And it's not going to have any of the problems that Windows XP had.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.800]   It's not going to have any of the problems that Windows ME had.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.800]   It's not going to have any of the problems that Windows 98 had.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.800]   It's not going to have any of the problems Windows 95 had.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.800]   It's not going to have any of the problems Windows 2 had.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.800]   Trust me.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.800]   I love that one.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   It's going to be different.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.800]   Trust me.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.800]   Oh.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.800]   And see, that's...
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.800]   No, see, that is the most unfair, like, BS ad.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.800]   If Apple had any guts, they would have, like, found...
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.800]   I think was Windows 9...
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:50.800]   When they had the...
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.800]   Todd shouldn't talk about Windows 95 and those close.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.800]   They shouldn't have the Apple guy in, like, no shoes.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   They will work for food.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:57.800]   So that's a good point.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:02.800]   If it's reflecting the Apple, the Mac guy at the state that the Mac was in for each one
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.800]   of these things, I don't think...
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.800]   Yeah, they could have gone...
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.800]   If he was in jeans and a t-shirt, that was the only close that he owned.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.800]   And he was on his way to a job interview with the other two.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.800]   Did you see the other one where...
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.800]   Hijman is sitting down?
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.800]   Yeah, we'll do the...
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.800]   The PC News.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.800]   Here's another one.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.800]   Hello, I'm a Mac.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   And I'm a PC taking you live to the Windows 7 launch.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.800]   Hello.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.800]   Hello, PC and Mac.
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   Well, as you can see, there is upgrade fever all around me.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.800]   Tell me, sir, how excited are you?
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.800]   Really excited.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.800]   We're finally switching to a Mac.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   Whoa, to a Mac, why?
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.800]   Why?
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.800]   Why would anyone say that?
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.800]   If we have to move all of our stuff, why not move to the computer that's number one in customer satisfaction?
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.800]   Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.800]   See, now, I think that that's...
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.800]   I know, I know, all right, all right, all right, all right.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.800]   Please, let's go to commercial.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.800]   We are commercial.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.800]   Let's go to another commercial.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.800]   That is a good line.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:52.800]   You know, they do...
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:53.800]   They do the human...
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.800]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, this is it, Danny, though.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:55.800]   They do the humor so well.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:56.800]   You pay attention to the guy's outfit.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.800]   You pay attention to the...
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   This is a commercial.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:29:59.800]   And you don't really...
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.800]   Your brain is now laughing and not doing, you know...
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.800]   Right, I think...
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   Critical thinking.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.800]   The great thing about this whole series has always been that it's so on message.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.800]   Mac has a lot of advantages that Microsoft cannot touch.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.800]   And here's what they are, one, two, three, four, five, and languages so plain that you can't misunderstand it.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:21.800]   I think these are the first series of commercials where even a Mac fan has to say,
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:22.800]   "Wait a minute.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:29.800]   It doesn't matter if it's been in public beta for a long time and lots of very, very smart people
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:33.800]   who are probably well set to hate everything that Windows does,
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   are saying that it's a very, very good operating system."
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:41.800]   Secondly, you know, it's not true that you have to move all your files and all your data.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.800]   It is true that if you have not upgraded from...
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.800]   If you've never switched to Vista, if you've been using XP for the past ten years,
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.800]   it's a major pain in the butt.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.800]   But if you bought your PC within the past year or two, it probably came preloaded with Vista
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.800]   unless it was a Netbook.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   So you're saying this is fun?
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.800]   I really think it's an embarrassment to Apple.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.800]   When I upgraded my Netbook, yeah, that was a big problem.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.800]   It was essentially...
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.800]   The installer did to that hard drive what Rome did to Carthage.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.800]   It basically destroys everything and rebuilds everything from the ground up.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.800]   And so you have to do a complete backup, reinstall lots of stuff.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.800]   It's a big hassle.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.800]   On all my Vista machines, though, it was just 45 minutes, "Oh, you're done?"
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.800]   "Oh, okay.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.800]   If you say, "Hey, you're done, excellent."
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.800]   And it's a very, very good operating system.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:32.800]   It's not something that I think that I would advise anybody to be tempted to switch to Switch from Mac to PC.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.800]   But the most significant thing I could really say is that,
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.800]   whereas last year when I got myself an XP Netbook,
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.800]   it was with the intention of turning it into a Macintosh,
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.800]   now I like Windows 7 enough that would...
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.800]   I like this operating system enough.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.800]   I would not destroy it in order to replace it with something better.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.800]   I would actually use it as a Netbook.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.800]   You know, I'm kind of admitted.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.800]   I like it too.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.800]   But I think that they make...
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.800]   I'm not as critical as you are.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:03.800]   I think that they do make a point that will resonate with some users,
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:09.800]   "Hey, if you're going to Switch, as easy as it is, it's still nerve-wracking, Andy."
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:10.800]   I mean, you still...
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.800]   You know, we've all had bad experiences upgrading operating systems.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.800]   So there's still that built in, "Hmm, it's a little risky."
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:20.800]   And so when they say, "If you're going to Switch, why not Switch to Mac?"
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.800]   I think that that has some weight.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.800]   And I think that the real argument is the danger of what...
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   If I was Apple, I'd be talking about is not so much, "Don't choose. Don't make a choice."
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.800]   I mean, this is...
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.800]   That's really better.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   You're right.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.800]   You know, this is my laptop right now.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.800]   This little 13 inches, my little test laptop,
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.800]   and I've got Windows 7 on one side, and I've got Snow Leopard on the other.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:46.800]   And I would never buy a piece of hardware that couldn't do both operating systems again.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:51.800]   You know, I mean, Windows 7, we have Windows 7 installed on one of our Mac Pros for our motion capture system.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.800]   And it is... I mean, it runs incredibly well, incredibly fast.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.800]   It's pretty good on its system.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.800]   Well, but on the hardware, too.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:00.800]   On the hardware.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:01.800]   On the Mac.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.800]   And so the thing is that...
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.800]   So you just showed me something, Microsoft Photosynth, that has to run on Windows.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.800]   You ran it in bootcamps.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.800]   It's one of the reasons I have Windows phones.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:09.800]   It ran beautifully.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.800]   And it runs great.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.800]   And so the thing is, is I think that Apple needs to pay...
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.800]   I talked to Dell then after...
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.800]   I was at the gym today.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.800]   My trainer comes up to me and he says, "I've had my machine is nine years old.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.800]   I need to buy a new machine."
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.800]   I said, "Great.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:23.800]   New Macs are out."
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.800]   And he said, "I can't afford a Mac."
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.800]   And he showed me the Dell catalog.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   He's looking at $249 desktop PC.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.800]   He'll add a monitor to it.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.800]   Come in at $500.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.800]   A lot of people can't afford.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.800]   The starting point of the Mac is $1000.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.800]   Let's not forget that that's a lot of money.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.800]   A lot of people can't afford that.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.800]   There's an Apple text.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.800]   Do you not think there's an Apple text?
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.800]   No, I think there's an Apple text, but I think there's also a cost of ownership.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.800]   And so the thing is, is that I find that...
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.800]   I do find that Windows takes more massaging.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.800]   I don't know about Windows 7.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.800]   Windows 7 may be a new company.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.800]   I would say it's the most Mac-ish version of the phone.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.800]   But in general, and it has more been...
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.800]   We worry more about viruses.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.800]   We worry more about those types of things.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.800]   We also have just more cranky stuff going on.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.800]   And my Macs are cranky as well.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.800]   But I find that Windows is a bit more cranky.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.800]   And I don't want to ever know about a DLL.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:23.800]   Yeah, I think that a lot of people, especially in the Mac world,
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:30.800]   have a conception of Windows that really dates back to XP or even ME.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.800]   It may be the case.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:34.800]   You use it all the time.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.800]   We use it half of our computers have Windows installed.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.800]   So I just know that we spend more time.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.800]   I use Windows 50/50.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.800]   And I...
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.800]   I will say that Windows 7 is great.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.800]   Windows 7 is pretty impressive.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.800]   And I think that's a good argument that Apple could make,
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.800]   which is if you want to run Windows, why not run Windows and Mac?
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:55.800]   This is the only platform we'll do it.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.800]   I mean, Apple's a hard work company.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.800]   But then people are going to say it's three times as expensive or it's twice as expensive.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.800]   So in my sometimes review, I felt that I had to address some reviews that were saying,
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.800]   "Oh, well, no, there's almost no difference between a Mac and a PC."
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.800]   And I have to say, "Well, no, there is a difference.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   The difference is that do you want to save money or do you want to have elegance
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.800]   and a future-looking operating system?"
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.800]   Something that I've been sort of thinking about a lot these days,
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:24.800]   especially as I evaluate Android devices as alternatives to iPhones and iPod touches,
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.800]   is the idea of good enough.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.800]   Good enough is something that I settle for in so many different products.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.800]   My car is plenty good enough for me.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.800]   It's a very, very sensible, very, very reasonable four-door vehicle.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:37.800]   It's very, very nice.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.800]   It has a radio in it and it has seats and it has air conditioning.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.800]   And I really don't care about cars beyond that.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:49.800]   I have a friend who has a German supercar and it really just wants to anger the road
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:55.800]   and anger every other driver because it was designed to be going on the Nurburg track,
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.800]   not on I-95 to 295.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.800]   I think that's... I try to think about that when I think about the difference
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.800]   between a PC user and a Mac user,
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.800]   the Mac user can explain and have very, very valid points to make
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.800]   about the superiority of that operating system and the hardware.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   The question is, are they things that are going to be relevant to the user?
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   I like to think so, but it's something that we still always need to sort of confront
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.800]   and make sure that we're not just drinking our own Kool-Aid here.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.800]   That's a very good point.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:26.800]   If you believe in Mac and you love Mac and you want to support Apple,
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.800]   you've got to look boldly into the eye of the enemy.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.800]   I guess the best back-handed compliment I can give to Windows 7 is just the idea
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:41.800]   that I really think that it's finally a modern usable operating system
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.800]   without a huge list of downsides to it.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   I still think the Mac is better.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.800]   I think it's easier to use.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.800]   I think it's more reliable and easier to maintain.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:52.800]   But I do not feel guilty that someone asked me for their advice,
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.800]   for my advice, and they walked away deciding that they're going to get
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.800]   a Windows machine.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.800]   This may not be popular with a Mac break weekly crowd,
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.800]   but I told that guy at the gym, yeah, pick that Dell.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.800]   That's a good price, $249.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.800]   And it's running a Core 2 processor, four gigs of RAM,
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.800]   750-gig hard drive.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.800]   You have an iMac, or you can have, get one for your office,
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.800]   get one for the bedroom, get one for the living room, get one for the car,
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.800]   and then get another one just because you can't.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.800]   AHP hit pretty hard on the Windows 7 site.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.800]   They said, for $11.99, the price of the low-end iMac,
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.800]   you can get three HPs and we'll throw in a wireless router.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:34.800]   I mean, is the Apple tax getting bigger as PC prices drop and Apple's price does not drop?
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.800]   Well, I think we also have to, generally, and I haven't done this recently,
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.800]   but generally if you spec out a PC the same way you spec out a Mac,
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.800]   it oftentimes is not as far apart as it would seem.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.800]   If you put everything into the PC that you put into the,
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.800]   that comes with the Mac, the same connections, the same processors,
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.800]   the same internal capacity.
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.800]   It usually comes out not that far, that different.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.800]   They just skimp a lot more on the PCs, on the low-end PCs and people,
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.800]   and many people who are just checking email and watching Hulu won't notice.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:09.800]   It is a case where you, when you, you have to, you can't compare the super netbook size.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.800]   Wow.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.800]   Hey, I'm dancing.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.800]   Hey.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.800]   Hey.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.800]   Welcome to the Thumbback Break switch away.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.800]   Come back.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.800]   Fun with the Tri-Castor.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.800]   Don't worry about it.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.800]   It's just life.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.800]   Life in the, in the bleeding edge of video production.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.800]   And those of you listening at home, just be glad.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.800]   You missed out on excitement.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.800]   You missed on dancing, dancing, Andy.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.800]   I mean, every, every major manufacturer has their premium line,
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:45.800]   and then they're, let's solve this to students going back to school line,
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.800]   and let's do their super, let's do the super notebook line.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:53.800]   My question is, is this $249 Dell that bad?
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.800]   It's a, it's a desktop netbook, which means that it's useful for the processor.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.800]   Or two processors.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   As far as, as far as I've seen, it's a core two processor.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.800]   It's a very, very, very practical and very, very credible machine.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:10.800]   I think that once you start playing games on it, you'll start to see where the weaknesses are.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.800]   But given that most people, they, they need the male client, they need the browser,
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.800]   they need Microsoft Word.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.800]   That's, that's more than enough muscle to run those, those few applications.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.800]   Well, the other thing is, I think as soon as you say, I would like to make home movies.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.800]   You know, I would like to do this thing.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.800]   You're right.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.800]   As soon as you do that, then, then I don't think there's a choice.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:33.800]   I mean, I just don't think that, that, that, that, that the iLife suite, you know, and the,
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   well, wait a minute, have you used Windows Movement Maker, the new one?
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.800]   Not yet.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.800]   Install it.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.800]   It's free.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.800]   Install it.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.800]   Get the live.com.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.800]   It kills me to say that.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.800]   Yep.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:53.200]   Premiere, Premiere Elements, Photoshop Elements, their ReNights applications, Premiere Photoshop
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.360]   Elements absolutely kicks iPhoto's butt.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.400]   We should be very, very happy that Adobe makes a Mac edition of it.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:02.040]   Well, I think iPhoto, I think iPhoto, well, number one is iPhoto is free.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.800]   Number two is that I think that they're-
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.800]   Coss is free.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.320]   Coss is also pretty darn good.
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.800]   Now it's available in the Mac, so.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.000]   And I think, but I think as a group, you have all of these applications that work really
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.720]   well and they work really well together.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.520]   So when you're opening up one application, you're, you're looking at the stuff over,
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:21.160]   you know, you're, I'm grabbing iPhoto's to put into my iMovie, I'm, you know, I'm able
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.400]   to go back and forth easily.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:27.240]   You know, that, that kind of integration, I, I just, and I have to test the new one with
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.240]   Windows 7.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.440]   I have to put all the stuff on and, and figure it out, that's why I have this little laptop
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.440]   to play with it.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:36.000]   But, but my experience in the past has been, is that they haven't been anywhere close.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.200]   You know, and, and that's been a huge issue as soon as you, I have kids and I want to
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:44.880]   take pictures and make movies, you know, that becomes something that, you know, you, you,
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:49.000]   you, you, I really feel like you, you want to have a Mac when you have eyes.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.920]   I, I, I absolutely agree because there's a, you have to consider how well this thing works
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.640]   today out of the box and how well, how happy you're going to be with it a year from now
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.080]   or two years from now.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:03.360]   Because right now you don't own a little pocket flip mine, video camera or something.
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.360]   And so you're not really doing much video editing or you're not really dealing with
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:10.880]   a lot of media or you're not listening to as much music or ripping videos as much as
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.200]   you were.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.480]   If you're, if you feel as though your needs are not going to change that much, then that
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.600]   Dell will always be a great machine.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:22.440]   Whereas, I mean, it's, I can go years and years between buying new Mac desktops.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:26.200]   I have the, I have this iMac here that is two years old.
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.600]   I think it was like at the end of his product line when I bought it, because I got it at
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:29.600]   a discount.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:34.160]   And I really don't feel any need in the near future to ever upgrade it.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.160]   I'm sure they'll change.
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:39.840]   You know, I think Apple, I disagree on almost every count.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:46.360]   I think that in hardware terms and in software terms, there's such close parity nowadays
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:50.080]   that you'd be hard pressed to explain to that guy at the gym, why you should buy a
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.080]   Mac.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:54.240]   The one thing I would say, and I don't know if this is going to be a compelling thing for
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.560]   him, but it might be for us.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:01.960]   Believe it or not, the big difference to me now is the incredible Mac developer base
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:05.680]   and the quality of third party applications that are written for the Mac, things like
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:13.120]   CODA, Panics transmit, the quality utilities that you use day in, day out, I find a hard
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:17.120]   time finding equivalents that are as elegant as well done on the PC.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:21.200]   And I think that's partially the developers who are great, but it's also that.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.720]   We've got that delicious generation that is so good.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.360]   But I also think that there's part of why they can do that is that the OS has a lot
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.360]   of cycles.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.360]   I agree.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:30.600]   And when you look at core image, core video, core animations.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:31.600]   It's very easy to develop.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:36.680]   And it comes with a fold fledged professional development system.
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.800]   It's free.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.360]   There's a lot of languages that come with the Macintosh.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.600]   It's Unix under the hood.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.000]   So a lot of people understand it.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.680]   There's a lot of reasons why.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.360]   And I'm not saying you take away credit from Apple for that.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.320]   No, Apple gets credit.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:55.000]   However, that's to me right now, that's the only distinguishing.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.120]   And the fact that everything ties together well.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.440]   And I feel much better.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.120]   I've just started using Windows 7.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.600]   And I think it's really great.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.240]   I mean, my past experience with Windows, it just feels like I got a car.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.440]   Everything was cobbled together.
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:08.960]   No, I agree.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.480]   The radio came from one place in the dashboard.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.480]   It was underwhelming.
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.000]   It was underwhelming.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:12.840]   No, I'm with you.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:13.760]   It's much more elegant.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.520]   And so we have to test it.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.320]   We have to look at it.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.000]   But as I said, that's been the big thing for me.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.560]   And I just don't want to spend the time trying to figure out how to glue that back together.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.120]   And so we'll see.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:23.640]   All right.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.080]   We're going to take a break and come back.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.320]   I do have one more ad.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:33.760]   But before we give you a commercial, let's give you a commercial to fit right in that
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:34.760]   theme.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.160]   And it's from the folks at Carbonite.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.960]   If you are backing up, that's good.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:39.960]   I'm really proud of you.
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:40.960]   Well done.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:41.960]   Everybody should back up.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:42.960]   But let me ask you a question.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:48.120]   Are you backing up just to a drive that's sitting right next to your computer?
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.280]   Oh, don't tell me that.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.640]   Oh, please don't tell.
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:55.200]   Just have you thought about what's going to happen if there's a fire or a flood or
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.320]   backup and your computer goes away.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.000]   That's not good.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.920]   You need to have offsite backups.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:01.920]   Everybody's going to tell you that.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:02.920]   I do both.
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:04.320]   I have a local backup and I have an offsite.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:09.080]   And I do the offsite the best way, in my opinion, automatically without thinking about
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.080]   it to Carbonite.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.640]   Now, if you're doing a time machine backup, that's great.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.640]   You're getting that benefit.
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:14.640]   It's automatic.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:15.640]   You don't have to think about it.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.600]   It does it automatically in the background and stuff.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.840]   But it's still right there, right in the same locale.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:25.000]   Carbonite's kind of like time machine to the internet.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.560]   There's a couple of real advantages.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:31.320]   First of all, it encrypts with AES encryption before it sends the data, uses SSL to send
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.840]   it so it's kind of double encrypted, so it's very private.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.000]   It's unlimited.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.320]   How many times you run out of space in your time machine?
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:39.480]   It's unlimited.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:43.200]   Now you can't back up every external drive, all your network drives.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.200]   It's not unlimited.
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.040]   That's not like a billion terabytes unlimited.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:49.360]   It's limited to what's in your computer, whether it's a laptop or your iMac or your
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.800]   Mac mini, those hard drives that are in the computer are backed up.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.480]   You don't have to count the bytes or anything.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.480]   You don't get teared up.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.880]   It is less than $5 a month for unlimited backup.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.240]   Very simple.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.240]   I don't know.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:04.880]   Check and see if they've got the snow leopard version up and running yet.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:09.680]   They're very careful at Carbonite to make sure that they, I remember their first Mac client,
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:10.680]   they didn't ever released it.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.720]   They said, "This isn't Macintosh Mac ish enough."
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.800]   They went back to the drawing board.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.640]   They really know what they're doing here.
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.200]   You can try it for free.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:20.640]   Go to carbonite.com, use the coupon code TWIT.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.000]   No credit card necessary.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   I'm not sure.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.240]   I have to try it with Snowle.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:29.440]   I only have one snow leopard computer to this day.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.720]   For this and other reasons, I'm waiting for more compatibility.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.920]   If you have gone to Snowleopard, do me a favor.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:35.920]   Send me an email.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.880]   Let me know if it's working.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:44.760]   Carbonite, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com and the coupon code is TWIT, T-W-I-T.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.960]   Carbonite, it's backup done right.
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:50.120]   I think you're going to love it.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:56.200]   Let's give you one more commercial now that we've had the commercial.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.160]   I'm feeling right in there.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:01.840]   This one is, again, another one aimed at the switchers.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:03.200]   Let me turn on the audience.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.480]   I'm an XP user who's getting ready for the big move.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.480]   People love Windows 7.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.480]   Too Mac.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.480]   What?
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:12.080]   Well, they say moving to Windows 7 would be a fresh start, but the real fresh start would
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:16.080]   be moving to a computer like Mac who's rated number one in customer satisfaction.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.880]   I mean, look, I could stick with what I know.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:19.880]   Yes.
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:20.880]   Pain and frustration.
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.840]   Why don't you just make up your mind?
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:23.840]   I did.
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:24.840]   I'm going to go with Mac.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:25.840]   Oh, great.
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.320]   You don't have to rush into anything.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.760]   You don't have to make up your mind.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.760]   I think that was credible.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:39.560]   Now they're using the SPSE satisfaction, which is, that's a real data point.
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:44.320]   They're using XP, aren't they, Andy, which is really going to be kind of painful?
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:49.720]   I have no argument with that.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:56.000]   I don't know why your particular monitor is that way, but we'll figure it out.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   There we go.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   Citizens do the hustle.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   Citizens do the money.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   Sorry, we're not, we're not dancing anymore.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   No, all right.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   Deep breaths.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   Deep breaths.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.800]   It's rebounded sharply today upon news at OPEC.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.640]   All right, Andy Bloomberg.
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:15.680]   It was a very, it was a very, it was a very, very fact reality based.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.160]   You don't have a problem with that one so much.
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.160]   No problems whatsoever.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.760]   Now, I don't know.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.200]   Is this PC Innovation Lab?
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:27.840]   They said there were three new ones, but this one, I don't remember this PC Innovation Lab.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:28.840]   So let me, let me just play it.
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:32.720]   You can tell me is, Ethel's getting their mileage out of this show.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.480]   This isn't, is this a new one?
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.480]   The bubble wrap.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.200]   Have you seen this bubble wrap one?
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.520]   This is a, I would buy that suit.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.600]   I would totally buy that suit.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.280]   This is actually my one of my, well, they're all so funny.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.280]   I don't know.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:47.520]   Hello, I'm a PC and here at PC Innovation's Lab.
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:51.760]   Well, you know how you have your patented magsafe cord that pops out anytime someone trips
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.760]   over it?
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.760]   Sure sure.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.360]   Well, we're protecting PCs with this new air cushioned enclosure.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.360]   It's bubble wrap.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:00.200]   And you know how you have your revolutionary new battery that lasts almost an entire work
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.200]   day?
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.600]   Well, we are offering this new extremely long cord.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.760]   Because you shouldn't innovations make people's lives easier?
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.680]   Well, that's exactly why we've developed these.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.240]   A couple of holders.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.520]   Cheers to innovation.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.320]   I think, I think they're making the, trying to make the point that Microsoft Chief Technology
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.320]   Officer is now red green.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.120]   Don't lie, not just make a suit out of bubble wrap.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:23.560]   Bubble wrap, I love it.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:26.840]   You know, that's not fact based particularly, but it's good.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:29.240]   I mean, look at this photosynthe you were using, Alex.
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:32.360]   That's straight out of Microsoft's innovation labs and it's an innovation.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.360]   Well, it is.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:39.080]   And what's funny is that that you, there's a couple of teams that you find in Microsoft
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.280]   that just do incredible things.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:41.280]   So live team is incredible.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:45.480]   A lot of times they just, a lot of stuff they do doesn't end up, you know, anywhere in
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.760]   a consumer app.
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:52.640]   The thing that I think is, I mean, Apple doesn't have to have everyone think that they should
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:54.040]   spend more for a man.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:58.520]   You know, if they literally have two or three percentage, you know, two or three percent
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:02.200]   think that it'd be worth it, then all these ads are well worth the trouble.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.360]   You know, and this is the time.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:04.360]   This is a week.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:08.440]   Anytime you have this transition period, it is the time when there's some chaos.
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:09.440]   There's some moving around.
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.640]   People have to make a decision over what they're going to do.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.600]   They're not going to keep on running XP anymore.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:14.600]   Right.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:18.040]   And if you're going to get them at the inflection point, yeah, that's the point for the Apple
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.360]   to dig into this.
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:21.560]   And we were talking about this on Twitter.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:25.520]   Apple probably doesn't want to increase market share to too much.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:27.480]   It just makes more problems for them.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.480]   Right.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.080]   I think that I they don't want to be 90 percent or do they?
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.080]   No, no.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:34.760]   I think Apple's natural high point would be 15 to 20 percent.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.240]   They're pretty profitable.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.240]   They're making a lot of money.
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:45.120]   Making a let's face at high priced computer that people who want to buy the BMW Mercedes
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:49.880]   at computers are completely content to spend that money.
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:54.720]   And I have to say when I look at that new and 999 white iBook, that's the one I tried
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:55.880]   to get the guy at the gym to go.
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:57.560]   I said, look at this is beautiful.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:58.560]   999.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:02.120]   He said, no, I want a desktop and I only want to spend half that.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.840]   So guess what?
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:04.840]   There you go.
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:07.440]   You're buying a PC.
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:12.440]   But on the other side, I've in the past, I've really fought harder because of these security
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:13.440]   issues.
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:16.480]   And I really have had in the past said, no, please don't.
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.480]   It's so dangerous.
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:20.000]   You're almost inevitably going to be affected.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:26.200]   And I think now because of the improvements in security in the UAC and because the Microsoft
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:29.920]   now offers a free antivirus, what do you think, Andy?
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:34.080]   I no longer worry about the security as much as I did.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:39.320]   The very worst is the situation where you're being you have to pay a $50 per year tax protection
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.040]   racket money to keep your PC safe.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:46.720]   Even with security essentials, you don't even have to do that anymore, I don't think.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:50.160]   I'm saying that I'm saying though, the worst case scenario is that you spend 50 bucks a
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.680]   year to a semintech or some other company like that.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:57.200]   Now it's yet to be seen how good this free system is because they just released it about
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.200]   a month and a half ago.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:01.800]   I'm certain that it's going to have some sort of a baptism by fire.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.040]   It's been pretty good.
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:04.040]   So far it's been very impressive.
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.040]   All the reviews.
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.040]   It's been great so far.
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:13.040]   It's such a, I don't know who was fired, was killed, was hired or had a, or quit drinking
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:19.200]   at Microsoft, but they're making so many incredibly shrewd decisions that the idea of simply taking
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:24.320]   antivirus protection and making it a free component for the operating system, it absolutely had
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:28.760]   to happen because this was the ultimate of windows.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:33.000]   It's the one argument that you can never really have a great argument against.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.960]   So you could say, well, it's not, you could tell the truth and say, oh, it's not a problem
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:42.280]   by utility and they're updated every single day and then your system will be almost certainly
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:44.240]   safe from from from attack.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:47.400]   But there's always the thing where, yeah, but why do I have to pay again?
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.200]   It sounds like a protection racket.
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:53.640]   Why do I have to pay an annual subscription fee just to keep my system safe?
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:56.720]   Shouldn't you be making a system that's safe to begin with?
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:59.680]   So it's not, it's not the big, as big a problem as it once was.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:04.080]   I would never say that that's the reason why you would buy a Mac instead of a PC.
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:07.280]   Well, that was a big reason for a long time, wasn't it?
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:13.880]   Well, if again, if you try, I keep saying again, my apologies, if again, if someone,
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:21.320]   if someone tried, no, you said, if someone tried a Mac and they preferred the PC for whatever
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:26.760]   reason, I would not advise them, well, you're telling me that you're going to go with a
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:30.720]   Mac anyway, because you're afraid of viruses, spend a small amount of money, you can have
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:34.840]   the the PC that you prefer, and you will be well protected against just about anything
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:37.240]   that'll and here's an idea.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.640]   Don't go looking at porn on the internet.
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.160]   How about just give that a try.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:44.000]   But wait, it's it's free or buy a netbook just for the porn.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   You don't want to do it.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   There's a market.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   There's a market.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:54.840]   And now the new porn book, pre-installed, pre-installed with special non-stake coding.
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:59.840]   You can't use these jokes.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:07.080]   Do we really leave in a situation where you want to specially met you want to if you want
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:11.760]   a PC, it seems like the place that they own is I want a really cheap computer.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.760]   Or I want a very specialized computer.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:17.840]   I want it specialized for there's a particular I have to run the multiple listing services.
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:19.680]   Whatever it is.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:23.200]   And the question is that does that leave that leaves a pretty big gap of of.
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:27.000]   I think Apple can get to 15% and I think I don't need more than that.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.840]   I think it's very comfortable.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:32.440]   And then you know, and to be honest, I'm happy to be in 50 the 15%.
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:36.480]   I prefer that because otherwise you're a target for virus authors.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.040]   You're you know, you're and again, I think that I think we're talking about 15% of the
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:43.200]   overall market, but I think it's really getting 30 40% of the.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:46.600]   It's business because my windows has such traction in business.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.040]   You can't really use that number.
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.800]   I think you just can't.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:54.600]   Well, it's not so much the traction in business thing is just the idea that people who use
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:58.360]   them for business are people who order them by the dozens and by the hundreds.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:02.120]   And if you thought that the the Mac tax was bad just for an individual who's shopping
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:06.160]   for a back to school computer, imagine that you can say I can either have I can either
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:10.800]   spend an extra 30% of my annual hardware budget by going Mac or I can.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:14.400]   You know, it's it's it's it's an interesting it's an interesting part of the problem.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:19.000]   Especially when you when you when you have someone using a software as a service client
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.720]   on a web page to do 90% of their work.
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:23.800]   I mean that you know, it doesn't really matter at all.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.440]   You barely need, you know, you almost don't even need to have a few.
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:27.440]   You're using Linux.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:29.800]   Yeah, we're running, you know, yeah.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:34.680]   I be honest, our front office is on Windows and it's not wasn't my choice.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:39.120]   Actually, Dan uses a Mac, but Frederick and and Lisa quick books on the Mac is they're
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.960]   using QuickBooks and it's not a good thing.
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:45.160]   And you know, we have to pay special attention to keep them secure.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:46.160]   Right.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.640]   But not it's not an onerous burden.
[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.640]   I mean, but it is part of our job.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:51.400]   We have we do IT stuff.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:52.400]   Right.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:53.840]   But that's what they want.
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.000]   Well, the QuickBooks on the Mac isn't usable.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   Right.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   That's what they need.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   It's not even a question what they want.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   It's what they need.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   But they're more comfortable.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.920]   Lisa wants to use Excel and she's more comfortable in Windows and it's just that's fine.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:04.920]   Right.
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:09.920]   I'll buy her PC and and and and and when I have a choice at home, it's all Mac.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:10.920]   Well, I'm both.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:13.280]   And to me, it's just that we just choose both all the time.
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.280]   You know, we just buy it.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.280]   We buy a hard Apple hardware.
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.280]   Right.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:20.280]   And then I just put put bootcamp on it restarted and see I'm not going to buy her a Mac.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:21.280]   When I'm a Mac.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:24.280]   If she's just running Windows, but it looks so pretty.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.280]   It looks good.
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:26.280]   Well, do you see what she's got?
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:28.120]   She's got dual 24 inch displays.
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.120]   Right.
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:30.120]   A cheap Dell.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:31.920]   We spent less than, you know, probably 1200 bucks.
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:32.920]   Right.
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:34.120]   It's pretty that's a pretty nice setup.
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.120]   It is.
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:36.120]   It's very nice.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.120]   Very nice setup.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:38.800]   Anyway, I think this is a good discussion.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:42.160]   I know a lot of people who listen to Mac break weekly are going to say, but wait a minute.
[00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:44.720]   This is the show for Apple fanboys.
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:48.160]   And you guys aren't, you know, hold you're not keeping the faith here.
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:49.680]   But I think Andy, you made a really good point.
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:55.440]   If you love something, you have to be honest and continually face the challenge of the
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.440]   competition.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:04.400]   And our arrogance is intact, if not enhanced, because you certainly wouldn't see a PC fan
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:09.720]   having the perspective of the entire marketplace and making sure that their choice of operating
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:15.360]   system and hardware is based on reality based fact and not simply fear.
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:16.360]   Uncertainty.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:17.360]   Now you really are.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:18.360]   Dance.
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:19.360]   Uncertainty.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:20.360]   Fear.
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.360]   Uncertainty.
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.360]   Fear.
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:23.360]   Insert.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:26.680]   It's the dancing, Andy's ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:27.680]   Let's take a break.
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.400]   We've got our picks of the week.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.880]   I know what yours is, Alex.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:35.360]   I hope that Andy and I are not going to collide.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:36.760]   We might.
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:40.360]   I think I think you might have tipped off what your pick is going to be.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:43.000]   So I'm going to avoid that certain tool.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   I think that you're going to.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   Well, I'll tell you what, would you like to go first?
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.320]   Should I go first?
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:51.640]   Well, I could go first because I can change.
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:52.720]   I can back up.
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:53.720]   I can backtrack.
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.400]   You're a true son of the south.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.400]   Yes, I am.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.400]   You're a champion.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.400]   I'll tribute you.
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.160]   Andrew, save your Confederate dollars of south.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:02.960]   We'll rise again.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:07.520]   But we are going to take a little break here before we do that to talk about audible.com.
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:14.160]   There's a great book, by the way, that is just hysterical called The Dog of the South.
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.160]   Have you ever read that, Andy?
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:16.960]   Maybe it was you who turned it on.
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:17.960]   Oh, no.
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:20.040]   It's very, very funny on audible.com.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:26.640]   The guy has that, has a great southern accent and it's just a wonderful.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.080]   I'm going to play a little bit of it, but I'm going to let you start, Andy.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.720]   First, let's tell people what we're talking about here, audible.com.
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:32.880]   You know about them.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.800]   They're my good friends, our good buddies.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:37.960]   I've been listening to Audible since 2001 since I started that.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:42.800]   Any is commute to tech TV, two hours a day minimum.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:47.800]   If there was no traffic, three or four more most days and boy, I kind of miss that because
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:51.240]   I got so much reading done thanks to audible.com.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:55.360]   You go to audible.com and you'll see why 60.
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:56.680]   I saw a new count.
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:58.960]   It's up to 65,000 books.
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:57:59.960]   It's a lot of books a day.
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:01.640]   When you think about it, because it was week.
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:02.640]   There are hundreds a day.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:06.160]   If you go to the, in fact, there's a just added section.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:07.160]   If you go to audible.com.
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:09.040]   Did you record a book?
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:12.000]   I recorded a short story and we're still trying to figure out if I'm going to record
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   a book.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.560]   It's a lot of work because pacing has to be consistent.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:22.240]   If you do characters, which I like to do, your accents have to be consistent.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:26.160]   You know, Jim Dale, the guy who does the Harry Potter books and has hundreds of character
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:29.640]   voices on those books records the character.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:33.520]   And then when he's about to get to, you know, Hagrid, he says, "I only hear the Hagrid
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:34.520]   voice."
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:35.520]   "Oh, the Hagrid, book's like this."
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:40.080]   So he can do the, because you otherwise, you can't drift over an imagine.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:41.080]   800 paintings.
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:42.400]   Did you do it line by line or how do you?
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.360]   You do it until you screw up.
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:45.360]   Right.
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:50.040]   But there's a producer sitting in the other room who will tell you very quickly when you
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:51.040]   screw up.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:52.040]   So he said, "Can you do that again slower?"
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:53.440]   Oh, you slurred that line a little bit.
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.000]   So you stop a lot.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.160]   And it helps to have a producer, makes a big difference.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:02.520]   It was, it's really, it was really fun, I have to say.
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:03.840]   So I'm just looking at the new books.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.280]   There are 98 new books for this week.
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:08.400]   So it's about 100 books a week.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:11.760]   And you can, and you can go to audible.com and you can see what's new, you know?
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:13.560]   So that's kind of fun.
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:17.480]   But then I think the best way to find your book on Audible is to listen to our shows
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:18.480]   on TwiCke.
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:20.920]   Because every one of our shows, we have an Audible recommendation.
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:25.440]   Andy has been the most fruitful for me.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:30.440]   I'm still listening to the Abyssken book on Hollywood that I just, Andy, I got to tell
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:35.200]   you, I've read it 30 movies on Netflix to say, "Oh, Easy Rider, I haven't seen that.
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:37.640]   Oh, the Godfather, oh, I have to watch Nash."
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.840]   And it's just wonderful to hear the history of these great movies.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:41.840]   What a good recommendation.
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:42.840]   Thank you.
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:43.960]   It was a hell, it was a hell of a good time.
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:49.240]   I was reading a lengthy article in a cinematographer's magazine that was just telling about the
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:56.560]   reason why movies are the way they are today was because someone invented the 35mm shoulder
[00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:00.040]   mounted camera with a really good lens on it that allowed you to actually go inside
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.280]   a real place and shoot what's really going on.
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:03.280]   That's right.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:07.400]   Without having to have a lighting right, without having to reconstruct it and be able to hang
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.400]   things from the rafters.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:13.160]   That's why Saturday Night Fever was a gritty, if it had been shot just five years earlier,
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.960]   it would have been a very, very musical, like sort of pet-by thing.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:20.480]   But the fact that they could go into a real disco, go into a real Brooklyn paint store
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.880]   meant that by definition it became very real and very gritty.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.560]   It's funny because I had that insight listening to the book too, not the article that you
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:31.480]   read, but the book, because that's really what happened with these Wonder Kids in the
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:35.480]   70s, is they went from the studio system where you had to shoot on a set because the
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.080]   gear was so huge.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:41.760]   And it really reminded me of the same kind of transition we're going through now where
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.920]   it's getting not just smaller but cheaper.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:48.920]   And so we're going to get a whole new generation of Wonder Kids who are not merely shooting
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:53.160]   in the field but are shooting gorilla style with cheap digital camera.
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:54.160]   And so it changes the whole look.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.320]   It changes everything.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.400]   And you start to see YouTube movies now.
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.920]   I think you're going to start seeing them in the cinema very soon.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:06.240]   That's absolutely my favorite component of technology where I'm sure that there have
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:11.080]   been hundreds of pages of doctoral theses about how, well, there was a post in the Watergate
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:15.160]   era, there was a lack of faith in humanity that was really reflected by the filmmakers
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.160]   of the time.
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:20.200]   They decided they wanted to reject the gloss and the colors and they wanted to have, you
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.320]   know, show New York as it really was.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:26.240]   But then you have to, but then someone with a better perspective says, no, the reason
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:31.000]   why they started filming that way was because for the first time in 70 years, they could.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.840]   They had the technology.
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:36.200]   You don't need to know that this is the point at which this technology was invented, but
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.440]   it had the effect that it changed everything.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.440]   It did.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:43.520]   It brought the studio system down just the change in technology.
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:44.520]   That's great.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.520]   It's a great story.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:49.040]   So what, before you talk about your recommendation, I just, I found the dog of the south.
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.440]   Let me just play a little bit.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:55.480]   This is such a, you have to get this book and it is a hysterical kind of a comedy.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:59.400]   A timely word here and there might have worked wonders.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:03.600]   I knew she was restless and anxious to play a more active part in life.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:06.680]   She spoke in just those terms and there were other signals as well.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:09.960]   This is an example, I want someone that you run into an audio book where the guy is, this
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:10.960]   is a first person book.
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:13.200]   So he's playing a character in the book.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:19.000]   He's an actor reading the book and this is why a great reader, he's really a great actor.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:26.080]   So he is the protagonist in the book and it's just, the guy is a doofus, an idiot, a complete
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:31.200]   nitwit, but he's so sure that he's right and he's doing everything, that he's a smart
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:33.560]   guy and this guy brings him to life.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:34.560]   It's just wonderfully done.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:38.200]   Anyway, that's my recommendation, the dog of the south by Charles Portis.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.760]   Now Andy's recommendation.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:46.600]   Well I'm glad you mentioned that because my pick is based on the same thing.
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:52.000]   If there's a bad stereotype about audio books is that you often get people who simply read
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.760]   the text in a very professional and stilted manner.
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:55.760]   Who needs that?
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:59.520]   Exactly, but there's some really great performers out there, especially when you have these
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:03.600]   guys who rarely do audio books, they just simply pick specific projects that are very,
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.600]   very appropriate.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:08.760]   So my pick this week is Terry Jones of Monty Pyeon reading the Wind in the Willows by Kenneth
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:09.760]   Graham.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.280]   Oh, what a great idea.
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.720]   And Terry Jones, he's, well she's, and when he gets excited, he has to ask yourself like
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:15.720]   this, doesn't he?
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.720]   Does anybody find out?
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:22.280]   So, so he's, he's, he understands comedy.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:28.720]   He also understands literature and he, his association with this audio book came from
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.160]   the fact that he produced an edition, a version of Wind in the Willows for BB, for the BBC,
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:37.240]   I think, like a few years earlier than that.
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:41.440]   So he's intimate with this whole text and he knows how to solve this story.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:45.880]   I haven't, I haven't started listening to it yet, but I listened to the sample and that
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:46.880]   was like done.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:47.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.880]   It was the, it was the orange button.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:49.880]   Click done.
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:54.240]   There's quite a few Wind in the Willows on here.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:57.360]   So I can't, can't imagine anybody being better than Terry Jones though.
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.360]   Yeah.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.360]   Right.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.360]   Look at all the different people.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:04.960]   That's kind of one of the, in some ways Audible has become like encyclopedic where they have
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:05.960]   every version.
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.880]   It's like a, it's like a band, a cover band.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.120]   I mean, Alan, Alan Bennett would be very good.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.120]   Do you know Alan Bennett?
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.560]   He's a BBC presenter.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.400]   He would do a good job too.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:20.480]   So you might have to, you might have to listen to several versions to find the definitive,
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.440]   but here's Terry Jones, the Wind in the Willows.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.840]   I'll just play a little bit of this way.
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:29.240]   The recession of the best stories in the world sent from the heart of the earth to be told
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:32.440]   at last to the insatiable sea.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:37.120]   As he sat on the grass and looked across the river, a dark hole in the bank opposite, just
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.040]   above the water's edge, caught his eyes.
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:40.040]   You're absolutely right.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.840]   Oh, that's so good.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.080]   The Wind in the Willows.
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.000]   Oh, that's a kids book we should say about.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   It's a kid's book.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.960]   But it's, it's, it's a whole haul.
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.920]   You got your six hours entertainment.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:53.920]   Is it that long?
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:54.760]   Wow.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:59.880]   I've already, I've already clicked away to make sure that we were talking about the same
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:04.480]   Alan Bennett, the same, the same beyond the fringe member that was.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.840]   Was Alan Bennett beyond the fringe?
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.000]   I did not know that.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   Of course.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.120]   Well, he's a wonderful writer, has a very ponzi BBC accent.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.360]   And there's a number, quite a few Alan Bennett books on Audible that he's written.
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:21.200]   But I think he'd do a good job narrating the Wind in the Willows as well.
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:22.200]   Wow.
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.200]   Some good choices here.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:27.520]   Well, here's, I can't help you with the multiple choices, but I can tell you how to get one
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.520]   of them for free.
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.520]   Go ahead.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.200]   And you know, I have a feeling you're going to love Audible.com and you're going to be
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.200]   back.
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.200]   Go to Audible.com/Macbreak.
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:39.320]   Sign up for the gold account and take your pick.
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:40.320]   Your first book is free.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.320]   You get to keep it.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.400]   And of course, you get another book every month.
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:47.240]   And now you see why Andy and I have kind of an Audible Jones.
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.320]   You just can't stop.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.320]   They're just so great.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.480]   I've listened to so many Audible.
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.680]   So I keep my house clean.
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.560]   Yeah, it's perfect for that.
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.920]   We don't, we don't have any more.
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:00.960]   But I definitely, I throw and I always have, you know, three or four books that I haven't
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:03.280]   gone through that are sitting on my iPhone.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.400]   Like if I'm going to get stopped somewhere, delayed somewhere, whatever, I'm going to pop
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:08.400]   it in and listen to another couple of chapters.
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:10.960]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.600]   We thank them for their support, Andy.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.600]   Oh, no.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:18.600]   I was just going to say I'm in the middle of reviewing every single GPS app for GPS street
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.000]   navigator after the iPhone.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   Oh, good.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.760]   And I've decided that what we, the one that I will absolutely, no matter what their other
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:29.600]   features are, the one that I will absolutely crown as the champion is one for the special
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:34.200]   button that looks at whatever track you're currently playing and will automatically route
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:38.000]   you so that if there are 37 minutes left in this chapter of the book, it will route you
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.560]   so that you don't get home for 37 minutes.
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.280]   Now, that's what we need.
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.280]   There you go.
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:46.240]   A GPS that you say, here's how much more I need to listen.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.240]   That's so good.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.240]   I love it.
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:54.160]   Hey, just before we get to our picks of the week, I just got a word on our friend feed
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.160]   feed.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:58.800]   And by the way, we create a friend feed feed for every show in the Twitter conversations
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:06:59.800]   room.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:03.760]   If you want to check that out, it's friendfeed.com/twit-conversations.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:10.720]   Dustin Salings, who is a really talented programmer and wrote a track application for Twitter
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:17.880]   and so forth, has a GitHub repository of, get ready for this, ZFS.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.880]   For the Macintosh.
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:23.160]   Now, remember, it's open source.
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:32.360]   So I'm not sure exactly how this would work, but if you go to dusted.github.com, you'll
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:37.360]   see that he's created a port for ZFS.
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:43.560]   And since it's an open source project, he can do that.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.240]   So it's got an installer.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:48.760]   I use in your, with your own wrist.
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.680]   I'm a little scared of that.
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:52.960]   I'm not sure I think that it'll be good for R&D.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.800]   He says, "You still need to kind of know what you're doing to make use of it, and I'm hoping
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:58.600]   we can work together to make it easy for everybody.
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:01.800]   Changing the file system on a Mac is a significant thing.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:05.600]   But you'd have to do it and reinstall, right?
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:10.920]   It's like taking the tablecloth out from under the table while the table's set.
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.320]   But thank you, Dustin.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:13.320]   Well done.
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:18.400]   Thanks, folks, in the Twitch conversations room who put that up also in the Twitch conversations
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:20.120]   room, the anti-Droidad.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.480]   As long as we're talking about the the Droidad, here's the anti-Droidad.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:25.840]   I remember the Droid does add.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.520]   This is called I Don't Care.
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.280]   I'm going to play a little bit of this.
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.680]   This is a visual, I'm sure.
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:37.000]   So you'll just have to, we'll have to read along.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.400]   I don't need scare tactics.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:45.520]   I don't need to imitate.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.240]   I don't need a droid.
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:48.240]   There's a little R2D2.
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.640]   Unless it's R2D2.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.280]   I don't have a problem with iTunes.
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:56.680]   I don't buy brands who bash other brands.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:59.760]   Hello, I'm a Mac.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.720]   Can I have a PC?
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.840]   I, oops, I came first.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:04.840]   I phone.
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.840]   Hey, that's cool.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.480]   That's what you call a user-generated.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:11.640]   Although I think that the I don't use brands that bash other brands.
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.880]   I mean, Apple's American pain is bash.
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:17.720]   In fact, that's a little clip that we're playing.
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.040]   Thank you, Holger, for passing that along.
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:22.040]   Now, it's time for our picks of the week.
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.000]   Let's start with you, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.760]   Then we'll get to Andy, and then I'll have my pick at the time.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.480]   So I'm back to the iPhone.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:29.040]   You son of a gun.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.240]   I'm going to try this.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.800]   I'm going to punish you for that.
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.560]   I'm going to do a mini-pick.
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:37.800]   After you do yours, you're going to be so sorry you did this.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:40.320]   I'm scared.
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:42.400]   I got a mini-pick that is going to addict you.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.440]   Leo, you're right there next to him.
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:45.760]   Don't just punish him by doing a pick.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:46.400]   Just hand him.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:46.920]   Oh, yeah, I could.
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.560]   He's right over in the head of my thinking.
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.400]   I'm scared.
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:51.880]   I didn't come with a pick at him.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:56.400]   I found a desktop defense.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.320]   Is this your pick?
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:57.840]   No.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.760]   Oh.
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:09:59.880]   That's not--
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:00.800]   That's field.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.240]   Yeah, use it as a shield.
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.840]   No, I found a desktop defense game that is more addictive than any I've seen yet.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:06.960]   No, I don't want to hear it.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:07.920]   I know.
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:15.400]   So this is-- money works gold is a kind of quick-in clone for the Mac.
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.640]   That's not what I'm talking about.
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:17.840]   You just wanted the box.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.440]   Oh, because it's got a barcode on it.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.480]   Ooh, let's watch him.
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:22.880]   He's going to take a picture with his iPhone.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:25.440]   I don't know if this is going to work because this is like a weird barcode.
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:26.960]   Well, here, I must have other barcodes.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:27.880]   Here, here's one.
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:28.560]   Here's one here.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:29.880]   This unsolved your computer.
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:34.280]   Now, see, if it finds this, this is a video that we made at the screen savers Patrick
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.200]   Art and I made.
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:36.440]   I mean, this is a really old barcode.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:40.120]   What this is, it's called-- and this was sent to me by someone-- it was Twitter follower
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:40.960]   where I can't-- I'm sorry.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:41.800]   I don't have the name with me.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.040]   But saying you should check this out because I've talked about wanting to be able to scan
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:47.840]   barcodes.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:51.120]   So this one's called Redline and a Red Laser.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.760]   I'm sorry, Red Laser.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.600]   And all I do is I say, I want to scan this.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.920]   And I don't really hit anything other than just--
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.000]   I mean, just stop for a second.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.560]   Hold on, I was moving when I did-- and I mean, I got to tell you, it was blurry when I did
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:04.760]   it.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:07.800]   And it says, solve your computer problems.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:08.320]   It found it.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.160]   It means instantly.
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.560]   Instantly.
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:10.960]   Instantly.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.880]   OK, that's OK.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.680]   I mean, it was a blurry-- from a blurry photo.
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:16.080]   OK, I'm like, I'm a shooting out.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.680]   It was all moving.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:18.520]   I mean, it was like--
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:22.080]   No, you didn't-- because I've tried-- there's another one that I have that is very slow.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.040]   That's very impressive.
[01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:23.640]   And I'm like, boom.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:27.160]   And I couldn't believe how well-- and I started going around and I--
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:27.960]   I've been scanning--
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.280]   Now, what do you get now that you found the barcode?
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:35.360]   Well, it'll tell you where you can-- obviously, where you can get it in Amazon.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.440]   You can't get that one at Amazon.
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:39.880]   But it has-- like, for instance, the Breville, the thing it has--
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:40.600]   It's a kettle that we love.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:46.720]   It has the prices, of course, at Amazon, but also at Rover Best by JR, Food Network
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:47.840]   Store, Ape's of Maine.
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.040]   I mean, it has the list of what it was--
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.520]   So it shows you where else you can get it.
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.040]   And I can do it.
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.400]   Now, I think that the business model here, for them, if it was me, the business model--
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.360]   Also, buck 99.
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.600]   So they're going to make some money on that.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:59.120]   Well, but I think the big business model for them, if they're smart, is that they're
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.480]   getting the referral code.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.400]   So they're getting 4% of the little Amazon--
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:04.400]   I think it's a little Amazon.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:05.400]   I hope they are.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.400]   They're not crazy.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:11.440]   So I can order it straight from Amazon on my iPhone from that thing.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:16.000]   Now, this is the kind of stuff that-- if it doesn't terrify brick and mortar, it should.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.360]   Because this is-- I walk in--
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:22.280]   I've seen stores with a band cell phones and cameras because they don't want you doing
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.280]   that.
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.280]   Yeah, then I've literally seen that.
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:25.280]   So don't go there.
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:26.280]   It's on the store.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.640]   It's rare for me to show up.
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:32.960]   I mean, I usually buy-- if the store is within a certain range, I buy-- I'll pay a little
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.320]   bit more for the convenience of that.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:37.360]   I just want to pick it up and walk away.
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:41.920]   But it's-- a lot of times my biggest problem is I just don't want to carry it home.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:46.280]   I mean, I think what stores need to be doing is figuring out ways that you can use that
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.480]   thing in their store, like borders bookstore.
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.600]   I should be able to use it in order and have it delivered to my house.
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:51.600]   I want to look at it.
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.760]   I don't want to carry the books around.
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:57.000]   The biggest reason I don't buy books is that I'm traveling and I go to a bookstore.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.840]   And I don't want to put it in my suitcase.
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:01.720]   And that's the-- and I think that some people just don't want to deal with it.
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:03.440]   They just want it to show up at their house.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:07.960]   Anyway, this works worldwide by the way, US, Europe and Great Britain's--
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.960]   And it's crazy fast.
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:10.960]   It's on Japan, France.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.960]   It's really, really effective.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.560]   I couldn't believe that it worked as well as it does.
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:18.040]   All right, I just bought it so you win.
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.640]   But I'm going to still punish you.
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:20.640]   No!
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:21.640]   I don't want to know.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:23.160]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.160]   OK.
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.640]   The password is for those-- Alex isn't listening.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:27.640]   No, no.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:32.480]   For those who still are looking for a game that is absolutely addictive on the iPhone.
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.480]   All right.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:34.480]   Shh.
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:35.480]   Geo Defense Swarm.
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:36.480]   OK.
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:37.480]   That's almost--
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:38.480]   You got to defend it.
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.480]   Yeah.
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.480]   It's a tower defense.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:41.960]   I want to know about it.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:42.960]   Oh, I love it.
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:43.960]   And it's pretty.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:44.960]   It's pretty.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.000]   Here, you just play a little bit on the easy level here on mine.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.600]   You just see if you want.
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.160]   Just play the-- just a little sniff.
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.720]   There's just the first one's free there.
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.200]   Just get the first one in there.
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:54.200]   Just do the first one.
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.640]   Can't you see how you like that?
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:57.640]   Just one line.
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:58.640]   It's tower defense.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:01.400]   But it's fast and it's hard and it's very pretty and it's very fun.
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:06.120]   And you know what it does what a lot of smart games do now, which is it posts your successes
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:08.600]   to your Twitter and Facebook.
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:11.720]   And that's how I've learned about a lot of games now.
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:15.560]   Andy and I've go time for-- time to dance!
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:17.040]   Time for your pick of the week.
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:21.800]   Well, of course, now that I am talking about actual dance music, now, of course, the
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.800]   video sells whole sound.
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:28.320]   I do have a couple of different special playlists in iTunes.
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:32.560]   One is called "Pepi Music" and the other one is called "Peaceful Music."
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.360]   So that when I'm-- it's a late night drop.
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:39.680]   You really only have two switches on and off.
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:40.680]   Go and oh, go baby.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.840]   That's how I roll.
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:47.680]   And usually it's just a case of, oh, well, this is like-- this is like-- it's raining
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:48.680]   men.
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:51.560]   Well, let's just put that in the peppy music track.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:54.040]   And let's see how that one works out.
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:15:02.840]   But I recently became hip to the idea of these BPM analyzers that software that analyzes
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:07.120]   the beats per minute of every single track in your library and uses that to assemble
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:13.720]   playlists not only of the fast music and the slow music, but also to sort of customize
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:17.080]   the path that the playlist is going to take.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:23.680]   We already have genius playlists that do things like look for genres, look for similar artists.
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:28.040]   They also probably-- Apple doesn't talk about why they picked the genius tracks that they
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:31.800]   do, but BPM is probably another part of it.
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:37.960]   This is the utility called "Tangerine" that is sort of a managed genius playlist creator
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:40.440]   where you can say, just give me lots of fast music.
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.120]   I'm doing-- I'm going to be running today.
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.880]   Give me lots of fast music.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:47.640]   Or you could say, I want to start off slow.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:50.560]   Give me an hour's worth of music.
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.560]   Start me off slow.
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:55.520]   Take it to a big nice peak in the middle part, then sort of tail it all the way down again.
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:57.960]   Or just like go up and down, up and down, up and down.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:02.640]   Just mix it up that way, but make sure it doesn't just simply jar from one type of music
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:03.840]   to the other.
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.040]   It can build these playlists for you automatically.
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:08.800]   You can control and play all the music directly through Tangerine.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.680]   It works through your iTunes library.
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:14.160]   It's not like you have to have a second copy of your library to make this work.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:18.320]   But once you have developed or the software builds you a playlist that you really like,
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:22.320]   you can click another button and it will simply create that playlist inside of iTunes.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:30.760]   And it can also add all that BPM information directly into the tags of your iTunes library
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:36.200]   so that if you then want to make a smart playlist that says, "Give me two hours worth
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:41.160]   of music from the genre rock and roll," whose BPM is no less than this but no higher than
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.160]   that.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:44.160]   And please just sync that to my iPhone right away.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.440]   It'll do that too.
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:50.400]   So you get a 15-day free trial so you can get an idea of what it'll actually do for
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.400]   you.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:56.600]   I was very, very surprised at how useful the playlist it was creating was to me, where
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.600]   to me.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:01.520]   That you just want to create playlists for specific moods, especially if you're doing
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:05.600]   like if you want to create a playlist that's going to be playing throughout a party for
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:11.200]   about four hours and you do want to be a good DJ.
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.200]   You don't want to stink.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:16.120]   You want to make sure the music matches the mood of the event.
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:21.760]   This can automatically set you up with a nice little rock and three, four hours of rock,
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:25.080]   jazz, whatever that will take you through the entire evening.
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.960]   A lot of it is just interesting just to see the decisions that it makes for you and how
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:30.280]   smart a lot of those decisions are.
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.360]   I've heard very good things about this.
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:33.360]   I want to try it.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:34.680]   25 bucks if you decide to keep it.
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:40.200]   But again, you get 15 days in order to see what it will do for you.
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:45.200]   I haven't bought it yet, but I have to admit that the only thing the trial does not do
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.920]   is automatically transfer a playlist into iTunes.
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:51.240]   And I sheepishly admit that I've liked it.
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:55.120]   Like some of these playlists so much that I've sort of screenshotted them, then reproduced
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.520]   them inside the iTunes.
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:57.520]   Wow.
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:58.520]   Wow.
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:00.280]   I think I know these people, somebody.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.560]   I think it's time to pay the 25 dalies.
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:04.480]   Mr. Skate and that co.
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:09.760]   And by the way, we've completely lost Alex.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:13.760]   He's gone.
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.840]   Completely lost Alex.
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:16.840]   It's good, isn't it?
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:17.840]   Damn you.
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:18.840]   It's really good.
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.000]   And I'll tell you, it gets harder and harder.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.440]   I'm stuck on a medium level, but I just, I think it's insolvable.
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.440]   Oh my gosh.
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:30.720]   So, so here the thing is, it's like a mixture of tempest.
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:31.720]   It's tempesty.
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:32.720]   It's tempesty.
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:35.840]   You know, with, you know, with desktop tower to fans.
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:36.840]   Oh man.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:37.840]   It's really fun.
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:40.120]   I feel like, I feel like Will Smith, an I am legend.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:41.960]   That's the one person who does not play games.
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:46.640]   That's the only person who's inoculated against this incredible fire debilitating virus.
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.640]   Yeah.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:48.640]   You are legend.
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.040]   You're the last of a dying breed, Andy.
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:54.380]   So on behalf of the only, only host who is actually still paying attention, your back
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:55.380]   break is broke.
[01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:56.380]   No, wait, wait.
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:57.380]   I have a pick.
[01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:58.380]   Wait.
[01:18:58.380 --> 01:18:59.380]   Oh, you are paying attention.
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:01.540]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:03.460]   Actually, look at this.
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:04.460]   Look at this.
[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:11.380]   Now this is a Windows 7 running on a Macintosh in virtualization, but, but there's something
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:12.380]   interesting in it.
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.540]   I don't know if you, you notice there's something interesting about it.
[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:18.740]   See, there's kind of, it's kind of transparent that the bars at the top are kind of transparent.
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:26.260]   And look, when I hover my mouse over the task bar, I get, I'm getting a little thumbnails.
[01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:29.140]   My God, it almost is if.
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:32.780]   Aero glass is working in virtualization.
[01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:33.780]   Could it be?
[01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:34.780]   Yes, it is.
[01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:39.660]   Ladies and gentlemen, V, it came out today, VMware Fusion 3.0.
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:42.420]   And this is the, he's given me my phone back.
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:43.940]   No, no, he says enough.
[01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:46.620]   No more, no more.
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:48.540]   This is the new version of VMware Fusion.
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:50.060]   You do have to pay for the upgrade.
[01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:54.340]   I'm sorry to say it's $40 if you have an existing copy.
[01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:59.140]   And you know, I've been going back and forth between VMware, parallels, and a sun's virtual
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:00.140]   box.
[01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:02.500]   And actually I use the free virtual box all the time, but you, if you're going to use
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:07.820]   Windows and you want to think, have things like arrow peak or shake and all of that
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:12.500]   stuff, you, you know, you have to use VMware Fusion.
[01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:18.820]   This is the first one I've seen where you can actually get arrow in Windows 7 in virtualization,
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:20.620]   running in a window, in a Mac window.
[01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:21.780]   It's by an arrow for.
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:26.020]   Arrow is the, is the fancy effects in, in, in Windows.
[01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:28.900]   It was actually started in Vista.
[01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:35.540]   And it's, you know, it's just, it really is, is just I can't except that there, you know,
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:39.020]   this, this, this peak thing is actually very, very cool.
[01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:42.300]   And now you can get an OS 10, by the way, it's basically what the new Snow Leopard doc
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:43.300]   does.
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:49.180]   It minimizes Windows now minimizes applications into the icon, just as Snow Leopard does.
[01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:54.420]   And it gives you a little thumbnail of what's, what that minimized window looks like.
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:56.820]   And by the way, it's, it's a live window.
[01:20:56.820 --> 01:21:00.140]   So in the performance people are seeing is that that's from the capture, not from the
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:01.140]   not from.
[01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:02.140]   Yeah.
[01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:03.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:04.140]   I don't know if you're seeing a slow performance if you're watching a shop.
[01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:05.140]   Yeah.
[01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:07.100]   You know, no, it's much, much faster in real life.
[01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:08.100]   It's, it's not full speed.
[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:15.020]   You know, VMware like a parallel seems to use a lot of CPU cycles.
[01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:16.860]   And so it can slow me down.
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:20.380]   And also I should say, while we're doing this, it's running something in the background called
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:26.100]   Nine Night that I run anytime I install a new copy of Windows and installs all my software,
[01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:30.060]   Firefox and Skype and VLC and everything, Foxit readers.
[01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:34.300]   So it's in the, right now we're installing a massive number of programs in the background.
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:37.020]   But look, just having a Aero Glass.
[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:42.580]   Well, what that tells you is that the performance is, is considerably improved.
[01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:46.340]   So this is, I think right now VMware Fusion is going to be the virtualization to be, and
[01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:52.260]   it is now out $3.0, $40 an upgrade if you, if you don't, if you have a earlier version,
[01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:55.580]   and I think it's $80 if you, if you don't.
[01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:56.580]   And very impressive.
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:57.580]   It was great.
[01:21:57.580 --> 01:21:58.580]   I was, I saw that this morning.
[01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.580]   I was thinking of very impressive.
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:00.580]   Yeah.
[01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:01.580]   Yeah.
[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:02.580]   Yeah.
[01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:03.580]   I upgraded immediately because I use them all.
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:06.100]   I mean, I have licenses for all of them, but, but this was impressive.
[01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:07.700]   It was well worth the $40 buck upgrade.
[01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:09.020]   All right, Andy.
[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:10.700]   Was that the one you were going to do, by the way?
[01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:11.700]   Nope.
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:13.540]   I thought you were going to talk about that really great website building tool.
[01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:15.020]   Oh, save it for next week.
[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:16.020]   Save it for next week.
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:17.020]   Save it for next week.
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:18.020]   He's dancing again.
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:24.980]   That's actually, I thought you might know because throughout the show, there've been
[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:29.540]   little windows, beeps and boops going on as I've been restarting windows and stuff, getting
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:30.540]   it set up.
[01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:34.740]   And I thought, Andy, especially might recognize, wait a minute, that's the Windows 7 startup
[01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:35.740]   sound.
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:40.460]   We can play in windows or we can play in for cool station.
[01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:42.660]   Deep, deep, deep, I can make you dance anytime now.
[01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:44.340]   I figured out how to do it.
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:46.460]   So I'm a, I'm not your damn monkey.
[01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:48.620]   I'm a dance Andy, dance button.
[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:50.060]   All right, we're out of time.
[01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:56.380]   I've got to go, I've got to go see a man about a car, but I think you all for, you
[01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:57.380]   look at me funny.
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:59.300]   All will be explained on Twitter on Sunday.
[01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:00.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:01.940]   All will be explained.
[01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:05.140]   If you want to watch his show live, you can see Andy dance on video soon.
[01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:09.500]   I know I promised that we would have, you know, the Roku stuff.
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:12.780]   It's, you know, this stuff always takes a little longer any day now.
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:15.140]   The Roku, the Roku, the new Roku players have been announced.
[01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:16.580]   They're going to be updated.
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:19.500]   There's a, there's the new Roku software download.
[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:22.740]   You'll see an update and I'll let you know when that's available at the same time as
[01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:28.140]   that happens, we will be putting all of these shows up on iTunes for video download as well
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:29.580]   as audio download.
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:30.740]   So just keep listening.
[01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:32.220]   You'll, you'll be told when it happens.
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:35.100]   We're going to start with Mac break weekly, Windows weekly, this week in tech.
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:39.220]   This week in fun and this week in Google, those will be the five video launch shows,
[01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:41.060]   but all of them eventually will come out.
[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:44.260]   We do record high quality video of everything now.
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:47.740]   You can watch the live stream as we're recording.
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:50.780]   Every Tuesday we do this thing at 11 o'clock Pacific time.
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:51.780]   Love an ish.
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:52.780]   Yeah.
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:53.780]   We'll get around to starting 11.
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:54.780]   But you get what we're on.
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:55.780]   We're on live.
[01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:59.860]   We're, you know, the cameras usually come on 11 and there's just some futzing around is
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:00.860]   which is fun.
[01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:01.860]   Yeah.
[01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:02.860]   We talk.
[01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:03.860]   And that's the difference is that's what you see.
[01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:07.540]   The rest of the stuff that you don't see camera always adds 13 minutes.
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.980]   That's what they say, isn't it?
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:12.060]   Even these new portable cameras.
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:13.380]   So 11 a.m. Pacific.
[01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:15.820]   That's 2 p.m. Eastern.
[01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:19.860]   And now they've, they've, no UTC hasn't changed because we haven't changed yet.
[01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:22.780]   So it's still 1800 UTC.
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:29.140]   I had to buy a application on the iPhone called time slider that will let me, because, because
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:33.620]   you know, we're going to go into standard time and that's going to screw up my UTC calculations
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:37.300]   because you never, there was a rumor that Obama was going to take that on.
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:38.300]   He was going to take on you.
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:41.980]   Getting rid of all this stupid daylight saving crap.
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:46.220]   But evidently he's too caught up with this silly thing called health care.
[01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:47.220]   Damn him in health care.
[01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:50.020]   And you know, it's important for some reason he doesn't understand that we need to get
[01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:51.020]   rid of this.
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:53.300]   We need to, we need to take a step.
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:57.820]   No, Obama said Thomas.
[01:24:57.820 --> 01:24:59.220]   That's son of a bitch.
[01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:01.220]   Actually, you know, Pennsylvania.
[01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:06.380]   I think after, if he, if he does conquer health care and the world situation, he's going to
[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:09.980]   take on the really thorny issue of converting to the metric system.
[01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:10.980]   I'm there.
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:13.100]   I'm just waiting for, maybe he's just waiting for reelection.
[01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:16.020]   He's saying, I'm going to say, I'm going to make sure that about eight months before
[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:18.900]   the election, I'll do it daylight saving time.
[01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:20.620]   I will, I won't even need a limo.
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:22.500]   People will just carry me wherever I want.
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.620]   You know, I think, I think we convert.
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:28.700]   I think that's what we really should be looking at is, his term too should be, I will convert
[01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:32.940]   us to the metric system and I will, and I will get rid of daylight saves.
[01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:34.140]   Those two things alone.
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:35.140]   That would be enough.
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:36.140]   I guarantee reelection.
[01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:39.180]   I think that says a lot about a candidate that they actually have a number of numbers
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:40.180]   in that thirty-seven.
[01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:42.180]   I would love that man.
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:44.820]   But you know, then we're going to complain that it's so dark.
[01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:46.980]   You can't really win.
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:52.300]   You know, in a computer, in a highly connected global economy, you know, we should, we just
[01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:54.820]   need to get rid of this, changing the time all the time.
[01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:55.820]   I know.
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:58.140]   But, but, but to see everybody else does it.
[01:25:58.140 --> 01:25:59.140]   We should just move.
[01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:00.140]   We should all just be all UTC.
[01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:01.140]   Everything should be all UTC.
[01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:02.140]   One time.
[01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:04.940]   It's usually arranged to hold the planet stationary so it's always the same time.
[01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:05.940]   There you go.
[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.500]   This will ever have to own a watch again.
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:08.500]   There you go.
[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:09.500]   I just want one time.
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:13.380]   I mean, I do not go and I support this message.
[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:14.580]   And we thank you for joining here.
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:15.580]   Get back to work though.
[01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:16.580]   Break time's over.
[01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:33.140]   [Music]
