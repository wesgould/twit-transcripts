[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   And by listeners like you.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Thanks so much for your contribution.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Couldn't do to it without it.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly to show the covers of all things.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Apple, Macintosh, and so forth and so on.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Mr. Andy Inatko is here from his lair in beautiful Massachusetts.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And to all of our German listeners I apologize deeply and profoundly.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   And I will not be using these stupid Hogan's Heroes German accent for the remainder of this show.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   I used an accent on Twitter this past weekend that I was just made up.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   It wasn't sweet as your anything.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   It was just made up.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And I got hate mail from Sweden.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Well, see, slowly I learn.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I know that sometimes it's fun to do one of your fakey fakey...
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   One of those fakey fake English accents.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   But you cannot have an appreciation for how stupid an American sounds doing what he thinks
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   is a very good English accent.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And then slowly it's almost like I have my world map of countries which I'm aware that I sound really stupid
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   trying to approximate an English speaking person trying to speak with that accent.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   We're calling the map as we go.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Still a lot of countries left to go.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I just miss those days when broadcasting was national and you didn't have to worry about offending across international borders.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Here you go.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   You can make fun of Canadians all you wanted.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   What could they do about it?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   What could they do?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Oh, they gots that bacon.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Have you guys seen the front page of Apple with a counter?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   You got to go to apple.com.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   The Apple store is about to hit a billion downloads and they've got one of those odometer things
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   you know, like you have in your car clicking over and it clicks over fast.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   That's not a live thing.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   It's actually going at a regular rate, isn't it?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Yeah, it is.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Oh.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Can we just sit here and wait until it goes over a billion and then start the show?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Well, we've till it goes just under a billion and I'll finally buy that app and we can buy it.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Yeah, because what do you get if you're the billionth app?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.800]   I think there's some like great prizes, isn't that?
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   You get like a notebook.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.000]   I don't want the whole listen in front of me about there's like a $10,000 gift card.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Wow.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.480]   So basically, so basically you go up to the top level browse of the iTunes store, do a
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.000]   select all, then click one click purchase and you own the iTunes store.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Not quite.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Not quite.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And then 18 months later, the downloads finish.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And then iPod touch, the time capsule, and a Macbook Pro.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   And all you have to do is be by the billionth app.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.640]   How much do you want to bet there is something going on?
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.000]   They found the legal loophole to make sure that it is not going to be a farting app.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Congratulations.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.480]   Or maybe there's just sort of a mutual thing that look, we can either tell the entire world
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.960]   that you bought the either the farting app or the app that lets you animate a bikini
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.240]   shot of a lady so that things are jiggling or we can simply give it to the next person
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.000]   down the line.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.320]   They had to change that after and they said that they didn't imply nudity or jiggling.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.120]   You could jiggle anything.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.000]   It's a basic technology that has applications just by everywhere.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.880]   It's like poor data.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.760]   Apple doesn't create answers.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.280]   They create possibilities.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.280]   It's actually a whole new core layer in Snow Leopard, I believe, the jiggle layer.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.000]   Yes, it's called Benny the Layer.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.200]   So they on the website, they say the top 10 apps of all time.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.440]   These are the all time top paid apps.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.600]   Do you want to take a wild stab at anybody?
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.360]   The all time paid apps might be on the iTunes store.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.920]   The Crash Bandicoot game has been...
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.920]   Very good.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.920]   Number one, Andy Inako.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.560]   I think we're going to give you $10 for that.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.560]   Really?
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.560]   Number two.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.560]   It was number one for a long time.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.080]   I'm not sure really why.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.080]   Koi Pond.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.080]   Anybody try that?
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.480]   It's like just a fish pond in your phone, right?
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.680]   I'm not buying any apps until I fart.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.680]   Number one.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.400]   By the way, Scott Bourn here, checking in from Gage Harbor.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.400]   I just wanted to say hi to everybody.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.400]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.760]   I didn't introduce you.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.880]   That other voice, I am so sorry, Scott.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.720]   I don't know what the medication is a little stronger.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.280]   This is my 158th episode of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.680]   I think this is the breaking point at which point you are actually just finally taken
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.680]   for granted.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.680]   That's okay.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.680]   We now know.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.360]   That guy who's always here is here.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.640]   Scott Bourn.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.960]   I am so sorry, Scott.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.960]   I wasn't...
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.960]   That's okay.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.960]   It's okay.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.280]   I got like 30 hate males on how I'm all wrong about I should be willing to listen to brain
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.760]   surgeon talk from people who are gamers.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.120]   We were talking before the show and I guess there were some people listening in about
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.120]   interactive media.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.120]   I get a lot of hate mail.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.120]   That's a wrap.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.680]   I get a lot of hate mail for talking about new media too.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.080]   They say, "Would you please talk about tech and less about new media?"
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.480]   Given the amount of hate mail you get, it's kind of a wonder why we're always in the top
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.480]   10 on the iTunes.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.600]   Well, it's a wonder that we have anything to talk about.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.080]   Somebody hates everything.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.520]   They said, "Talk less about new media and then, oh, and by the way, you aren't new media."
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.520]   Yeah, I understand.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.080]   Because you're not interactive enough.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.280]   By virtue of the fact that you're older than I am.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.280]   Yes.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.280]   Anyway, top 10 applications and the iTunes support.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.000]   Is I fart anywhere on there?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.840]   It's not even in the top 10.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.840]   No.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.840]   How can that be?
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.840]   There's like 3,000 ifart apps.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.840]   Well, that's why.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.840]   Well, that's because of the competition.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.840]   I see it's too diluted.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.560]   It's because of...
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.560]   [Squeaking]
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.160]   ...quipond enigma, which I think is a really great app, but jeweled to a great app.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.400]   I beer, interestingly enough.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.400]   Number four.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.640]   I'm sorry, that's number five.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:02.920]   Moto Chaser, Pocket Guitar, Flick Fishing, Tetris, Texas Hold 'em, Super Monkey Ball,
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:09.200]   Pocket God, Chromag Rally, by the way, Chromag Rally makes I think three now for Pangaea
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.200]   Games.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.760]   Or is it two?
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.400]   They're pretty hot.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.920]   Ocarina?
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.520]   Or is it Ocarina?
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.520]   Oker-Ack.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.520]   Judges?
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.880]   We're still working on cans versus cons, so I don't know.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.880]   Fieldrunners.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.880]   Oh, there it is.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.880]   I fart mobile.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.880]   Thank you.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.880]   Touch grind.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.880]   I hunt.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.880]   I shoot.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.880]   I get it.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.880]   I beer, I hunt, I shoot, I fart.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.280]   It's the magic.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.560]   They should release those as a special app.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.360]   You realize that the Appalachian Americans are going to be upset with us.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.400]   No, I didn't say anything about Appalachia.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.400]   You do.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.960]   Well, that's what I'm filling in for Alex.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.200]   I hunt, I shoot.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.200]   I fart.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.200]   And I do.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.840]   But what's the order on that?
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.840]   All right, these are the...
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.600]   This sounds like a conversation that a junior high school student has after a Latin class.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.640]   I want to do the declension of something that he wasn't supposed to learn.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.640]   Mo amassamat.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.640]   Amassamat.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.640]   Amassamat.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.320]   I'm hard, I drink, I shoot.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.320]   I Facebook.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.320]   I Facebook number one on the top all time free apps.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.440]   Are you ready for the free apps?
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.440]   Facebook?
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.440]   Very good.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.440]   You know why people use Facebook?
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.440]   Because it's got the old Facebook interface.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.440]   It's the best way to use Facebook.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.240]   You don't have to deal with a new one.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.240]   Google Earth.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.240]   Good.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.240]   Pandora.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.240]   Good.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.240]   We all love Pandora, right?
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.240]   Tap.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.440]   Yeah, Pandora is awesome.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.480]   Tap Revenge.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.320]   That was a great game free.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.320]   Shazam.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.320]   Pac-Man.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.320]   Light.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.320]   Backgrounds.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.320]   Touch Hockey.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.320]   Labyrinth.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.320]   Flashlight.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.800]   Flashlight is in the list.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.840]   How many people have downloaded Flashlight?
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.480]   I need a new business model.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.480]   Clearly.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.680]   Well, there's no business model.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.680]   This one's free, so I don't know.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.680]   We are listening to...
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.560]   We are hearing about a lot of free apps here.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.880]   We're not talking about a lot of like $20 apps that are setting the world on fire.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.200]   The other ones were paid, but they were $1 to $5.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.000]   Yeah, but they make it up in volume, Andy.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.440]   Here's one to fill out the five.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:16.600]   By displacing bandwidth from the actual pay apps for people that you're competing with.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.880]   It may be free, but we make it up in volume.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.920]   That's the business model.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.320]   It's a good model.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.920]   This is one to go with our five horsemen of the apocalypse, actually.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.920]   I bowl.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.720]   So now it's I shoot, I hunt, I fish, I fart, I bowl.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.720]   And afterwards I beal.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.400]   I don't know if there's a nice scratch there on a bee.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.400]   Oh, that'd be really good.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.160]   And then bubble wrap.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.640]   To round that ball.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.320]   No, you're gonna get...
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.720]   You're gonna beat last week's Twit Hate Mail record with the hate here.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.960]   I'm not assigning this to any region of the nation.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.960]   Oh, no, no.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.280]   I mean, just the fact that we're even talking about it.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.720]   There's only love here.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.480]   I'm only feeling love.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.840]   I mean, people can't stand it.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.520]   They were having such a good time.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.760]   Well, there's an app for feeling love, too.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.760]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.000]   You need a jail brick and phone for it, though.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.800]   I've got to say, isn't that in the adult section over there at the iTunes store?
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.360]   So Apple is responding now to the Microsoft ads.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.480]   You've seen the Microsoft, you know, I am a PC ads.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.280]   I'm gonna go buy a PC for, you know, $50.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.760]   Oh, I'm too cool.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.040]   I'm not cool enough to have an app, an Apple.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.880]   So I'm gonna go buy a cheap PC.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.920]   So there are, if we haven't had, how long's it been since we have, let me stop here, stop
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.920]   here.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.240]   How long's it been since we've had a new get a Mac ad?
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.240]   It's been a while.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.960]   Yeah, I heard about it.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.960]   Scary.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.000]   It's loading it up on me.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.160]   Can we get the ad to run in one of those empty spots there on the Sky Passaurus?
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.960]   Now that would be cool.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.160]   Well, I can only do it this way.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.160]   Full screen.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.160]   So this is biohazard suits.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.160]   Oh, I'm a Mac.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.160]   And I'm a PC.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.160]   Hey, PC, what's with the suit?
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.160]   What?
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.400]   What's with the biohazard suit?
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.640]   Oh, the biohazard suit?
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.800]   There's this major new PC viruses on the lose.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.880]   Yeah, I heard about it.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.880]   Scary.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.680]   PC viruses and malware have tripled in the past year.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.440]   Some estimates put a 20,000 new ones are discovered every day.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.360]   If you're lucky, you don't have to deal with this stuff, Mac.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.360]   What about you?
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.360]   You know, living the suit forever.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.360]   What?
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.920]   I'm sorry, are you gonna live in that suit forever?
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.640]   I couldn't hear you through my virus-proof mask.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.640]   Well...
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:30.520]   These are, you know, maybe it's maybe it's maybe the Microsoft ads are getting to me,
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.040]   but they don't seem quite as sweet and funny as before.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:39.440]   Well, see, my favorite one was the one where PC goes into the future to see if the virus
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.400]   problem has been solved chiefly because it was impossible for people to go to Comic-Con
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.800]   or these other conventions dressed as PC guy or Mac guy without completely blending in.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.440]   Now I'm betting you a $50.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.440]   That was a costume.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.640]   I'll see one guy who's dressed as a future.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:59.600]   There's now a costume that you can finally wear because the brown suit and the hush puppies
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.760]   just weren't doing it.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.760]   This is time traveler.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.760]   Hello, I'm a Mac.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.960]   I'm a PC and I'm headed to the future.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.960]   What?
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.960]   The future, really?
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.880]   Yes, Mac, throughout human history, PCs have had to deal with freezing, crashing error messages.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.840]   I need to know if we're ever going to work the way we should.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.320]   So I'm going to the year 2150.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.640]   Wow, that's amazing.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.640]   Well, good luck.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.640]   I hope it works.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.640]   Greetings, I'm a Mac.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.200]   And I'm a PC.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.200]   Future PC.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   Have they figured out how to fix our issues?
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.920]   Have they figured out how to make us a stable and as hassle-free as a Mac?
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.920]   Future PC just froze.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.520]   So that answers that question.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.440]   All right, that was funny.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.080]   And I like Future PC's suit.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.080]   He's got a little faux tie.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:41.280]   He's got like a tie decal on, which I would actually buy because that's actually a useful
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.280]   product.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.880]   That is a useful product.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.200]   Maybe I can't get away with a clip on tie, but a stick on bow tie.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.000]   I think everyone would actually get behind.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.840]   I think that's free.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:58.120]   I also have to applaud Apple for showing a certain amount of pride and restraint and not
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:04.600]   having the Mac guy having transcended this mortal plane and just being sort of a glowing
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.600]   orb of perfection hovering.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.600]   Hello, I'm a Mac.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.600]   I keep starting.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.600]   I apologize.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.640]   Yeah, because, well, he's wearing a tie.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.360]   He's still wearing a brown suit, basically, is what they're saying.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.200]   Here's legal copy.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.800]   Hello, I'm a Mac.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.000]   And I'm an incredibly easy to use PC.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   What?
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   What is that, buddy?
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.240]   It's just a little legal copy.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.200]   So he's saying I'm much more simple and intuitive than you, Mac, requires a little explanation.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.680]   Did your legal copy just grow?
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.680]   Yeah, I see.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.440]   Usually PCs require a lot of regular maintenance, downloading security patches, virus scans.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.120]   I can't just go out there and say, hey, getting started on PC is the easiest thing in the
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.120]   world.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.480]   Wow, that's a lot of legal copy.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.480]   Watch this.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.480]   PCs are now 100% trouble free.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.480]   Whoa.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.480]   That's the shit that I know.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:55.200]   He gets eaten by the fine print and subsumes the whole screen.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.200]   That's one to watch.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   That's a visual gag.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.000]   But that was very funny.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.680]   So it has actually aired on HD because that's definitely where I use the pause button on
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.680]   my DVR for.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.280]   Now they have HD on the, oh, to read it.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.120]   I want to, if it's, if it's just loremips, I'll be, I'll be very, very, very, let me, let
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:21.080]   me load it up and see if we can zoom in a little bit on it because I've got the HD copy
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.800]   from, let me see here.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.880]   Let's see if we can, let's see if we can zoom in using something that a PC can't do.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.560]   Please note that when you first receive your PC, there's some suggested work that needs
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.120]   to be done before PCs could perform at their peak.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.560]   These steps include, but are not limited to downloading and installing necessary drivers
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.560]   for peripherals.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.200]   These drivers, man, this is good.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.480]   It's real empty the recycle bin.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.040]   And then it has all the, this is somebody who spent some energy doing the copy here.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.320]   Let me, let me, let me see what the, ask them if you have any questions.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.320]   Please see the company.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.960]   Oh, you've got to read this.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.720]   If you choose to run maintenance on your computer prior to this act, please notice your camera
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:03.760]   driver must be installed on your PC in order to review and edit your photos.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.320]   Your camera will not work with your PC if the software driver is not downloaded first.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.080]   I think this is all, this is very interesting.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.440]   You know, I think, I think they must have had someone from an Apple Genius bar write
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:17.480]   that because that's probably the most free technical support for Windows that has ever
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.480]   been given out.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.200]   It's been given out by Apple.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.840]   Therefore, if your PC is not at least 100% is not 100% trouble free, at least you won't
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.160]   lose all your files.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.640]   PC does not claim ownership of problems that occur for materials or software that you downloaded
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.800]   off the internet.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.640]   If your warranty is expired and your PC is not 100% trouble free, you are not eligible
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.120]   for a refund or replacement in terms of the warranty.

[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.120]   You know what?
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.120]   It's honest.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.120]   It's not made up.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.120]   It's honest.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.120]   I wish it were funny though.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.840]   Yeah, it's not funny.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.840]   It's just straight.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.480]   I suppose they'll get a good effort.
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.240]   It's not there with the Chuck Laurie N. title card, but it's up there.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.040]   What's the Chuck Laurie N. title card?
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.760]   Oh, that Chuck Laurie production is like the end of Big Bang Theory.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.200]   It flashes, but just instead of just simply saying Chuck Laurie productions, they'll say
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.080]   Chuck Laurie productions and then like three paragraphs of text that you can only read
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.280]   if you're if you're recording on a deep part.
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.280]   Stop.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.880]   Now that it's an HD though, you can easily read it for the freeze frame.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.080]   It also puts all the title cards up on up on his website.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.240]   They can read so oftentimes they'll just be it'll just be censored.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.560]   Go to the website because they would let up the top card.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.840]   Anyway, this is a digress.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.840]   This is your right though.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.840]   I'm reading it.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.160]   It is actually tech support that they put on this ad.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.160]   One more.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.160]   This is called Stacks.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:43.320]   Hello, I'm a Mac and I'm having a very difficult time finding pictures of my friend.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.400]   Wait, so you're just going to look through your thousands of photos until you find it?
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.400]   Yes, one by one.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.400]   What other way is there?
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.080]   Well, I thought it was actually this cool new feature called Faces, where you just tag
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:55.760]   and face once and I thought it automatically finds other pictures of that person for you
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.600]   and then just puts them on the same place.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.600]   It's facial recognition technology.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.600]   Sounds expensive.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.920]   No, actually it comes free on every new Mac as part of my life.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.080]   Well, I guess I could refine my search method.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.080]   How's that?
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.080]   You do that.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:13.960]   Now, that's a little disingenuous because you can do the same exact thing on a PC.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.240]   In fact, you could do it first on a PC.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.280]   So I'm going to channel Paul Thoreau here.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.080]   Why those little...
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:28.440]   Wait, was that a part of a component of Windows Media?
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.920]   What was it a part of?
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.920]   No, it was never part of Windows.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.320]   I think Picasso does it.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.320]   Right.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.560]   But it's free.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.360]   You don't get pre-installed the machine.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.200]   So okay, you don't get it pre-installed the machine.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.200]   You're right.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.200]   But it doesn't also...
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.560]   The implication is if you want to do this on the PC, it's going to cost you a lot of
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.560]   money.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.560]   True.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:51.280]   Now, one thing it will cost you, if you do it through Picasso, it will cost you the rights
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.360]   to your copyrights of all of your images because all of the Google products require
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:03.120]   you to sign over on their terms of service in a fairly draconian statement.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.720]   Basically the rights to let them do anything they want with your stuff.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.320]   So that's a factor to think about.
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:13.080]   You need to read the terms of services of all these online places that let you do certain
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.080]   things.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.960]   For instance, we're pulling our videos off Vimeo because Vimeo's terms of service allow
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.680]   them to resell them.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:26.160]   And they may not have that intent, but the fact that they have that ability, that gets
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.160]   me worried.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.400]   So I looked at the Google's terms of service and they're really, in my opinion, draconian.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.840]   I don't have anything on Google Docs, Picasso, or any of these places for that very reason.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.280]   I didn't have my photos on Facebook because of their stance on this.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.600]   So there is a slight difference between having a native app that comes with your computer
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:49.960]   that doesn't go outside that you are able to control your intellectual property on.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.080]   But hasn't that already been really hashed out and answered by now?
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.600]   There's so many times that those boilerplate terms of service agreements where all they're
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.000]   trying to do is make sure that they have the ability to copy your photos and your data
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   from one drive on the server to another drive on the server without having you acknowledge
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.360]   another change of terms of service.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:12.520]   Would that actually be a problem if it actually went to a lawsuit?
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:17.320]   Well, I did an interview with Denise Howe of This Week in Law and asked her somebody's
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.080]   very questions, Andy.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:25.360]   And she concluded that the very broad terms of service that I'm talking about, in which
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:31.600]   I've written in detail about on photofocus.com, they would indeed be enforceable in a court
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.520]   if people did it.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.080]   Now there's possibility that you could win that lawsuit, but who has the money and the
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.920]   time to go out and make that case.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.520]   So I mean, I don't want to digress too much.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:48.040]   I just want to mention that there is a slight difference between using a program like iPhoto
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:53.280]   that's on your computer that you're going to put your images into versus going online
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:58.600]   and trusting some third party with both the safety and security of your photographs.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:03.000]   If you've got young kids or if you've got sensitive material or if you're a professional
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.080]   trying to protect your copyright, then it's not the same thing in my opinion, so it doesn't
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.080]   have the same value.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.080]   Right.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.960]   No, you've been very outspoken on this stuff and I think it's good that somebody raised
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.960]   the issue.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.960]   And I'm one of those people who just kind of says, "Oh, it must be just more boilerplate
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.960]   that they throw in there."
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.600]   But it's probably something that...
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.200]   Well, there are boilerplate provisions they could use to accomplish.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.960]   They don't have to be so draconian.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:25.960]   Exactly.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.960]   And he's got a valid point.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.000]   I mean, they do need the right to move stuff, serve, to serve.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.800]   And they can accomplish that without saying it.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.960]   And oh, by the way, we own all your stuff forever.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:34.960]   Right.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.960]   I mean, you don't have to...
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.520]   Well, that's what Facebook asserted and backed down because of people like you who said,
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.520]   "Hey, wait a minute."
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.240]   I mean, I'm just the kind of guy that actually reads these 4,000 word terms of service agreements
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.240]   because I want to know what's going to happen to my stuff.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.920]   And if you choose to make the decision and say, "Hey, it's worth it to me to have the
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.200]   free service to take this risk," then I have no problem with that.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.320]   I just want to make sure people understand what you're doing.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.320]   What they're doing.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.000]   And obviously, it's not going to impact grandma who's got pictures of her cat up there like
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   it's going to impact me.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.600]   It's going to steal fluffy's image.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.520]   You know, it's going to impact me differently.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.680]   I'm a professional photographer.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.320]   It's not going to impact everybody the same.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.640]   Fortune 100, Apple hasn't been on it since 1995.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:24.080]   Steve Jobs and Apple are back on the Fortune 100, partly because of their amazing performance,
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:31.760]   32% increase in revenue this year to 32.5 billion.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:38.280]   They improved 32 positions finishing now at number 71 on the Fortune 100.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.720]   So it hasn't been since Steve Jobs left.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.720]   In '97.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.040]   Well, they said in '95, Steve left.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.600]   This is the first time since he returned in '97.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.600]   I see what you're saying.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.600]   Steve had already left Apple.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.600]   I see what you're saying.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.600]   Yes, yes.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.760]   Their highest rank prior to that was '67 in 1994.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:07.320]   And actually, just for those of us that follow things like stocks and such, Leo, it's a 35%
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.160]   increase in year over year revenue.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.160]   Wow.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.160]   Not 32.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.560]   I'm just reading it from the Silicon Valley Business Journal.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.560]   So slightly.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.560]   They got it.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.560]   They got it wrong.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.560]   What they can't help it.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.000]   Well, you correct me if I say anything wrong.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.480]   Hewlett Packard number nine.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:29.160]   Dell and Microsoft 33 and 35 respectively, but heading south.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.560]   So that's pretty good for Apple.
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.320]   They, I mean, it's just, I mean, how important is it?
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.840]   It's not that important, but you know, it's in a down market to see a company that's moving
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:41.840]   up like this.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.200]   Now, obviously some of that's due to attrition from other companies moving down.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.200]   So there's no reason to try to ignore that fact.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.200]   That's a real factor.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:55.760]   But you know, their numbers are huge given the market and given, you know, what's happening
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:56.920]   to a lot of other companies.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.920]   The stock looks great.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.280]   They're very strong.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.560]   And I think that, you know, they're going to be hit there.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:10.040]   They're predicting a negative year over year growth in the second quarter.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:13.040]   But then again, that could just be a safety net for them.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.920]   But you know, I think they're well positioned.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.480]   They sold 2.2.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:21.720]   Was it 2.2 million max for the quarter?
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.040]   Hardly, you know, a bad showing in this economy.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.440]   And I think if you're a Mac fan, it gives you a little bit of a sigh of relief to say,
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:34.720]   hey, the company that makes my computer ain't going anywhere versus if you're a son microsystems
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.040]   owner, you might have to be a little trepidation right now.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.040]   That's quite a story.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.040]   It's a whole story.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.480]   But Oracle buying son for $7.4 billion.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.400]   I didn't see that coming.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.840]   I did not either.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.360]   And as a guy who bought lots of sun sparkles in the 90s, you know, had I known that they
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.360]   were about to be acquired, it would have made me reconsider my position.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.040]   I mean, Oracle is not a hardware company.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.880]   It's a question is, did they buy son for the hardware?
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.000]   The hardware business has been flagging for son lately.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.120]   You know, it's tough to compete with commodity off the shelf stuff, running windows or Mac
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:16.400]   or Linux, but also with that hardware business, they get a very vital open source software
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.280]   business, including Java, son office.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.480]   And maybe interestingly enough, my SQL, MySQL.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.120]   That's going to impact a lot of people.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.360]   Yeah, I really wonder what that all means.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.120]   But I guess maybe that's a conversation for a lost weekly.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:40.240]   Our friend Randall Schwartz posted that this is a good reason for people to move from MySQL
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.400]   to the other open source free database program, which he and many others believe to be better,
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.960]   which is PostgresQL.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.960]   PostgresQL.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.960]   PostgresQL.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:53.360]   I don't know how you say that.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:58.060]   Also somebody else said, boy, this is why the MySQL Foundation is glad it was very careful
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:02.680]   about its license agreements because Oracle could just, you know, pull the plug at any
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.680]   moment, I guess.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.680]   It's very interesting.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:09.320]   Well, at least MySQL is something that most people who, it is the database system that
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.320]   operates the web.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.680]   But a lot of people who use it, right, use it by WordPress don't even really know how
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.680]   it works.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.680]   It doesn't even care how it works.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.600]   So someone could just rip out the transmission from my car or place with something different
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.480]   and open source and not owned by Oracle.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.680]   And I wouldn't know when I wouldn't care.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.680]   Right.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:31.000]   And I've been a lot of servers run PostgresQL in addition to MySQL.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.760]   And it's a very straightforward thing to use instead of, for instance, for WordPress instead
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.760]   of MySQL.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:42.720]   Apple is rumored according to Apple Insider to be giving developers the next pre-release
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.880]   of Snow Leopard.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.480]   Snow Leopard getting closer and closer.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.000]   You think they'll have it in time for June for the WWDC?
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Certainly.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.160]   I think they'll have something.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.040]   They're sure aiming at that, aren't they?
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.960]   I mean, I'm not sure when the release date is going to be.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.800]   I think they're going to need to have a...
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.960]   We haven't seen the sort of accelerated fine-tuned releases that suggest that they're going
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.600]   to be actually shipping it in June.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.200]   But it definitely means that it definitely looks like they want to have it ready to go
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:12.880]   to developers, lock down, feature-rich, and just doing it to spending June and July just
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.360]   doing bug reports and have it released by, let's say, August.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:20.400]   And make sure that ships with every machine that starts shipping in August and September.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.280]   April 1st was the last update.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:26.840]   At that point, they told developers, "Focus on delivering 64-bit compatibility in your
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.720]   third-party kernel extensions."
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.160]   They really aggressively want to be 64-bit on this, which is a good thing.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.160]   Yeah.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.320]   It definitely points to where the future is going in terms of the architecture, the hardware.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.320]   All 64.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:44.080]   But that must have hurt Apple a little bit when Adobe released 64-bit versions of Photoshop
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.200]   for Windows and not for the Mac.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.200]   And you got that.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.120]   Yeah, but it's such a mess.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:54.840]   It shows you how lucky we are as Mac users to be insulated from all the differences between
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.840]   every single CPU.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.840]   We have to worry about it.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:01.920]   There's so many times when the difference between a 64-bit architecture on a Windows
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.720]   machine is so different.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.560]   Basically, it limits you so greatly if you have an older or cheaper processor.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:13.440]   The difference between a machine that you can pick up at Best Buy for $500 and nicer
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:19.640]   shinier, more oozing with power and scintillating with evil box for $2,000.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.120]   The difference between those two machines could not be more different.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:27.160]   Whereas when I put the same OS on a $500 machine and a $2,000 machine, obviously the
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:30.960]   $2,000 machine runs the same software a lot better, but pretty much it's running the
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.960]   same software.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.720]   It's the same user experience.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:39.800]   I'm always sent straight to Wikipedia and straight to three other different online sources
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:46.080]   to make sure I know, okay, you have an AMD X61-62 processor, but not the AMD 6261, which
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.440]   means that, oh, gosh, dang it.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.680]   Can I just buy you a Macintosh and we can pretend this price is the solve?
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.520]   I really want to go out to dinner tonight.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:28:01.640]   Hey, I just noticed that MacJournals.com has posted an entire transcript of the fine print
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:07.800]   in the new Get-A-Mac ad with gloss and annotations and so forth.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.400]   That's pretty, wow, that's quite a lot.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.640]   I want to have that kind of free time, Leo.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.120]   I'm willing to pay for it.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.120]   Are you kidding?
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.120]   Andy's saying rats.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.080]   I wish I'd gotten there faster.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.760]   You see, it's just like those boys that engage it.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.880]   They know that you get the first one to get into the Google index thing and boy, you just
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:26.880]   break your own.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:27.880]   It's over.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:35.280]   Hey, that's like 30 column inches right there, just with the transcript.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.280]   Any other story?
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:40.280]   Do we care about Pirate Bay going to jail?
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.880]   Does it affect Mac users particularly?
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.880]   I don't think so.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.360]   We talked about it on Twitter.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.520]   It's kind of sad because, I mean, as somebody pointed out, and I think this is really true,
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.560]   these guys are just a search engine, the fact that the search engine often points to illegal
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.760]   torrents isn't necessarily, should that be illegal in itself?
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.400]   They're just a search engine.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:02.800]   Well, I mean, that's a sort of question that ends with the statement, well, let's let
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.880]   a court decide that.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:04.880]   And a court did.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:09.440]   It's one thing to be so insistent that, look, we are not providing any illegal content.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.440]   We are just a very, very useful tool for finding illegal content.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.440]   But you can't really get into that business without understanding that you are exposed
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.880]   that when people come running, looking for someone to blame, looking for someone to sue,
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.640]   looking for someone to put in jail, your name is going to be on that list.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:31.680]   And when the whole system of torrent is designed to prevent the suppliers of this content from
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:36.080]   having being easy to find and being easily held accountable for, they don't do a who
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:40.160]   is on your website and then say, you know what, you're going to phone call from a lawyer.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.560]   I'm not necessarily saying it's good or bad, but to simply say that these people are being
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:49.080]   scapegoated, they're just innocent people who just innocently put up a search engine that
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:54.920]   had no, no, no, no, no understanding that perhaps people will be using this for illegal
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.920]   purposes.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.320]   And they're sure that 95% of all this traffic was perfectly legal stuff.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.320]   Public domain movies.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.680]   Yeah, it's pretty clear that they don't have that defense.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.480]   It's a perk in the straw.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.320]   They don't have that defense.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:13.240]   I'm not a lawyer actually sent some URLs to my, I have a stable of seeing eye geeks that
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:17.440]   I pass things on to when there's a topic I really don't understand law is one of them.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.920]   And they're basically telling me that the reasons why they got bagged was because they,
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.680]   the courts were able to simply say, you knew that people were using your service to get
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.880]   illegal content.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.920]   You knew this, you knew this, you knew this, and you did nothing to either keep an eye
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.880]   on this or to take any accountability for it.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.520]   And you know, just there's an old Steve Martin routine.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.800]   Plus here's how to pay or make a million dollars and not pay a dime in taxes.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.760]   Step one, make a million dollars.
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:49.240]   Step two, whether the IRS asks you why you didn't pay taxes, you say the following words.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.480]   I forgot.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.080]   I pay my taxes.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:58.480]   And that seemed to be the defense of the power being big.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:03.080]   I think that, well, I forgot that I had any liability whatsoever and I decided to pretend
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.080]   that nothing is going to happen.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.080]   What?
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.120]   I am not sure that one year in jail for anybody is appropriate.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.960]   It would be fine, absolutely, but I'm not sure that anybody should be in prison for a full
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.080]   year for running a site like Pirate Bay.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.080]   Well, they are appealing.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.080]   We'll see what happens.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.840]   I hope so.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:26.440]   Coming up, first, Mac, botnet, perhaps, perhaps not.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.440]   Perhaps not.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.440]   We'll talk about that.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:35.440]   And Tweety for the Mac is out joining a now-long list of Twitter clients for the Mac and Tush.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.440]   And we'll talk about both of those.
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.440]   Of course, your application picks gentlemen in just a little bit too.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:43.560]   But before I mention that, I should say the show is brought to you by the folks at Go
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.560]   to Meeting.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.960]   Scott, born, you know this.
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.120]   The average cost of the business trip has just gone up and up and up with a cost of
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.120]   gas.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:55.360]   The cost of time wasted, the cost of hotels and travel.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.360]   Go to Meeting.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:01.600]   According to American Express, the average business trip costs $1,000.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.600]   The average $1,000.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.280]   I wish I could get mine down to that.
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.280]   I know.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:08.600]   A little less first-class travel, Mr. Born.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.640]   I've got to put the yacht back in the harbor.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.080]   But go to Meeting $49 a month.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.440]   All the meetings you want.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.440]   So that would be less than $1,000.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:22.000]   It would be a lot less than a thought about what my calculations are correct, about $1.50.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.600]   Or no, $1.40 the amount.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.760]   My calculations were not correct.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.760]   I try.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.960]   I really do, but sometimes they're incorrect.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.800]   I'll tell you this.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.000]   Go to Meeting is a great way to hold a meeting.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   We do them all the time here.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.560]   In fact, people often try to hold meetings with other competitors.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.040]   I say, "No, sorry.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.880]   I'm using a Mac."
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.520]   A lot of these guys won't work on Macs.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:49.040]   Go to Meeting works on Macs and PCs, both to hold a meeting or to join a meeting.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.040]   Here's the beauty of it.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.640]   You don't have to worry about your router configuration installation.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.920]   Just click the mouse a couple of times.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.920]   Go to go to Meeting.com.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:59.400]   Actually, if you go to go to Meeting.com/MacBreak, you could try it free right now for a month.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.960]   Go to Meeting.com/MacBreak.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.520]   You'll have it installed before I'm done talking.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.360]   It's really good that you can hold the meeting on a Mac because a lot of them will are you
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:14.240]   to visit the meeting from a Mac, but most of them won't let you hold the meeting on a
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.240]   Mac.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.240]   I know.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.240]   This is huge, I think.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.240]   That's what I like about it.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.920]   In fact, I don't know of many, if any, cross-platform meeting programs like this.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.200]   Sales presentations, product demos, training sessions, there's nothing better.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.560]   If you go to go to Meeting.com/MacBreak, you could try it for 30 days.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.440]   Just a couple of clicks in the mouse.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.880]   You want to invite somebody to a meeting, you could send them an email, or you could just
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:41.120]   call them on the phone, voice over IP, and regular teleconferencing are free when you
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.200]   buy go to a meeting.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.360]   You could say, "Hey, I'm on the line.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.000]   We're having a meeting, but I want to show you something."
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Go to go to Meeting.com.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.080]   Here's the meeting idea all of a sudden they're seeing your desk.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:53.960]   Upgrade for sales, for product demos, training, collaboration.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.720]   Stop those expensive business trips, save money, save time, and have a lot of fun.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:58.720]   It's really good.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.320]   Now, that's not $49 a meeting.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.920]   That's $49 a month, right?
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.400]   Thank you, Scott Borne.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.400]   You're absolutely right.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.280]   You can have like 100 meetings for $49.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.400]   You can have as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:14.200]   You could be meeting, I could meet with you 24/7 for the next 30 days, Scott.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.200]   Thanks.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:21.720]   And then I'd like to show you the contents of my system folder.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.240]   You see here?
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.920]   No, you're going to love this.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.480]   Go to Meeting.com/MacBreak.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.720]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:32.360]   I'd like to try free today for 30 days.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.160]   So I am really a little skeptical.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:39.440]   The research was done by researchers at Symantec.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.760]   It almost is weird that this story came out now.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:48.120]   They referred to a three-month-old blog post in which a guy said here, "I found a PHP script
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:54.560]   on my system after I downloaded a trial of iWork."
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:58.640]   We found out, of course, since that that "trial of iWork" was a pirated copy that he
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.640]   downloaded.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:00.800]   I had to avoid bank work, yes.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:02.800]   Try.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.800]   That was the try.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.800]   How?
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.800]   I forgot.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.800]   Do you pay for it?
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.800]   I forgot.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.800]   I forgot.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.800]   I work.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:10.800]   It's not an open-source, copy-left project.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.960]   So already this blog post is a little suspect, you know.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:19.040]   And we did, and everybody knew, and we reported this, that if you were downloading from
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:24.440]   the pirate sites, copies of purported to be iWork 09, that there was a Trojan in it.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.320]   So these Symantec people wrote the report.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:30.960]   Then the guy on ZDNet, who happens to work for Kaspersky Antivirus, three months later
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:35.680]   writes his story saying, "Oh my gosh, the first botnet's on the Macintosh."
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:41.040]   But it's very weird because at nowhere do they say there was a botnet or here's proof
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.160]   of the botnet.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.160]   Was there a botnet?
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.000]   What do you think, Andy?
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.120]   Well, this story kind of died for me when I found out exactly how this so-called Trojan
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.920]   got propagated.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:58.720]   It's like, "Well, if I let you break into my house with a copy of Xcode and put code
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:03.640]   physically on my hard drive and restarts, then wow, that doesn't demonstrate that Macs
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.920]   are now vulnerable to Trojan courses."
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:10.720]   And if you simply say, "I'm going to take the most suspicious kind of software you can
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:15.080]   possibly have and just end up being surprised that there's anything nasty inside there
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:21.080]   by definition, if you have access to the actual executable file that's being distributed,
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.400]   you can put whatever you want inside there."
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.920]   And so yes, surprise shock bewilderment and let me collapse upon my Victorian fainting
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:31.560]   couch that I keep in my office for exactly this purpose, it was possible to get a Trojan
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.560]   horse this way.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:37.760]   I haven't seen actual evidence that this botnet was actually in operation.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.760]   I haven't seen any evidence that it was actually used for any purposes.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.800]   But it was a story about something that is completely plausible and completely believable,
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:51.800]   but also completely irrelevant in the discussion of which machine is a greater hazard to navigation
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.920]   on the internet.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.840]   Are we being apologists for Mac saying, "Oh no, there couldn't possibly be a bit."
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.360]   Oh, no, I think no one's saying that there couldn't possibly be one.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:06.280]   Time and time again, we're given evidence that every single machine has security holes,
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:11.280]   unpached problems, things that have been known in the community for many, many months, if
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:16.480]   not years, that have yet to be properly addressed by Apple, that if somebody were motivated
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:21.600]   to do a botnet for the Mac, they could certainly get that done and it wouldn't take them much
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.040]   more than a few weeks to get the first layer up and running.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.080]   So nobody fooled themselves into thinking.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.840]   You talk about having lines of disclaimers when...
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:36.360]   I think there's a reason why Apple stopped doing those sort of ads before they released
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.360]   the disclaimer ad.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:42.280]   Yeah, I mean, it's a little foolish, I think, for Apple to promote, to tout the fact that
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.440]   they're virus-free with this story floating around.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.880]   On the other hand, I have to say this story is suspect to me.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.760]   I mean, it came from two or many virus companies and I don't see any evidence that there is
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.760]   a botnet.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.920]   We're talking about the possibility that maybe according to...
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:56.920]   We know.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:57.920]   No.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:03.800]   There's one virus on the Mac versus the 20,000 that'll be created today from Windows, so
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.520]   that's get that in perspective.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:12.760]   Really, I mean, not to be cranky or cynical, but who in the world would be happier about
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:17.200]   Macs being susceptible to viruses than semantic?
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.200]   Right.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.200]   Discurions.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.200]   Okay.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.760]   Well, they sell in any virus for the Mac and it's got to be kind of embarrassing for them
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.760]   that it never gets updated.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:28.480]   Well, you know, this is one of these weird questions that I used to get in philosophy
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.680]   class in college.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:33.320]   It's like, do we really want to cure all disease?
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.680]   The answer is no, because if we did, our medical system would collapse and our economy would
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:37.680]   follow.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.080]   Do we really want to stop all crime?
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:43.400]   No, because if we did, our complete prison system would fall apart and all the businesses
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.320]   that support it would go away and that would collapse our economy.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.840]   So does semantic really want viruses to go away?
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.120]   No, I don't believe so.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:55.000]   But on the other hand, it's sort of like sometimes you worry that brink security system is giving
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.800]   you a statistic about crime in your area.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:02.360]   Sometimes they're giving you statistics because they actually do actual work in this area.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:07.440]   But I wouldn't immediately say that news that comes through semantic is suspect, but obviously
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.240]   it's a trusted verify.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.640]   Well, and I'm not saying that they're wrong either.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:18.840]   All I'm asking is, you know, who has more to gain than they if there is a influx of Mac
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.680]   viruses, I can't think of anybody.
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:25.400]   Well, furthermore, this isn't an exploit that's a whole takes advantage of a hole in the OS
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:26.400]   10 operating system.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:31.360]   This is a Trojan horse that you have to willingly install, in this case by using pirated software.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.280]   However, we know there are holes pwned to own showed us that.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:39.880]   So I don't think any Mac user would be foolish enough to say, Hey, I don't have to worry
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.400]   about this stuff.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.840]   It should always be in the back of your mind.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:48.320]   But I should think we should it would also behoove us to say there still is no evidence
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.320]   of of any issues going on with Mac and Tasha's.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.840]   You don't need an antivirus.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.840]   Sorry, semantic.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.720]   There's no point in downloading installing an antivirus.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:00.360]   Just don't download pirated software and keep listening.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:05.920]   And I'll tell you what, I'm not such a Mac fanboy, but that I won't be the first to say when
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.360]   there's a real problem, get the doing antivirus.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.520]   But yeah, and it's going to happen.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:16.080]   I have no doubt in my mind that at some point in time, the, you know, the Mac haters will
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:19.280]   create a virus that gets into the the Apple system.
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.280]   You think it'll be Mac haters, not people.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.280]   I do.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.080]   I think it'll be people motivated by money.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.080]   Oh, there you go.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.280]   Mac haters, Mac haters can't really propagate.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.200]   Aren't motivated enough to propagate.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.200]   It's too much work.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.440]   Bob Knitt that would actually be have traction and actually be successful.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.720]   I mean, again, the best defense that that we have.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.480]   What if they were Mac haters that wanted to make money in?
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.480]   Then maybe.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.480]   Okay.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.320]   So then they have a weather satellite orbiting the world.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.360]   They they threaten to vaporize Paris unless they handle for a trillion dollars in the
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.360]   pot.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:52.240]   And even then they'd make more money selling that story to Jerry Bruckheimer then to the
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.280]   IT tech public.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:41:02.920]   I have a feeling that there may never be a Mac virus problem merely because it is guys
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.360]   who are going after money.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.560]   They know how to write Windows viruses.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.000]   They work perfectly well.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Thank you.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.320]   They seem to be working better than ever.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:15.280]   If you take conficker as an example, there's no need to take the time and trouble to figure
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.360]   out how to hack a Mac.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.160]   And there's not much payoff in it.
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:22.880]   It's a little bit like building a tunnel underneath I 95 like, well, but what's wrong
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.880]   with I 95?
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.360]   Well, it well, it's not.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.360]   Did they do that?
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.360]   They call it the big dig air.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.360]   They're in.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.360]   Bring that up.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.360]   Thanks.
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.400]   Thanks for the 18 billion dollars, everybody.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.880]   I use I use the big big tunnels to get the MIT flea market.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:44.200]   There was air condition cool Italian frescoes on the in tiles and every single wall of
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.200]   the tunnels.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.840]   Next time next time your kid comes home thinking, gee, there are three of us in a
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.840]   class.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:53.480]   You have me and my cushy cozy air condition ride to the MIT flea market on Sunday to thank
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.480]   for that.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:58.920]   Now, let me ask you, is either of you guys going to pick Tweety as your application of
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:41:59.920]   the week?
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.320]   Okay, so we won't do the Tweety story.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.280]   We'll let you we'll do it when we when you make your pick.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.280]   Okay.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.880]   Let's see.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.880]   What else?
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:12.640]   Any other stories am I missing before we get to our picks of the week?
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.200]   I do want to talk about Tweety.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:20.040]   Oh, I didn't mention my massage 1.2, the new massage application that goes with I shoot,
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:27.440]   I fish, I hunt, I scratch, I fart, I beer, and now I get a massage after you bowl.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.760]   I bowl to my massage.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:34.200]   You can choose from speeds from slow and steady to super fast overdrive.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:38.360]   The phone could be set to shaken at just at a random pattern.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.360]   You have to have the vibrate, of course, enabled.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.360]   What are you?
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.360]   Are you falling asleep there?
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.200]   Is he hitting his head against the microphone?
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:49.320]   I'm just I'm just going to my happy place.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.120]   Because there's no vibrate in the eye touch.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:56.480]   The eye massage on the eye touches particularly gentle.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:01.480]   Soothing graphics can function with screen off built in help and support.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:04.920]   The power could be your best.
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:05.920]   And now.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:10.480]   Close to the crazy one in the three.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.320]   And now in version 1.2 Italian and French localization.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.600]   Would you like a hot towel?
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.600]   Was that miss you?
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:22.680]   To learn how to use it, you only have to master these twelve annuals.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.360]   This is an apple macanade.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.520]   To master it, all you need to learn is to.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.640]   He's actually repeating old Macintosh ads.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:35.680]   That's because I'm in my happy place with a half plate.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:40.240]   Which is why 1984 won't be like 1984.
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:44.240]   Don't bury them in their own incoherence.
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.240]   We shall prevail.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:50.000]   You know, you know, you know the words of big brother even.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   Wow.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.400]   That's that's his happy place.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.440]   You know what's depressing?
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.000]   A cute girl with a hammer now is like 45.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.680]   I bet she's still good though.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:02.680]   All right.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.680]   All right.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.840]   If she if she landed on page three, I'd skip right past.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:07.840]   Stop it.
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.000]   I'm funny that much.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.520]   Do you ever do that?
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.560]   You watch Hollywood movies and you see these great, gorgeous, good looking people and think
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.680]   he's 78 now.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.680]   She's dead longer.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.320]   What I think is, you know what?
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.800]   Someday they're going to be 78.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:24.800]   Brad Pitt.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.800]   I don't think much about Brad Pitt at all.
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:28.800]   I have to play 70.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:29.800]   All right.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:33.080]   This we're going to get to our picks of the week just a bit before we do that though.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:36.200]   It is our pick of the day with audible.com.
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.600]   I just got a message from Roz.
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:42.360]   You know, Roz is rowing across the Pacific one leg at a time.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.760]   She's she completed leg one.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.720]   San Francisco to Hawaii.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:53.840]   She's going to go from Hawaii to somewhere in the South Pacific in about three weeks.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:57.160]   And I asked her the difference between rowing across the Atlantic, which she's done and
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.160]   rowing across the Pacific.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.160]   She said audible.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:04.760]   She said it was awful going across the Atlantic.
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:08.160]   And then you get I gave her an iPod with I gave her actually my iPod with all my audible
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.320]   books on it.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:11.640]   And she said, this was easy.
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:15.920]   I just listened to but she and she listened to like, I mean, she went through Bleak House
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:21.400]   in two days that I mean, she because she was rowing like 15 hours a day and listening.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.200]   And she said, I she said, she sent me another saying, I can't do it again.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.200]   You got it.
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.700]   Send me your iPod.
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:29.440]   I said, all right, I have a few new books.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.440]   You probably haven't heard yet.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.960]   And I guess she went to audible UK and got some.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:37.280]   Let me tell you, if raw, if Roz is commute across the Pacific can be made easier.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:42.400]   Commute across town can be made easier with audible.com audio books, the best audio books
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:46.680]   in the world, 50,000 titles to choose from.
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:50.800]   And I mean, just so many great books were it was it you that recommended shadow country
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:55.400]   by Peter Matthias and Andy and not co because I just I just started that or maybe it was
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.400]   Paul Thorett.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.400]   I can't remember.
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.160]   Might have been Paul doesn't ring a bell doesn't ring a bell yet.
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.240]   It's a history of Florida at the turn of the century.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.040]   It's fantastic to me.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.280]   I could care less about Florida.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.920]   I hold all the state of Florida in complete contempt.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:12.200]   They know the reasons why email Andy at twit.tv ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.800]   We know that's not true.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.920]   You know, I'm going Andy, do you have a recommendation?
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.000]   Because if you don't, I have to make a recommendation.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.480]   I have a recommendation, but it can be delayed till next week.
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:23.760]   If you're eager, no, you know, I'm not that eager because I have remember many other shows
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.480]   that I can make recommendations on.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:26.480]   Okay.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.480]   So I'll save mine.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:30.320]   I just want to give you an ad if you want it because I have one that I just as a knockout
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.760]   recommendation, but I'll save it for another show.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.760]   Okay.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:39.080]   My recommendation is actually a book that I'm reading on the iPhone by Kindle.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.320]   It's called the soloist.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:46.160]   You know that there's a movie coming out in a couple of weeks about the story.
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:53.200]   It's about this LA Times journalist who encounters and writes a story about a homeless guy living
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:59.200]   on the streets who plays a two stringed violin far, far beyond any ability that you would
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:03.040]   expect a homeless person to be able to play a level of technical proficiency and beauty
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.800]   that just stopped him dead in the street and thought this mother must be a story here.
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:12.400]   And indeed there was because the man was a very, very gifted musician, got a scholarship
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:20.160]   to the Juilliard Academy, but was side railed by a descent into schizophrenia.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:25.680]   He has he has an organic mental disorder that has basically made his life completely unmanageable
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:30.720]   and completely difficult to do and also side railed him from his career in music and landed
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:33.680]   him living on the streets in LA.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:38.240]   I bought this book because I kind of wanted to see the movie, but I did not like I heard
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.240]   about the story before.
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:45.160]   I read like these original series of LA Times articles and there really is a fantastic story.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:50.080]   I was kind of concerned about the movie because it seemed to have the same sort of vibe that
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:54.720]   you often see in terms when you when you see mental illness discussed by a really bad
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:58.520]   cheap movie, especially one like the airs on the Hallmark channel.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:02.400]   So you sort of brace yourself for the overarching theme.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:08.000]   You know, maybe these so called sane one has can learn a little something about them.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   So called great.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.760]   I hate that when they do that.
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:11.760]   Exactly.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:15.200]   Because it minimizes the courage of that kind of a life.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:19.080]   It is incredibly difficult to be managing an organic disease like schizophrenia.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:23.120]   It is also incredibly difficult to care about somebody who is struggling with a disease
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.120]   like that.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:27.760]   And it's even harder to find a solution if you were just a third a third party who sort
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:31.920]   of gets into that orbit like this L.A. Times columnist.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:37.040]   The book I'm only halfway through it so far, but it is really rich and really, really rewarding
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.600]   because it does not pull any punches.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:40.320]   It does not make any bones.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:45.880]   It is essentially a very compelling document explaining the problems of helping people
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:51.360]   who have these serious diseases that you know, one of the problems with the with this man
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:56.600]   was that he was treated he was diagnosed first in 1970, I believe, and they had very, very
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.200]   limited things that they could do for schizophrenia back then.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:04.880]   Lecture shock therapy really, really severe drugs like Thor's Thorazine that just puts
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.600]   the people in such fog.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.680]   We've all seen one flow over the cougars nest.
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:09.680]   We know how awful.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:14.200]   So basically it would rob him of everything that he found that he that he enjoyed about
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:20.160]   life, but also he has certain difficulties and process and maintaining reality around
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:21.160]   his world.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:24.640]   And he just did not want to be under control by anybody.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:27.080]   He did not want to be given drugs by anybody.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:31.200]   And part of the problem is how do you help a guy who really is resistant to accepting
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.120]   even something as simple as here is a building.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.480]   If you go here, they will give you food.
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:40.800]   If you want to sleep someplace safe tonight, they will give you a bed to sleep in and he
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:46.120]   does not want that deal because according to his reality, accepting that offer is disaster.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.320]   So it's an ongoing, it's an ongoing process.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:54.040]   Again, I'm only halfway through it, but it's now it's now in that category of books where
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:57.120]   I'm working, I'm having a full work day and I'm like, okay, I just finished a column
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.720]   and I can't really think about what to write next.
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:03.080]   I know I'll spend the next eight minutes reading reading 10 more pages of this book before
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.080]   I have to go back to work.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:08.320]   So I the audio book is a bridge, but not doesn't look like it's heavily abridged.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.720]   Actually, it says on a bridge here.
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:10.720]   Oh, I'm abridged.
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:14.360]   But it's a short book and I can see why you would think it was abridged because it's
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.720]   it's only six hours, 45 minutes.
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:17.720]   Right.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.400]   But I cannot wait to do this.
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.400]   It's good stuff.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.760]   Again, it has the it has the courage to be completely honest and unflinching about a
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:24.940]   very, very difficult situation.
[00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:29.800]   I really think that one of the reasons why it's so difficult to get proper mental health
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:34.720]   care in this country is because so many even even the quote popular movies and popular
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.360]   TV shows that try to address it.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:39.320]   Again, they trivialize it as though, well, he's happy like this.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:43.360]   He's living the life that he wants to live and he has his own little special brand of
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:44.720]   some well known he does.
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:49.040]   And he has very, very serious problems and we have to find a way to help this guy and
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.400]   all everyone else like him.
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.400]   Really cool.
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.400]   Whoops, really cool.
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.200]   I can't wait to hear this.
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:56.200]   Let me play a little bit.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.960]   This is a soloist, the soloist.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:03.360]   I'm sorry, a lost dream, an unlikely friendship and the redemptive power of music.
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.960]   I hope the movie is as good as what you just described.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:06.960]   That sounds really awesome.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.960]   And into entryways, the man plays on a lone fiddler.
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:17.400]   He throws his head back, closes his eyes, drifts, a portrait of tortured bliss.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.800]   When he pauses, I move in.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:22.720]   "Hello," I say, he jumps back, startled just as before.
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:25.200]   "Do you remember me?" I ask.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.760]   "I remember you voice.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:31.320]   He's still suspicious of me, suspicious of everything around him.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:32.320]   It seems."
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:36.880]   He says he was trying to remember a Tchaikovsky piece he once knew quite well, but now it
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.600]   is as elusive as the meaning of a dream.
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:43.720]   It's obvious that he's troubled in some way, like so many others who wander the streets
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:48.040]   as if they inhabit a different planet than the rest of us, wrapped in many layered outfits
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.040]   to keep from coming.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.840]   That sounds, I can't wait.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:51.840]   I'm going to download this.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.160]   That sounds fantastic.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:58.080]   I should mention that sometimes the excerpts on the Audible Cider of a little lower quality,
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:02.080]   this is one of the books that's available in the new enhanced format, which is CD quality
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.080]   release.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:07.640]   I've redownloaded all my books now in enhanced format because they sound so great.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:12.480]   This is available in enhanced format, so it won't sound like that if you go to audible.com
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:13.480]   right now.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.400]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:19.200]   Get your first book free and I think you're going to love it.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:22.360]   It's a great way to, if you listen to podcasts, you're going to love audiobooks.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.760]   Audio from Audible.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:24.760]   It's the best.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:28.680]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/macbreak.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:32.680]   And the soloist is our pick of the week, but you'll find there's many, many 50,000 wonderful
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:33.680]   books there.
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.640]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.920]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:43.480]   And now it's time my friends, Mr. Scott Borne, Mr. Andy Inatko and Mr. Leo LaPorte.
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:44.480]   He's my friend too.
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:45.480]   Mark.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:49.760]   Ah, our pick of the week Scott Borne, what do you got?
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.760]   Tweety.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.280]   Oh, what a surprise.
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:53.560]   I wasn't ready for that.
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:55.480]   So you like Tweety.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:53:00.520]   I didn't like it for the first two hours because it sent your password in the clear without
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:01.520]   using HTTPS.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.520]   Oh, that's not good.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:07.520]   But after tweeting about that, and several other people tweeting about that, the developer
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:11.040]   who seems to be a real stand up individual said, oops, got that fixed.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.040]   What else?
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.040]   He is great.
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.120]   Bit's A-T-E-B-I-T-S.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Would you know his name though?
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:17.840]   Because he, boy, he's like.
[00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:24.600]   But I can say that when you don't react defensively or negatively to legitimate negative input
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:29.040]   about your product, you immediately raise the bar for everybody else.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.040]   Now, it's a woman.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.600]   Ben Gold saying she's a woman.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:32.600]   Okay.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:33.600]   Well, I didn't know that.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:34.600]   Wow.
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:37.040]   That the woman stood up and did the right thing.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:39.040]   And so that was fixed.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.040]   She's so good.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.040]   Sorry.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.040]   Keep going.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:46.040]   I'm not going to talk anymore.
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:47.040]   You talk.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.800]   It's all yours.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:55.720]   The layout is not as screen over compensating as tweet deck.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:58.080]   I mean, you don't have to give up your whole screen.
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:53:59.080]   I like that.
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:02.120]   The simple little icons in the left are very Mac-like.
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.800]   It's pretty obvious to see what you're supposed to do.
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:10.200]   You can double click a tweet and see its conversation timeline.
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:13.960]   Although that doesn't help you if the conversation comes out of left field like it does to me
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:14.960]   sometimes.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.240]   I'm sure you see that too, Leo.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:19.920]   People will tweet something at us from a show we did five days ago without any reference
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:20.920]   and we're supposed to.
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:21.920]   I love it.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.720]   You can double click it though and see the conversation.
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:27.760]   But if it is a conversation that actually started on Twitter, double clicking, it leads
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:33.040]   you to much more information, which makes it a lot easier to follow the conversational
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:34.360]   thread.
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:37.640]   I just think it's a much nicer interface.
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:42.360]   It's very responsive and the one thing that I really have found that I like about it is
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:48.480]   that it gives you the option of choosing to have the tweets come in and scroll in real
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:55.160]   time past you or to freeze wherever you last saw it so that any new tweets that come in,
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:55:00.440]   you will be able to scroll up to them instead of having to scroll down to find them.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:01.960]   That's a nice little feature.
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:08.040]   Right now I'm parked at the one of the people I follow is Chris Brogan.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.120]   He wrote as I'm writing my next blog post, I'm thrilled by how many different brands
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:13.480]   social media folks I know blah, blah, blah.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:17.600]   So if I come back a half hour from now, it'll still be sitting there, but there'll be a
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:22.440]   little indicator to tell me there are new posts in my timeline and I can just scroll
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:25.800]   up through them to get current, which I really like.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:29.040]   By the way, the author's name is Lauren Richter.
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:30.040]   Thank you, Loy.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.560]   I'm going to say it's a guy.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:33.560]   He lives in here.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:39.080]   She lives in Berkeley, so I'm going to find out the individual who created this.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.160]   And by the way, I've used the iPhone tweet.
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:43.440]   Is my default client and I agree with you.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.920]   This is the nicest desktop.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:52.680]   Now there have been some who have complained because, Oh my gosh, there's a fee for this.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.120]   Well, well, not really.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:59.640]   You can use it for exactly, but you have to be willing to suffer.
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:00.640]   Advertisements.
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.600]   Very mild ads.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:03.600]   Very mild.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:04.600]   Every once in a while.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:09.840]   And so it's worth the 1495 or whatever they're asking in my opinion.
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:13.520]   I think it'll only get better and it's really good right now.
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:16.640]   And it's really made my personal Twitter experience better.
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:21.080]   I liked tweet deck and I've been using it, but I like this better.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:24.480]   Hence, it's the official Scott born pick of the week.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.960]   Sweetie.
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.840]   I think a very good choice.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:33.240]   I'm trying something as a you could use as an alternative called NAMBU.
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.000]   I've heard good things about that as well.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.640]   There are a number of, you know, Twitterific for a long time just dominated this space.
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:43.440]   And I of course use twirl, which there are a number of great air applications.
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:46.120]   People love tweet deck and twirl.
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:48.560]   But there's something about a cocoa, a native cocoa application.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:51.760]   This makes it, I think, a little bit more mackish.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:55.320]   And NAMBU is going to support friend feed and you know I'm a big friend feed bigot.
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:59.200]   So I'm looking forward to seeing that develop as well.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:04.400]   There's one thing tweet doesn't do that kind of I missed a little bit.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.400]   What was it?
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:08.400]   Does it do everything you want to do there?
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:09.920]   Seems like there was one thing missing.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:13.800]   Oh, well for one thing it does and I'm sure Lauren will fix this.
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:19.040]   Instead of saying retweet, it doesn't use the standard RT retweet syntax.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:24.360]   When you retweet it, it's got a different syntax at the end.
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:25.360]   I can't remember what it is.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:27.160]   It's a little weird.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:30.520]   But I'm looking forward to it does support multiple accounts, which is great.
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:33.880]   I'm looking forward to trying it more and I will pay for it.
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:38.720]   I think it's nice to have some good choices on the desktop there.
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:41.080]   My pick, thank you Scott.
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:42.480]   Thank you.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:46.840]   My pick is hardware, but it's also an app, an iPhone app.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.480]   I just got it yesterday and it is very cool.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.320]   Have you heard of Pogo plug?
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:53.320]   I have not.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:58.360]   Yeah, this is kind of, I think this should be better known, especially among Mac fans.
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.520]   The packaging is very Mac-ish.
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:03.880]   It looks like a little iPhone.
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.720]   It's a device you plug into the wall.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:10.560]   It has an ethernet port and a USB ports, 99 bucks.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:12.240]   You connect it up to any USB device.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:13.240]   It could be a thumb drive.
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:14.960]   I hooked it up to a Drobo.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:18.920]   I hooked it up to a terabyte loss C drive.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:24.080]   Then you log in to my Pogo plug, my.pogoplug.com.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:29.600]   And once you've logged in, you've got a view of this drive wherever you are on the net.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:31.080]   Mine is at home.
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.440]   I can download files from it.
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:35.960]   I can put new files on it.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:40.760]   I can give it its address to other people and share it.
[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:43.360]   It's basically, it's hard to describe.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:48.480]   It's like an easier form of FTP because you're going through the Pogo plug servers.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:52.360]   There is 128-bit SSL security.
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:56.680]   But you also have the ability to share files with other people using passwords.
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:59.440]   You can even, now I've got some audio files on here.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.440]   I can even listen to the audio files.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:05.520]   But here's what makes it very particularly Mac-ish.
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:09.320]   It also has support for the iPhone.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:12.400]   It has an iPhone application.
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:21.280]   So I can also use this on my iPhone and even play audio files from it off the iPhone from
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.240]   my hard drive at home.
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:25.360]   I can put file, I could store files on it.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:28.000]   I can remove files from it.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.720]   It's kind of an amazing thing.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:33.200]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.400]   I hear you're breathing.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:40.640]   I was just going to say, so it'll be able to find your Pogo drive wherever you are in
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:41.640]   the world.
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:44.840]   I'm going to say there's a reset of your cable modem after you've set it up.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:45.840]   That's an interesting question.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:49.200]   I haven't tried throwing bad things at it.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.200]   But yeah, I think so.
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:53.480]   It looks like there's basically a little, this plug is small.
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:57.640]   Looks like there's a little server in there, probably an FTP server of some kind.
[00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:02.040]   That you have two little lights that go green when it's connected to the drive properly
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.080]   and when it's connected to the internet properly.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:08.320]   I'm going to take it to the office and plug it in and just see what happens.
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.080]   I didn't have to do any configuration.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.440]   I didn't have to say what my IP address was.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:16.880]   I didn't have to say, because it's just plugged right into the ethernet.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:21.600]   I presume you connect to a router so that it's just set to do DHCP.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:26.560]   It'll be lovely if it worked like a sling box or a Roku box where you could simply carry
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:30.000]   it with you from home to a hotel room.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.320]   And just by which of the fact you haven't plugged into a wallet at your hotel and that
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:37.160]   you paid for internet access to your hotel room, the files you dropped on there that
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:40.360]   morning after you woke up are going to be available to you no matter where you are on
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:43.240]   your phone at a conference or a radio speaker.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:47.080]   Although, I mean, in a way, it can do that because I leave this at home.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.160]   I'm at the hotel room.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.360]   I just log into it, copy whatever files I want from the hotel room.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.440]   They're still available to me on the iPhone at the conference anywhere I go.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:58.760]   So it's really kind of the idea is that it doesn't matter where that hard drive is situated.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:03.320]   You can go anywhere and always access it through a worldwide web interface.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.760]   There's also a desktop application for the Mac as well as for Windows that makes it
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.080]   mount as a drive.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:14.400]   So my Pogo plug shows up as a drive, just as other drives do.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.400]   So that makes it very easy.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.080]   I mean, you don't have to launch a web browser.
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:19.080]   It's right there.
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:24.920]   And if people share files with my Pogo plug, I can see them just as if I'm there.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:29.880]   So it actually is, this is really an interesting solution.
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:35.440]   You know, plenty of geeks will have set up something similar using FTP or even if you're
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:39.760]   really sophisticated using WebDAV and creating a WebDAV server.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.800]   But this does it so transparently.
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:42.800]   It comes with a number.
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.600]   You go to the my.pogo plug.com.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.520]   You enter the number to register the my Pogo plug.
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.560]   And then from now on, you can see it anywhere with your login.
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.800]   You just log in using your name and your email and your password.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.800]   I'll share something with you and see it.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.240]   If you put it on a fast enough connection, it's pretty slick.
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:07.440]   I was, for instance, I had some file sign theater stuff that I had bought from Amazon
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:08.720]   on my Mac at home.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.120]   I wanted to put it on my iPod.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.920]   My iPod 6 here at work.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:15.960]   So I put it on the Pogo plug at home, came into work, downloaded it, synced it up.
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:16.960]   It was great.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.280]   But then I found out, wait a minute, I can also play this from my iPhone directly.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.600]   So that's kind of an unusual thing.
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:28.640]   If there's if it's mp3 audio, the KAC two, you can actually play the audio from the Pogo
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.640]   plug.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:30.960]   It buffers and then starts playing.
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:31.960]   Now one marvelous.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:32.960]   Isn't that weird?
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.720]   Now one thing I did notice is that the if the iPhone goes to sleep, the audio stops.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.600]   So they need to add something to.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.600]   I don't know.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:42.160]   Maybe you maybe Apple doesn't let you do this, but the application is free on the iPhone.
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.160]   iTunes app store.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.720]   It's called Pogo plug.
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.760]   Of course, you need a Pogo plug.
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.320]   The hardware is $99.
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.200]   It doesn't come with any storage.
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:55.280]   It's just a plug that plugs into the wall and then you attach your ethernet and your
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:59.800]   USB to it's not firewire, but it would work with anything that supports USB.
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.960]   And that's plenty fast considering that most of your transfers are going to be occurring
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:03.960]   over a network.
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:04.960]   Yes.
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:08.960]   Well, of course, I'm going to be reviewing this in the next few weeks.
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:11.360]   I had to keep it under my hat, so to speak.
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.760]   I was completely unaware of it.
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:14.760]   I had never.
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:15.760]   I had never.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:16.760]   You know what?
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.760]   I was out of the bag.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:18.760]   So to speak.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:19.760]   Yes.
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:20.760]   This came out of nowhere.
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:21.760]   I'd never heard of this.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.280]   I think I saw it on friend feed.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.280]   It's like, what is this?
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.280]   I never heard of it.
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:29.120]   I am on Pogo plug.com right now looking for a press contact.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:33.040]   I think Andy, you should absolutely review this.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:35.560]   This is a very, very interesting product.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:36.560]   It sounds great.
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:40.400]   It sounds like it sounds like exactly the sort of solution that we want to have.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:44.040]   Again, something where you just simply tell people, no, you don't have to run software.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.800]   No, you don't have to set up a DHCP or anything like that.
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:47.800]   Plug this into that.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:48.800]   Yes.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:49.800]   Plug it into that in.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:50.800]   You're good.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:52.440]   Let me see if I can share.
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:56.080]   Let's see if I can edit it.
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.520]   I can change file names.
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.160]   I can examine it.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.840]   I can play it back.
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:04.520]   This is kind of cool.
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:11.160]   So now I'm listening from my hard drive at home to some Fire Sign Theater over the network.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:17.400]   Wow, that worked.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:22.240]   If you play in video, playback, that was very quick actually.
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:25.240]   It's always interesting to me that when you have a pick of the week and you seem surprised
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:31.760]   that it works, it may reduce a little bit of the audience's willingness to try your pick.
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:34.160]   Well, I only had it for a day.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.200]   But no, I'm just discovering more and more features.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:40.160]   Now, I haven't played much with the sharing feature, but I think that that sounds really
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.160]   interesting.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:45.600]   I should be able to share this with you, Andy, and I'm going to figure out how to do that
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.040]   and send you an email and see.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:50.560]   And then you should be able to share files with me too.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:54.160]   I'm more to learn about it, but I have to say it worked too easily, right out of the
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.400]   box, and I've already used it, and it's been great.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.280]   Too easily or suspiciously easy.
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.200]   Suspiciously easy.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:09.160]   Now if you've used, you probably use online storage like .mac or Mobile Me, but you put
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.360]   as big a drive as you want on there.
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:14.400]   You can put your Drobo Pro on there, Scott, and have all this storage available.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.640]   That would be cool.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:16.640]   Yeah.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:17.640]   I mean, it's very interesting.
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:23.240]   Anyway, that's my $99 device controlling multi-million dollar media empire on a Drobo.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:24.240]   Precisely.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.840]   Just thanks this time next year.
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:30.440]   You too could be sentenced to one year in prison on a million dollar line.
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:34.840]   I'm going to call it Leo the Pirate Bay.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.440]   Oh, my God.
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:37.440]   Leo Bay.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:40.440]   It's $99.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.720]   It works perfectly well as far as I can tell.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.640]   I'm very, very impressed.
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:48.960]   It's from cloud engines, but go to pogoplug.com.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.200]   And there's an API even.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:53.440]   So they clearly want people to do more stuff with this.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:58.800]   There's a complete support for a soap, XML, JSON.
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.400]   I mean, it's pretty interesting.
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.040]   It's a very clever idea.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.040]   All right.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:10.160]   Now it's your turn, Mr. Andy Nautko, to blow me away with your pick of the week.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:15.240]   Well, now that I'm going to stop sending a middle-riving email.
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:16.240]   Oh, to pogoplug.
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.240]   OK.
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:21.720]   Too much to my established press contact telling them that we've mentioned it on the show
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:26.440]   after Josh, but we wanted to be tall as little son Joshua Jr. and Sally.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.880]   The good news because I've known them for quite so long.
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.480]   I mean, they went out on a limb.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.800]   When I said, boys, here's what you should make.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.280]   There's a gap in the market that only you've been.
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.880]   I'm just glad that they ran with it.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.400]   I mean, they ran with it.
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:42.840]   Who busy educating America in the world to develop these things myself?
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.320]   You know, I'm going to China.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.720]   We're going to China, too.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.280]   We're going to China, Leo.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:52.840]   So did you get the note from Neil that said you might not want to say you're a journalist?
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.280]   Yeah, a little bit too late, but that's OK.
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.480]   Oh, this will be interesting.
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.080]   OK, well, this will be a good A.B.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.080]   comparison.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.720]   I feel as though I'm in a win-win situation here that either they give me a visa and I
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.560]   get to go to China or I add a new line to my CV.
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:10.560]   He was blocked.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:18.200]   He was the client as being a person of dangerous ideas who would tear down the red banner revolution
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:24.640]   and stall his sweeping river raging of democracy that would undermine the status quo.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:29.200]   It's an interesting form because they say, do you have mental diseases, venereal diseases,
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.160]   leprosy, or are you a journalist?
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:36.160]   And I thought that kind of combining those four was an unusual choice.
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:39.600]   Three out of three out of five, you're in three out of five, you're out.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:42.480]   So I said, I'm an educator.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.480]   That's not a lie.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.240]   I'm an educator.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.240]   You are the booth.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:50.080]   Make a mental note when you're going to a country where you have to lie about your profession,
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.640]   it could lead to some kind of problem later.
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:55.280]   OK, well, Scott, you'll bail us out, right?
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:59.120]   Yeah, except for the fact that I won't be able to find you.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:04.280]   I'll be stuck trying to figure out which of the poison sauces I like better in the Hoonan
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.560]   Province and I won't quite get to you.
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:10.560]   Great.
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.680]   I'm sitting there going, you know, this, this is really good.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:17.120]   And, you know, I'm supposed to be finding Rio and Andy, but, you know, this is so good.
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.160]   I'm going to have to stick around for a day.
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.080]   Oh, no, I was counting on you.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:22.960]   All right, Andy, go ahead.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:23.960]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:28.360]   Did we give you enough time to finish that email?
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:33.360]   I'm sure they're contacting me because, again, they usually come in about three 30 of the afternoon.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:35.400]   Let's tell me how the, you know,
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:36.240]   hey, I bought this.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:40.840]   I paid 99 bucks, but, you know, the Chicago Sun Times is a major metropolitan newspaper
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:43.760]   and surely would be very interested in covering this.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.160]   I'll do a paper, yes.
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.360]   OK, but I'm sorry.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:53.160]   The, my pick of the week is a really cool little utility called DMG Master, which is
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:59.080]   not the name of a hip hop recording artist, but a great utility from Attention Software.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:06.040]   I can get it at pomola.com P O Amazon, Mary, oh, Elas and L a dot com.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.240]   You couldn't think of anything that goes with Elle.
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.400]   The end of my friend, I know what you thought of and you can't use that.
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:18.280]   So, I think at the moment, the most disgusting work I think of was Leo LaPorte.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.400]   And I just put him.
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:20.560]   Oh, very much.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:23.240]   My initials, ladies and gentlemen, Elle.
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:27.160]   The hated revolutionary trying to sneak his way into China.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:35.960]   Anyway, as the name sort of implies, it's a very simple one click utility for creating
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:39.160]   disk images.
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:43.520]   The disk utility that you get free with the app with with the Mac OS does a great job
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:48.360]   of creating disk images, meaning it's a sort of like a virtual a virtual hard drive, a
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:49.360]   virtual volume.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.480]   It's like a file that you can then put anywhere that when you open it up, it mounts to the
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:56.240]   finder as though it were an attached piece of storage.
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:00.640]   And the cool thing about working with disk images is that it allows you to have sort
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:04.960]   of partition of a storage device into different areas of usefulness.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:10.440]   For instance, when I'm I always have a disk image of photos that is exactly the size of
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.960]   a DVD burn.
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:15.200]   So that I know that so that I know that I have a I have a two terabyte hard drive, but
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.120]   I know that when this disk image fills it fills up, I have smart.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.200]   I now have one DVD's worth of photos.
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:24.400]   I simply I think you simply drag that disk image onto a burn icon and disk in disk utility
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:25.800]   and it burns into a DVD.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:26.800]   Great.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:31.040]   It also lets you do things like we all have like a little pocket hard drives and little
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:36.680]   keychain flash drives that allows to keep really cool things in a key at hand at all
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:37.680]   times.
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:41.680]   The problem is though that if you were to lose it or it falls out of your pocket now,
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:45.680]   everybody has your passwords, your phone numbers, your personal photos, things that
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:48.400]   you didn't you would rather not fall into other people's hands.
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:53.960]   The solution here is to when I when I have a carry around device like that, I have it's
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:57.680]   everything is there is normal can be used as normal, but I also have a disk image that
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:02.120]   is secured and encrypted via password so that I can simply drag files onto it and off of
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.120]   it.
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.800]   I can let it lend it to a friend as a matter of fact, and he can put files onto it and
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:06.960]   return it to me.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:11.720]   But that disk image cannot be monable and cannot be accessed without that password and
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:13.800]   it's encrypted super super duper tight.
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:16.680]   The only problem is that sometimes they're a little bit complicated to create and then
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.760]   not complicated is just that there are lots and lots of steps.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:25.600]   Also I use I use cloud storage for as one one of my layers of backup and I have a system
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:31.440]   that that every now that I take again important files like my taxes from that I prepared last
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:35.040]   week the week before those are like backed up and encrypted.
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:39.720]   I don't want to simply put even though my cloud storage on dot Mac and elsewhere is very
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:40.720]   nicely protected.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.440]   I don't want to have those files out in the open.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:45.840]   So I basically take all these little files all these things off my desktop, put them into
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:49.080]   a disk image, encrypt them and then upload them.
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:52.320]   I know that even if someone does get access to that file it's very, very unlikely you'll
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.320]   be able to crack it.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:58.160]   But every time I do this and I try to do this once a week it is like a multi step process.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:03.080]   What DMG Master does it allows you to basically do all the possible settings of creating a
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:06.320]   disk image in one window with one click.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.320]   That's useful enough.
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.960]   You don't have to go through multiple windows and multiple steps.
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:13.560]   The other cool thing is that it will save your setting so that if you want to cook another
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:19.480]   version of this in next week, meaning same file, same folder, same encryption, same setting,
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:21.600]   now you can simply save those settings as a document.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.000]   And then when you double click that document it will simply build you a disk image to the
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.520]   made to order like that.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:31.080]   So it not only does it make things easier if you're doing a disk image as a one off,
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.960]   it also makes it so easy to do the same operation time and time again that you'll want to do
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.200]   it more more frequently.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:42.040]   This is an especially big deal when you have situations like if you're a software developer
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:45.600]   and you need to send a package that contains not only the workable application but also
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.000]   a set of binaries, also a set of press files, like if you're setting bug reports, there
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.600]   are all kinds of different scattered files that you need to send out to make sure that
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:56.920]   everybody, people have all the bugs and all the data and all the telemetry from that
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.360]   crashed application.
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:03.040]   Once again, what I can do with this utility is simply define what a crashed version of
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:07.960]   this new alpha software, what needs to be sent, sent on, and then anytime I get a crash
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:11.880]   I simply double click the stock, it will build me a disk image that contains all those files
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:15.000]   and all those directories and then I'm good to go.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   Very cool.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   It's not very expensive.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.200]   I think it's $15.
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.200]   Is it?
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.200]   Yes, $15.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:24.040]   So you're saying that instead of, because I just use disk utility to create these things,
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:28.240]   this is easier and with the encryption and so forth, it works better.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.240]   Exactly.
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:34.160]   It doesn't build any disk images that disk utility can't build.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.920]   The difference is that, whereas it might take you, let's say, four or five mouse clicks
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:40.080]   and maybe five minutes to get something to write.
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:43.960]   This one, not only can you get every single feature and every single attribute in one
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:50.200]   window, but also once again, if this is something that you keep making disk images of the same
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:53.960]   directories with the same characteristics over and over again, all you have to do is create
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:55.880]   those settings just once.
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:59.920]   Not only that, but you can also, when you set up this template, you can also give it
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:05.800]   like file name variables so that if you like to have snapshots of a certain folder or a
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:11.440]   certain project every single day, if you simply set an automator action to please open up
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:15.760]   this doc cloud, not only will create that same disk image, but will also date stamp it
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:16.760]   with the current date.
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:17.760]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.040]   So you'll have distinct files.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.200]   So this would be a useful thing with automator.
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:24.000]   Now, I don't see, I'm looking at the control panel.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.440]   Is there anywhere you could set the size of the image on this?
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.040]   This is something that I just started.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.040]   That's the one thing I haven't used it for.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:38.320]   I love your idea of having a disk image that 650 megs or 4.7 gigs that's very, I'm going
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.480]   to use that because that's a great idea.
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:45.280]   I always have to figure out, well, how many photos can I fit on this DVD and I have to
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.560]   take a few app, put a few in, and this is, that's a great idea.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.560]   Yeah.
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.760]   That's not something that I see, but I've been using it for the past week for lots of
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:56.800]   those routine disk image creation things and it's been working great for me.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:57.800]   Very cool.
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.720]   So, here's DMG Master from Tension Software.
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:07.360]   It's at P-O-M-O-L-A as in lawport.com.
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:11.800]   What are you laughing at?
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.800]   What are you laughing at?
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:19.640]   We're going to change that Lima to the port.
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:20.640]   Yeah.
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:24.200]   Now, that would be a form of immortality, wouldn't it?
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:30.600]   It's like Oscar Mission actual, we need a fire mission at lawport, lawport 32 on the
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:33.760]   grid, please.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.000]   Scott Borne, you're the greatest.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.680]   He is at scottborne.com.
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:37.880]   He's doing so much stuff.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:39.640]   You've got the trip photo blog.
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:42.040]   You've got this great blog where you people, you're...
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.840]   We've changed trip photo to photofocus.com.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:49.000]   Ah, P-H-O-G-O-F-O-C-U-S.com.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.560]   And there's a new show to go with it called Photo Focus with me and Rick Salmon launching
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:54.440]   on the 5th of May.
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.200]   Oh, is there a little schism in the Twip photo universe?
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.040]   Why does everybody go there?
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.520]   If you listened to Twip, you would know the answer is no.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.480]   I was on Twip to explain it.
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:04.480]   We're just...
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:05.480]   I've been on...
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.480]   So how is everyone...
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.080]   Everyone says you're not on Twip anymore.
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:11.120]   And I've been on Twip like 32 times since they said I'm not on Twip anymore.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.120]   So how is the new show going to differ from Twip?
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.120]   All it is is Q&A.
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:15.120]   Q&A.
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.120]   Ah, see there?
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:17.120]   Okay, we need that.
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.640]   There's just nothing but Q&A.
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.520]   We don't do any round table, no news, no product reviews unless it comes with the phone.
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.280]   Some of the question we just answered.
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.760]   Well, actually that's good because we need that.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:30.120]   And you've been doing a really good job even on Twitter helping teaching people about photography.
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:33.280]   Yes, I started to send regular tweets about photography as well.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.400]   And of course I get arguments, but whatever.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:38.200]   No, because it's art, not a science.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:39.200]   Exactly.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:40.200]   But it's...
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:42.200]   You know, the point is Rick has been at this longer than me even.
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:46.920]   He's a little bit older than me and we both just felt like somebody needed to do Q&A.
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:51.400]   And I will say that it's inspired by Call for Help.
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.280]   Because you know, that's when you were...
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:57.160]   Your original Call for Help show just really always floored me how much information you
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:00.840]   were able to give people and how happy they were to actually get their questions answered.
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:02.640]   So that's what we're doing.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:06.320]   We don't hardly do anything but just get right into each show.
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.840]   Like here's a question.
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.160]   And the shows are about 40 minutes.
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:13.520]   We're going to be three times a month and it launches on the fifth.

[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.640]   No, I keep pressing the wrong button.
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.640]   I got too many buttons now.

[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:26.440]   So quick, send him to...
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:27.440]   How's that?

[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:31.440]   And listeners, no, I'm not going to be giving one away.
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.800]   I was going to have one and plugged in.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.640]   Another one, like carry around with me so I could show to other people.
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:39.160]   And say, I've got so many, I could just carry one around with you.
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:40.840]   That's how many of these I have.
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:43.840]   But if you sent it to Scott Born, he'll no doubt give it away.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.840]   Yes.
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:45.840]   I can't help myself.
