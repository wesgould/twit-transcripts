[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.160]   What they mean, whether the big phone from Samsung announced today makes any difference
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.720]   for the next Apple iPhone and Apple gets out of a $625 million verdict.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.720]   Or does it?

[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.040]   assembled the team.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.520]   The big team once again, Alex Lindsay is joining us from his fortuitous solitude.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.000]   It's very quiet in here.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   It is.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   It's beautiful.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   It's a beautiful place.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   It's the only quiet I get.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Good.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And you can put me anywhere.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   See, I gave you the green.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.240]   I love expecting some fun.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.960]   You should have some fun with green.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.560]   Send me to the beach here.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.840]   Also with this Renee Richie, he's in Montreal and has no choice about it.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.840]   Nope.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.840]   Stop.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.840]   Can't change.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.840]   I gotta get Alex out of here.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.840]   Must not move.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.200]   Do not go anywhere.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.640]   Even the Scarlet Witch can't help you now Renee.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.920]   Oh no, no more Montreal.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.280]   And the in not cove, the Chicago Sun times.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.520]   So you can hear we see the brilliance of having this type of backdrop.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.680]   I could be anywhere in the world right now and you would never know until Augusta win
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.400]   blows it down and you see the Fiji islands behind me.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.880]   You take that backdrop with you.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.880]   What's your hat say?
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.200]   Oh, this is the classic Hayward fire department hat.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.200]   Nice.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.800]   I did a podcast for somebody who is a firefighter and he sent me a what's called a job.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.040]   A work shirt, I think a job shirt and a this hat and they're both like the nicest thing.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.800]   The job shirt is like what a firefighter wears like underneath the coat.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.040]   And it is like the most intensely warm thing I own.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.840]   It's you would fire fighter would need to be warm.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.840]   Well, yeah, well going outside with freezing weather with a spring water.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.840]   Water.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.840]   Yeah, frozen water.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.600]   I just have to make sure like in the winter that I often this is like sometimes my daily
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.280]   wear hat and I'll be might be wearing like the job strip, which also has the Hayward
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.640]   fire department emblem on it because it's warm.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.160]   They'll go out and run an errand.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.680]   Oh my God, I'm wearing like firefighter hat, firefighter.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.280]   It's like, it's like, it's like, I just hope there's not a fire and somebody says, Hey,
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.280]   help us.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.440]   Sorry, I'm just wearing the clothes.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.440]   Coward.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.240]   I'm a coward.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:50.280]   So as we wrapped the show yesterday, Renee Richie ran off to file and listen to the analyst
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.440]   call as Apple reported.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.240]   It's quarterly earnings for Q three, Q two, yes, three.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.240]   And what's the upshot?
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.840]   They made a ton of money.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.400]   There was a slight, there's a slight bit of hope because, you know, sales either weren't
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.040]   as bad as you expected or in some cases like iPad.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.560]   There's a huge challenge here because year over year compare is very difficult because
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.520]   the iPhone, all the iPhones last year sold gangbusters because there was such pent up
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.240]   demand for bigger screened iPhones and that continues to resonate throughout this year.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.120]   So people either bought early, they were, they were not planning to upgrade, but they
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.800]   saw the big phones and they bought them.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.200]   And so this year they didn't buy an iPhone or just people who'd never considered an iPhone
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.120]   rush to get iPhones.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.160]   So Apple didn't make billions and billions of dollars, but no longer is their record-breaking
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160]   profits in front of every one of their earning releases.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.840]   The SE was a big seller apparently kind of making up for a little bit of a slump in iPhone
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.840]   sales.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.600]   Yes and no, it's also less expensive.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.360]   So it hurts them on average selling price, which is one of the big metrics that people
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.360]   look for.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.800]   So they don't make as much money or margin on the SE.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.240]   Do we know where it's sold well?
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.040]   I mean, it was aimed at the kind of the developing nation, the China market.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.680]   The brick countries, so absent China, I think the Brazil, Russia, India, I mean, I think
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.680]   it was a big surprise.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.440]   I think a lot of people expected it to sell well in countries where they wanted a less
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.800]   expensive phone, but it's not, I mean, it is a little bit of a hundred bucks less, right?
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.200]   But it turns out people really wanted a smaller phone and I think that caught people by a
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.200]   surprise.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.280]   Like some internet people kept saying, I love the iPhone 5, the new ones are too big, I
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.560]   can't use them one-handed, but you never know when that's just nerds complaining or
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.160]   it's, it really is a harbinger of a trend and they just sold a ton of the phones, probably
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.040]   because they were smaller phones.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.080]   And it turns out there is a percentage of any population.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.440]   When you get big enough, when you're selling hundreds of millions of units, even if it's
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.040]   10%, that's still tens of millions of people who want that smaller phone.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.720]   And so this shows, I think that the market is so mature, you've got to start segmenting
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.160]   it now and you can make a lot of money if you start playing to those important niches
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.600]   that are adjacent to your big flagship phone.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.400]   Q1 is always their biggest quarter.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.480]   That's the holiday buying season.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.160]   Q4 sometimes benefits from the fact that you get, maybe you get the iPhone bump in there
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.040]   at the very, very end.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.680]   So this is probably the worst quarter in general.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.680]   Yes.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.560]   Yeah, but they're doing the year over year compare and you know, that's where I'll get
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.560]   dinged on this.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.360]   Third quarter net income down 27%.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:28.560]   Yeah, net income, that same thing, right?
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:37.520]   42, 4.2 million max, 9.95 million iPads.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:45.040]   Service revenue, Apple's been pointing to this as their future, up 19%, almost $6 billion.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.400]   That's revenue, not profit, but services are mostly profit, I would guess.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:56.520]   So all in all, anything to deduce from Apple, from the numbers about Apple's future, anything
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.640]   to, are we going to see more small phones?
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.920]   I think we're going to continue.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.360]   I think these are the three big phones.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.800]   I don't know if we're going to see a lot of other options and I don't think we necessarily
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.800]   need to.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.440]   I think that we're going to be, we're waiting, we had planned to get the SE phones, then
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.680]   I just didn't quite get all the lists of all the people we needed to supply and we're
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.440]   waiting to see what happens in the fall.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.160]   But I think that for also for a lot of companies, for parents buying them for their kids, I
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.760]   think it's a great segment.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.800]   And then I think that it really is a choice between screen size and pocket size and so
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   on and so forth.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:35.160]   I actually prefer the smaller of the two larger ones, the S plus, or the S and not the S plus.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.160]   And I have both of them.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.720]   And I just, so I think that those are, I think that really fills the three, I think most important
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.720]   niches for Apple.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.440]   I'm not sure if they would need to add anymore.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.440]   I think it's interesting that now Apple's in the sort of, Apple's in the stage of the
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.840]   gold rush where they have picked up all the big nuggets of gold that were lying on the
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:08:00.520]   ground and now it's going to be the part of trying to find where they've missed opportunities
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.400]   in their previous horde.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.280]   So they're not, they're not in the place where they take down entire mountains and try to
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.080]   get little, find grain particles of gold anymore.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.520]   But now's the time where brass before they were not going to necessarily be inclined to
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.800]   try to figure out how to sell to India, how to sell to all these other, all these other
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.800]   markets.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.920]   Now it's time to figure out where they're leaving money on the table and then go pick
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.920]   that up.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.360]   So small, so part of that is cheaper phones.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.920]   But another part of it is saying that it's not enough anymore for us to say we're not
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.080]   interested in making phones of this size.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.640]   We don't think that works for consumers.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.640]   We've done tests.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.640]   Now it's down.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.880]   It's really going to get more of these instances of we know now there is a big market for this
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.880]   type of phone.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.840]   So that reason if we're going to make a make money and be make customers happy, we're
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.280]   going to throw away whatever data we think we have and say, great, okay, we will give,
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.240]   we will make a banana shaped phone because people like banana shaped phones and they're
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.240]   buying banana shaped phones.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.960]   We mentioned this on Sunday, but I'll show it again.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.360]   Every second of .io Neil Arguell has written a really great site.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.320]   He's actually expanded it to show Facebook and YouTube now.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.400]   But this is what Apple does every second.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.400]   40.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.720]   Well, actually as the time goes by at the top, it says it's been 10 seconds.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:14.600]   70 iPhones sold, 16 iPad sold, 7 Mac sold, 5 Apple watches, 5 iPad pros.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:22.200]   And in the last 17 seconds, $120,000 in revenue, $27,000 in profit, 18,000 apps downloaded
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:28.160]   now in 24 seconds, 6,000 iTunes songs, $17,000 spent on the app store.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.480]   Now that it's half a minute, 14 million iMessages sent.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.000]   I mean, this is just fun.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Just really.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.520]   I think to see how much money they're making from Renee buying new watch band.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.280]   Let's see the real watch band.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.120]   The thing that I thought was fascinating was that people aren't necessarily buying tons
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.120]   of apps anymore.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.640]   They're spending more times in apps, but they're spending more of it in the same app.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:56.040]   So really is the Facebook, the Snapchat, the Pokemon goes that mainstream people are investing
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.600]   their time and money into so that I think shows the maturity of the app market as well.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.440]   Yeah, that's what I mean, that's what it's saying is you don't have that explosive growth
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.880]   anymore and people trying every app that comes down the line.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.560]   You've got people found the things they need that do the things they want to do.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:17.560]   And every once in a while, you get a Pokemon Go or a Snapchat, then you hot network of?
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.440]   Or what's that photograph app?
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.440]   Prisma.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.440]   Prisma.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.800]   It also provokes you to start looking at the numbers and trying to figure out how much
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:31.040]   is there, how much is the loyalty towards the platform and the hardware and how much
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:38.240]   is the loyalty towards the platform agnostic apps that happen to run on the platform.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.600]   And so what is Apple going to have to do to make sure that they retain all of the iPhone
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.760]   users and all the iPad users that they have built up so far?
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.960]   Well, I think that's especially hard of it though, is it for the ones that are paid?
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.480]   And the fact that so many people have paid for apps, even if they went to another platform,
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.520]   there's no easy way to basically rebind all those apps again.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.360]   So even if they are available on both platforms, it doesn't necessarily mean people will jump
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.360]   right over.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.440]   A lot of these apps are actually services, so they wouldn't necessarily have to rebuy
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.440]   these apps.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.920]   They would just, again, it's, I think that it's going to be interesting to see how sensitive
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:18.400]   iPhone users, for instance, would be to, let's say that Apple were to come out with a new
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.280]   phone that is missing something that they're counting on.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:26.560]   It just seems to, to a random user as boy, it'll be a nuisance to have a banana shaped
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.320]   phone instead of a flat one.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.400]   And no matter how strongly Apple says that a banana shaped phone is the future, this
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.640]   is absolutely, we've not used a flat screen here at Apple's.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.800]   For instance, we had these, these prototype devices, they're wonderful.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.440]   But once you have someone's, the first time that you're shown a phone that is so uninteresting
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.320]   to you that you have to, and you've been holding this cracked screen iPhone for the past three
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.760]   years, you really have money burning a hole in your pocket by a new phone.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.600]   So we can see if people will say, well, I'm not willing to adapt, I'm willing to now look
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.040]   at other phones that are out there.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.200]   So it's going to be just the commoditization.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.160]   I mean, people might not care anymore about whether it's an Apple or not, they might just
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.640]   see a hot phone that they like, they might be bored with the current phone that they
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.440]   have and just want to try something new or the phone will become irrelevant.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.440]   On the Android side, I mean, I think at this point, Apple's kind of thanking their lucky
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.680]   stars that they're the only company that makes an iPhone because on the Android side now,
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:24.120]   you've got all this pressure from, this is an axon from Chinese companies all CTE, $400
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.120]   with every feature that's built.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.120]   Huawei, Alcatel.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.120]   Huawei, there's the OnePlus 3.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.640]   And these are commoditized at this point.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.960]   And the worst part of this, for me, is that we don't care anymore.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.200]   If you look at the worst behaving apps on any platform, it's almost always Facebook, Snapchat,
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.920]   Pokemon Go, and people use them by the hundreds of millions and we've had the shred battery
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.960]   life, their resource, hogs, they abuse almost everything that's possible to be abused.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.680]   And we're like, oh, look, I can catch something.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.880]   I can snap with my friend.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.320]   I can update my history line.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.400]   And that's becoming the norm and people look and see, oh, well, they used to say that we
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.840]   have to be optimized and run and mobile and it's all about that.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.840]   They don't care.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.200]   Whatever schlocky thing we can throw up, go throw up.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.360]   And to Andy's point earlier, that makes it much less tolerant of what the phone can
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.560]   actually do because they're not seeing it.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.080]   They're seeing the worst implementation of the APIs on any platform.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.080]   Meanwhile, the mobile CPUs are getting more and more powerful.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:18.720]   And so therefore, you're kind of hidden from all the waste that all these apps are generating.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:25.440]   And then we're talking about the $400 phones that seem, I would say that the typical $400
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:30.560]   Android phone is built as well as any flagship phone of two years ago.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:35.120]   I don't think they're built quite as well as an Apple phone or as a flagship Android
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.120]   phone is.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.360]   I've both cases I have dropped.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:46.000]   I've dropped an iPhone 6 6s plus onto a cobblestone street and almost didn't even bother to look
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.200]   at the screen before picking it up because I counted it.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.320]   I counted on it still working and it's not quite at that level.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:57.720]   But still you get things like the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 was just released this morning
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.000]   or at least the press event was this morning.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.080]   And I wasn't there at a conflict, but I've been talking to people who were there and it
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:11.120]   is a freely handsomely built, beautifully constructed phone.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:16.200]   And the problem is that again, if you've got someone who's got $700 burning a hole in
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.640]   their pocket, they don't necessarily, there's nothing different enough about the iPhone
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.520]   7, let's say, that really floats their boat.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:29.240]   Or one of the things they mentioned at the Samsung event is they, hey, we still have
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.480]   a headphone check.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.640]   Well, yeah, but I think that may actually be a counter indication for the future.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.280]   That's a very big deal.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.160]   That's what I'm really talking about.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.720]   But also things like Samsung is really good at a lot of things.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.800]   But one of the things they do a lot is here is a gimmicky feature that demos extremely
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.400]   well, gets a lot of attention.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.760]   It is really, really cool in the store and it's going to be awesome for the first two
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.960]   weeks you use it.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.080]   But then maybe you won't ever use it again.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.160]   So now they have iris security that you can hold the thing up to your face.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.800]   There is a separate, there is an infrared mode on the on the front facing LED and a separate
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:11.360]   infrared camera that will actually read your iris, take an eye print of your everything
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.600]   in order to unlock the phone.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.520]   And I'm not sure if that's going to be in any way more convenient than using a fingerprint
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.520]   reader.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.400]   But nonetheless, there are people who are going to be in a store who says, wow, I can
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.520]   actually unlock it using my eyeball.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.520]   That's awesome.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.520]   Does it do?
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.160]   Does it run all the apps that I use on my iPhone?
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.160]   That's awesome.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.160]   Does it have a headphone jack?
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.160]   Of course it does.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.160]   Yes, that's great.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.160]   Tell me one of those.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.400]   The thing that I thought was super interesting is that for the last few generations, Samsung
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.040]   is getting hit with the same brick that Apple gets thrown up in that.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.920]   Yeah, it's a great phone, but they're all great now.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:41.920]   It's a powerful year.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:42.920]   It's a powerful year.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.920]   The Galaxy S7 Edge, they're holding it side by side.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.520]   And this is a seasoned reviewer going, I mean, it sits on top of this, but they're also
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.520]   similar now.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.000]   And that's one of the reasons I think, and I disagree with you, Andy.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.360]   It's one of the reasons I think these sub $400 phones are actually going to start becoming
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.520]   a problem for both Samsung and Apple.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.520]   This accent is every bit as well built as any state of the art modern phone.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.520]   It's beautiful.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.520]   It's phenomenal.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.520]   It feels good.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.440]   I don't think this is a compromise in any way.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.440]   I don't think it's a compromise.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:21.520]   I'm saying that there's a difference between, I'm very, very sure that if I buy an iPhone
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:27.640]   6s plus, let's say, or if I bought a Samsung Galaxy 6, let's say, last year, I'm very,
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:32.480]   very certain that I can get that value back, or at least part of that value back in resale,
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.680]   partly because these things are built really to tolerances where it will last.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:41.720]   I'm saying it lasts about three years beyond the point at which I'm probably going to be
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.200]   in the market for a new phone anyway.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.240]   I think that the $400 phones are built exceptionally well.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.360]   I think they're built as better than anybody really needs it to be.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:54.400]   I think the tolerances that they're built to, they're built so that if you do drop them
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:59.560]   two and a half feet onto cobblestone, your 50/50 chance it's okay.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.960]   I disagree, Andy.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.720]   You obviously haven't handled this phone.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.080]   I completely disagree with you.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.320]   I think you're wrong.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.680]   I've handled pretty much every phone that's kind of like that.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.600]   I'm saying that these phones are largely unproven in that level of durability.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.880]   I think they're commodities, and you're right in that sense.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.200]   Well, there's two things with those phones is that I think for some people in established
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.000]   markets, they're going to want to store with the logo on it that they can go to if there's
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   not any problems.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Brand, it's a different stuff.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.720]   And in some emerging markets, the brands, they want the esteem.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.800]   They said in China, I think Ben Thompson said this, there's two things.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.080]   There's this little wallet that you can buy at an iPhone, and they're cheap enough that
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.400]   most people can eventually afford one, and it's a huge status boom, and that really matters
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.400]   in some of those countries.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.400]   Yeah, no, I agree with you.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:46.040]   In fact, even in those countries, this country matters, but I think if, in a purely objective
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.520]   point of view, if I handed you this in an iPhone 6S, I don't...
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.400]   I think you'd say this is every bit as good.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.400]   I think that they're every bit as good.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.080]   I'll drop it for you if you want.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.480]   I still think the challenge is that...
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:03.960]   I have a couple of Android phones and a couple of iPhones that I'm using on a regular basis,
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.160]   and I still think that...
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.920]   I think that Apple still has an edge on its views.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:13.200]   I think for us, maybe not, but when I handed it to somebody else, it's definitely there's
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.840]   a lot more that you can...
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.200]   There's actually more you can do on your Android, and there's also more pitfalls in the Android
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.160]   than on the iPhone.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.120]   As far as you get it and use it, and I think that when I still think about who I would
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:29.320]   hand it to immediately, I'd still pick an iPhone for someone unless I felt like they
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.680]   wanted kind of a more geeky end of things.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.320]   And I think that that is still the edge that Apple has, and something that's still a gap
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.440]   that Android has to close.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.440]   I still think...
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:44.400]   I've said for a long time, I still believe this to be true, that Apple excels at designing
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.480]   software and hardware that's really easy to use for the first two or three weeks, they
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.760]   don't design hardware that's necessarily gets easier to use after six or seven months.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.240]   And the difference isn't necessarily the design of Android or Windows or anything like that,
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.440]   it's the amount of freedom that the user has later on.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.960]   When they start poking around, they start trying to figure out, "Gee, I still hate the
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.280]   way that X works.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.560]   Is there a way to fix that?"
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.440]   And then you Google around or go to a wonderful site like I'm more one of its partner sites
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.960]   and you find out that, "Oh, actually I can change the way that apps load, or I can change
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.600]   the way that this looks."
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.400]   And then it becomes easier for that person because they've found the way to adapt the
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.040]   thing that's been a sticking point for them.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.960]   Yeah, I mean, I guess the question we're really asking is, "How price sensitive is this market?"
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:35.720]   And are people willing to spend twice as much for a brand name and for a few ineffable things
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.120]   like maybe it's easier to use?
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.560]   Neo makes a good point in our chatroom, Apple.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.800]   If you break a screen, there are lots of places to go to get, but Apple's screen replaced,
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.240]   I have no idea where I would go to get an axon screen replaced.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.400]   That's another difficulty.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.720]   A Samsung is about as easily easy to fix as an iPhone.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.040]   But it's the same cost as the point.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.880]   But it's probably less expensive because it's all third-party stuff.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:07.720]   No, I'm just saying that is the $400 phone competitive with an $800 phone?
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:12.400]   It may be objectively, but there are these ineffable differences that probably, and
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.600]   I just don't know how price sensitive people are.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.600]   It depends if you're...
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.480]   The bigger disadvantage, just to point out, is that, first of all, with a company like
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:24.320]   OnePlus, they're making probably some of the best phones that are discounted that you
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.320]   can possibly buy.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.320]   They're incredible, yeah.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:31.000]   But the problem is they don't have the same resources as Samsung, which means that if
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.200]   you bought a OnePlus 2 last year, you just got Android 6 about a month ago, and the rumor
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.520]   has it that Android 7 is going to be released in three days.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:46.120]   And actually going to be the biggest difference in the long run is on the Apple side, you
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.640]   know you're going to get all the updates.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.360]   You just are, as long as you have that phone in the last few years.
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.720]   And the thing is that Apple's never wanted to compete for the attention of people for
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.880]   whom price is the most important feature.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.280]   They're okay with price being somewhere in there, but if you're making a decision-
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.280]   No, I understand.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.280]   ... that's only on the price of it.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:05.800]   I understand I'm saying is that an old-fashioned strategy in a world where you can spend half
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.560]   as much money and get an equivalent phone?
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.560]   That's the question.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.880]   It was only real advantage there is they're the only source of iPhones.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.280]   So as with every other Apple piece of hardware, they can inflate the cost because there's
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.280]   nowhere else, there's no competition.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.280]   But I think that also there's a lot of people-
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.280]   But I think that also there's a lot of people-
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.280]   Value price.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.320]   And is it so easy for a dollar phone on another platform competition or not?
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.240]   Is it so commodity that people are going to treat it like anything they buy in the
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.240]   store?
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.240]   Exactly.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.240]   I mean it's hard to differentiate.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:36.280]   Say there's a true differentiation between a Ford Fusion and a BMW three series.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.280]   You're exactly right.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.280]   You're exactly right.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.760]   So I think there are definitely people out there that are going to buy a three series
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:46.280]   and they buy the three series for a variety of reasons and that's a good market still.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.920]   But it's really hard to say that the Ford Fusion is not as good as the-
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.480]   No, that's an excellent point.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.600]   Cars that has held true.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.080]   I do think it's going to be more of a challenge for Apple in the coming years because now-
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.200]   Remember when the iPhone started and for the three or four years after that, people weren't
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.720]   really aware of how much money they were spending on their phones because they were just simply
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:08.000]   getting their "free phone" or "of now they know".
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   They're charging $100.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.680]   Now basically you go into the AT&T store and you buy a phone and now when you're looking
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.480]   at here is the phone that you keep the iPhone you came in to get.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:24.360]   Here is a phone that's to the Toyota Corolla purchaser is pretty much the same, same build
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:29.240]   quality, same features and it costs an entire car payment less.
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:34.040]   That's when people start thinking, "Well, not that they're going to be skeptical about
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.960]   the iPhone but they're going to at least start asking questions as what is this other phone
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:44.320]   going to give me for an extra $250 that this other phone will not be able to do for me."
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.960]   It's going to be interesting to see how that plays out in future sales.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.120]   The thing that I was talking about is I've been working on which iPhone is best for which
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.600]   person for a long time and we're working on a guide for it.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.520]   I was talking to some people in the industry trying to figure that out and saying, "Is
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.280]   the iPhone SE the less expensive alternative?"
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.800]   I thought that they would all say that because the sticker price is much smaller when you
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.040]   first go in but they were all saying no.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:09.200]   That surprised me, people really are buying it for the size and they thought that especially
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.840]   now that it's been decomposed and you can see the full price that they would be super
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.040]   sensitive but they realize that they're going to be paying this off over a year, over two
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:20.040]   years and they're starting to understand total cost of ownership better now.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.000]   You think they would have cared about that more previously because the prices of the
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.040]   contracts were so high but they just never had to think about it because it was this one
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.200]   payment thing but now they're starting to think about it.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.800]   They are seeing that and they're saying, "Well, it really works out to $5 more, $10
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.920]   more or I'm paying so much.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.600]   It's going to be almost exactly the same thing over two years.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.760]   So why shouldn't I get the better phone, one that I'm really happy with?"
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.920]   I think that's an interesting angle that's starting to play out in the industry in North
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.920]   America.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.920]   Let's take a break.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.080]   We're coming back with more conversation.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.680]   There is a new Galaxy Note.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.000]   Does it threaten the iPhone?
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.520]   Apple borrows $7 billion.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.800]   Why?
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:57.800]   And what are they going to do?
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:05.560]   A world-renowned Nobel Prize-winning economist says Apple's Irish Tax Strategy is fraud when
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.560]   we come back.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:11.440]   But right now, I want to tell you about the best place to make your next website, Squarespace.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:17.520]   The more I use Squarespace, the more I realize what a valuable product this is and I don't
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.960]   understand how they offer it so inexpensively.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:25.240]   Squarespace is the best hosting and the best software married together to give you a beautiful
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:30.520]   website for your business, for your personal site, from a simple cover page to a perfect
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.920]   portfolio to your online store.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:38.720]   It all is included with your Squarespace website, whether you're a designer, a photographer,
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.720]   a filmmaker.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.560]   Maybe you've got a restaurant, you're a writer, you're a band.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.520]   They've got a site, a design for you.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.800]   Lots of templates and these templates not only combine state-of-the-art engineering, things
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:58.800]   like mobile responsive design, e-commerce, all built in, but also the finest, most beautiful
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.920]   design.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.400]   You get the best of both worlds.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.920]   You sacrifice nothing.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:12.160]   They have these new five-new magazine templates, which I love that include grid-style land.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.160]   Like I'm more.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.640]   You get a grid-style landing page of the Verge.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:19.280]   You get infinite scroll related posts to automatically appear at the bottom, encouraging
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:24.720]   visitors to read more, you get author profile pages, integrated search right in the header,
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.760]   so readers can find what they want.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.880]   That's just one template.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.480]   Your content is independent of the template.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.520]   Tomorrow you say, "Yeah, I like to try a new look.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.560]   You can't easily."
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.720]   It's designed by pros to look great, but of course, if you want to get geeky, you can
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.240]   get really down into it.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.800]   All the settings are customizable.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.600]   Faunt color page configurations.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.400]   If you're a developer, you can even start with a blank template, have all the engineering
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.840]   behind the scenes, and do your own thing on top of it.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.360]   We've used for Lisa's new site, Artisanal Agency.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.440]   We used a Squarespace Designer.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.440]   Very affordable.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.280]   They did the whole thing.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:07.720]   And then for a small fee every month, she gets all the updates.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.920]   It was a choice between that and me doing it.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.320]   I said, "Hey, Lisa.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.080]   Looks like they've got these great designers."
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.280]   And I'm actually really glad.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.000]   In fact, it impresses me so much.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:28.120]   I'm thinking, "I would be doing this if I didn't have a lot more to prove to people."
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.680]   Artisanalagency.com, take a look at it.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.280]   It really is beautifully done.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.600]   She didn't have to do any work.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.520]   It's really, really incredible.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.800]   I want you to try Squarespace right now.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.560]   Get a free custom domain with an annual purchase.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.960]   Great 24/7 support.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.440]   They now have their own domain registrar.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:50.600]   So you can browse over 200 top-level domains, not just .com and .net, but like hundreds
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.080]   of others, buy it from Squarespace domains.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:57.960]   And even if you're not ready to put up a site, you'll get a clean, spam-free ad, free parking
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.720]   page until you're ready to start building.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.840]   And I think that's awesome.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:07.760]   If you have three or more active Squarespace sites, and I know a lot of you do, now you
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.640]   have something called the Squarespace Circle, membership includes advanced guides, optimized
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.400]   support, and longer trial periods for new projects and more.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.400]   It's really cool.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.400]   Six-month trial periods.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.400]   Squarespace.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.640]   I shouldn't have to sell you on this.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.640]   It's just great.

[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.760]   And of course, Andy and I go to Chicago Sun Times.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.000]   But, ting, this is like, it's like the match game or something.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   Each of you get a little-
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   You're either double Isaac.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.760]   God, what was that game?
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.920]   The Call of Christian Hollywood Squares.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.360]   Somebody's asking, is Georgia Dow still writing for you Rene or not?
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.480]   Yeah, she does a column.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.840]   So it's usually every two weeks every month.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.240]   She just did a really, really good one on the Breathe app for the Apple Watch.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.680]   Because that's always, whenever she starts someone in therapy, she starts them off with
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.440]   breathing and it's incredibly important.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.960]   She just loves a new app.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.960]   So there you go.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.960]   Yeah, we love Rene.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.440]   I mean, we do love Rene, but we also love Georgia.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.440]   That's what we want.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.840]   I mean, pull poor shadow compared to them.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.480]   No, not at all, not at all.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.280]   Let's see, what else?
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:44.000]   Let's talk a little bit about the Galaxy Note 7.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.160]   Announced this morning, available for pre-order tomorrow on all carriers and you'll get it
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.160]   on the 19th.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:53.600]   Of course, I will have to order one and immediately insert the pen backwards to see what happens.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.600]   You're safe.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.720]   But it's so much better than the Galaxy Note 6.0.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.520]   It's so much better than the Galaxy Note 6.0.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.520]   There is no Galaxy Note 6.0.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.520]   It's a hundred percent better.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:05.920]   It skips right ahead because they want to keep in track with their Galaxy S7.
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.040]   Looks like, as you said, anti-swollen, not swollen.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.040]   Enhanced.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.080]   A larger Galaxy S7 with a stylus.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.360]   The stylus, though, really, they're smart because that is a differentiator.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.880]   The iris, I guess, as well.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.880]   Yeah, the phones are big now.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:18.880]   I mean, the size.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.880]   The size does not do it.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.560]   The first CES, they had them on the tables.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.360]   You went into the Samsung room and there was the first Galaxy Note 7.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.600]   It was so big you could barely see the table.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.600]   I mean, we all had time.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.200]   I think I had an iPhone 4S and a Nexus 1 back then.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.200]   And you could stack them.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.040]   We stacked like nine palm veers on top of the original.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:40.200]   This X on this one and another X on it is bigger than or the same size, I think, as the original
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.200]   Note.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.600]   It doesn't feel or look big to me.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.600]   It looks normal.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.600]   It's five point five.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.800]   It's like the differentiator.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:46.800]   Right.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.960]   If you've got phablets, we don't even use the word phablet.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.960]   Thank God.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.960]   It's just a phone.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.960]   It's just a phone.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:53.960]   It's just a phone.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:57.920]   It's about the same size as the Nexus 6P.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:58.920]   It's just basically standard.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.920]   Right.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.000]   They got a couple of digs in an Apple.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.240]   They did mention headphone jack and he waited pause to see if the answer would get it.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:12.160]   They took them a while, but eventually they laughed or applauded or whatever.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.720]   If bears mentioning this is why we talked about this a lot last week, but this is why
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.520]   Apple has to make sure that if they delete the headphone jack, they get their messaging
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.040]   straight because this phone not only doesn't have it a headphone jack, it has a big huge
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.560]   hole for the for the receptacle for the for the pen.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:33.560]   It also has speaker grills and it's still IP 6.8 certified just like the Galaxy 7.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.120]   So it's not waterproof.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.400]   It's not the issue.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.200]   You can make it waterproof with all that stuff.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.200]   Right.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.200]   Exactly.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.280]   So they'll have to if they're looking for reasons for pro consumer reasons why they deleted
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.760]   the headphone jack, they're going to have to delete that off the lid.
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.920]   Also the type C momentum for the connector is building.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:54.400]   Now I would say every phone except an iPhone in the next year will have a type C connector.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:00.160]   I keep getting like sample phones in like month after month after month and pretty much
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.320]   all the at least all the flagship phones that seem to be coming in are switching to USB
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.320]   C.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.720]   Yeah, as they should.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:11.600]   It has many of the advantages of lightning.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.400]   And those cables are oxollet now.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.000]   Let me worry about those anymore.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.880]   Thanks to Benson Leung at Google.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.200]   We can now trust our type C cables.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.200]   Let's see.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.000]   Iris Skinner, yeah, we'll see.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.760]   Fingerprint reader works so well.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:26.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.000]   I mean, so fast.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.800]   I don't, could Iris maybe be more secure because you can't cut somebody's wallet.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.240]   I could imagine them pushing.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.400]   Are they doing both on this?
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.400]   Yeah, they're doing both.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.400]   Yeah, they're doing both.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:43.920]   You could have some people that wanted to, you know, two forms of ID or either or as
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.920]   well.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:45.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:46.920]   And they do.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.240]   They did announce a number of banks, including Bank of America, are adopting Iris reading as
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.320]   another form of authentication.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.440]   Evidently, I've heard that, and I haven't actually seen it myself, that it already in
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:02.240]   Bank of America, I think it's if you have $10 million in the bank, I've heard that you
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.240]   have to give an iris scan.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.000]   They actually send you one that you put on your computer if you want to get into your
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   account.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.640]   So I think that that already exists for the banks for the house.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.320]   It'll come down to how well they implemented this.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:21.240]   There's already a lot of security experts who seem to be saying that there are the fingerprint
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.640]   reader is not necessarily vulnerable, but it's not invulnerable.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:31.160]   There was a story just was it last week of the week before about how a murder victim
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.640]   had a phone and they the authorities wanted to unlock it.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:40.920]   And they did manage to through a lot of equipment, basically reproduce the victim's thumbprint
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.280]   or fingerprint and correctly unlock that phone.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.720]   Unfortunately, it wasn't a passcode behind it as well.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:50.520]   But just to be fair, this required a lot of this required a special print, for instance,
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:55.520]   that could deposit conductive ink and reproduce a reproducing fingerprint conductively.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.640]   They try to 3D scanner and 3D printer.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:01.560]   That's also like $300, $400, $500 device.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:05.240]   But it's the difference between if someone was really motivated to do this, could they
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.240]   do it?
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:11.440]   It's also unknown how well it would work with a with a with a simpler stuff or more clever
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.560]   people who were more motivated.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:18.960]   So but it will come down to people trying to break this retinist scanning and see if it
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.920]   actually turns out to be maybe a second less convenient than fingerprint scanning, but
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.080]   perhaps more resistant to to to miscreants.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.840]   Should we clear it's not retinist scanning?
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:28.840]   It's Irish.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.840]   Sorry, it's Irish scanning.
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:34.040]   It takes an information for it photo of your right of the of the kind of the colored part
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.040]   of your eye.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:39.880]   And apparently the formations there are unique and more importantly don't change over time
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.600]   so that that is a useful way to identify it.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.000]   It's not the first one.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:51.560]   Microsoft put out a iris scanner on the Lumia 950 and 950 XL, and it was unusable.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.560]   You had to.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.960]   So you spend a lot of time with the phone going up down.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.800]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.800]   The Nexus machines.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.800]   Well, then, and then you also get into it.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.800]   Yeah, like a Nexus machine.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:03.960]   Can it go through a sunglasses?
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.920]   Can it go through prescription?
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.920]   What level of prescription?
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.920]   You've been drinking.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.920]   How red are you?
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.920]   This may be gimmicky.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.080]   This may be something great.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.080]   We just don't know until we get.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.080]   But then that's to be convenient.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.200]   I think sometimes people think their security features, but when they were introduced, all
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.080]   companies were very clear to say that, you know, people just don't use pass codes because
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.480]   they can say them a pain.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.800]   And this is better security with convenience.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.440]   So it's better than not having anything.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.400]   It is not as good at having a long like if you want, you can have a Steve Gibson 32 bit,
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.960]   you know, random pass code that you just put in there and that's it.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.200]   And nobody can get into that phone.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.960]   That's very secure, right.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.600]   It is, but it's so hard for you to get.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   Nobody wants to do.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.600]   So I'm going to call it.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.680]   I mean, if you fall asleep, someone in your house can come and put your thumb on the phone.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.680]   It's not a security.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:46.640]   They can open your bleary eye and try and speak for things about fingerprints.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:52.600]   You can give a family member one of the fingerprints if you wish or, you know, somebody you trust.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.840]   And I like that because then I don't have to give them a password, but I can give them
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.120]   they can quickly get into my phone if they need to.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.400]   The fingerprint works so well.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.040]   I will not buy a phone without a fingerprint reader now.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.320]   It's just it's a requirement.
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.320]   One of the things Samsung did announce is they're going to have and this is interesting,
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:14.000]   a secure folder that requires it wasn't clear, but it requires an additional step of security
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.680]   to open and you could put stuff in there.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.600]   And even if your phone's unlocked, nobody's going to be able to get to it.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.760]   I thought that was interesting.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.760]   Right.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.760]   So if you're concerned about your banking app, for instance, you could basically have fingerprint
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:28.520]   unlocking for most everything, but then say, no, I'm going to need an eyeball in order
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:32.200]   to get into my banking app or to get into my Snapchat or stuff like that.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.600]   This is something, of course, Apple does so well to secure enclave and so forth.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:42.200]   And I think Samsung and Knox, which is their security platform, have proven to be as just
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.200]   as desirable.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:50.040]   In fact, in some cases, government installations, I think the Pentagon has approved Knox, but
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.600]   has not yet approved the iPhone for use in secure installations.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:58.800]   Yeah, I've read I've read but have not talked to anybody who could confirm this to me that
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.840]   Knox is one of the reasons why the president's phone is an Android phone.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.840]   Exactly.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.840]   Well, it's an older Android phone.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.800]   It's just to be with the open source nature of it.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.480]   Not because it's better, but because it has been certified.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.880]   We're asked the iOS equivalent.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.200]   I just want that everywhere.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:15.120]   Like I want a setting that you can go into any app and just say require authentication
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.120]   to open.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.120]   Wouldn't that be great?
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:21.360]   I just never actually have that because third party apps on iOS have that you can like all
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.040]   my banking apps in one password require a thumbprint to open them.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.800]   Just make that part of the package.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.960]   Anyone can use that.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.720]   All the standard apps have that turn it on.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:29.720]   Make it off by default.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.720]   Turn it on the settings.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.960]   That way your messages, your photos, everything, it just has a chance to be secure.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:34.960]   That's what you want.
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.960]   And Renee is spot on.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.200]   It's like as soon as my bank, as soon as my banking app added fingerprint recognition
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.520]   to the iOS app before the Android app.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.440]   And I'm like, please come on, man.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:50.920]   Add this to the Android phone because I'm sorry.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:55.320]   I usually carry like both phones with me on a day to day basis just so I can stay hip.
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:00.360]   And it's like, I would much rather like make sure that Wi-Fi hotspot is always turned on.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:04.800]   Make sure that my second iPhone is connected to that and always sign in with my fingerprint.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   It is that much easier.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:10.280]   And that's also the reason why I should say that Apple can make things even easier.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:15.360]   I'm such a big fan of putting the scanner on the back instead of at the front and the
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.520]   home button.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:20.160]   And because you're taking, I'm reaching in my pocket, I'm taking it out.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.720]   And my finger just happens to be here.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:22.720]   So that's true.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.720]   And it's simply unlocks.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:24.720]   That's a Nexus 6P.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.720]   This is the 5X.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.720]   Or the 5X.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:28.720]   The Nexus is due to that.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.880]   The Samsung still has it on the front, you know, the home button.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.920]   The accent does have it on the back, which is it's a very natural place to put that, I
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.920]   think.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.360]   I don't know about Android, but I think the end game for Apple is just going to be anywhere
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.720]   you touch the screen and it will authenticate you.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.920]   I think the patents are out for that.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.160]   I don't know when they're going to start implementing.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:51.000]   I think they want to at least make one section like somewhere on the screen here, an omni
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   focus thing.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.920]   If you can't necessarily open up the passcode by touching anywhere, at least here is one
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.880]   section where they can at least draw a circle or draw a fingerprint logo and say, here's
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.880]   what you touch.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.880]   Hook to log in.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.560]   Well, that's the potential for the iris scanner.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.160]   I have to make sure that I get a good print off of your eyeball.
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.200]   The potential for the iris scanner is great.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.360]   If it works as well, I mean, face recognition was dopey.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.600]   But if the idea is it could just, you just kind of are there and you hold the phone up
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.560]   or maybe you even don't have to hold the phone up and it just knows it's you because it can
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.480]   see your iris.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.720]   That would be the ideal.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.840]   Ambient authentication is just the end when it can pull enough vectors, like it knows
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.000]   your fingerprint, it knows your iris.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.360]   It can pull together whatever three or four bits it can and have a really high likelihood
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.840]   that it's you and then just open.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.840]   We will have that.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.160]   I predict we will have that in the next few years.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.160]   That's coming.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.160]   Absolutely.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:44.200]   There are also some researchers who are trying to work on really subtle other metrics.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:49.720]   Like again, if I take my phone out of my pocket, it can sense by how it's moving and
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.720]   how it's twisting.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:51.720]   Okay.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.480]   I'm going to take my left pocket and he fumbled with it a little bit before getting it lit
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.480]   up.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.480]   He always does that.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:01.480]   He never which whoever tried to let whoever tried to take this phone out took it out of
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.720]   a back pocket and we have not seen Andy actually take a phone out of a back pocket yet.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:10.000]   Not necessarily that I'm going to trust what I know before, but where I'm going to make
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.800]   sure I use a little extra authentication or I'm going to cut Andy a little bit of slack
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:18.520]   if he is if his the way he unholed through the phone was within one tenth of one percent
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:19.920]   of how he usually does it.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:23.360]   I think a lot of people don't know that multi touch is actually three dimensional.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:27.160]   It radiates out of the screen, which is why some companies choose to use it to do distance
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.440]   gestures and things, but all of them use the same fundamental technology.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.400]   So you can start mapping where the fingers are holding.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.480]   So if someone is touching a phone, you can start building up a profile.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:39.600]   This is how Leo usually unlocks his phone or this is how he usually taps the screen.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.600]   These fingers are bent.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.600]   These fingers are straight.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.240]   This is the arrangement, the distance and you can start measure those things.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.600]   That becomes another trigger or how you walk.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.480]   That's the pace, you know, your gate, there's also an alice.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:52.400]   There's so many ways you could fingerprint a phone.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.040]   I can't unlock your phone.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.240]   Try to walk a little bit more fun.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:02.960]   Try to be just like you use silly walk.
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:06.480]   I will play she in the she needs in strut pout.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.240]   Put it out is what you want for women.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.480]   Please just dance accordingly as we know we do.
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.480]   I just read my ankle.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:16.280]   I can't walk and my voice is really high pitch right now, but please I need into my phone.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:22.080]   I would like to open this, but you've lost your muchness.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:28.360]   Why is Apple, which has more than $200 billion in the bank borrowing $7 billion?
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.640]   They finalized a five part bond sale.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:32.640]   Taxes.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.640]   Taxes.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.640]   Tax.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.600]   Is this because of domestic and overseas money, Leo?
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.080]   Yeah, they can't spend that money.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.080]   Most of it's overseas.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.720]   They can't spend it.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.240]   They could, but they have to give the government was a 25% of it.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.240]   It's hurting.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.240]   30%?
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.240]   Wow.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:50.840]   The United States tax code is much higher than most other countries, not just Ireland.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:54.160]   Well, Ireland's 12.5%.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.560]   Some might say that Ireland is artificially low.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.880]   In fact, that's exactly what the EU says.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:02.080]   Well, it's unclear whether they're actually even paying that.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:06.600]   The whole Irish Dutch sandwich thing has them not.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.960]   It's unclear what they're paying there.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.960]   In some cases, they pay tax to other countries already and they just want to repatriate the
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:14.040]   money, but then they have to pay what they consider to be double taxes.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:19.320]   And in fairness, they are, Apple is the largest taxpayer in the country.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:23.040]   So it's not that it's not paying any taxes.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.760]   I think people have this impression that they are.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.600]   They're paying more taxes than anybody else.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:30.360]   They're just not paying them on all the corporate profits that are generated overseas.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:36.400]   In an interview with Bloomberg, Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stigless said it
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.960]   was actually fraud.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.960]   He didn't say it was illegal.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:43.360]   He said our current tax system encourages companies to keep their money abroad.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.600]   It's a vast loophole.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.880]   But he said, here we have the largest corporation in capitalization, not only in America, but
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:53.280]   in the world bigger than GM at its peak, claiming that most of its profits originate
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:57.080]   from a few hundred people working in Ireland.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.720]   That's a fraud.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.440]   Tax law that encourages American firms to keep jobs abroad is wrong.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.000]   And I think we can get a consensus in America to get that change.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   Imagine I well-pampered those.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Even Tim Cook has-
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.240]   You can imagine I well-pampered there in limousine.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.320]   No one's allowed to touch them.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.040]   And by the way, Apple is far from alone in this.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.720]   Every tech company, every big company does this.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.240]   The small company can't get away with it.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.440]   I tried.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:19.920]   But every big company does.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:24.440]   And the trick is to transfer, in this case, Apple's case, transfer your intellectual property
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.840]   rights to this small holding company in Ireland.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:30.760]   And then all the profits go to that holding company and you only pay 12 and a half percent
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.160]   corporate tax.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.760]   Instead of the 35 percent you'd have to pay.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.160]   Really good whiskey and stew.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.160]   Be illegal.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.400]   And I agree to you know, look, it is legal.
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:48.000]   And it's their fiduciary responsibility if you're their CFO to pay as little tax as you
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.080]   can legally pay.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.840]   Why would you pay more?
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:55.360]   But at the same time, I also agree with Stiglitz.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.080]   It's ethically questionable.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.440]   I don't think Apple should change what they do.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.120]   But I think the law needs to be changed in Pronto.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.120]   It's not-
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:08.680]   I think a more reasonable tax rate would probably bring a lot of money back.
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:14.120]   And I think that they- I think we pay a pretty big price for the higher tax rate.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:17.160]   It's not just that there's all this rigmarole about paying taxes.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:20.360]   It's that all that money that could be invested into things in the United States, there's
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.400]   not being invested into things in the United States.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:27.000]   700 American companies have international headquarters in Ireland.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   Right.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.160]   That tells you something, right?
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.640]   You're the weather.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.560]   They're there for the weather.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:41.040]   And even the EU is questioning Irish tax law and saying this maybe is a little bit, you
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.280]   know, obviously-
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.960]   It's a question before the Brexit.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.960]   Too late.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:46.960]   Sorry.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:47.960]   Too late now.
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:48.960]   Sorry.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:49.960]   Bye bye.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:50.960]   Actually-
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:51.960]   That's true.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:52.960]   The Ireland Republic of Ireland.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.920]   The Republic of Ireland is still going to be in the EU, right?
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.920]   So they still can ask about that.
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:02.560]   But that's where Apple's money is and that's the way it is and that's why they're borrowing.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:06.440]   And it's a good deal to borrow it because what's going to, what could possibly go wrong?
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:08.880]   That's probably those bond rates are probably pretty good.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.880]   Can you guarantee this?
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.120]   I got money in my shoe.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:12.120]   Okay.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.120]   Really.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.120]   Yeah, really.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:19.160]   Apple is saving or looks to be saving $625.6 million.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:29.560]   A judge has voided the verdict against Apple in a patent lawsuit by Viernet X.
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:33.680]   Some might call them a patent troll, others merely a non-practicing entity.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:34.680]   So happy about this.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:38.800]   AKA patent troll.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:44.280]   In Friday, US District Judge Robert Schroeder of Tyler, Texas, where most of these lawsuits
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:49.960]   occur, East Texas, said it was unfair to Apple that the lawsuits had been combined into
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.440]   a single trial.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:54.280]   Jurors may have been confused.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.040]   So he has now ordered both cases retried.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:01.240]   So it ain't over yet and it's still in Tyler, Texas.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:08.160]   But at least they don't have to write a check today.
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:13.720]   I wonder, shouldn't we now be at a point where there's so many people who are so important
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:18.120]   in Apple just defending lawsuits that just like the original Mac, they should all, as
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:22.880]   a point of pride, they sign like the inside of the cover page of the latest.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.720]   I look as free from never.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:26.720]   I feel so sorry.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:27.720]   I feel so tired.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:30.240]   I mean, it's funny, but some of them retired over the Samsung trials.
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.680]   They just didn't want to be in court anymore.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.360]   And I'm sure this is the same.
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:36.760]   They want to be there creating apps and they can't create apps because they're being sued.
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.280]   Plus they have to waste their time going to testify about these apps.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:41.600]   It's not the job they want to have.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:42.600]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:46.080]   And you can say like Apple, you know, Apple in Samsung, they knew what they were getting,
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.040]   but being sued by all these patent trolls all the time.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.920]   It's just not what anybody wants.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:57.720]   And of course, the Samsung cases is going to the Supreme Court, I believe Apple counters
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:04.040]   Samsung in the Supreme Court struggle on Friday, Apple filed a legal brief urging the Supreme
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:09.360]   Court to rule against the Samsung assertion about the damages is to pay Apple for infringing
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.400]   patent designs.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.920]   Let me see if I can.
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:19.960]   So earlier this month, Apple said Samsung told the court that Apple should get profits only
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:25.680]   from the parts of a smartphone that infringe Apple's patents, the front face and ingredient
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:30.240]   of icons in the interface, not from the entire phone, just the profits from the face and the
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.000]   icons part that the humans use.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.360]   But today, Apple countered by saying Samsung had no evidence support.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:40.320]   It's claimed the company also said there's no need to send the case back to a lower court.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:45.680]   Remember the damages were originally a billion cut back a little bit by a judge.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.000]   I guess, I guess it's we'll see what happens.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   Right.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   It's going to the Supreme Court.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:57.040]   Yeah, I think that their Apple must be kind of happy that I'm sorry, Samsung's kind of
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.280]   happy that Scalia is not on the bench.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.240]   Well, and also that if even if they lose here, that's it.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.240]   It's over.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.240]   Yeah, they can't.
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.840]   There's no more fields.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:06.840]   You can only go to God now.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:07.840]   And that's going to the Hague.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:14.960]   Maybe maybe that's maybe maybe both sides figure there's no way of going possibly lose
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:17.760]   because there is no way this continues after this.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:18.760]   Yeah, it's over.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.720]   I'll be out drinking that night.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:21.720]   It's over.
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.400]   Let's take a little break and we'll talk about the car.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:31.200]   Some movements in the Apple Titan project and the one billionth iPhone.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:37.040]   What one who would have ever thought a billion iPhones would be sold.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:40.000]   I bought two that weekend Leo is a high chance for most of the time.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.600]   Did you get did you get a prize if you well, let's fight.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:43.600]   We'll find out in a second.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.720]   Definitely not palm.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.920]   I got my new look at this my new Mac break weekly tracker came.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:50.920]   This is so awesome.
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.800]   Tracker is really a fun thing.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:59.040]   It lets you keep track of stuff that you lose like your keys, the remote control, fluffy,
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.440]   the cat, spot the dog.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:07.240]   There's small enough these little anodized tracker bravos there about the size of a quarter and
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.800]   they can easily fit on a dog collar.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:13.680]   In fact, if you have a if you have it if you want to put it in your dog, they have a waterproof
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:18.000]   enclosure to put it in and now you can get custom printed images.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   Look Mac break weekly.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.800]   I've got one that's my face.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.760]   Actually you picture the dog would be kind of cool on there too.
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.120]   So what is this?
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.560]   Well you pair it to your phone, right?
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:31.800]   The tracker app on your phone and now you get two way separation alerts.
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:37.920]   If you lose, let's say it's on your keys as mine is and you lose your keys.
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.680]   Then you can say, where are my keys?
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:43.200]   You can look on the track wrap on your phone and see a map and there's where you left your
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.480]   keys.
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:49.000]   But also if you have your keys but you left your phone somewhere, you can press the button
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.560]   on the tracker and your phone screams or whatever sound you tell.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.720]   Even when it's silenced, your phone will say, I'm here, I'm here, come get me.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:59.080]   You can track up to 10 devices at once.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.120]   Now it is Bluetooth L8.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:04.800]   That's a good thing because it means you're going to get a year battery life and the battery
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:07.000]   is replaceable in this.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.880]   But you might say, what if I get more than 100 feet away from my keys?
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:14.880]   Well that's when the amazing tracker, Crowd GPS comes in.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:18.040]   It's the largest Crowd GPS network in the world.
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:21.560]   Every, more than a million and a half people have the tracker app running on their phone.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:25.720]   If they stroll by your keys, the tracker goes, help me, help me.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:31.600]   And the phone goes, oh, I see Leo's keys and sends the My Tracker app, the message your
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.640]   keys were last seen right here.
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:39.200]   So this is a way, those are all those blue dots, those are all trackers, a million and
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.360]   a half of them.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:44.760]   A great way to keep track of where your device is everywhere.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:48.920]   You can add a laser engraved message as well as getting a custom image print on this thing,
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:51.200]   which is really, really nice.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.200]   Tracker also just introduced the tracker Atlas, which works not only with trackers but all
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:50:01.240]   Bluetooth trackers to pinpoint your item on a customizable floor plan of your house.
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:04.560]   So now you not only know it's in your house, you know which seat cushion it's behind.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:09.680]   You just ask where the tracker Atlas where your item is and you get the answer, no need
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.940]   to search.
[00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:13.240]   You'll never lose a thing again.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:19.960]   In fact, the hardest thing you'll ever have to find is their website, T-H-E-T-R-A-C-K-R.com.
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:26.840]   You see the missing E, T-H-E-T-R-A-C-K, the track R.com.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.800]   And if you want a good deal, just use the offer code MAC break, you get 30% off your
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.480]   entire order.
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:35.640]   So get some custom printing and all that stuff.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:41.200]   Get just slowed up on them and get 30% off with the offer code MAC break.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:45.520]   Thetracker.com promo code MAC break, we thank them so much for their support and for helping
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:47.120]   me not lose my keys.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.280]   I haven't lost my keys since I have had the tracker on them.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:53.520]   It's very, very nice.
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:51:00.400]   How many products in tech have sold 1 billion items?
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:07.240]   Took the computer industry 25 years to ship the billionth PC.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:11.680]   Android has passed a billion devices but not just one manufacturer.
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:15.440]   It's one manufacturer apart that's impressive.
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.440]   Really impressive.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:19.440]   Diode.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:20.440]   Diode's.
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:21.440]   Diode's.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:22.440]   Diode's.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:23.440]   You know what's cool?
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.880]   A billion iPhones.
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.160]   And I think it's kind of cool.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:32.320]   Also, Steven Sinofsky, the guy behind Windows 8, former Microsoft employee, tweeted, "Getting
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.680]   to 1 billion cumulative.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:39.480]   The iPhone 9.1 years, the PC 20 years, Android 4.5 years, McDonald's took 23 years to get
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:44.520]   to a billion hamburgers, Facebook to 8.7 years to get to a billion users."
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:48.280]   Well, and also, I think the Facebook and McDonald's are an equal thing.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:52.000]   But when you talk about the personal computer, these are different manufacturers with different
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.360]   backgrounds and so on and so forth.
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:56.160]   So, you know, iPhone is, I think, very different than the PC.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.880]   And it costs a lot more than a big mess.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:00.640]   And if you combine iPhone and Android, it's 2 billion really fast.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:02.640]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.080]   I mean, the world has changed because of portable pocket computers.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.080]   Everybody has it.
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:08.080]   I think that's the impressive stat.
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:11.480]   If you look at computers versus handsets, handsets are obliterating everything.
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:15.720]   And you really think about the timing of things, you know, whether things were really ready
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:16.720]   to happen.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:19.920]   I mean, obviously the Newton was out there and it could have done the same thing over
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:24.520]   time, but just the technology wasn't there, the infrastructure or the ecosystem wasn't
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:28.400]   ready for that kind of screen at that time.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:31.600]   So it really also was timing is everything.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:37.920]   If you, and you can tell this is true because it's from Wolfram Alpha, stacked all the iPhones
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:38.920]   flat.
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:43.160]   You can take you to the moon.
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:44.720]   It would take you to this personally.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:45.720]   You can believe it.
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:46.720]   Did he really?
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:47.720]   Does Steven do this?
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:49.360]   No, I don't know.
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:50.360]   It's sold enough iPhones.
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:54.000]   If stack flat, they would go from the earth to the ISS nine times.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.320]   I don't know why they picked the ISS.
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:59.680]   But the question is when they say nine times, are they calculating the different width of
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:00.680]   each iPhone?
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.760]   No, they're averaging seven and a half millimeters.
[00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:03.760]   Okay.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.480]   Times a billion sales amounts.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:09.960]   So it would be, I think that the accuracy is--
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.960]   It's fudgey math.
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:17.000]   I guess I could turn it into the moon by just changing this calculation here.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.080]   It wouldn't be so hard.
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.600]   It doesn't go probably to the moon.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.600]   That's why.
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:23.600]   Maybe you can get them close.
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.600]   Maybe you can get them close.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.880]   And besides, if you had a stack of iPhones going to the moon, what would keep them from
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:30.480]   falling over?
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.480]   You and your physics report.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:37.080]   Of course.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:41.880]   So we heard from Evleaks, who is, as you mentioned last week, notorious more for Android leaks
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:47.080]   than iPhone leaks that we were going to be able to get our iPhone seven or whatever they
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.680]   call it by September 16th.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:55.640]   He's now saying pre-orders could begin on the ninth.
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:58.400]   Confirmed, Evleaks tweets.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:03.480]   Pre-orders start on the ninth, you can extrapolate the launch event from there.
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:06.000]   Evan deserves all the credit in the world for his previous leaks, but it's only confirmed
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.880]   when Apple announces it because it's July.
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.640]   And while there's a rough plan for this, things change.
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:14.560]   We saw that last year when there was a three-week instead of a two-week gap between delivery
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:15.560]   and event.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:20.440]   So I don't even think this is credible because what pre-orders typically are the Friday after
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:21.440]   the announcement.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:24.680]   You used the last couple of years, yeah.
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:25.680]   I have to say--
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:26.680]   Go ahead.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:31.240]   The announcement is like the day after Labor Day.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:35.520]   The event is usually the twos-- more often than not the Tuesday and they become available
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.720]   either-- not that Friday, but the Friday after.
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.120]   Although last year it was two Fridays after.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.120]   Well, this is not then.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:46.120]   You'd have to announce it in this month to make that work because the ninth, you'd
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.120]   have to go back to August 31st.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.720]   I don't know.
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:50.720]   Who cares?
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.480]   Any credible rumors?
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.720]   Are they going to remove the headphone jack really?
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:55:02.000]   It's starting to look like at least one device in the line will not have a headphone jack.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   No.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:08.760]   The gravity has now shifted such that I will be more surprised if I do not see at least
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:12.640]   one phone that does not have a headphone jack on it.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:15.880]   And if Apple does two phones one with and one without, are they going to use that as
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:17.960]   a referendum for the headphone jack?
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:21.320]   Well, it'll be more complicated than that because do you want the big fancy camera but
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:23.880]   then you don't have the-- I mean, Apple choices are never, never easy.
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:26.440]   Like I really want the fancy camera but I kind of like the headphone jack would have
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.000]   to pick one of these two things.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.680]   I mean, look, compare that to, again, back to the Galaxy Note.
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:37.320]   The difference between the Galaxy Note 7 and the Galaxy Edge 7 is pretty much nil.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:42.240]   Has the same memories, same CPU, same camera front and back.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.200]   There's that extra scanner but pretty much you can just choose.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.240]   Do I want a larger phone or a smaller phone?
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:48.240]   Do I want a stylist?
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.240]   Do I not have a stylist?
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.240]   And that's your decision.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:53.120]   You're not forced to-- if you want optical image stabilization, you don't have to go
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:56.440]   for the larger device just to get that.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:02.680]   And I hope that if they do go for that route, they will do it the way they did the MacBook
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:06.920]   Nothing which is that we're just going to simply add a phone to the line that does not
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:11.040]   have this feature because we think that that's going to be the future but we acknowledge
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:15.400]   that if we just simply cast everybody a drift at once, that's when people start realizing
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:19.880]   they can buy great Android phones for $450 and we don't want to make people do that.
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:23.400]   But if you want this future-thinking phone with this fancy camera and all these other
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:26.560]   bells and whistles, then maybe you're the person who's ready for wireless.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:27.560]   Right, exactly.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:32.040]   I think especially in the Apple world, there are a lot of people that are willing to-- there
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:36.160]   are early believers, more than early adopters, where they're saying that, you know what,
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.840]   this is the right attitude.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:42.240]   I kind of like the idea of being the first people who don't have headphone jacks in our
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.880]   phones and they'll get over it very, very quickly.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:47.560]   Do most people use wireless headphones?
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.560]   No.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:49.560]   No.
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:54.840]   I'll say this, that for the past six months, I have been paying super, super close attention
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:58.240]   to how people using phones in public.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:03.200]   I'm always one of those snoops on the subway car or in an office or in an on a college
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:06.440]   that's trying to get a look at what kind of computer are you using, how are you using
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:07.760]   it.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:11.520]   And I was specifically trying to figure out, has there been this exodus away from wired
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:13.360]   headphones that I haven't seen yet?
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:17.880]   And just two or three weeks ago, I was in Boston almost specifically, they were five hours
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:23.840]   early before a dinner date, just to hang out at public areas and look.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:30.280]   And I was seeing-- I think I saw three wireless headphones until about 5 p.m.
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:35.600]   compared to-- I think I lost-- I stopped counting wired headphones at 100 and something.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:39.800]   And the only time I saw-- I started seeing any volume was when I was intentionally in
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:43.600]   the financial district, positioning myself at the place between where everybody leaves
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:46.840]   their offices and runs to South Station to get their trains home.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:50.960]   And then I saw maybe another dozen compared to so many wired headphones that couldn't
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:51.960]   count.
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:54.800]   Well, I think that's part of the-- I'm absolutely convinced that if there-- everybody thinks
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:58.800]   that there is a-- that wired headphones are not what people are using and people don't
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:02.800]   rely on them and they're on their way out, they've got to come up with better data than
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:03.800]   that.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.960]   Well, I think that Apple has to-- to make this work, if they're really going to push wireless
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:11.480]   and not a lightning-based headphone system, which I think the probably-- you know, the
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:16.280]   lightning-based one is probably more likely as far as-- or they'll have that available.
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:19.360]   If they're going to go wireless, I think that Apple is going to have to-- they're going
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:24.440]   to have to release a better version of Bluetooth, a bunch of partners to do that.
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:28.440]   There are more refined versions of Bluetooth than what's out there right now.
[00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:31.440]   No, I mean, I'm saying that there is Bluetooth that Apple's not using right now.
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:35.240]   Yeah, there's A2DP, which is stereo, but there's a higher quality Bluetooth that's
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.240]   not--
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:41.960]   We use Bluetooth with some of our wireless transceivers that goes a lot farther.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:43.600]   It is a lot more powerful.
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:45.600]   It is a lot more reliable.
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.360]   That's not being used in the headsets right now.
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:48.360]   And so there are--
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:49.720]   My new headphones just for that, though, right?
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:50.720]   I mean, you--
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.760]   They might need to, but I think that that's the argument that Apple's going to have to
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:56.920]   make, because the reason no one's using the wireless is because of all the clicking,
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:57.920]   all the breakup, all the--
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:58.920]   Right.
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:02.960]   You know, all of us got to wireless-- I probably bought five or six wireless headsets thinking
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:05.440]   this is going to be the one that works, and it never does.
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:10.720]   And so, you know, a reliable-- I mean, I would love to go wireless if I felt like it was
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:13.280]   going to work as well as wired.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:14.280]   And it just--
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:15.280]   You never--
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:18.280]   So, you know, you can't separate it from those and you both wireless?
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:20.280]   The QC-- the QC7s are there?
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:23.280]   QC something, yeah.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.360]   You know, it's funny because I interviewed yesterday David Hennemire Hanson, the creator
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:28.680]   of Ruby on Rails, and we act-- I don't know how we got on this subject, but we were talking
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:33.200]   about this, and he says, "Don't-- everybody-- this is great.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.840]   Everybody should go to wireless headphones."
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:38.320]   He says, "Once I started using those Bose headphones, I never looked back to-- I never--
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:41.680]   I-- all the think of all the years I spent untangling headphone wires."
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:42.920]   He says, "You got to do this.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:43.920]   This is the future.
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:46.040]   It's what happened with CDs.
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:48.080]   It's what's happened with floppies.
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.080]   This is the future."
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:50.560]   Here's a video, by the way, and I don't know.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:54.960]   This is another one of those weird leak videos of what purports to be--
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.600]   What do I mean, "Demlineful"?
[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:58.040]   I don't even know what language this is.
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.280]   I think it's Vietnamese, yeah.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:04.280]   The purports to be the new headphone-- lightning headphone adapter.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:09.080]   It's short, just a couple of inches, and has lightning on one end, of course, and a mini
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.920]   jack on the other.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:13.520]   I don't know why he's taken--
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.160]   That's why I accidentally don't use it.
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:18.400]   This is a simulation of what the iPhone 7 looks like.
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:20.920]   He's taping over his headphones.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.920]   It's all over the tape.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.920]   It might be different in the shipping product.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.420]   Yeah.
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:31.720]   No more headphones, and now he pulls out-- apparently, this is the adapter.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:36.160]   It does look very appily if it's a good fake, if it's a fake.
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.640]   I mean, who knows?
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:42.560]   And the rumor would be that they would ship this with whatever this new iPhone is, yes?
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.680]   They haven't put an adapter in the-- I can't think of a ton of it ever actually included
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.640]   the adapters, usually like a $20 extra.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:48.640]   Well, I just hope--
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.520]   I just hope the first time they have to.
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:55.840]   I was about to say, but the first iPhone, they required a dongle for just to make a bit
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.200]   of that recess, but they didn't include that.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.480]   They included special headphones.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:02.760]   I do-- actually, what Alex said is something I hadn't really considered before is let's
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:07.600]   say that there is a new Bluetooth standard that does away with most of the inconvenient
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.000]   of Bluetooth.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:17.160]   And Apple can say, we are the first to adopt this industry-wide, non-proprietary standard
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:22.760]   as both a way of enhancing the user experience and also pushing the standard forward.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:29.080]   That's a little bit of a BSE sort of thing, but you could get away with it.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.680]   All I'm thinking about is I'm not talking about clicking and buzzing.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.440]   I'm not thinking about audio quality.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.360]   I'm thinking about every time I go off on my bike three or four times a week, I have
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:42.320]   this little tiny, cheap little eBay Bluetooth speaker so I can listen to podcasts that's
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.960]   mounted under my handlebars.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:50.240]   And one out of every five times I wind up going up from my ride without any audio whatsoever
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.800]   because for some reason, it would not connect.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:56.280]   It would not-- I can see it, but it's not connecting to it as an audio device.
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.880]   And this happens with iOS devices.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.120]   It happens with Android devices.
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.720]   And it's just too much trouble to-- I don't want to spend five minutes in my driveway
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:08.400]   debugging a problem, whereas if I had wired headphones, you plug it in, it works.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.680]   You unplug it, it stops working.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.560]   You plug it in, it works again.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:17.200]   And so as I said, I'm-- I'm-- I hope Apple doesn't screw this.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.960]   I'm just saying I hope Apple doesn't screw this up.
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:24.440]   Well, I mean, the other-- the other possibilities, of course, Apple wouldn't use necessarily
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.360]   an industry standard that they would use their own--
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.360]   And which case--
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:31.160]   Their own special standard that is going to be higher quality and easier to use and
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.160]   it's easier to pair.
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.720]   And of course, Apple would worry about adoption except for the fact that they own a headphone
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:36.720]   company.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.520]   So it wouldn't hurt Apple too.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:39.520]   It could fall back.
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.840]   It could fall back to Bluetooth.
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.480]   How much of this is because they own Beats?
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.480]   They would do that.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.480]   You should make fun of them.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.000]   We should be absolutely merciless and make fun of them because--
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.480]   Well, I think if they-- if they say it properly, that's a company that deserves to be taken
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.480]   down a peg.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:53.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.040]   If they do it properly and they say, you know, we'd love to use Bluetooth, but we have this
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.040]   and this problem with it.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:01.240]   So these use a special point-to-point Wi-Fi high band connection.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:06.280]   And if it can't detect that, it just defaults back to Bluetooth 4.5 or 5.0, whatever they
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.680]   want to use for that.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.720]   So it works great with everything, but it works super extra great if you have the brand
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.600]   new iPhone.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:14.600]   Very interesting to see.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.400]   Super extra great trademark.
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:21.080]   I know we will be watching with interest on September 2nd, 9th, August 31st or whatever
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.080]   day they do this.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.160]   And I think that there's interesting, you know, like I would love to have, you know, kind
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:28.040]   of a-- for a lot of productions and so on and so forth that we're doing.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:31.200]   I'd love to have something that I just have in my ear all the time that is-- that is this
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.200]   omni-present.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.200]   I hear things.
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.760]   I talk-- I ask questions.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:38.360]   I do all those other things that happens to use my phone as an interconnect, you know,
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.360]   for that.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.760]   And I think that is a possible future that Apple is kind of going down.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.840]   I think a lot of people are going down.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:48.000]   And so-- but it-- you know, we have-- we now have in-ear translation tools.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.800]   We have, you know, things that are connected to searches, all of those things.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:56.000]   But I think this kind of augmented-- we talk about augmented reality with our eyes, but
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.880]   I think an augmented reality where you have hearing aids that are essentially providing
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.520]   a lot of extra data, I think is probably not that far away.
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:07.080]   And this could be something-- it may not be what they're announcing in September, but
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.480]   I wouldn't be surprised if that's the direction that they're going to--
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:17.720]   I can listen to my iPhone on my hearing aids, my Starkey halos.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:21.920]   The problem is hearing aids, audio quality is terrible because it's just designed to
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:23.600]   amplify voice.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:26.480]   So it's not full spectrum by any means.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:31.960]   And really, they favor hiddenness over quality.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:36.440]   So this really tiny little speaker that comes back to the part in the behind your ear.
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:39.760]   Rich Stevens had a great comic on I'm Worse Today when he was saying, "I just-- I can't
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.600]   take people talking about this headphone jack anymore."
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.080]   And they're saying, "What are you complaining about now?"
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:46.600]   And you just see everybody using their iPhone with the speaker up because they don't have
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:47.600]   headphones on the work with it.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.960]   And they're just walking around listening to all their podcasts and Amazon books.
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:53.520]   I totally can see there's happening.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:58.840]   There was a funny Joya tech a couple months ago.
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.480]   I don't think it was a Diesel Suite.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:05.480]   I think it was a Joya tech, which he said, "There was some sort of consumer complaint
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.640]   about a feature that the iPhone doesn't have."
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.600]   And so, "Well, this is what the iPhone would look like if I had everything that all the
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:14.560]   users wanted and it says, "We're microfiche reader and it's got a satellite linked to
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:15.560]   this."
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:20.200]   And if I had any talent for drawing, I would have put a response cartoon.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:24.400]   Here's what the iPhone 7 would look like if Apple had to compete with other people making
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:29.720]   iOS devices and would just be an iPhone that, when Arrow was saying, "A damn headphone jack."
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:30.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:33.960]   We're in local instances of these cars.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:34.960]   Yeah.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.360]   Well, maybe the time will come with it.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.360]   I'll be nostalgic.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:43.840]   Well, you know, and I still think of Andy when we talk about this because Andy was so
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:47.960]   adamant that we were going to be upset about the Ethernet cable being taken out of our laptops
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:48.960]   and he was right.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.800]   I mean, I have to use that all the time and I'm always like, "Oh, right."
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:52.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.560]   You were the one who really railed against that.
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.560]   You're one of the few.
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:58.560]   I'm not going to need an Ethernet jack.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:03.760]   But it was specifically because it wasn't like the MacBook Air where they made it so
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:06.880]   thin that you could incredibly put one in there and so you're getting something in return
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:07.880]   for it.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:13.400]   It was, you basically made the MacBook Pro maybe one millimeter too thin to accept an
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:14.400]   Ethernet jack.
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:20.320]   And even then the Pixel has this little like foldy one that you can use that is the same
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.320]   thickness.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:25.200]   It's okay to take a feature away, but I think that you need to explain to me how that is
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.920]   a consumer positive feature.
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:28.680]   What are you taking something from me?
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.840]   What are you giving me in return?
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:34.960]   And if it's not something that's important to me and you have taken away something that
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.360]   defines for me the convenience of your product, you run a really big risk that I'm not going
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:40.920]   to buy the next version of your product.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:44.960]   Oh, and the problem is that it is what 90% of people use 90% of the time.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.720]   90% of people we know don't even like I work in offices now.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:52.160]   We go to do productions in offices that they I'm like, so do we have a hard line connection
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.160]   there?
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.160]   What's a hard line?
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.160]   Nobody even knows.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.160]   Or computers and we're connected to the Internet.
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:59.920]   And so it's it can be very you know that literally there won't be one in the whole office
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:00.920]   anymore.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:01.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:02.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:03.920]   Let's see.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:09.760]   Titan project Titan has a new big Bob is back baby new leader Bob Mansfield.
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.240]   He's found something he wants to do.
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:18.880]   Although the rumors now are that maybe Apple is not going to build a car, but build the
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.880]   software in.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:21.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:24.920]   These are these are really weirdly reported stories.
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:25.920]   Yeah, you can't.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.280]   It's just a really that would be very difficult.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:31.800]   So like the one couple of things with this one is that Mansfield did step back from his
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:36.120]   role as head of hardware engineering at Apple and he was replaced by Dan Riccio and then
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:40.880]   Johnny Saruji sort of split off the platform technologies group, which does all the silicon
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.760]   and all the internal stuff.
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.640]   But Bob has been around like if you talk to people at Apple, they see him.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:47.640]   It's not he's not been a stranger and he's been working.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:48.800]   He helped work on the Apple Watch.
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.840]   So he's by no means stepped away from Apple is now stepping back.
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:55.280]   The big thing here is that Apple tends to put a senior vice president in charge of everything
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:58.920]   like Jeff Williams is technically in charge of Apple Watch, but there's a lot of other
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:02.120]   people, including Johnny I very involved in that project.
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:05.320]   And Dan Riccio was in charge of Apple car, but he's also in charge of every iPhone, every
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:10.960]   iPad, every Mac and putting Bob Mansfield there as you have somebody who very literally
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.400]   is a legend in his field.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:16.680]   He launched the iMac, the iPhone, the iPad and you're making this his basically his one
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.680]   job.
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:21.960]   And I think that is just a huge win for everybody because it means that Riccio can focus on
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.680]   all the other products he's already shipping.
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:29.280]   Mansfield has a singular focus, which is project Titan and everybody there gets the benefit
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:32.400]   of his enormous experience.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:35.880]   And it always involves self driving software, it's just the degree of which it's self driving
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:40.600]   and when that's the issue because as we know self driving is great until anything unanticipated.
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:45.440]   Like maybe a snowstorm happens and then you've got to sort of understand what self driving
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.520]   really means.
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:51.320]   And also it's so far out that there's a lot of time for Apple to sort of explore the space
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.360]   and it's what they're doing in the meantime, how they're how they're doing everything from
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:56.920]   the software stack up that I think is super important.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:02.360]   Yeah, it's a really interesting thing is everyone assumes self driving car.
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:07.320]   But in truth, you're talking about situations where you can create whatever business you
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:08.320]   want to right now.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.040]   It's not even necessarily I think it would be a very smart thing to try to work on the
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:16.760]   software that can become part of a standard that every modern car in the next 20 years
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:18.480]   is going to be based upon.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:22.680]   But it could also be something as simple as we are going to work on the software that
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:27.240]   a government or a city would buy in order to coordinate traffic and observe traffic and
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:33.600]   figure out how to route traffic through through cities or even analytical software that can
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:37.520]   take real time data and figure out this is the next bridge that needs to be fixed.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:41.960]   This is the next road that should be improved or this is the new this is where we should
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:47.200]   probably be considering adding more capacity to to our transit system.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:51.320]   There's a there's a smart cities initiative from the Department of Transportation that's
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:52.320]   getting a lot of traction.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:56.360]   There's so much you could do with by just putting lots of sensors on the road and then
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:59.160]   figuring out what those sensors are telling you.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:04.640]   So there's just because a company is putting billions of dollars into automotive stuff
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:07.640]   and transportation doesn't necessarily mean they're building a car.
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:12.560]   It could be that they are thinking a little bit more abstract and therefore really looking
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:16.000]   for a situation where they can basically get eight cents out of every dollar that's being
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.920]   spent by every government and every consumer of the next 20 years.
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:23.920]   And my thing has been look at the iPhone look at the Apple post iPhone and we've gotten
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.800]   the focus on security on privacy.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:29.160]   We've gotten sandboxing and no matter how you feel about them there's been several.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.600]   The iPhone is greatly influenced how Apple perceives a computer and that's propagated
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:36.960]   across their entire lineup and that was a product that was built under lockdown inside
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:40.440]   Infinite Loop and now you have this product that's being done across town and that has
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:44.080]   five or six years of incubation ahead of it or whatever the timeline is three five whatever
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:48.000]   the timeline is and how will that affect Apple for the next 10 years and that you know that's
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.840]   a big question because the Mac was certainly 10 years the iPhone is probably going to be
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:52.840]   10 years.
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.600]   There's got to be something that picks that up next and I think this is a huge opportunity
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.960]   if they take it sort of figure out what Apple culture and technology will be for the next
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:00.760]   decade.
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:03.600]   They just hired Dan Dodge from Blackberry.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:09.520]   He was the guy CEO at Q and X with a real time operating system and this is also going
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.840]   to be about the car right.
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:15.640]   So many infotainment systems I mean when you when you do early Android Auto and I and Car
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:19.680]   Play that was all living on top of Q and X and Q and X was super agile and getting that
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.520]   deployed and nuclear submarines power plants.
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:26.560]   It's just that is what a lot of the stuff has been built on and there's a huge amount
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.760]   of expertise in Apple.
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:31.160]   I mean so secret of Blackberry is not what they used to be so there's a lot of really
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:36.160]   talented embedded systems engineers out there that are looking to do great things.
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:41.200]   Yeah I'd be pretty excited if this represented not Apple making another luxury consumer product
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:48.400]   that looks really cool but if it really it would be a sign of their next level of maturity
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:52.440]   that they are now moving into something that is completely abstract software that consumers
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:58.120]   don't even touch but nonetheless that will improve consumers lives greatly.
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:05.400]   It's I think Apple's goal could be or maybe even should be we want to make sure that in
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:10.640]   10 years time we are not just simply a maker of phones or a maker of cool hardware devices.
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:15.080]   I think they're smart enough to realize that there is a long long list of companies that
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:20.080]   basically cut their lunch eat and because they were they were reliant on the hardware
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:24.880]   bits that they make that are really insanely popular being insanely popular for the next
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:25.880]   10 years.
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:30.400]   There's like a lot of there are a lot of severed heads on a lot of pikes on that road.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:33.880]   I mean there's there's a time where if you thought that what if no will Nokia ever be
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:38.040]   on the ropes no no never Blackberry oh for heaven's sakes they're actually they're actually
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.400]   songs about people using their Blackberry.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:46.160]   So if they were to have that sort of diversity not the sort of thing that distracts their
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.440]   attention because there will always be I think by nature a very focused company but if their
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:56.440]   vision were to expand to say that we're not necessarily going to be a producer of things
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:02.160]   that have chamfered edges and a girl of glass version eight on it that we can basically
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:06.160]   change the world and improve people's lives just by pushing electrons around I think that
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.280]   would be a really great move for the I must be getting old because it just doesn't feel
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.040]   like the apple I knew.
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:15.440]   The apple I knew was a computer company oh by the way and I'm good article Renee on where
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:23.760]   are the new apple computers I've got the answer the new apple computer is here.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:29.840]   Just when you think you know what a computer is you see a keyboard that can just get out
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:39.880]   of the way and a screen you can touch I like this commercial lot and even right on.
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:43.800]   They're just telling the story of iPad again I'll be super happy yeah just make you wonder
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:49.520]   hey what else can it do imagine what your computer could do if your computer where an
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:54.040]   iPad was they say was the bad grammar were an iPad pro.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:57.160]   I think the thing with this though is that they control the whole stack here so they
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.840]   I mean the iPad pro there were there was some different timing and getting it to market
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.480]   and the smaller one came out after the big one but they're relatively in charge that
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:08.520]   are on destiny there where with the max there's so many other companies involved that it can
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.880]   fall apart a lot faster.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:16.240]   Does it mean that they want you to think of the iPad as a Macintosh computer and forget
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:18.960]   those other silly computers.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.480]   No it still doesn't make Mac's computer.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.400]   You put it as a computer.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.800]   It's not a computer not their computer not the computer.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:32.240]   There's still I my iPad pro is my out of the office computer and it's almost 100% of the
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:36.520]   time and I still range a lot of people who are surprised I'm using an iPad as a computer
[01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:42.600]   because their own internal definition of an iPad is that it's one of them book reading
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:47.480]   website thinking devices as opposed to no no I run real software on it I get a full
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.160]   days work done on it.
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:55.920]   So they've the I like the way that the that that ad is positioned not boldly say oh we've
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:00.720]   we've created a brand new revolution and personal computing they're saying why don't you think
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:05.000]   think about what a computer is exactly think about what you do with it think maybe you
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.280]   realize that if you're spending a thousand dollars on a on a tablet it doesn't necessarily
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:15.400]   have to run an operating system that you recognize that it is what we were talking about this
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:21.240]   just earlier earlier today about how it hardware really isn't hardware hardware is the apps
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:26.040]   and the services that you run on it and now there's so many services even Microsoft office
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:31.120]   that have abstracted themselves to run on pretty much any device you care to run it on that
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:34.920]   you have so many options now you could I could if I were if I were
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:39.200]   precious about these things I could basically do a whole days work on on a phone screen
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:44.960]   today but I like but I like to be able to watch Hulu and I'm an old man I'm gonna go
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:52.640]   down in my go to my grave with a buckling keys keyboard and a 40 inch monitor and a
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:57.360]   quad core processor and 32 gigs of RAM if there was no Sierra this year Leo then you
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:00.840]   could start being a start about Mac but as long as Apple is construed like they have their
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:05.760]   resources are scarce and they would move people off that project so fast so next year if there's
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.160]   no you know OS 10 10.13 or whatever well they're not gonna do that till they're really ready
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:14.440]   to pull the trigger doesn't mean that they're not planning on pulling the trigger yeah I think
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:18.840]   it I think it was I think it was 11 they're merged you know like I think that it's it is
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:23.520]   I think that's the direction that we're we'll see we'll see how it goes but I think that
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:27.760]   that's the direction that this is this is definitely going and I see myself I mean even
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:33.040]   when we look at how we use the computer I still use my laptop probably the most but I see more
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.760]   and more of the stuff that I do either something I'll do in my iPad or something that I want
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:42.760]   computers that that neither my Mac Pro or my laptop fulfill on you know like so you know
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:45.800]   a lot of our stuff you know our heavy duty or stuff is all moving to Linux because we
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:51.240]   just I need multiple GPUs and you know lots of other things and so you know and I don't
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:55.440]   have any expectation that Apple is gonna do any heavy lifting you know and so so I think
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:58.400]   that we're gonna continue to see that merger and I think that it makes sense from a business
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:03.360]   perspective I think a lot of us will feel bad when it happens I just made a Linux Mac
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:09.760]   book I took the I didn't use a Mac book I use the HP that really thin HP elite and put
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:15.440]   Linux on it and it's about the perfect it's it's like is it's like a MacBook but not with
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:22.520]   OS 10 on it and I feel like I don't know I feel like Apple doesn't want to be in that
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:26.400]   business particularly look at look at how they're doing things now like they previously they
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.880]   just bought next and that was their solution for going the next 10 years forward and now
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:32.800]   they're they're swapping things out they're not doing all we're gonna rip and replace
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.160]   we're gonna get a whole new system it's suddenly a swift and swift runs on iOS and OS 10 and
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:40.760]   now it's Apple file system and that's gonna work great on Mac's and it's gonna work great
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:44.400]   so I think it'll be a hybrid at least until they do make the next big jump and they're
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:50.280]   gonna have an arm and we talked about arm last time arm is next part of this move to right
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:53.320]   but I think they're firmly committed to having different presentation layers like whether
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:57.760]   the underlying things become very close you know 99.9% the same DNA they still seem very
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:01.720]   adamant that the the needs of someone using a traditional computer are slightly different
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:06.600]   and deserve you know surface sorry surface in that area I agree a hundred percent with
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:12.520]   Renee that's this absolutely how I feel about it I think that we I again I have I can afford
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:18.960]   to have a $2,000 notebook and a $1,000 tablet that can do my work for me most people they
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:22.680]   have if they're lucky they got five or six hundred bucks for a notebook that they might
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:26.560]   have to share with a family member and so I don't think it's gonna be practical to move
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:32.560]   everybody towards a system that is not good keyboard attached to a good screen and a really
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:37.320]   good internet connection that could run sort of real apps however I think that Apple's
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:42.320]   plan the more they the more they announce it every WWDC the more I think that their their
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:48.360]   plan is not necessarily to merge the two platforms but to keep stealing good ideas from each one
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:55.480]   of them so that's why we see that Apple that that the next version of a Mac OS has a lot
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:19:00.960]   of iOS features like picture in picture that here's the way that this is gonna deal with
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:06.760]   video pretty much the same way that we can deal with it in iOS here's how iOS handled
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:11.360]   having multiple apps on the screen at one time it's similar to having the way that the
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:17.680]   Mac OS can can manage multiple windows automatically by basically putting them into tiles I think
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:22.720]   there's and as Renee said it's it's not an accident that they chose to have one file
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:27.320]   system and it's a similar security layer that's gonna work on everything with an Apple
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:32.200]   logo on it from now on it's not necessarily because they want one operating system for
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:37.480]   everything but they want to make sure that if you once you if you if you I think I think
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:41.760]   it was designed to manipulate people like me into doing the things that I'm actually doing
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:47.560]   which is to say that if you have if you if you have a nice desktop computer why not consider
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:52.360]   having a Mac mini as your laptop instead of buying if you don't have a thousand dollars
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:56.880]   to spend or $1300 to spend at a Macbook or Macbook Air why don't you consider buying
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:02.520]   a $500 iPad Air iPad mini instead because it will do it will be a consistent experience
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:07.240]   you'll find that you'll have file compatibility from one to another and you'll all be in the
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:10.640]   family you'll find that it works in a very very comfortable way I don't necessarily think
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:15.000]   there's one way that works better than the other because the time that I spent with the
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.760]   latest Microsoft Surface Pro got me thinking that geez this if this ran Mac OS this would
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:26.080]   no question be my next my next laptops I think it works exceptionally well but I think that
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:29.440]   Apple is pursuing that in a way that they don't it doesn't feel like they're being left
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:33.160]   behind it just feels like they have a different point of view on making sure that you have
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:36.640]   the right device for the right person well I think also it's generational I think that
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:41.720]   you know my kids have iPads I'm not I would never give them a laptop I was just like never
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:45.280]   give my computer a laptop I mean you know they they're coding they're doing all kinds
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:49.280]   of stuff they're typing away there you know they so I mean they're you know they're doing
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:54.800]   all those things on there on their iPad I don't you know I would they don't feel like
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:57.880]   there's anything missing other than when they go to my laptop they touch my screen and
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:02.880]   they're still very young wait till they're in ninth grade and tell me that okay I guess
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:06.120]   I think by the time they're ninth grade they would never I mean unless they get really
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.920]   geeky and decide to build stuff and want to tie it in but even then I think they're
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:12.760]   gonna have interfaces I think by the time they're ninth grade we're not gonna be having
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:17.520]   a yeah but that's that's an excellent point if they a lot of people who including people
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:21.960]   at Apple consistently point out how we've tried having touch screens on max and people
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:27.400]   don't like having to do this with their hands all the time that is crazy talk and I'm saying
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:32.840]   I'm sure that they have video and they have test results but nonetheless people are doing
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:37.080]   this all the time because it's second nature they're they're they're expecting they they
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:40.800]   you know if they've been using their phone for three or four hours I do it too like I'm
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:44.880]   on my iPad I come home I unpack I come here with my desk and I'm just reaching out to
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:50.280]   touch something on my screen I've I always actually just my iPad Pro I thought that I
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:55.440]   thought that I find I am using it on the sofa all the time I have a little easel that I
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:00.320]   have on my on my lap to keep it up at the right angle and I don't think anything about spending
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:04.680]   like three or four hours like actually doing email on this thing and so I feel as though
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:09.280]   if you don't watch how people are using their machines you don't you miss out on some wonderful
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:14.520]   lessons on what people are actually wanting from these things well I do but yeah the thing
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:18.280]   that pulls is pulling me more and more to my iPad is slack because people slack me pictures
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:21.880]   that I want to annotate and they would it's why I want to annotate it and then I'm like
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:27.120]   oh and I close my laptop and open up my iPad open it up jump into something draw on it
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.760]   like this is what I want and don't want and then send it back to them over it and I'm
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:34.800]   just like it's way easier to do that on on my on my iPad than it is on my on my laptop
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:39.080]   and that is the you know the hand I have in the touch screen I don't think I mean I'll
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:43.920]   buy a couple more but I am I'm front every time an app a Mac book comes out without a
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:51.760]   touch screen I'll say I'll say this I am I am actually more excited about the range of
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:55.840]   Chromebooks touchscreen Chromebooks that are becoming this they're coming out the next
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:00.440]   three months that are designed to run to work really well when they when the Google Play
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:05.200]   Store is available for for Chromebooks then I am about the next Mac book so I'm not expecting
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:10.880]   anything particularly revolutionary or particularly epic changing about the new Mac book but the
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:15.680]   idea of having a three hundred dollar notebook that is credibly can credibly can handle everything
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:20.200]   that you would want a notebook for and it's not a piece of junk that you're going to throw
[01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:25.720]   away after after six or seven months that's a huge deal I'm really excited by that prospect
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:31.000]   I can I guess I can acknowledge that I'm just purely nostalgic yeah and there's a desktop
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:36.360]   computing and well there's still things that are that are easier I mean you know it Photoshop
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:40.080]   the Photoshop experience there's a lot of you think out there but the Photoshop is not
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:44.240]   most people nowadays everything they want to do this is another thing we're talking about
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:49.920]   with David Heinemer Hanson yesterday on triangulation they do in the browser and and really if you
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:56.240]   have a browser for most people that's all you need yeah and there and I can I can start
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:59.640]   and think yeah you're probably right Andy that you know the majority of people who aren't
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:06.160]   writing computer software they're not doing photo and video editing the tablet's fine that's
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:11.240]   all I need yeah and I also it's not just the sophistication of iOS it's that now we have
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:16.560]   developers who this isn't their first time on time at the rodeo this is their they've now
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:23.520]   had years of experience in thinking in terms of how to build a tablet app I have been I
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:31.120]   have so in love with Adobe Lightroom Photoshop Lightroom for for the iPad Pro so much so that
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:35.760]   I was a guy who would spend hours and hours and hours just on the desktop doing all my
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:40.160]   I see what thing photos and and now it's like I feel as though I really want to see I want
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:45.840]   to hold like an eight and eight by ten color glossy picture of this photo do all my selections
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:50.240]   I can do most of the adjustments that I want to do there and then at the last minute before
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:54.040]   I publish something I just basically walk over to this machine it's all been synced and I
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:57.880]   can do some I would agree with you do it Adobe's really on the right track because they have
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:02.520]   desktop light room and they have tablet light room they interoperate you have the same stuff
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:06.960]   on both and they're different they're different apps for these different platforms that really
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:10.520]   takes advantage of what you can do with an iPad Pro and you're right and sounds like Beyonce
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:18.140]   I mean their marketing is just on point yeah well yeah I mean I throw shade of Queen B
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:21.600]   Renee she is an American I'm not throwing it at the hands which is still my least favorite
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:28.080]   cost of a singer but the light room is a perfect example I think you're right of where you can
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:34.920]   use the strengths of each platform simultaneously of course you have to have a desktop and an
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:40.120]   iPad to do that but I think also the transition is easy like you can start on the desktop
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:44.040]   get your Adobe account everything yeah and then you I decided my next computer is going
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:48.240]   to be an iPad Pro and look I can download photo like Lightroom I can download Photoshop
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:53.120]   and all my stuff is still there Alex do you work that way with Lightroom I don't yeah I'm
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:57.600]   still the most of my photo stuff in Photoshop you're an old time I'm an old time I was you
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:01.960]   know obviously I spent a lot of time in aperture which turned out not me the best direction
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:05.640]   long term and so I got really good at that and I'm still in the process of slowly moving
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:11.680]   the entire library you know porting it all over and and to be honest with you I just
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:15.160]   I still just go back to Photoshop fix it fix things I'm probably going to move the Lightroom
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:18.400]   over the by the end of this year I'll probably have it all over there but they're not every
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:23.880]   workflow can adapt to that programming doesn't really you need a desktop to program I don't
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:28.520]   know I mean I I think that we'll be able to program on on our iPad pros I mean I don't
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:34.480]   think that's the type of like I don't I guess you use keyboard I have I have never been
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:39.960]   in the office of someone who codes for a living and seen fewer than two right you have multiple
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:44.480]   screens because really they yeah exactly it's it's not and also the the amount of CPU
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:48.880]   power that's required to build an app is pretty intensive the number of collaborative apps
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:54.120]   you need it's pretty hard I don't think we'll ever find ourselves in a place where you do
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:59.120]   there is no place for a conventional some sort of big screen some sort of physical keyboard
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:05.040]   some sort of pointing device interface but it's the case of finding out what it how why
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:11.680]   are you to what extent are you buying a new laptop because a laptop is the perfect solution
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:16.520]   to your needs and to what extent are you shopping for a new laptop because you always
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:20.880]   buy laptops you never considered maybe getting spending these even the same amount of money
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:27.080]   on a tablet instead I again if you told me when the iPad first came out that I would
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:32.360]   have my that the the most important device that I'm shopping for for my Macbook Pro is
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:37.320]   a really good Thunderbolt dock to make sure it's so like I can only plug one thing into
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:42.840]   it because it seems to be living on my desk if you told me that when this Macbook dies
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:48.400]   out by next purchase will probably be a Mac mini instead of a necessarily another Macbook
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:52.920]   I would have said you clearly don't understand what a professional journal like myself requires
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:59.000]   but I absolutely love I love it I even love the fact that I have both the 13 inch iPad
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:05.480]   and the NMA and iPad mini because they're again it there's no excuse now for me to leave
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:09.960]   the house without a really good workspace that I can do stuff with I'm so happy with
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:14.520]   my my investment in Apple hardware when it comes to what the iPad does I really think
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:18.120]   it's their most successful hardware platform right now and I include the iPhone in that
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:27.320]   well well it's victory no responses no I yeah I mean like it makes me a little sad but I think
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:30.760]   I have to acknowledge that's what that's what's going to be happening right this is where it's not
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:33.640]   that sad it's like it's the same thing because we're talking earlier about the change we're
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:38.680]   making at iMOR it's just in recognition that the early adopters the enthusiasts represent a very
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:42.840]   like we're very loud we're very vocal we're talking first we're talking often but computers
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:47.160]   have become to earlier point their mainstream they're commoditized and what 99% of people want
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:52.280]   to do is very different like they're just not opening up terminal they are playing Pokemon they are
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:57.000]   using docs or using web browsers and they're super happy and they need devices that fit those
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.720]   needs and that's going to be where most companies make most of their money and who they target
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:05.640]   most of those devices and we'll always have a you know we'll always have the stuff that we like
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:09.720]   but it's going to be very different than every one of us has brothers and sisters and mothers and
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:14.120]   fathers and kids and their their needs and their devices are going to be different well and we
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:18.280]   have argued for a long time that well apple will always make max because the developers will demand
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:24.120]   it there the people who use desktop computers but i i i think i could even see a world where apple
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:28.760]   doesn't make desktop computers and developers use uh you know linux or something and cross
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:33.080]   platform situation you know probably be even different than that is that we'll just have you
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.560]   know glass or whatever our or vr or something like we'll have endpoints and i hate to quote
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:41.240]   torsden heintz you know three or four years later because it's really weird but you know we'll just
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:45.560]   have these endpoints and these clouds and these little boxes and they'll it'll manifest the
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:49.400]   the environment that we need according to where we are at the time you saw we're talking
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:53.880]   about them anymore it's it's more than just ui we're talking about really there's also a
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:59.640]   philosophical difference there's no file system and no access to the file system on ios do we need
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:03.640]   a file system probably not that's actually what keeps me on matt on that keeps me away from the
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:07.880]   ipad for the things that i use it for as you need a file that is absolutely i need to be like fine
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:13.720]   so when i when i was using uh the uh surface pro as my daily driver uh that's the key difference
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:18.600]   that there's i i will happily take that with me for an entire week without having to think ahead
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:23.640]   or without having to plan anything we're asked with the ipad by first if i'm living for a week
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:28.360]   and i'm taking the ipad as my only thing my first question is okay let me take a look at my the
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:34.200]   NAS that's in my office and make sure that everything i could possibly need is on that NAS so i can use
[01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:39.480]   an ios app to get that file when i need it uh the number of dongles i have to take with me
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:44.280]   for just a day to make sure that if i need to access something i can do it is insane whereas
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:49.560]   again with the again with the with my it's just my simple little android phone i can simply plug
[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:54.600]   in a usb c card reader and i can see everything that's on that card i can struggle though right
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:59.400]   you've added to the difficulty of doing what you're doing it feels like to me well like we're all
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:04.520]   saying yeah you can do it on an ipad but it's just harder it seems to me maybe not there's there's
[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:08.760]   some things that are harder but i think the key difference if you're trying to use an ipad of any
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:14.200]   stripe as a primary computer during a trip it comes where you have to be able to predict what
[01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:18.760]   you're gonna need and prepare for that especially when it comes to file IO for other things however
[01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:23.800]   i love the fact that i can have two apps on the screen and window management is non-existence just
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:28.360]   simply understands that here is the primary app i'm dealing here's scrivener here is on the
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:33.560]   outliner on the side of it and i can go between the two very very easily and also have a surf
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:37.960]   a floating window that has the thing the youtube video that i shouldn't be watching but i actually
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:46.600]   am and also the rely i will also say the reliability of of an ios device just a mac os cannot compete
[01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:53.000]   with that i know that my my ipad is always just plain gonna work whereas the mac with on the mac
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.720]   it largely comes down to what was i doing yesterday and was it something that's gonna
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:03.480]   require me to shut down and restart just basically to whatever memory sucking gremlin is
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:08.680]   suddenly taking over the inside of my my mac like a cavity creep or something uh needs to be
[01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:14.840]   needs to be dealt with uh it's uh it's super light it's super small i don't i know that today uh
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:19.160]   the tomorrow when i'm gonna be spending uh the day in town i'm not gonna i'm just gonna need to
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:24.280]   write an 800 word thing i'm gonna want to look at something i wrote over the weekend that's 4,000
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:29.320]   words and do my editing on it so i don't necessarily need to have 12.9 inches of display i can have my
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:34.680]   mac my ipad mini uh for for that reason and choose the right thing for the job what it's
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:40.360]   so there there are differences but they're not really limiting different history of computing
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:46.280]   were you kind of touched on this with your nass some sort of each individual had some sort of
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:53.320]   centralized cpu storage unit whether at home or in the cloud and then you choose an appropriate
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:59.880]   set of peripherals to do the kind of work you wanted to do i mean one of the advantages of that
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:05.160]   of course is you have a single data set that you were working on with your phone tablet dressed up
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:10.360]   whatever and then you choose an appropriate peripheral whether it's a v augmented reality
[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:15.400]   visor and swiping around or maybe you need a keyboard or may but does that make sense as kind
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:20.440]   of a future vision of computing because really the difference between an ipad and a desktop is more
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:28.200]   about the peripherals about the ui and about your interaction with your data um i think i think it's
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:34.680]   more about uh the developer the developer understanding that your intent is probably going to be different
[01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:39.240]   from i've a predictable set of features and therefore it lets us jettison a lot of things that we know
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:45.080]   the user is probably not going to want uh to making sure that the that the user has never set a drift
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:50.840]   but what you what you described is i was doing some deep file maintenance i came across the keynote
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:58.760]   that i wrote for uh the last boston you have last boston mac world expo the final one i closed i
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:05.000]   closed the sucker down a 2004 2005 and i'm talking about and the whole theme of it was here's what i
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.280]   think should be the next versions of mac OS and one of the big ideas that i thought was natural back
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:14.840]   then is the idea of articulation having one app that figures out the device it's on and what you're
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:19.640]   trying to do with it and re-articulates itself to fit into the mold of that and windows 10 is very
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:25.560]   much like that because you can have the exact same app microsoft office is not broken down in different
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:30.520]   versions of it there is if you're running on a on a big desktop with three screens it behaves
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:34.680]   like a big desktop app if you're running it on a small tablet it becomes a small tablet app if
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:38.680]   you run on a phone it runs it becomes a phone app if you're running it on hollow lens it becomes a
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:44.200]   hollow lens it's all just about changes in ui that's natural to a centralized data core of data
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:51.880]   and work um and and your whole life is in this thing i mean i'm i've started as you know running a
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:57.640]   centralized server out of my house we're all my data and my notes and music everything is there
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:03.560]   and it has a a web based interface which means i can use it on a phone or on my ipad or on a desktop
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:09.080]   and i think maybe if we move in that direction and then you're right you you have not just peripherals
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:16.520]   but apps that are not data aware so much as ui aware yeah i mean play one that uh this is the
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:22.520]   problem i i'm i continue to become a bigger and bigger fan of plex uh i really could example right
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:29.400]   because exactly i mean it's uh it has uh tail apps that are tailored for ios and tailored for android
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:34.920]   but it also has an amazing web app that gives you pretty much everything you could possibly do
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:40.120]   with these individual apps and it really does make me think my god if i why doesn't itunes have
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:45.560]   some sort of a web presence so that it doesn't matter all that matters is that there is some
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:50.680]   play there's a file there's a there's a pile of my music and my photos in my video somewhere where
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:57.080]   this computer can reach it and this web this web page will find it connect to it and pipe it
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:01.160]   into this screen right here i don't have to worry about and i have i have i have i synced my data to
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:05.640]   this is this in the cloud or have i downloaded this device i would love to see apple work on
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:12.280]   this instead of a car apple here's what i want you to do i want you to make a box that's really easy
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:17.640]   that everybody has one of their own and maybe you also do a cloud backup so we don't want our data
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:23.000]   needs to be safe and then you make peripheral devices that interface with that box in a way that's
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.400]   appropriate to the kind of thing you want to do the location you're at maybe it's a little phone
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:34.520]   maybe it's a pad maybe it's a a thin client with a keyboard and a screen that if apple did that
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:39.160]   i think that's more forward looking than thinking about oh how can we do an automated vehicle
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:45.000]   now it's something remember that the car is something that they're looking at and also that
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.640]   it's not as though if they shut this project down all that money and all that work work
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:53.400]   attention well i'm sure we know they're doing that they have enough money to do all of the above
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:58.680]   yeah i mean i just this is this is one area which makes me think that if i could change one thing
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:03.560]   culturally about apple it would be that they could take the secrecy down from 11 down to say seven or
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:08.040]   eight i think it's very very useful to be able to say here is something that we're thinking of here's
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:12.840]   what we're looking at so that even if they never necessarily ship this version of itunes that they
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:18.840]   showed off at uh at wwdc last year you at least know that here is where their thinking is here's
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:23.720]   where their attention is as opposed to there's a total vacuum in the fact that the finder hasn't
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:29.400]   really changed much uh to the in terms of surface features in the past five or six seven years
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:35.400]   does that mean that they're really they're not in they're not engaged in improving it or does that
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:39.880]   mean that they're planning something so big that they don't feel like they've really licked it yet
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:44.520]   it's what do you think grina what do you you think that'd be a market that'd be interesting if it
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:49.320]   was just dead simple to use you didn't have to worry because right now you could do it but you
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:54.680]   have to know what you're doing you have to set up a server plex is is a particular thing for
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:38:00.440]   media but what if you had plex for everything your whole life the box and you bought the box
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:06.440]   you had automatic cloud backup and then you bought the the peripherals and it all and it wouldn't
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:11.160]   that be a product yeah i mean again that's that's the sort of the dream that's that's what the thin
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:14.520]   client used to be when everyone was just talking about having that you know computer but now we
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:18.840]   have enough bandwidth we i mean now we can do it we can actually make it work totally just depends
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:22.680]   who delivers a compelling solution well apples great at this because apples really good at
[01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:28.600]   our standing user interface factors human factors uh because it has to be dead simple because it has
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:33.960]   to be something every human would want one of and then and then you buy all the stuff that goes
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:37.880]   the accessories the pessimist would say that apples you know track record of services doesn't
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:41.240]   doesn't align them with doing this but i think that's what you see companies like up there you know
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:45.240]   who who've been trying for a while now to do very interesting things you know apples not to do it
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:49.880]   just because it's going to be some new it's it's it's too it's going to be somebody comes along and
[01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:53.640]   says you know apple has a chance because i mean they have reinvented themselves several times
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:57.960]   yeah you know one of the few companies who can and i would be classically hard working on this
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:02.200]   yeah absolutely that would be shocked if a big part of what they're doing now doesn't involve that
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:07.000]   why do you also decide what your story up there i mean is it any file or is it your images and
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:12.280]   notes and you know everything it's everything right it's everything and the thing is yeah you
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:17.320]   apple can sell one box to everybody and yeah you upgrade it or whatever but what you make all the
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:22.040]   money on is all of the ways you interface with that box i know the different box like you might
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:26.280]   have that box and then you might have the beautiful display the wall size one is living room the one
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:30.520]   in your car is that what we want we don't want ten computers and that's what we've got right now
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:35.960]   we've got a pad we've got a phone we got a desktop we got a laptop we got a computer at work we got
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:42.840]   we don't want that anymore well i think that to a degree i think we do we want if we want to
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:47.640]   have the right tool for the job and we want our individual tools to be as flexible as possible
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:52.360]   like i said i mean if i if i had known a year ago what i knew now about
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:58.520]   changing my thinking about how i do the work that i do again i might not have bought
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:03.960]   replaced my macbook back in november because it turns when i early in the earlier
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:09.400]   last year when i knew that the ipad pro was coming in the fall i intentionally bought an ipad mini
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:14.760]   because i could foresee a future having used the nine point seven inch ipad for years a future in
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:19.960]   which i would be using this 12.9 inch device as a primary field computer but also have the small
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:24.600]   thing for when i'm in that mode where i'm hoping that i don't have to do any work today but in case
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:30.040]   i get an email from my editor and i have to work today suddenly i want to be able to do that uh if
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:34.920]   i were stuck with one device that uh could handle it all i'm not sure that i could really do my work
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:39.480]   i'd love the fact that i work i live in this in this world in which i can and have written
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:47.800]   800 words on this thing uh at a backstage at a at a family at a family event because a court
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:53.880]   court case got handed down uh in the middle of a family reunion and i felt as though i a couldn't
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:59.240]   turn down a chance to talk about this uh to the suntimes readership and i also couldn't down turn
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:05.160]   down a really good excuse to not have to interface with distant relatives for 38 minutes so i could
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:09.480]   just go into a second bedroom here's another reason apple wants to do that if you're going to do
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:15.880]   privacy that means you have to have the users data centralized so you can if you want to do a really
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:21.640]   smart series the series has access to all your data in a centralized place so not only is your
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:26.760]   data living there in the box but your agent your personal agent is living in the box and has access
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:31.960]   to everything and enough enough power to be useful in other words move it away from the
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:38.040]   you know the variety of clouds we use i don't know i'm just yeah i'm just i just made this up but i
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:43.160]   like it i want it no but i i think i understand what you're saying and i think i i hope that apple
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:51.880]   doesn't miss an opportunity uh that they uh uh security and privacy are super important but if you
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:58.280]   allow for a world in which a user is willing to trust a third party with extremely sensitive data
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:04.440]   if they're getting a really good payback in return uh that's a really great thing uh i think i haven't
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:10.760]   really i haven't read haven't haven't into it yet but google added a new feature to google keep
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:15.080]   where it will try to organize your notes for you and try to figure out there's a trend to the
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:19.800]   notes that you're keeping and so as a result kind of like with google now it will surface a note when
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:24.520]   it thinks that it's going to be of most of the greatest use to you that requires a large level
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:30.040]   of trust in google not screwing you over with this but nonetheless this becomes the what every
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:37.400]   manufacturer should fear is the is the long long wait for a bus between two or three co workers and
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:42.200]   someone saying wow what why are you like not what how did you make your phone do that how do i make
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:47.320]   my phone do that well this is a feature of ios you can't do that in android really what to show to me
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:52.200]   again uh it's that's the that's the thing that gets people to switch that's so this is what gets me
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:55.720]   to switch from one thing this is my home cloud which completely replaces keep but see i would
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:43:02.360]   want all the all of the keep so i've got uh you know notes i've got tasks i've got my music i've got
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:08.440]   uh when i record ads for the radio station i put them in this folder and i can share that with them
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:15.000]   it's actually not synced up i guess or something um i i've oh yeah i sit at a different spot but i
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:21.720]   feel like i don't know Alex wouldn't that work for you too i think it would i mean i think the
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:26.360]   hard part for me when i think about the cloud is the files that i happen to use are so big that they
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:31.480]   you know it's not practical oh bandwidth's gonna be plentiful soon though right yeah but i mean we're
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:35.400]   some of the stuff we're doing now it's generating like six terabytes a minute that's not good and so
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:40.680]   so it's it's uh so it's it's it's but that has to all be local but another reason why you put a box
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:47.240]   in the in the house or the office and they can replicate in a in a slow fashion in an offline
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:51.640]   fashion or yeah i know and i think but i think that outside of some of the production things that i
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:55.720]   do i think i would definitely want that and i think that um i think a lot of us want to figure out a
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:44:01.960]   way to quantize our life to some degree um and uh you know to you know be able to grab all those
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:06.360]   things and make some sense of all the information that's coming in um and also being able to you
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:11.800]   know store it and does have to be something that's simple it's easy to use um and uh but i you know
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:15.560]   i think that for 90 percent of the people out there i think that that wouldn't be very hard that would
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:22.680]   be images some text files you know it's really not the average person is not regenerating that much
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:28.120]   you know i i had to move for my wife i had to move uh files over from one computer to another and i
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:31.480]   asked her you know how big are your files and you're thinking i'm gonna have to what kind of hard
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:34.360]   drive i'm gonna get and she's like oh it's pretty big it's like four gigs
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:42.280]   i got that i got that i got that i think i have a speak here here i have some old i have a whole
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:45.960]   old view as a viki that somebody gave me as a promo that i think i gave it to your whole computer
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:50.760]   you know and so so anyway that but i think that that is um you know the average person is is not
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:55.160]   really generating that much content and and but they are not able to find it you're not i think
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:58.840]   you know being able to find it is is the key all right we're gonna take a break come back with your

[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:49.000]   to quicken loans dot com slash mac break rene richie from i'm more dot com your pick of the week
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:55.160]   sir so my pick of the week is the new apple tv remote app it is a completely new app it will not
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:58.840]   update if you have apples old remote app you have to go to the app store you have to grab it
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:04.600]   and but when you get it is sort of everything that we wanted and we're promised for an apple tv
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:08.840]   remote app for the fourth generation apple tv and that includes all the gesture controls
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:12.360]   there's a serie button so you hold down a little microphone in the bottom right and then you speak
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:17.960]   to it the way you would the actual hardware is serie remote the menus work the skipping works
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:22.920]   all the gestures work and it really does if you remember back when the apple tv launched there
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:26.680]   there was no remote app that worked with it and then we sort of got our retrofit of the old one
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:31.640]   but this really feels like the app that should have launched alongside um the apple tv and if
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:36.840]   you're a big apple tv user i cut cable uh several years ago now and i use apple tv for everything
[01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:42.760]   for netflix i have um obviously all the itunes stuff that i've bought and there's new things
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:47.960]   like shalemie in canada and craved tv that i've been subscribing to and it makes it much easier to
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:51.880]   find that stuff especially in the u.s where apple has integrated the serie search results into a lot
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:55.960]   of other apps it will give you not just itunes results but results for a lot of the other video
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:48:00.920]   apps that are available on the store uh and i it's a perfect example i took my apple tv with me to a
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:05.320]   bunch of meetings that i was at last week so i could just use airplay and we could all work on the same
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:09.320]   documents or look at the same presentations the same time and it was phenomenal because you
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:13.640]   don't even need to be logged into the network anymore it does peer-to-peer airplay but i left
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:17.880]   the remote behind uh when i left the hotel and so i have to go buy a new one and i haven't had time
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:23.080]   to go to the apple store yet so i was trying to use the old app and it was not ideal and i loaded
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:27.160]   this up earlier yesterday when it came out and it's i've just been flying and i have i had time to
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:30.760]   go to the apple store and i just didn't and it's always it's just great when you can use your apple
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:35.320]   watch or your phone or the device you have in your hand and don't have to go searching um for a
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:40.280]   physical remote and i was watching stranger things on netflix which is a phenomenal homage to like
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:46.760]   the steven spielberg john carpenter sort of steven king in 1980s era of young adult science fiction
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:51.000]   stuff and i could find the episodes i could search for it i could do everything i needed to do and
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.800]   i'm super happy that that apple shipped this this app and did it before you know before the fall i
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:49:00.280]   was i was in fear that we'd have to wait until the tvos 10 update to get it but it's available right
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:05.720]   now in the app store they promised that they would update this and they finally yes yes very nice
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:11.320]   yes and it's free absolutely free and again it's a separate app so even if you have the old app you
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:16.360]   have to actually go to the store and get this new app do you have to uh like repair i mean how do
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:21.640]   you you just you tell the apple tv to pair to this app yeah so the app launches and it shows you the
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:26.040]   apple TVs that i can detect within its vicinity you tap on one of those the tv will show you a
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:30.520]   four-digit code on the television you just tap that into the app and then it pairs got it so you
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:35.800]   don't have to go to the you know the apple tv and go in and find yeah yeah good thank you rene
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:41.320]   Alex Lindsey your pick of the week i have one that i just really like and i've got a lot of comments
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:47.880]   on and so i thought i chaired it's not exactly an apple thing but i part of the reason i thought
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:52.120]   there would be you know uh relevant is because i i really wanted it for my watch i thought this
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:57.400]   was gonna be my next watch band and um and then it just came out as a bracelet and i know i'm buying
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:03.480]   jewelry i know you never expect me by a jewelry but it is quite possibly the most manly bracelet
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:08.360]   ever made so um so i thought i thought you're it's anyway so and even some of the women on our
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:13.480]   crew want it um so this is so i'll show you to you actually on my wrist one see rene this is for you
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:19.240]   know this is a bracelet see but so if you look at it here this is a what's called a leatherman tread
[01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:25.800]   oh i want love that and it is so it's a bracelet with a knife in it it is the it doesn't have a knife
[01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:31.880]   so it is actually it is actually so if you look at this um it is it it's the most manly bracelet
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:38.520]   because it actually has tools you know tools you know and so so and and i you know i i didn't want
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:42.760]   to i have had it for a couple weeks and i and i didn't want to say anything about it until i
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:48.680]   actually was like i was like am i really gonna use these tools um and the answer is yes i've used the
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:52.040]   you know you and basically what you do is you take it off and you hold it like this and it
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:57.240]   becomes a handle for you know something like a Phillips head screwdriver um so i've used the
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:01.720]   Phillips a fair bit um it's got little allen wrenches i have not been able to successfully use the allen
[01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:07.400]   wrenches on the right size um the one i use the most are the is the you know the can open or the
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:13.400]   bottle opener slash on the end there as well as there's this little one here that cuts so this one
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:19.400]   right here and it just slices open plastic oh i need that i would use that every day goodness like
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:23.720]   like that is like worth that's worth the price of admission and then there's just lots of like
[01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:28.360]   straight head um you can throw an airport on that thing i was about i had done it multiple times i
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:33.960]   i was just in cleveland in philadelphia and uh and dc and a bunch of other places and and a flying
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:38.760]   around it no doesn't even show up on the radar i think it's a bro i take it off it's
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:43.400]   quarreled up it's just quarreled up in my uh in my uh in my uh leather or my scottie vest or whatever
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:47.240]   so it's not like it's not like it's i have the bracelet no i wouldn't be able to wear it wouldn't
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:51.880]   get that hasn't even raised it hasn't raised any issues at all so far i i didn't uh try to take
[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:55.400]   i obviously in the last couple weeks i was in enhanced security i didn't try to take it through
[01:51:55.400 --> 01:52:02.200]   there so um but uh i didn't try to do that but i uh but but from airport security anyway it was uh
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:08.520]   it was fine um and so uh but the um it's great it's comfy the only thing if you have a small
[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:12.600]   wrist fortunately my wrist is fairly large if you have a small wrist you have to decide what tool
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:18.440]   you're giving up to make it smaller so it's like i had to give up like one one section like oh do i
[01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:22.920]   give this up or that up and so that's the only and the only other thing is is you you want it to be
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:27.160]   kind of loose because otherwise if it's tight typing on your keyboard is a little you know what's on
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:31.960]   the Mac it's just it's just the right place so if you let it uh you know uh slide back a little
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:37.080]   bit it's fine um and you get a lot of comments on it i i was kind of surprised i don't wear a lot
[01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:42.520]   of jewelry so i don't i don't expect uh but everyone was asking so what is that and and then you
[01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:46.600]   able to say it's it looks like a bracelet but it looks like there's something else going on it looks
[01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:51.560]   like a really gnarly bracelet that turns out to be bad max beyond the thunder dome kind of it looks
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:57.400]   like you're expecting a fight somewhere you're hoping for one but you're expecting one
[01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:01.880]   exactly two hundred twenty bucks ordering it now i think it's less on amazon i don't think it's
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:06.200]   that i don't remember best the list price i think leather was price but i think i think they actually
[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:12.760]   make a version of that with watch band lugs yes um do they because i didn't see i believe they not
[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:16.680]   for the apple watch but for watches in general i believe they have a version uh yeah yeah so i
[01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:20.280]   didn't of course then i have to give i don't know what i'd give up but anyway but yeah the probably
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:24.360]   some allen ranches because they haven't turned out to be that useful but the um but i've used it
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:27.960]   for lots of things just prying things open and work and just so many times when you now have it
[01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:31.960]   right at the tip of your you know like right available um you didn't forget to put it in your
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:37.000]   pocket or anything else anyway so i i like it a lot from leatherman it's called the tread
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:44.200]   and uh you you can have one on your bracelet uh on your wrist today i bet you can actually get a
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:48.280]   car out of a snow bank if you flatten that in through that underneath one of the one of the
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:55.080]   we have it looks like it doesn't it it looks like snow chains a third of an allen x my friends uh
[01:53:55.080 --> 01:54:00.360]   reis on it for 165 so there you go so it's a very good lesson yeah i got an eye on his own so yeah
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:06.520]   yeah Andy and not go your pick of the week since the first day when comic strips were available on
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:13.000]   the web i have begun every day by dragging my macbook pro off my nightstand or ri iPad pro off the nightstand
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:19.480]   into the bed and reading the morning comics before anything else happens i read the comics uh and
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:26.520]   i finally after many many years bought myself a pro subscription to to go comics.com this is the
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:31.400]   official site of i think andrew's mcmeal publishing uh and this goes to show you that if there's
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:34.840]   something you didn't like the first time you checked it out but that was a couple years ago you should
[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:41.160]   probably check it out again when they first started up they had uh mostly their own comic strips and
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:45.960]   they weren't necessarily ones that i really liked and now since last time i looked they've got all
[01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:51.960]   kinds of independent comics they've got pretty much every comic that's a professional comedy
[01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:58.440]   carfield dunesbury peanuts right and it costs nothing it costs if you want to see the comics
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:03.720]   they have they have dozens and dozens and dozens it costs nothing to go to go comics.com and just
[01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:08.760]   look at comics if you give them one stinking dollar per month uh wish you have to pay in advance 12
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:16.280]   stinking dollars. Is that all it is? It's actually $11.88 per per per per year. Let's call it let's
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:20.360]   call it dollar a month. It will actually go even better where you can select all the comics that
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:25.480]   you read when you go to go go comics.com it will actually put it all into one scrolling one
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:30.040]   one web page so you basically just scroll and you see all of your comics in one page it will only
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:33.640]   show you the comics that have been updated if that hasn't been updated since your last visit
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:37.240]   they'll you'll they'll just be a little link saying okay this comic has not been updated
[01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:41.880]   so you know what's what and these are these are your classic newspaper comics.
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:47.320]   Mostly but but there is there are a bunch of comics I was surprised to find there
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:54.840]   like I really really love oh god why am I blanking on her name but there is a comic that I
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:56:01.880]   sorry about this I feel as though I cannot move forward until it looks like you can read these
[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:06.440]   for the most part without paying for them you can read them without paying for them but you
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:11.560]   have to like click on these click on these one at a time. You don't get it all you don't get it all
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:16.600]   in one in one page where it's just all pre-load of editorial cartoons so these these are the
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:22.680]   syndicators that sell them to your local newspaper you get deer, abbey, puzzles. Right I
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:27.480]   I imagine that they've there have been some changes where they no longer have to have an absolute
[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:32.280]   exclusive on everything you do they have the brand new version of Bloom County.
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:39.880]   Yeah the 2016 version yeah they have a they have Jane's World which is something that I've been
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:49.400]   really digging for for for quite a while I will be unicorn tank McNamara Nancy.
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:56.360]   They also have a lot of duds here but if you go to go comics.com features they will show you this
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:03.080]   again four columns four columns high long just the scrolling scrolling scrolling all the way they have
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:08.440]   I don't I don't think they have a well I'm really disappointed though to see that
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:16.200]   the comments on these are as bad as they are on YouTube. Yeah why have comments here's one from
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:22.280]   Nancy no more beach all we have is this crummy pool and he says the struggle is real and somebody
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:25.960]   comments so you're not happy because you can't have a trip to the beach think about what you have
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:31.720]   and be happy you just said that two days ago. Yeah it's a good it's a good problem.
[01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:38.120]   It's a good thing they don't have funky winker bean. Oh the comments on that one at this trip where
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:44.680]   I find it are really really funny to that's it Connie to the wanny by Connie Sun one of the I
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:50.360]   didn't I had no idea it was on she was on go comics I was it's she was on one of those I've
[01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:57.640]   subscribed to her on offer her website by RSS some of the most beautifully written beautifully painted
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:05.320]   strip she works in education somewhere in New York City but the time and time again Connie
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:11.480]   Sun when I see one of her one of her strips it's like I want to buy a print of that and put it some
[01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:16.920]   place where I can see it every day and it will help me out on days when it's very very hard to move
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:22.200]   forward and very hard to have focus because just some of the it just really shows you how good
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:27.960]   comic strips can be these topics that you would never you wouldn't be able to consider this as a
[01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:34.920]   format until you see it and then it's just day after day after day I just love this strip
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:38.200]   but that's but that's a good example of the sort of stuff where I didn't realize it was going to
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:44.360]   be available on go comics I'm used to okay so Steve Roper and Mike Nomad and here's here's the
[01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:49.240]   the lock horns and not a whole lot of stuff that I was interested in that was like three years ago
[01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:54.280]   and now really most of the strips that I like but it really is the idea that I can just click on one
[01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:59.240]   link and boom there's everything I will have they do have an iOS app but I don't think it's as nice
[01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:05.720]   I really it has the simple problem where I instinctively the interface tells me that I can move to the
[01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:10.920]   next strip by simply swiping to the left and we'll move to the next one it is never that I have to
[01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:15.640]   look for a button at the bottom and click it and then click click that for next and that's the only
[01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:20.760]   reason why I don't use the iOS app but again I had the same reaction as you want for one stinking
[01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:25.160]   dollar a month okay I can I can do a dollar a month therefore five I'd have to maybe think about it
[01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:32.280]   because now we're talking burrito money but for a buck a month easy yeah boy this and craigslist
[01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:41.960]   who needs a newspaper it's all over folks sell your newspaper stock shut up dude you're gonna
[01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:47.400]   really want what I've got this is my pick of the week ladies and gentlemen the next time you play
