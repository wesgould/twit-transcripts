[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Today we're going to be talking about the 5S and the 5C and iOS 7.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Should you be interested in any of those three things you've got?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Mike Elgin helping out along with Renee Ritchie and Tanya Angst,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   which is going to be navigating a whole bunch of issues,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   including the idea, should you or should you not bring a non-Apple phone
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   into an Apple iPhone press event?
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   This is coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   This is "Cats You Love" from People You Trust.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   This is Detroit.

[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Hello there, I'm Andy Nopko.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Leo Laport is, I'm told he's off in the Middle East
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   directing his first feature film, and as such,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I'm going to be filling in as guest host, but that's okay.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   We have other people who are hosting too.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Starting, of course, with our regular, our beloved Renee Richie of iMore.com.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Renee, how you doing?
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Great Andy, and I'm so happy that that squirrel,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   after his second starring role in an Apple keynote,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   still went home with you at the end of the day.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   No, no, see, of course, every time there's an international standard for anything,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   somebody has to go and like fork it.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   So the first squirrel that Apple used as a demo photo was a tree squirrel.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   This one is a ground squirrel, so I don't know where the standard is now.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I'm going to, all of my tests date over the past two or three years now
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   is all tree squirrel, and I have to stick with that.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   But, you know, I mean, this is why there are standards committees, people.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   This is why there are standards committees.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Also, in the roster of people who are probably incredibly stressed out and overworked
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   because we are only a day away from a major operating system release
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   is Tonya Anks of Take Control Books.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Tonya, how you doing?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Hi, I'm doing great.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   So, I'm guessing that you have been rather busy over the past couple of weeks,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   ever since they actually locked down a ship date for OS 7.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Yeah, it's fairly busy, but we've done this so many times here
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   with the same bunch of people that it's kind of a busy period, but we're not frantic.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   We're not staying up until two in the morning.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   We're just sort of doing what we can with the time we've got
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   and having fun with the new features.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And, yeah, I'm glad you put it that way because I've talked to other people
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   who've put it in the sense of, like, there's a broken step up to their apartment building
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   and they keep tripping over and stubbing their toe.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And at this point, they've heard their toe so much that doesn't even hurt anymore.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   So, I'm glad you're saying that we've just gotten better at producing those things.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   We're smarter than, well, okay, I will say it's a good thing.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Well, okay, I will say it's me.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Also, through some bizarre mistake of geography,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   my goal is actually I understand in the United States of America, Mike,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   is that possible?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   New York, New York.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   It's close enough.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   So, or as you refer to it as a connecting city.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   That's exactly right.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   JFK essentially is what it is.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Not Newark.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   That's the important thing.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   How did you wind up in, because every time that you come in,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   you're either in some exotic city and/or on your way to another exotic city.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   So, you're here for a reason?
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Yeah, my wife and I were in living in Florence, Italy,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   and mining our own business and having a wonderful time,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   but one of our relatives is actually being married.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   So, we came back for a wedding, and while we're here,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   we're going to eat a lot of this strange exotic American food
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   and see the sights.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   We've seen so much about America on TV.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   We thought we'd try it.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   We'll get on to actual Apple and Mac-based stuff,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   but I really do have to ask you,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   I don't know many people who travel as much as you do.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   What do you really miss?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   What do you really have to do when you get back to the United States
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   room for a few weeks?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Well, I hope to visit the United States myself some day,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   so I want to know what the hot spots are.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Yeah, it's a mixed bag.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   I mean, there's actually one of the strange realities
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   is that everybody thinks that the food is horrible in the United States
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   and that it's wonderful everywhere else.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   There's actually a lot of incredibly good food
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   and certainly a way more food variety in the United States
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   than almost everywhere else you live.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   I mean, you remember that thing from Three Amigos,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   where they're in a little village and Chevy Chase says,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   "Do you have anything besides Mexican food?"
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   A lot of countries are like that,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   with they have their own types of food.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Italy has lots and lots of Italian food,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   not a whole lot of Thai food, stuff like that.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   So when you get to the United States,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   you basically can just say,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   "What strange and bizarre foods can we have?"
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   So that's one thing.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   In general, life is very convenient in the United States.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   So basically, it's a good time to just be lazy,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   which I enjoy.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   I believe they're adding that to the new redesign quarter next year.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Yes.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Welcome to the United States.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   You have the right to be lazy.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Here's a giant car.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Crushing a deer underneath its wheels.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   So obviously, lots of big news this week.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Probably the most pressing news for most people who are listening are
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   iOS 7 is going to be dropping on September 18th.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   It's going to be released tomorrow.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Obviously, we kind of have new phones this week too,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   and the difference is that you can get iOS 7 without having to
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   plunk down $200 and commit to a two-year contract.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   So there are a lot of people who are going to be navigating the
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   question of whether to upgrade or not.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   I've had my own little path with iOS 7.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I kind of avoided trying to talk about it or write about it in the
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   first couple of weeks because Apple was really clear about how
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   big a change they were making and how much this new operating
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   system was going to be evolving between the version that they were
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   showing off at WWDC and the version they would actually
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   ship to customers.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   We have seen a lot of changes.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Renee, what do you see now?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   You've seen screenshots that have been published publicly and
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   therefore can likely comment on what you have seen and you were
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   impressions on how much the operating system has evolved since June.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Yeah, I mean, iOS 7 is the biggest change to iOS since the
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   first iPhone, and that sounds like her perbole.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   But it's really not.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   They have redone every pixel of the interface.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   It's an entirely new design language.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   They got a really famous game developer to build a physics and
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   particle engine that the entire thing is based on.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   There's way more gestures, way more direct manipulation.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   It's much more text-centric.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   They've got a whole new system for making dynamic text and it
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   looks visually very different.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   They did keep it spatially similar, so your phone icon will be in
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   the same place your old phone icon is and it looks roughly the
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   same.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   But I think initial reaction will be kind of jarring.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   It looks like a completely new coat of paint.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   You left for a day someone destroyed your house and built up a
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Tim Burton house in its place.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   But I think because it's spatially the same, people will get
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   used to it fairly quickly.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I don't know what's the...
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Can you give examples of what the game engine is lending to?
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   So the game engine, instead of previously you'd have to spend a
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   lot of time animating any special effect you wanted and you just
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   couldn't do a lot of stuff.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Like you couldn't do the Apple stuff where you would peek into
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   photo stacks.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And now everything can be given a behavior.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   So, for example, in Safari when you press the tabs button, you get
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   this Rolodex that you can flip through and you can...
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Because it paralexes, it understands the direction of your
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   phone.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   As you move your phone around, you can peek at the cards without
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   touching them.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   And then you can put your finger on one and either move it around
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   or just toss it off.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And that makes it much more discoverable because you can play.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   And then you can play with how children learn.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   You can play with all these things and they interact with you.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And it also just makes it more delightful.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   And when you're dealing with mainstream computing appliances,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   the more delightful and playful it is, the easier it is for people
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   who aren't tech savvy or on computer literate to just pick it up
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   and use it.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And Tonya, how about you?
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   I mean, you have a different attitude in that you've...
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Your company is in the business of teaching users how to actually
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   use this damn thing.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And I think we've been talking about an awful lot because we do a
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   lot more content where we...
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   As Andy said, we're really trying to teach people how to take
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   control of something, how to go deep with something.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   We've realized what a fool's game it is in many ways to give
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   people detailed directions where we tell them exactly where to
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   tap and click because interfaces are changing so rapidly these
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   days that by the time we can write a series of steps and
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   publish it, even if we're just publishing it on a web page,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   it may be changed in a week or two.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   So we've been talking a lot more about how we can in our own
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   writing encourage people, in fact, just like Renee said, to
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   explore, tap around, try a few gestures.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   If it's not on the upper left of the page, maybe it's on the
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   lower right of the page.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   So we're trying to really work into our corporate DNA, the
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   idea that we need to teach people how to teach themselves,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   especially people who are maybe a little older or a little
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   set in their ways.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   They have to continually be giving up clues and signposts in the
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   interfaces they've gotten used to to learn new things.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   And I think for a lot of those people, I always have been
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   going to be very challenging just because visually it is very
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   different, even though a lot of it kind of works the same.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   You know, you finally figured out that, you know, you tap the
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   button that looks like an atom to create a genius playlist,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   say, in iTunes, and now you have to tap the word that says
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   create.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   So maybe the word create is more obvious, but it's different.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   So it's going to be interesting to see how people respond and
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   what we can do about it.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Yeah, it's been weird because I can speak openly about the two
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   times when I've used iOS 7, not under NDA.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   So obviously I had a lot of time to use it during the press
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   event last week.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   And I was pleased that a lot of the things that annoyed me back
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   in June are no longer operative.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   They went to a thicker font that doesn't really disappear as
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   the original version of Hell that it disappeared.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   They toned down, they adjusted a lot of the translucency, which
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   was to me was the cause so many interface problems.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   There were so many times when I first used it, I was using
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   the music player app and I thought that, you know, there's a
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   bar at the bottom of a genres, artists, playlists, whatever.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   And I thought that it was trying to tell me that, oh, I'm
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   backlighting this one, the playlist section in red to let you
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   know there's a problem here that you need to check out.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   But it turned out that no, I just was scrolling through a list
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   of albums and Beatles number one, which is a red album cover,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   happened to be behind that button to that button bar.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   So it was not so stuff like that has been adjusted.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   And thank God they changed the the lock screen indicator.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Now, everyone's probably heard about it.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   It hasn't too new genuine system wide gestures where you
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   stroke up from the bottom of it to get at a new hardware panel.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   You stroke down from the top to get indicators as a way to
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   remind you, however, that, hey, look, there's something new.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   You can swipe upward from they put an up arrow up there.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   But now when you at first, when you try to unlock, it's like
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   it's trying to tell you swipe up to unlock when actually you
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   have to actually do like a hill raiser puzzle box sort of
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   thing.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   It always took me like three swipes to get through that.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And now they've actually put the arrow where it's supposed to be.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Mike, have you had a chance to play with iOS 7 yet in your
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   travels?
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   And one of the things that I'm really excited about that I just
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   am utterly fascinated with.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   And it's one of the things that made the iPad, well, the iPhone,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   first of all, but the iPad later so compelling is the natural
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   reactions that the interface gives you when you interact with it
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   when you touch things scroll and the physics and all that kind of
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   stuff.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   And iOS 7 has just gone completely over the top in a good way with
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   ways in which the interface subtly reacts to whatever it is
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   you're doing.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   So for example, you look at the phone buttons and you dial the
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   phone.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   It's not just like you're dialing the phone.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   The second you touch it, you know, they're empty.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   The second you touch it, boom, it's gray.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   And then when you let go, it sort of fades, fades away.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   It's a small subtle user interface convention.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   And that's just one small example of many that exists in
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   this operating system.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   But it just feels really good to use because it always
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   responds to what you do in an appealing way, not always
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   appealing, but it always responds.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   And there's all kinds of really neat little things like that.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   They're unmeasurable.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   They are slammed by critics as fluff and sort of decorative
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   elements or whatever.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   But in fact, those are the kinds of things that make a user
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   interface compelling to use and even addictive to use because
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   they're constantly giving kind of feedback to your brain that the
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   real 3D world gives you.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Because every time you touch something in the real world,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   there's an effect.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   There's a cause and effect.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   And so it's really beautiful in that respect.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   And not only within the general use of the operating system,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   but within the apps that Apple has created.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   So it's just really, I really like it.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   For example, there's a really interesting thing where you have
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   two speeds on certain interfaces.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   So when you're looking at, you know, you go into the mode where
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   you're looking at multiple apps and you want to scroll through
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   the running apps.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   If you scroll through the top, that's the super fast speed and
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   you scroll through the bottom and move slower.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   It's like a two speed bicycle really pleasant to use.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   And I think a lot of people are going to love it and they probably
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   won't know exactly why they love it so much.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   But I think it's really, this is a really
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   crowd pleasing interface.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   This really isn't a case of Apple just changing the drapes in the
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   carpet.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   This is their first chance to take this thing that they built in
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   2007 and decide what parts of this interface were okay for
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   2007, but it turns out we don't need them.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   What parts of the interface?
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   What parts of mobile interfaces have we seen other app developers
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   create in the past five years?
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   They're like, wow, that actually is a good idea.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   We should probably put that into our operating system.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   It really does feel like it's more like a facelift.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   It really is like, okay, now here we are preparing the preparing
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   iOS for the next five years, not just hoping to make it
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   compete with whatever else is out there right now.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   I mean, first one, one of my favorite user facing features is
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   now the new app switcher, which is it maybe, maybe it's a little
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   bit fatalistic.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   The old way of getting the jiggling icons and then closing
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   them out seemed to indicate that you would never, ever, ever,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   ever, ever need to manually shut down an app.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   So okay, I suppose if you want to, we'll let you do this, do this
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   top secret thing.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Now it seems like, well, yes, we will let you simply have an
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   application switcher that lets you flick applications away and
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   get rid of them.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   I could really spend like so many hours, you know, in my reading
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   chair next to a fireplace with a brand sniffer, a brand or
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   brandy trying to figure out, is this a shift in Apple's attitude
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   that perhaps users should have more control over what they do?
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   So it's, yeah, you're a multi-tasking API is Andy.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   So the chances of them needing to do what might be higher now,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   too.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   That's a good point because not only like Steve's absolutely
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   right, it's so much prettier and much more natural interface,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   even though we'll, even if it will take people a little while to
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   relearn things they already know, but it's chockful of so many
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   APIs.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   I can't tell you how many times over the summer I've spoken to
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   developers who have said there's so many things I would have
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   liked to have done over the past three, four, five years, but
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   then I couldn't do because they would have been too difficult
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   and now I feel like I've been enabled to do some new stuff.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Like that's, have you had those sort of conversations, too?
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   I mean, as much as we saw the visual refresh and we heard a lot
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   of people complaining about icons, every developer I spoke with
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   the WWDC and I wanted to make sure I spoke to a lot of them
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   before I wrote anything about iOS 7 because it looked more than
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   it was just on the surface.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   The new multitasking stuff is phenomenal because it makes
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   every app a first class citizen.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   And the really smart thing is that Apple realized that perception
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   is reality and they have this concept of just in time updates.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   So you don't really need to have all these applications running
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   all the time.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   They just need to run right before you need to use them and
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   from push triggers, so a notification to update an app to
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Apple watching when you use apps and just temporarily updating
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   them five minutes before you usually open them to timers
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   that developers can set.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   They've put this entire framework together where, you know, if
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   you're not looking behind the curtains, the stuff just works
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   for you.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   And I thought there'd be pushback from developers because usually
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   they want to control all their own stuff.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   But Apple used language that made it seem like they were doing
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   a huge amount of server-side smarts behind the scenes.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   And that's the kind of stuff that really appeals to developers.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   And I think made it likely that they would go and implement all
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   these features and just the apps you're starting to see now with
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   content or messaging that can provide you this.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Previously, you get a push notification, you tap it, you go to
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Twitter or something and then have to wait five seconds for it to go
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   and fetch your message.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   And now that notification goes and prefectures your message.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   And it seems like a small difference, but those little things
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   are going to make the overall experience so much better, I think.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   I mean, I think that the real proof in iOS 7 is not going to be
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   what we see tomorrow, but what we see a few months from now when
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   all the developers are really up to speed on what's going on.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   I want to -- I want to -- I want to -- I want to -- I want to
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   something of Tonya too.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   I mean, have you been working hard in iOS 7 and has that been
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   a stumbling block to you're trying to get any of this work done?
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   I've been -- I'll let me preface this by saying that I have had
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   iOS 7 on a couple of devices that are in no way mission critical
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   that I can put down and walk away from and stay away from for a
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   week if I get upset with what I've seen.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Well, I have installed -- I always have been on my regular iPhone
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   that I use just for normal person iPhone stuff and been living
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   with it for a while now and haven't had any, you know, huge
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   struggles with getting used to it.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   I would say that I've spent less time, you know, sort of
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   marveling over the parallax effect or, you know, getting
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   excited about the small interface details which are nice,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   I think I've been much more like, okay, you know, how do I send
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   a text message on this thing or, you know, just how do I get my
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   normal stuff working?
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   And I think that's probably also because of the focus of my
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   job which is to help other people figure out how to get their
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   thing working.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   And I have sort of mixed feelings about some of the helpful
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000]  ness of iOS 7 when you read about, you know, Apple's claims for
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   what it's going to do with, you know, downloading your apps
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   automatically in the background for you and figuring out what you
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   want to read before you even wake up in the morning and knowing
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   when you're going to wake up and downloading everything for you.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   It sounds fabulous.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   But I always worry when, you know, some kind of computing
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   device is going to do stuff for you, you're hoping that it will
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   guess right about what you want it to do.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   And so hopefully with all the new processors and new smarts in
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Apple, this will come true.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   But I think, you know, in three months, we will know a whole
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   lot more, not only about what cool stuff we're going to be able
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   to do, but also if it fully lives up to expectations.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   Does it feel to anybody as though there's anything that's
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   missing because this is, again, Apple's first chance to
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   explicitly say everybody, you're going to have to relearn
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   some things.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   This is going to be a, we're putting on an uphill grade for a
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   month.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   It seems like this is the time when if you're going to disrupt,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   you're going to means well put in whatever you can.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   It's actually a side note.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   I thought it was kind of interesting that the last,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   again, according to published sources, there is the last bill
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   does not have iCloud keychains in it.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   That was the feature where your passwords are going to be
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   synced across all devices everywhere, which is, which was
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   one of the features that in the WWDC keynote was given a little
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   actual spotlight as though it was a really, really important feature.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   So that's Gish Finkto.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   That's not there anymore.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   I think that's waiting for Mavericks so that you can do it on
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   both platforms at once.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   Okay.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Hopefully it's, I mean, it's, it is a big deal.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   I mean, when we talk about passwords, every time there's a
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   deletion of that, you wonder, okay, do they not have faith in
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   this or this, or this, as you say, just trying to sync across
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   other devices.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   But, but, but, but what, what is, what opportunities has Apple
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   missed or is, do they already have a full plate as it is?
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Well, I mean, for me, Andy, like we've talked about this before,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   actionable notifications is like they're doing it on OS 10
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Mavericks.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   They're not doing it on iOS and because iOS 7 is such a
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   dynamic, they're basically birthing dynamic operating systems
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   with iOS 7.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   And one of the key features is their ability to push interface
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   is no longer stuck in an app or stuck on a home screen.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   And one of the best features of push interface is actionable
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   notifications.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   So if you get a text message and you're playing a
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Plants vs. Zombies 2, you don't have to leave the game, go to
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Messages, write your message, come back.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   You can just answer it during the game, send it back and be on
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   your way or reset alarms or do any of a bunch of other stuff.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   And that going, that's available on Android.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   It was partially available on WebOS years ago.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   It's going to be in Mavericks, but it's still not going to be in
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   iOS.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   And I think that's still that and maybe the predictive aspect of
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Google now are the two things that seem the most obvious to me.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   >> Yeah, that's what I was just going to say is, I think I would
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   have guessed that Siri would be further along by now.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Now, Siri is greatly improved in this in terms of the chatiness
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   and real life human sounding voice and all that kind of stuff.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   But I would think that the sort of preemptive stuff that Google
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   now does is just gold.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   I mean, it's just such great stuff.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   And you can't do the same things on the iOS version.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   You can on the Android version.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   And I would think that Apple would really want to get busy on
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   that aspect of it.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   I'd like Siri to start interrupting me at some point out of the
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   blue with something that she sort of came up with and put two
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   and two together.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   The traffic is bad.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   And I noticed that you have a meeting.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   So I know you like to go to Starbucks and know that Starbucks
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   is really busy.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   But I mean, I'm sort of projecting in the future, but I'd like
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   to see a lot more sort of, you know, super assistant kind of
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   stuff rather than just, you know, tweaking it a little bit
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   and making the voice sound nicer.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   It's on the today's screen.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   There's one little bit of it.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   If you go to the today's screen, it'll say if you want to leave
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   for home now, it'll take you 12 minutes given traffic conditions.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   Or if you go to work a lot, it'll say if you want to leave
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   for work today, but it's only that one line of text on that one
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   screen.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Two years ago, restaurant reservations with Siri.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   And like I by now, I'd like Siri to say, hey, you know, you're
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   wedding anniversary is coming up in three days.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   I see that you haven't ordered any flowers.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Would you like me to take care of that for you?
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   Now, I want that.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   My wife wouldn't want that, but I want that.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   And that sort of thing where it's just like really preemptive
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   and really ask covering, you know, it's really save your bacon type
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   stuff.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   See that does create a problem though, because what happens if
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   you suddenly switch phones and suddenly you become the, you're
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   no longer a thoughtful husband.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   You no longer remember birthdays and anniversaries.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   You no longer know what her dress size is.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   That could cause problems down line.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Yeah, or if there's a glitch and you know, there's an error and
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   I get the flowers myself.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Why do I get flowers from myself?
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Oh my God.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Let's get to a critical question though.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   I'm 99% sure that I'm going to upgrade both by, okay, granted
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   I'm now a full-time Android user, but I also use my iPhone a lot.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   But I rely on my iPad for my daily work.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   And side note, I do think that the interface for iOS 7 looks a little
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   bit, it still looks a little bit strange for me on the phone.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Pretty much because it's so different.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   On the iPad though, boy, with a little bit extra room to spread
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   out in, it looks so much prettier and so much more, more right
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   and more correct.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   So, but nonetheless, it means something that I'm probably
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   going to be upgrading my iPad to iOS 7.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   But I'm not sure that I would recommend it to other people.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   I really want to go around the panel and get your opinions on.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Tell me, are you going to be upgrading your real use devices?
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   And to will you recommend that random person who does not work
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   in the tech industry would do it?
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   And let's start with Renee, I think.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   So, I have this test that I do right before any iOS release,
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   because I put the first beta on both my iPhone and iPad
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   immediately because I have to.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   I mean, it's just part of my job.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   So, what I do is I wait until the GM is out and then I give them,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   in this case, I gave my iPad to my mom.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   My mom's favorite computer, the computer she uses the most is the
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   iPad.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   She can do way more on an iPad than she can do on her Mac.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   It's the perfect computing device for her.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   So, I gave it to her and I wanted to kind of gauge her reaction.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   And she loved it immediately.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   She thought it was colorful and playful and she had no trouble
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   doing anything that she normally does on an iPad.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   And to me, that means that for most people most of the time,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   this update will be maybe a little bit jarring initially,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   but it'll be absolutely usable enough for them to do.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   If you have something that's mission critical, if, you know,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   like Andy, you absolutely have to have it for that plane flight.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   I would wait a week and see what, you know, the reaction are.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   But I think for most people, it's fairly safe at this point.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   How about you, Tonya?
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Oh, I absolutely recommend.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   If your hardware device will support iOS 7, absolutely upgrade.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   There's just no reason not to.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   It's a benefit to everybody to stay current with what Apple is
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   doing and to be part of the excitement of what's going on with the technology.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   The only consideration really would be, you know, do not upgrade,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   you know, two hours before your planet get on an airplane or, you know,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   don't upgrade if you really need to be using a lot of your apps and you don't have a few hours
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   to sit down with it to learn what's going on.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   You know, take a couple days when you can, you know,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   focus on your upgrade to make sure that you're ready, you're ready for it,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   and everything's going smoothly for you.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   But this is just really neat.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   I mean, these, these iPhones and iPads, these things that we have,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   these are like having super computers in your pocket.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   And I have seen all kinds of people who are not very computer literate,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   do the most amazing things with them with using the maps and the social networking
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   and the geofencing, just all the features they have.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Everybody finds a few features that are just like little miracles that they carry around with them every day.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   And if we're, you know, alive at this time in history, why not?
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   If you've got a device put on the newest thing from Apple and try out all the great stuff.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   I think everybody will find something to like, yeah, there'll be a couple little stumbling blocks.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   A couple of things won't look the way they used to.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   But it's good for everyone's brains to learn new things.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   And I think this is a winner from Apple and there's just no reason to stick around on iOS 6.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Things will start breaking or not sinking correctly and you want to get updated and stay with the program
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   and have a good time with it.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Mike, how about you?
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   I mean, you're maybe in an otter situation because...
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Yeah, totally agree with that.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   Yeah, I mean, human psychology is a funny thing.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   There's always gracing and then when people get used to it, they still think that they don't like something about it,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   but then try to get them to go back to the old thing.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   It's always better.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   The new thing is going to be fantastic for all users.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   I personally am like you.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   I use the iPhone as a secondary phone.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   And I use the iPad heavily as a very primary device outside of MacBook Pro with Retina as another primary device.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   But yeah, I'm going to upgrade and recommend that everybody upgrade as soon as possible.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   Yeah, I agree with you mostly.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   I think the only qualm that I have is that I think it's going to be stable.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   I think that most of the apps that people rely on are the kind of apps that have a huge tech support and huge support staff working on them.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   It's not one person in a kitchen counter who doesn't have time to really update something for iOS 7.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   So I think that it's been tested 10 ways till Sunday by now, even third-party apps.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   I think the big hitch for a lot of people might be that a lot of what we use, particularly a phone for,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   is I've got 10 seconds to make something happen.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   Like I'm, first of all, on Tuesday, I'm going to be recording an interview that is the sort of thing where if that thing gets screwed up,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   I just have to leave the business.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   That's how bad it would be.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   And for that, I don't think I will be having iOS 7 on the device that's doing that recording.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   So I think that people need to be prepared that things that you expect them to be in a certain place might not be in that certain place.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   A way to do something that you've been doing almost by muscle memory at this point might work a different way.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   So I think that your phone will be stable, but the person behind it might not be stable for at least for the first few days.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   So definitely keep that in mind.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   So it's definitely useful.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Thumbs up around the panel for updating to iOS 7 on the first day.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   But before we leave iOS 7, there's another one of the key, one of the really coolest things about iOS 7 is support for a new thing
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   that Apple's doing called I-beacons, which is, imagine these incredibly low power Bluetooth devices,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   kind of like smoke detectors where you put a little battery in it and it'll run for an entire year that can broadcast.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Here is I-M&I beacon.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Here's my location.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Here is my address.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   And so it can do things like pinpoint your location inside a building, inside a specific room, stuff like that.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   And this is first spotted as an unremarked little like six point piece of type on that master slide at WWDC of,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   and here are all the other features that we're going to be putting into iOS 7.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   But they've been, Apple's been talking about it a lot since then.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   What I've found interesting is that a lot of commentary online about I-beacons has been that this is going to be an NFC killer.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   That, well, why should you have to tap a device to a tag that you've put onto a door jam in order to find out where you are?
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   See, this is a, NFC is a failure and it's failed for e-commerce.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   It's going to be killed by I-beacons with these little 20 or $30 devices that stores and houses can put up pretty much anywhere.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   I'm not sure it's going to be that big.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   I mean, it's an interesting resource.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   I just am waiting to see how people are going to actually implement this in buildings and public spaces inside their homes.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Like, Renee, have you heard from people who are really excited about making products that support I-beacons yet?
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   You know, I haven't. I think it hasn't gotten the amount of attention.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   I mean, Apple hasn't given it a lot of attention yet.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Maybe they're working behind the scenes, but it hasn't been featured prominently.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   I'm kind of with you on the NFC thing, but I think one of the problems in tech media is that we look at chipsets and not feature sets.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   You know, Apple's never been a company that says, "Oh, look, here's an NFC radio.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   What features can we throw on it?"
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   They're more likely to say, "This is a feature set we want.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   Do we need an NFC radio to do it, or can we use Bluetooth Low Energy or AdHoc Wi-Fi Direct?"
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   And so far, they've been going with Bluetooth Low Energy and Wi-Fi Direct.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   And I think that's great.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   It remains to be seen what becomes really popular because if any, you know, if a major retailer rolls out NFC and the iPhone can't do it, that's a problem.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   If I-beacons take over the world and nobody needs NFC, then it doesn't matter very much.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   But I like the fact that we're doing all these location-based technologies and not just from satellites and GPS, but these kinds of things, for example, you could put this in a national park and people who have accessibility issues could do tours that they were never able to do before.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   And when you watch those WWDC videos, Tim Cook's really fond of showing off how these technologies matter to people in everyday life.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   And that's the thing I'm going to look most forward to in seeing with I-beacons.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Yeah, I'm really bullish about this thing because I think it's just incredible.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   And I wrote something, I don't know, a year or two ago, about how I suspected Apple wanted to make commerce work like it does in an Apple store where, you know, you go to the Apple store, there's no cash register, there's no standing in line to buy your new plastic, fruity-colored iPhone case.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   You just find somebody with the right kind of t-shirt and you sort of accost them and say you want to buy it and they swipe a credit card, which is a little barbaric.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And then you walk out with a seat in your inbox, right, email inbox.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   And I think they sort of envision that's how all brick and mortar commerce ought to work and I-beacons is one way to do that.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   The other thing that's interesting about I-beacons is right now we have stuff like Four Square.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   And you know, all of it's copycat stuff and you know, where you go and you check in, you know, I'm at Dunkin Donuts and I'm checking in.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   And the reason that check-ins is kind of a required for the retailers and for the, you know, the people who would serve us, you know, all the stuff that goes around check and just because they don't know exactly.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   They don't know where Dunkin Donuts, Dunkin Donuts, you go to check in and Dunkin Donuts.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   And it's like, well, here's a list of places where you might be and then the sixth item down the list, oh, there's Dunkin Donuts, that's why I am and you check in and you, okay, now you were a Dunkin Donuts.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   With I-beacons, there's no check. You don't have to check in. Like they know exactly what story you're in.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   If you, you know, again, this is going to be an opt-out thing. It's not an especially egregious privacy issue beyond the long list that we already have to deal with.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   But that's one of the things about I-beacons. There's certainty about where you are. Not only that you're a Dunkin Donuts, but you're looking at the Bear Claws.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   I mean, it can be pretty specific about, you know, you can triangulate these things at a microscopic level.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   You put one over here and one over there and Apple also recently acquired another company's name of it escaping me for the moment.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   But the Bear Company does that they acquired, pro-regulate both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals to get a very exact location indoors.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   And so they're going to, let me say it's called Wi-Fi Slam.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   And so they're going to be able to enable retailers to put, you know, even a gigantic store,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   can put three or four of these things, or maybe two of these things plus a Wi-Fi network and really know, you know, pretty exactly where you are in the store and give you very good context for stuff.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   And then it's all through Bluetooth 4.0. And that's the genius of all this is Bluetooth low energy.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   So, you know, Apple's essentially what Apple's doing is sort of leapfrogging the NFC thing.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   We've been waiting for NFC chips. When is the iPhone going to have an NFC chip? When are this phone, that phone, the other phone going to have an NFC chip?
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   The second, this stuff exists. It's compatible with everything back to the iPhone 4S.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   And it's also by the way compatible with the iPad is compatible with all the Apple laptops.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Apple is the first company to ever put Bluetooth low energy into a laptop or into a phone.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   And so there are literally by the time that they throw the switch and make this real, there's going to be a couple hundred million people who are good to go with this technology.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   No waiting for a chip. Nothing. So it's really, I think the potential here and there's no guarantee that Apple will realize the potential, but the potential is absolutely enormous.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   It is a sufficiently big deal. Apple, as far as I know, and it's possible that my ear hasn't been close enough to the ground.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   They haven't talked a whole lot about the openness of the technology.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   I guess I'd be a lot more excited about what it can do, especially the idea of being so low power running so long on one battery and so inexpensive to produce that.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   You may as well put them in any place that would be useful. But what worries me is that every time they come up with use examples as well, if you have your iPhone and then you have your iPad and then you have your other Apple device, you have this other Apple device,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   I feel a little bit more. I feel a little bit better about it if we knew that Apple is going to make this into an open standard.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   If they were possible for any device that supports Bluetooth low energy can take advantage of this.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   Otherwise, it's like that golden escalator inside the mall that takes you to the real store that the Rifrath can't access.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   If accessibility is a great goal for everybody, but if they were really interested in that, they would say, "We think this is a great idea.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   We don't think other companies have pushed this before the way that it's going to work.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   We've come up with our own standard. We're publishing them and if you want to create software for any device that will allow someone to navigate through forest trails,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   or park easily, we're going to let you do that." I wish I'd seen more stuff from Apple saying, "We're not going to just make this an Apple-only party.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   We're going to make this available to everybody." Because NFC, again, open pool, anybody can come in there.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   That is really the question. How open is it going to be?
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   There are other third-party companies that are proceeding as if it's going to be open, for example, Estimote,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   which is already selling what they're claiming. I think they're claiming that their iBeacons compatible devices.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   There's only three for $99, which is an amazingly cheap price.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   There's another company that's out there leasing them for a monthly fee of $10, something like that.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   It's really the thing that the actual beacon does is so trivial that it really has got to be open.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   If you're in a series about an e-commerce situation, it would really be dumb to have entire systems set up just for people that use one particular brand of phone.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   I'll tell you something else that got me excited about the technology, not necessarily having these $20-$30 devices that you can buy and stick around places,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   but what if Apple simply decided that we can do this so well and we believe it so much, that every Apple TV will also have iBeacon chips in it.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   Every router we make will also have iBeacon in it so that without even having to set up an extra network, if you enable a certain feature in your phone,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   your phone can know that, "Oh, Andy's in the living room now.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   I'm going to just by default connect through the airplace speakers that I know happen to be inside this living room."
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Or, "I know that Andy has left the house because I can see that he's at the front door and he's the last place he was,
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   was at the room that was behind the front door, so I'm going to put the phone into whatever mode he wants it to be and when he is not home anymore."
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   I'm going to disconnect the Wi-Fi from the home network.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   I'm going to make sure it doesn't necessarily automatically connect to base stations that might encounter while he's on his walk,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   that sort of stuff.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   I think that I see sort of a similarity between the response to iBeacons and NFC in that when people talk about iBeacons,
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   they talk about that store experience where, "Hi, great.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   I just, you know, pottery barn, the reason why I stopped at this set of placemats is because I got a text message.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   I'm not interested in these placemats. Please don't record that Andy Anatko is shopping for placemats and marketed me accordingly."
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   But NFC is usually talked about as a failed way of doing e-commerce, of doing wallets.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   And to me, the most impressive stuff I've seen with NFC is when you need to configure your phone or your tablet to work with this router
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   or with this speaker system and you simply tap it against the router and they have a conversation chip to chip
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   and suddenly your phone can talk to the router without any complications like that.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   So all of these things have a lot of potential.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   I think it's going to take a company that has enough force of will to say, "This is a great idea.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   We're going to make everybody believe that this is as good as we think it is."
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   Any last comments about iOS 7 before we go to break?
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   No? Okay. Let's go.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   We have now, before Leo fled for his directing assignment, he did pre-record a bunch of ads for some of our sponsors.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   So now let's go to Leo Laport somewhere in the recent past to talk about legal zoom.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   Andy, sorry to interrupt. Thank you, by the way, for filling in while I'm gone.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   First day on my vacation, I'm already back to an ad.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   Actually, I wanted to talk to you about legal zoom.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   One of the reasons I like to do the ads for legal zoom is because I use legal zoom.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   I use it when I first set up Twit.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Somebody, I think it was Kevin Rose, said you should really make an LLC when you do this.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   And he'd set up a number of companies, Dig and others.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   So I listened to Kevin, and I went to legal zoom.com.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   Now, legal zoom is not a law firm. This is what's cool about it.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   It doesn't cost you like a law firm will.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   They don't bill you $350 an hour.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   But way it works, you go to legal zoom, you're going to get a flat rate for a particular product.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   For instance, in this case, an LLC, you can also do an S-Corp or a C-Corp if you want to incorporate as well.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   You can do other things too.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   You trade marks, a lot of patent filings, all the things you might want to do when you're starting a business.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   It's really wonderful. I got to tell you, starting your own business is awesome.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   But it's really important to legally protect yourself.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   The good news is it doesn't have to cost a minute.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   You don't have to go out and get venture funding just to do the LLC.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   Over the past 12 years, a million business owners have trusted LegalZoom to help start their businesses, including me.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   LegalZoom saves you a lot of time and a pile of money.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   Mostly, an LLC filing is basically filling out forms.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   So LegalZoom gives you those self-help services.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   They go through the step-by-step questions that you need to answer.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   Occasionally, you run up against something you might want some help.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   They also have, and I love this, the LegalZoom legal plan, which lets you talk to an attorney
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   at a pre-negotiated flat rate.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   You choose the attorney in your state.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   From a list of attorneys, you've got profiles, unedited reviews from users,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   so you can really choose the attorney that's right for you.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   You know exactly how much it's going to cost.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   You can ask him, for instance, Delaware, California, where would be the best place to set my LLC up.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   Go to LegalZoom today and see what's right for you.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   Form an LLC, get a DBA, incorporate, form a non-profit that all is $99,
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   including the filing fee.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   You add the filing fees, not including the filing fees.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   They also do stuff for personal wheels, trusts, LLCs, trademarks.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   So here's the deal.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   If you are going to use LegalZoom, I just asked that you use MBW in the referral box at checkout.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   We're going to give you $10 off LegalZoom a note that you saw this on MacBreak Weekly.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   LegalZoom.com, $10 off when you use MBW as the offer code.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   Back to MacBreak Weekly, Andy?
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   Like your wheel?
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   I didn't see that ad beforehand, but I did notice that the last thing we talked about was NFC.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   If you notice over his shirt pocket, he was wearing an NFC chip that unlocks his Moto X phone.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   Apple maybe has a better solution for getting past the unlock phone pane with the iPhone 5S.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   The 5S and the 5C announced last week they're shipping on Friday.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   Here's another place where we have a solemn duty and a responsibility as tech savvy people and people who are interested in such things to people who may have been camped out for at least 12 hours in front of their local AT&T store by now, waiting to be the first to have a 5S.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   Okay, look, side note, if you're camping out, that was so 2007.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   It's done.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   You don't have to make plenty.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   And you know what?
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   If they sell out in September, good chance they're going to make more.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   If they stop making iPhones, I will give you $50.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   If they only make that one first run, I will give you $50.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   I'm that confident that they'll have more in October, November.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   But we've probably all gotten those emails from people who are their contracts are up.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   They've been waiting or they bought an iPhone 5 and they're thinking about buying out of their contracts.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   I was actually at the event last week, so I wasn't participating in the show last week.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   But what were people's impressions?
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   And not just in terms of, hey, cool technology, but is this really the the the phone?
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   It is an S release or talk update.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   But I was pretty darn impressed.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   The A7 processor inside there, it's kind of like the advantages of iOS 7.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   It's not so much what's there today, so much as sitting back again.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   Leather chair, fireplace, sniffed or brandy, thinking about all the things that Apple and developers can do with hardware like this.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   So how impressed were people about this?
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   We'll start with Renee here.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   You know, I think you're exactly right.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   I think the A7 processor, which is 64 bit, but also has a lot of other technologies.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   It's based on ARM V8, which is a much better instruction set.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   It's probably got a power VR series six GPU inside of it.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   It's an amazing processor and we probably won't see the results of that immediately.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   But what it shows, what it portents about where Apple is going with mobile is really exciting.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   And to give you an idea of it, the fingerprint scanner, which is going to be the big Santa Claus commercial moment,
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   depends entirely on the A7 processor and a secure enclave that lets a talk at a hardware level to maintain security
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   or that entire fingerprint authentication process, which you kind of really need to do to employ something like that at a functional mainstream level.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   If you look at the outside, yes, it comes in gold and space gray now.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   But when you look at the camera improvements, you know, once again, Apple's putting the focus on the image signal processor,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   not just on the glass on the outside.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   And when you look at how many pawns they've been putting on the board for the last, you know, couple of years,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   as they start to encroach towards the center, towards what it looks like their mobile endgame is, I think it's really exciting.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   I mean, if you have an iPhone 5, there's very little reason for you to upgrade unless you happen to need one of the new LTE bands they support.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   But if you have older iPhones, especially if you have one not getting iOS 7 and won't be able to run iOS 7 apps,
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   both the 5C and the 5S are tremendously exciting phones.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   Yeah, the more I dig into these things, the M7 processor, that does nothing but try to understand, look at the, read the accelerometers, read all the sensor data to figure out where are you,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   what are you doing with your phone right now?
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   And is there a way that the phone can adjust itself to be not annoying you while you're out taking a walk versus when you're inside your car versus when the car,
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   you're inside the car, but the car is parked versus you're inside your house.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   It just seems like this is going to be a whole new game that we're dealing with.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   So, you're asleep. I mean, they said it will stop using network connectivity when it detects it's not moving into things you're asleep.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   It's amazing.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Yeah, I mean, how are we even going to do battery tests on this?
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   Because the usual thing is just to beat the hell out of it for until the damn thing gives up and invakes for mercy.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   Just keep hammering the Wi-Fi, keep hammering the running video, keep playing games, keep running 3D graphics.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   I'm putting up buying Cluecon at treadmill. That's what I'm going to do.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   It seems like more like an intern sort of thing. They're developing valuable job training experience by running at 7 miles an hour until either the phone dies or the intern does.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   But it really is that kind of thing, isn't it? I mean, Mike, were you impressed with what you saw?
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   Yeah, absolutely. And I like to write a lot about the user side of technology.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   And so I like to parse these things. So, for example, for the individual user, probably the best single thing about it will be the camera.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   I have a strong camera and the iPhone 5 is just killer. People always say, "Well, this one's better. That one's better."
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   No, iPhone 5 has the best camera out there today. That'll change some more.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   I just repeat that.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   There are some cameras that do a little bit better on the high end. Some do a little bit better.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   They actually see one is a little bit better in darker rooms, but iPhone is the camera that does second best in both of those, which makes it the best camera.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   Anyway, so the new camera is going to be great. That's going to be great for the user.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   But the only -- and all the 64 bits and the faster processor and all that kind of stuff.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   But the only thing that's really culture-changing is the fingerprint reader.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   People are sort of missing -- a lot of people are missing the boat on what this thing is for.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   It's not about securing the phone. It's not a passcode replacement. It's about identifying the user.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   It turns the iPhone into a driver's license and a signature.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   And it turns it into potential, really, into a password keeper type thing, a pass type of thing.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   It turns it into the sort of NFC thing that authenticates you into your building.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   And it's something -- a phone is something everybody has.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   So many, many phones -- I say many, maybe a dozen significant, memorable phones in the last five, six, seven years have tried to put fingerprint readers in, sometimes awkwardly on the back.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   They've always slapped them on in some way to replace a passcode or a password or something like that.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   They've all failed miserably. They all looked horrible.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   There was nothing good about them.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   Motorola came out with one a few years ago, and then in the second version of that phone, it didn't have one because they said, "Yeah, nobody uses it."
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   That's what Apple does. That's what Apple does better than any other company.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   And there's no contest, which is that they change human behavior. They change culture.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   And so they're going to make the world safe and give a reason for fingerprint ID to exist on a phone.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   This is really going to change things. Finally, we've been talking about digital wallets that replace your physical wallet.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   We all carry physical wallets still.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   2013, and we're still carrying around cow skin filled with plastic, like, magnetic -- you know, it's a bazaar.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   We go to a restaurant and we hand our credit card over to somebody who takes it out of our site into the back room where there -- who knows who's back there.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   And we get to -- you know, if this all goes as I think it will, we get to replace all that.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   So it's really -- that's really a culture-changing thing.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   And I'm predicting that it's going to have enormous usage.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   I think that they're actually going to succeed.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   And they're -- you know, just like they did with the multitouch user interface on a phone, every other phone is going to do it, and then those users are going to use it as well.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   I think they're really going to change the world with this thing.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   I was really impressed in the demo room by how well it worked.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   In previous weeks, we've talked about the fingerprint reader and what would be expected of it, that it really does have to work 100% of the time because if it's only about 75%, people are just not going to really rely on it, because of why I roll the dice every time.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   But I had only about five or ten minutes to try the fingerprint scanning, but registering a fingerprint is really easy.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   It's very, very graphical.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   It's not a technical process.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   It's almost a game process that it works like.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   And then things reliable.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   I registered one thumb.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   I could not get it to work with any other finger.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   And the one that I registered didn't matter whether I was using the tip, the size, the fat end, the whatever end.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   Obviously, we're all going to be testing this out pretty heavily on Friday when we get our hardware.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   But if -- in the worst possible scenario, a brand new user who -- whom the phone had never seen before
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   and who has never used this service before, if it worked that well, that's extremely promising.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   What do you think --
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   Go ahead.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   If I could just -- just another quick brief thing about this.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   And you're absolutely right.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   And every time you do use it, the fingerprint gets more -- it gets smarter about knowing -- recognize your fingerprint, gets more accurate.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   The other part of it is the genius that Apple is doing where they're using it for two things.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   They're using it to unlock the phone and they're using it for Apple, you know, online Apple store iTunes purchases to replace that password.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   Which is really three things.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   They're using it as a password replacement.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   They're using it as a -- an authenticated ID user for you to use a credit card to buy something.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   And they're using it to unlock the phone.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   That is so genius because you -- everybody's annoyed by having to put in the password yet again because I downloaded another app.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   And it's like something we all do all the time.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   And now it's -- it'll just -- that thing will sail through.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   You'll easy pass those apps now.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   And that's -- you're just one baby step away from saying, "Okay, well, now you can buy everything that way."
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   Companies, you know, Macy's and all these other companies just work with us, Apple.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   And the credit card that we already have on file for this user, they can buy stuff at your store now.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   They already know how to do it.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   They already feel comfortable doing it.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   I mean, it's just really -- it's just genius to roll it out in such a limited way that covers the basic things that they then can be extended to all passwords, all commerce, if they want to.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   If they decide that they're going to go that route, which I think they very well could.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   I want to give Tony a chance to chime in.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   What do you think about it?
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   Well, I personally was just so excited when I first heard about it. And that's just because personally, I spend a lot of time editing and writing about iOS.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   And therefore, on my own desk and in my own office, I'm constantly entering passwords on these things.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   And further, I keep editing articles and books about how important security is and online privacy and things like that.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   And so I become more and more personally paranoid.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   So over the past three years, I've gone from having the stupidest pass codes you could possibly imagine on these things actually having fancier and fancier ones that take longer and longer to enter.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   So I will be getting that iPhone 5S just as fast as I possibly can, just because I'm excited about the new feature.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   Implementation details, we still don't know too much about them, but I think for your typical user, what this means is, and let's just assume that Apple's hardware lives up to a usual reputation and works well.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   So for the typical user, this means that they can stick their thumb or whatever the singer they want on their iPhone and unlock it without worrying that if they just leave it on in a restaurant or lose on a bus, that some, you know, miscreant is not going to be a good thing.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   So miscreant is going to unlock it.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   And with that means is that they can be less secure within the apps on the phone.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   So for instance, in Safari, they may be more likely to turn on the auto fills.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   They can more easily log into websites or they may just be less certain about what apps they have on their phone.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   For example, when I traveled to Europe last summer, there are a few apps I have that synced to a lot of my personal information and business information.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   I just took them off.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   I'm like, you know, if I lose the phone, I'm on vacation.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   I don't want to worry about someone figuring out that I've got, you know, an account on this particular system.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   It's just not taking the app off the phone.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   So some of those worries just go away, assuming that it works.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   And the thing that Apple has not really clarified from what I understand among the tippet staffers this morning, they just haven't really clarified it, is how will this fingerprint skinner system interact with the new iCloud key chain that we're hoping we'll see back in iOS seven soon,
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   possibly when Mavericks comes out.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   And to what extent will your fingerprint let you into anything you've got synced in your iCloud key chain, which will let you access web passwords, web logins in Safari.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   So that is a big question.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   And I'm just very excited about it.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   And the other thing I like about it is it's sort of Apple acknowledging what I think is a huge complaint among users.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   Users don't like entering passwords.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   They don't like remembering them.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   They don't like typing them.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   They don't like re typing them.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   They don't like the fact that they have to have numbers and special characters and wacky stuff, especially when you're typing that on a small keyboard.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   And by Apple sort of saying, "Hey, we get it.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   This is a huge pain.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   We're at least trying to put in a feature that makes sense here."
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   It's just acknowledging to the user of something that is not working very well and that it sort of feels caring on Apple's part to put something in the future.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   And that hopefully will improve that every day.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   Is there experience?
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   That's a great observation.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   It didn't occur to me that if you trust the walls and the door and the lock that you've just passed through, once you're inside that area, you can feel a little bit.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   You can sort of like, you know, take off your pants and walk around with what I'm wearing about, you know, being a little more casual about where you are.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   If you feel as though that's a very, very secure zone.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   Apple does seem--
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   That's an interesting analogy.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   I like it.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   I am a communicator.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   [laughter]
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   I will leave those of you who are listening as opposed to watching about how I've illustrated this point that I've just made.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   Apple does seem to have paid close attention to how they implement this.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   The only trip ups that--and this is something that Wall Street Journal has put talked about in a blog as I think they talked to someone at Apple who mentioned that if you've got sweaty fingers, that's going to be a problem.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   If you've got lotion on your fingers, that's also going to be a problem that seems like obvious that if there's something that is given that you are just putting your finger on something that's essentially a scanner, an optical scanner, something that's going to smear your fingerprint is not going to help out.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   Also warning that if you have scars on your fingertips, if you have a background character in a 1930s, gangster movie who has dipped your fingertips and acid to remove your fingerprints, also possibly a problem if you've removed all of your fingerprints.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   I like the fact that it's not as though Apple has done away with the passcode and replaced with a fingerprint.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   There are still instances in which it will still ask for your passcode.
[00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   If you have not, for instance, used your fingerprint authentication in X number of time, it will default to, "Okay, we're going to have to ask you to do two-step authentication before we will let you authenticate with your thumbprint again."
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   One thing that's kind of occurred to me though, as I was fooling around with it and going through the menus last week, that you can authenticate up to five fingers.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   That's really important because sometimes you take your phone out with your left hand, sometimes with your right hand, sometimes it might be on your desk.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   You might want to authenticate with your index finger.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   But let's say that, again, if you've got more than two kids, then cumulatively your children are far more clever than you are and far more devious.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   And if let's say that your passcode has been compromised for a three-day period, can your kid now use your one, two, three, four password to authenticate his finger?
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   And now he can actually get into your phone and make more purchases for a Simpsons tapped out or something like that.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   So, please, I would step in and say that actually you want your kids to be able to get into your phone.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   For instance, my son is my text message reader in the car.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   He's completely in charge of the iPhone in the car. He's like my theory assistant and I absolutely will be giving him a fingerprint on my phone, same with my husband.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   This is great. They can get in my phone and nobody has to memorize anymore passwords.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   I mean, they'll probably still need to know what the password is for a backup, but thankfully, they probably won't memorize it.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   So, at least they'll be able to get in some of the time very easily.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   Yeah. Well, that's that. Go ahead. I'm sorry. We're not going to say one of the things I like is how deeply Apple see and it looks like Apple's been working on this for years.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   It's not just they bought a company last year and implemented it, but they've been working on this literally for several years now.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   And they, for example, they scan the subdermal layers, not just the skin on top. It's the living skin underneath.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   So, you know, morbidity aside, dead fingers won't unlock your phone.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   They also keep it on the hard way. We'll have to test that out for a frankly.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   The guy you're Canadian innocent. You don't know how life is here in these United States. We'll we'll figure that one out. Someone will get past that.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   And the people who are looking at it so far say like it literally stays on the hardware. It doesn't even get put into RAM. So it goes from the sensor to the chip so that you don't have to worry about some clever developer or agency figuring out a way to pull it, you know, from anywhere that Apple doesn't intend it to go.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   And I know there's a lot of people who say, you know, I'm going to put a sticker over this the same way I put a stick over my web camera or my microphone.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   But if you're willing, if you're willing to have your identity proven by this device, it looks like Apple is going the extra mile to make sure it's as secure, as easy and as robust a process as possible.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   And that's just exactly what Mike said. That's the hallmark of the kinds of technologies that they slowly roll out.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   Yeah, my understanding is that no software on the phone even has access to the authentication process. All it can do is ask the hardware. Could you please use the, could you please authenticate this user?
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   And then this there is a secure portion of the A7 process that handles that. And then it simply gets back a yes or a no. And what was the check sum? Not telling you.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   Well, is your pretty sure or just really sure I'm telling you, I vouch for this person. Are you asking me if I'm going to vouch for it? I'm telling you I vouch for him. That's all I'm going to do for you.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   So yeah, because if if there were like a, if there were like a hash that represented a unique signature represented by your fingerprint and that got out that because you could, I can change my passcode changing my fingerprints.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   Whole other issue. And I'm not sure if it's as easy as going through the dictionary and finding a word, another, yet another send in them for dragon that I don't think anybody else has thought of yet.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   But getting back to the A7. That's there's been a lot of discussion about whether or not we're, this is just the five S is just the first device we're going to see that has the A7.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   It's a natural to think that we're going to see that in whatever refreshed iPad comes out, hopefully later on this year. But I'm surprised at how much traction people are giving to the idea of the A7 processor as the heart of a Macbook air next year.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   What do you think about that Mike visit to I think I thought that the.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   I'm not sure that I understand enough about the A7 to be able to answer the question what problem will the A7 solve that Intel's household strategy is not going to solve. I mean, this year's processors are already doing kick ass for for for power constraints.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   Next year's wave of updates is going to even be even better. So I'm not sure I understand what problem the A7 would solve.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   I don't know either and I've long suspected that Apple's long strategy is to move iOS up into the general desktop space the general laptop space and sort of eventually have a system where the content consumers are all using iOS and the content
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   creators are all using OS 10 or something like that. And so it could be that they want to just take all the mobile stuff as it becomes as more as a law makes it all more powerful and move it all up like the Jeffersons.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   I don't know one or the other but one of the questions that I wanted to ask the panel because I personally don't know a lot of the promise of of a 64 bit processing requires a heck of a lot of RAM.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   And do we even know how much RAM is going to be in the new iPhone.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   It's I mean the numbers on the chipset are being read as one gigabyte as an outside chance there's more.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   Although I mean 64 bit it does it has a lot to do with the amount of registers you can read it once which is sort of like the old thing you know you can keep stuff in RAM you don't have to go to the hard disk.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   This way you can keep more on the chip you don't even have to go to RAM. So it speeds it up that way.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   And the instruction set is so much faster anyway that you get a lot of the boost that Apple was suggesting.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   Yeah I mean it's a surprisingly controversial question because with a lot of things I've read saying that 64 bit doesn't won't change anything and other other articles saying it will change everything.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   And the more persuasive ones to me are the ones that say that that route of 64 bit processing will change everything radically but not yet.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   And so I'm really curious I mean it's just kind of an exciting that's one of the most exciting things about this whole thing is what is really what's really going to be like to really work hard on this thing and see what kind of performance it gets.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   But yeah it's a mystery but you also don't know the extent to which what Apple's relationship is within tell.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   And I'd be curious to be a fly on the wall to know what's going on there but who knows.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   One of the interesting things is and this is I believe this is a record yeah Apple's been working on putting OS 10 on ARM for years I mean I've heard about it as a serious project.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   And I think it's a very interesting project.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   And I think it's a very interesting project.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   And I think it's a very interesting project.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   And I think it's a very interesting project.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   And I think it's a very interesting project.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   And I think it's a very interesting project.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   And I think it's a very interesting project.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   And I think it's a very interesting project.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   And I think it's a very interesting project.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   And it might be non not intuitive at first but we start thinking about a very light MacBook Air like product that gets 24 hours of battery life.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   And does a limited amount of computing but lets you do it for an incredibly long period of time.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   And that Apple can control that ship set and its destiny in a way far beyond what it can do with Intel and their roadmap.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   It seems like a very Apple thing to do given both their history and where it looks like they're going.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   I mean it's very much in style for what Apple would be thinking to even if they're largely happy with their relationship with Intel to make sure that they have a plan B ready just in case things go sour or whether they have a better opportunity in a couple of years.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   I kind of it when all of this talk about the 64 bit hardware.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   It really the message that I really heard last week was not so much.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   Hey look we've got this phone with a 64 bit processor but that we are updating our entire mobile library for 64 bits.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   So I was I was thinking more along the lines of a year or two from now a more powerful iOS based iPad or something or a new idea that is kind of a better hybrid between a and iPad and a MacBook Air because right now we've well established that I love the iPad and I use it
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   every single day for real real work but there's still so many things that it could do better if you're going to be using it as a real real work machine.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   So I think it's more of a vote for 64 bit software in the next few years than necessarily having the a7 become the new standard for for the Mac.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   But first and foremost video editing I think is what would benefit the most probably for most users with a much more powerful iPad.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   But are people really going to be using the iPad for serious video editing?
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   I think they would I mean I serious I mean I think most people won't be doing serious what what what we what we communicate with call serious but I currently edit my all my videos on YouTube on the in the cloud.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   So any improvement on that would be welcomed by me personally.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   And also I just corrected myself there it's so easy to think in traditional terms that when I think about powerful video editing I think of also why would someone want to run final cut on an iPad.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   But we've just seen last week demonstrations of we've just not to get back on.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:54.000]   We're talking about the camera earlier and that's probably the one user facing feature that I'm most excited about that if you want to see the power of the a7 chip it's the idea that you know what we are just going to always be looking at.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   And deciding what kind of looking at the scene whenever you have the camera app open so that by the time you touch that shutter we've already essentially taken that photo 80 million different times and figured out exactly the way to do it.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   And we're going to take multiple pictures and create a single synthetic image that has tone mapping because we have that much power there.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   So now you've got me after correcting myself thinking about well what could you do with the video editor if you have enough ome that you could that the app could actually look at your entire 38 minutes worth of a phone.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   And I think it's worth of of 1080 HD video and know that while here is shots of medium shots of people with faces looking at the camera here are wide shots with motion here wide shots that are static after after producing a shot list like that
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   can we simply do a really good rough edit for the user just by the virtue of the fact we have this kick ass processor on this little mobile device so it's it's I'm humbled and chastising myself to remember that the powerful editing powerful photo
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:58.000]   powerful software is a very different thing when you when you put it through apples filter of what power actually means.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   I think where we're headed I mean where this is really going is that we're headed for the elimination of a difference between video and still photography where everything will be video and every frame of video will be a really beautiful still photograph.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   And so instead of just capturing that specific moment you know you you'll just hold your phone up in the photo mode and then you'll just be a wheel or some kind of interface that allows you to quickly go through and say that's the one I want push a button
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   and then you'll just be able to go to Facebook or whatever and I think that you know we're really getting not just with phones of course but with all digital cameras to the point where you know in 10 10 or 15 years we may you know people may not look at still photos and video as being so different.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   Same thing. I mean I'm sorry I interrupted you earlier about when you said that the iPhone 5 is the best camera out there. It's obviously a subjective opinion I think that after using the Lumia 1020 in the Nokia for a couple of months.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   And then using it side by side with the iPhone 5. I don't think the iPhone 5 is in its class. And I'm also but I only bring that up because that's that's I think that I think that you're going to see a real dual with in philosophies a battle of philosophies between a phone like the Lumia 1020 in the iPhone 5S where the Lumia has incredible hardware features that cause it to make take great pictures I don't think that the 5S has that wonderful
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   balance dual LED flash but it's still an LED it can't do what a strobe flash can do which is what the Lumia 1020 has the Lumia 1020 it's a lot of a lot has been said about its 40 megapixel image sensor.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   But with the real effect of the image sensor isn't taking 40 megapixel sensors but taking a beautiful 5 megapixel image that's a slice of wherever you want to move it so it really does have a zoom.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   feature that I've been using a lot and the third thing is the level of control that you have over every single camera setting there's the difference between for me the iPhone 5 nothing and the Lumia is that I can't think of any situation in which I was not able to take a picture with the Lumia
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   which is not something that I associate with any other phone including the iPhone 5 we've all been there where some place where to take a picture of a kid or one of our family members are just a cool scene and you take the picture doesn't work we try tap to focus tap to expose doesn't work and we simply put the phone back in our pocket because we say okay this is simply one of those pictures that a camera phone cannot take.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:42.000]   And so the Lumia doesn't have that restriction however that my frustration with the Lumia is the same as with most other phones in that it just does not understand color balance as well as apple seems to know what it is it doesn't understand.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   It doesn't understand the how humans emotionally react to a picture the way that apple puts that into everything that's every single thing they do so I really think that that's going to be again a battle of philosophies do you get a great picture by putting in great hardware do you get a great picture by trying to be
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   smart enough to look at the data that's being collected and use it to build something that you think the humans are going to enjoy.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:10.000]   So I don't know if there's going to be a winner I think it's going to be a choice of what you like what pleases you.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   Well speaking of humans enjoying it I mean the biggest elephant in the Lumia living room is the fact that it doesn't run out of L.S. or Android.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   So it's almost like you know I think for the average consumer who needs to be part of one of the two big app ecosystems etc.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   It's almost like a standalone digital camera it's out there it's outside of the world of what's happening in terms of apps.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   Yeah exactly so so it's.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   In my review at compared to between the comparison between iOS Android and Windows phone it's like the difference between living in New York living in Brooklyn
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.880]   and living in Boston where there are three very nice cities if you have an iPhone you live in New York meaning if you want to get a
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:15:02.000]   coniche at 3 30 in the morning you get a coniche you get all the first one first run Broadway shows you get to see Louis CK testing out material before his national tour.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   If you live in Brooklyn you have access to that but it's a little bit more of a hassle to get there you maybe you have to wait an hour or half an hour to get to their Boston is lovely.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   I live I live in the Boston area all my life it's a wonderful city should consider moving and raising you we hear raising your kids here but you're going to get the roadshow of Book of Mormon you're going to have to like you know get a coniche when the store is open
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   and you'll be lucky if Lucy cave and plays here as opposed to anything like that but the but the the interesting thing is this might be something that that would be great for everyone to really chime in on.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   We all care about this stuff there is a level sometimes I wonder if we care about this way way more than ordinary users do I mean yes windows phone has a miniscule app library compared to iOS or Android but it's got the hits you can get
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   you can get Netflix on it.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.120]   It works well with Evernote and all that sort of stuff.
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.800]   Google's has absolutely no interest in developing anything
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.260]   that's native for it, and you're never going to see a good game,
[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:03.460]   or you're never going to see a good service for it
[01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:04.760]   in the first year, if ever.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:10.640]   But maybe a phone that does the core functions extremely well
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:12.400]   but also has this kick butt camera,
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:15.360]   which means that you're going to have a beautiful picture
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.060]   of your kids and your dogs as opposed to one
[01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:18.960]   that's kind of okay.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:19.960]   I don't know.
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:21.760]   I mean, how do you make that argument?
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.960]   And everyone wants to chime in on that?
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:28.280]   Well, the way I make it is that the people who care
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.880]   about super high quality pictures,
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.680]   people care about the difference between an iPhone 5
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:35.440]   or iPhone 5 S quality picture and a Lumia picture,
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:40.600]   are the same people who care about all the apps and geeks.
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.480]   And by the way, the other thing, one of the best things
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:45.320]   about the iOS platform is the hardware add-ons,
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:47.120]   the sort of hardware version of apps.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:54.560]   Like, you know, I write a lot about low cost smartphone-based
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:57.860]   home automation, and almost everything is iPhone-based.
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:00.140]   All the little things that replace the people
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:02.300]   that use an old iPhone for a camera,
[01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:03.840]   and the thing that communicates with your dog
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:06.780]   and drops a doggy bone over the internet
[01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:09.660]   and all this kind of stuff, those are all iOS compatible things.
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:11.420]   If you have a Lumia, you're completely outside
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:18.380]   of the entire world of smartphone aftermarket fun stuff.
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.780]   But back to the point, it's the same people.
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:24.180]   You know, most people are uploading to Facebook.
[01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:28.100]   Facebook will destroy your photographs
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:31.500]   through lousy compression and aggressive compression.
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:33.660]   It doesn't matter what phone you took it with.
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:35.940]   Unless you're uploading it to Google+
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:38.220]   and have like you've gone through the whole--
[01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:40.260]   you've opted into the thing where it doesn't
[01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:43.060]   modify your pictures or you're using Flickr.
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:45.940]   In other words, unless you're in some small, tiny subgroup
[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:48.260]   of people who really, really care about photographs,
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:50.500]   it doesn't matter what quality your picture is,
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.420]   because Facebook's going to wreck it.
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:55.820]   That also makes the case that even the Samsung Galaxy S3
[01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:57.660]   that you're getting for free, even the iPhone 4,
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:59.380]   which you can get for free on that level,
[01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:01.620]   is as good as the iPhone 5S camera.
[01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:04.980]   I mean, in terms of what people are going to care about.
[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:06.500]   Toni, what do you like?
[01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:10.420]   I think people, for the most part, normal people really--
[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:11.780]   it's not that they don't care.
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:13.820]   It's just that they're focused on the other things.
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.660]   So it comes up so low on their care list
[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:18.780]   that they end up effectively not caring.
[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:21.980]   I think most people get smartphones just on a whim
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:25.420]   and more ideally because their friends have a similar phone
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:27.980]   or their other family members have a similar phone
[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:30.900]   because then they get this energy of learning from each other
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:33.820]   or more readily sharing stuff.
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:39.540]   Yeah, I mean, that's why-- but I think before the show,
[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:41.980]   I was talking to Mike because he's using the--
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:45.500]   or he was using the Moto X, which is a phone that I absolutely
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.580]   love and man, if it had a better camera,
[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:51.580]   that might very possibly be my next phone or--
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:55.820]   excuse me-- without knowing anything about the iPhone 5S,
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:58.820]   that would have been-- the iPhone 5S is--
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:01.300]   I got to admit, it's an FV phone.
[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:01.860]   I like the phone.
[01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:03.300]   It's kind of a tempting phone.
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:06.500]   But one of these people who cares enough about photography,
[01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:10.060]   that the fact that, OK, the Moto will take OK photos
[01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:14.220]   that I can fix when I get them into aperture.
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:16.060]   We should take better pictures, though.
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:19.940]   But you can take mediocre pictures fast for the Moto X.
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:21.940]   And it works very, very easily.
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:25.860]   I mean, it's cool to see the effect
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:28.060]   that Apple has had, the positive effect it's
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:31.060]   had on so many other phone makers that I really
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:34.660]   do think that the folks at Motorola who made the camera app
[01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:37.100]   that's now on all of their, like their droid phones,
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:39.700]   as well as the Moto X, their idea was, no, it really
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:43.100]   should be more like what the iPhone does,
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:44.940]   where there is one button.
[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:47.580]   You tap this one button, you get a picture.
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:50.700]   And now because I am the phone and I have all these smarts,
[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:52.740]   it's my job after you tap that one button
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:55.060]   to figure out how to make a good picture out of this.
[01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:57.140]   Again, it's too bad that the hardware kind of lets it down.
[01:19:57.140 --> 01:20:01.300]   But it's an interesting way of separating that
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:05.980]   between the Samsung's camera app, which is we have one button,
[01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:10.420]   one slider switch, one drop down menu, one A/B switch,
[01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:12.220]   one slide in tab.
[01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:15.260]   I mean, the idea of one of the things I love about the Lumia
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:18.260]   is that the human brain is still really, really good
[01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:20.460]   at looking at a picture and deciding what's wrong.
[01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:22.700]   It's like, I look at the picture that's got shot.
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:25.700]   I can say, I really want that to be not quite so bright.
[01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:27.780]   On the Lumia, tap a button and you have a little slider
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.740]   that lets you simply take that down a stop.
[01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:31.780]   You can say, you keep moving until it's perfect
[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:32.900]   and then you let go.
[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:35.380]   On a Samsung, it's okay, what menu is that behind?
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:37.660]   And now what sub menu is that behind?
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:38.980]   And how long is that gonna stick?
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:39.980]   It's like, I can't see that.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:42.140]   - Can you get out the manual, you start flipping pages?
[01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:45.420]   - Oh, yes, I mean, people who think that I talk too much
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:47.180]   about Android and that I'm an Android fanboy,
[01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:49.580]   you should see me inside a museum after the battery
[01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:51.700]   for my real camera has died and I've got to rely
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:54.180]   on this damn thing for all my pictures.
[01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:55.380]   (laughing)
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:58.380]   But yeah, I mean, that really is the most,
[01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:03.380]   such a user facing feature because everyone has LTE,
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:06.380]   everyone except for Apple has larger screens.
[01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:08.860]   Everyone has all these really interesting features.
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:11.820]   It's taking a picture and seeing how good that picture is
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:15.860]   is one of the few things that are left where any company
[01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:18.540]   can really stand head and shoulders over any other company
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:21.500]   by giving you a knockout photo.
[01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:24.060]   And if you look through your camera roll,
[01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:28.820]   you'll see, if you kept enough photos on your camera roll,
[01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:31.100]   you will come across that picture where,
[01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:34.740]   thank God you had a halfway decent phone in your pocket
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:37.180]   or camera in your pocket because here is a moment
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:40.020]   that would have like, you didn't know that,
[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:42.420]   when you left the house, this is gonna be the last time
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:44.180]   you got to play with your dog before he got sick
[01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:46.780]   and was not there for you when he came back again.
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:50.820]   I hate to bring it down, but that's the price of the camera
[01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:51.860]   that's always in your pocket.
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:53.940]   You just take lots and lots of pictures with it
[01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:55.860]   and you don't know how significant a photo is
[01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:58.180]   until you realize how three months later that,
[01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:01.420]   oh boy, if I'm so glad I had this chance
[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:03.940]   to take this one picture or even something like,
[01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:05.980]   gee, I was so happy at this part of that.
[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:08.500]   I was just commuting home and I saw this beautiful thing
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:10.940]   and this reminds me of how happy I was at that moment.
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:11.940]   That's the sort of thing where,
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:13.380]   I mean, they're people who just kind of dump things
[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:16.580]   to Instagram and then do horrible, horrible.
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:19.500]   I mean, some of the things that Instagram does to photos,
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.180]   they should be brought up in front of the tribunal
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:23.420]   at the Hague for the things that Instagram does
[01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:26.500]   to these beautiful pictures of the iPhone is taking.
[01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:27.980]   But I mean, it's great that you have to--
[01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:30.380]   - But you're actually bringing up another weakness
[01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:34.220]   of the iPhone which is that, compared to other systems,
[01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:36.620]   I know Andy that you, in addition to using the Moto X,
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:39.300]   also use Google Glass.
[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:42.460]   And one of the things that makes a good photo good
[01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:45.940]   is the ability to take a picture very quickly.
[01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:48.900]   You see something that's a moment that happens for one second.
[01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:50.780]   And if you don't ever take the picture,
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:53.180]   then it's not a good picture.
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:55.540]   And if you can capture it, wow, what an amazing picture
[01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:57.700]   because you captured this fleeting moment.
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:58.820]   And you can do that with Google Glass,
[01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:00.220]   you can do that with the Moto X.
[01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:04.780]   And it would be great for Apple to do more Moto X type things
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:06.740]   to-- 'cause they certainly have--
[01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:10.700]   they seem to have a lot more processing power than they--
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:14.220]   you know, so for those unfamiliar with Moto X,
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:16.980]   you sort of twist your wrist twice to turn on the camera
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:18.340]   and it's ready to take pictures.
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:20.220]   There's like a second lag or so.
[01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:22.220]   And then you just touch anywhere on the screen.
[01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:23.620]   It auto focuses.
[01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:27.300]   It doesn't focus where you touch unless you choose that setting.
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:29.780]   But the default mode is you touch the screen
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:33.020]   and it will take pictures as fast as it can.
[01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:34.980]   As fast as it can, it's pretty much a picture
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:36.100]   of the three quarters of a second.
[01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:37.700]   So it's not that fast, maybe a half second.
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:39.980]   It's not that fast.
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:43.340]   What would be killer for Apple with all this amazing hardware
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:47.060]   and stuff to have a quick go straight to the camera gesture
[01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:48.700]   and then just be able to do rapid fire.
[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:50.300]   I mean, I have a Canon EOS 7D,
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:53.180]   which can take eight pictures a second
[01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:55.260]   and do that for 130 seconds.
[01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:57.940]   Many of my best ones where people,
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:00.180]   I fool people into thinking I'm a good photographer,
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:02.260]   is the fact that I took 100 pictures
[01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:05.980]   and one of them by some miracle happened to be a good photo.
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:09.380]   You know, that's just a basic fundamental thing,
[01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:12.220]   the speed of how quickly can I be taking pictures
[01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:15.980]   and how many pictures can I take in three seconds?
[01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:18.140]   Like that would be great for Apple to really get on,
[01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:19.140]   you know, on board with that.
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:22.220]   Or at least, you know, at least,
[01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:23.860]   there are apps that do that.
[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:26.220]   So maybe that's good enough for the enthusiasts,
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:29.020]   but that's one area that I like to see them improve.
[01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:30.540]   - They don't have the gesture stuff yet.
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:33.260]   They do have the fast camera access button on the lock screen,
[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:34.660]   which is, it's better than it used to be,
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:37.140]   but you just pull it up and you can start taking photos.
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:38.780]   iPhone 5S has burst mode,
[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:40.220]   so you hold your finger down on the button,
[01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:41.580]   it'll take 10 photos a second
[01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:43.420]   as long as you're holding your finger down.
[01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:46.260]   But in some imaginary world where this wasn't NDA
[01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:48.260]   and someone had been doing, for example,
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:50.100]   rapid fire tests on an iPad 2,
[01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:52.860]   which is one of the oldest hardware to get iOS 7,
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:54.660]   the speed of the shutter,
[01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:57.300]   and they've shown this off on stage on iOS 7 is amazing.
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:59.540]   And if you just tap your finger over and over again
[01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:00.900]   on older iPhones,
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:03.580]   you're gonna have a really pleasant surprise come Wednesday.
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:04.620]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:06.220]   And there are a lot of cameras like that.
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:09.980]   But I think that the pendulum of history
[01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:13.460]   is really going towards the approach of Apple and the Moto X.
[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:16.780]   The other thing that the Moto X does is it will intelligently
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:18.580]   figure out that, okay, there is no way in hell
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:19.740]   I'm getting a good picture out of here
[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:22.140]   unless I turn on HDR and I'm not even gonna ask,
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:24.060]   I'm just gonna make this an HDR picture.
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:28.620]   But I think that, and you brought up the Google Glass,
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:31.740]   people are often really amazed when I post something
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:33.300]   and they find out that this is something
[01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:35.780]   a photo I took with Google Glass,
[01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:38.380]   because again, it's a chintzy little thing
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:39.740]   on the side of your face,
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:41.180]   it doesn't look like it's a real camera.
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:42.700]   And that's the exact same thing it's doing.
[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:45.500]   It's using the intelligence of,
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:49.100]   it uses a very, very common imaging element,
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:51.300]   but then uses a lot of software to figure out,
[01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:52.780]   okay, how do I take this data
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:53.980]   and turn it into a great picture?
[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:56.860]   So they added in one of the first updates they did
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:59.180]   to Google Glass, they got pushed out,
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:01.180]   it will do auto HDR.
[01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:02.860]   When you put it onto Google+,
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:06.060]   they bought a NIC software a while ago
[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:09.060]   that makes those incredible aperture and Photoshop plugins.
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:12.860]   So it will automatically essentially apply $800 worth
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:14.580]   of Photoshop plugins to figure out
[01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:16.740]   how to make this picture even better.
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:19.100]   So, I mean, again, I love the Lumia,
[01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:21.060]   but I think that really,
[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:24.220]   the star of any great camera on a mobile device
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:25.700]   is going to be a great processor
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:29.420]   as opposed to necessarily great lens, great image sensor,
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:30.260]   not to denigrate.
[01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:31.740]   They also, it should be mentioned,
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:34.620]   they improve the glass considerably.
[01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:37.820]   Now it's an F2.2 instead of an F2.4.
[01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:41.100]   In my side by side, by side, by side, by side, by side tests.
[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:44.140]   One of the iPhone 5's biggest problems was that
[01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:46.420]   it was constantly looking for a slower shutter speed
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:47.980]   because it did not have that wide aperture.
[01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:50.580]   So, camera shake was going to be a problem
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:53.100]   because it can't freeze the motion.
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:54.620]   Anytime someone is moving,
[01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:58.140]   they're a blur as opposed to crisp sharp images.
[01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:00.860]   So suffice to say that I will be,
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:04.540]   I will be driving myself nuts starting from Friday onward
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:06.300]   to try to figure out which one of these cameras
[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:07.300]   is my favorite one.
[01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:10.580]   Last thing, and this is, I say,
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:12.900]   let's save the least interesting bit of,
[01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:13.740]   I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
[01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:17.180]   I talk about the 5C, poor iPhone 5C.
[01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:19.060]   Not having a really, that cool camera
[01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:22.020]   in the fingerprint sensor, all you have are fashion colors.
[01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:24.020]   And now people are thinking that you're like,
[01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:26.020]   the middle sister on the Brady Bunch now.
[01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:28.740]   (laughing)
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:30.940]   I'll say that I certainly thought it was,
[01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:32.380]   it was better than I thought it was going to be
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:35.780]   because I was sort of anticipating last year's hardware
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:37.700]   using new manufacturing techniques
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:39.860]   to make it a viable $99 phone,
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:41.420]   but they really did update,
[01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:43.540]   it really is a 2013 phone.
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:45.500]   And it's not a 2012 phone,
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:47.740]   which pleased me a lot.
[01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:52.060]   Was, Renee, was that your take from a two?
[01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:52.900]   - Yeah, no, absolutely.
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:55.740]   I mean, I think we saw some of the period worst period
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:58.100]   Apple analysis ever over the last week,
[01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:00.660]   just based on people who had assumptions on other markets
[01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:02.020]   and weren't really attuned to how Apple
[01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:03.500]   has historically done business.
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.060]   But this was an incredibly Apple camera,
[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:06.380]   the Apple phone.
[01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:08.260]   They took something that was hard to manufacture
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:10.460]   that they would have previously dropped $100
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:12.300]   and tried to sell, it was sold,
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:14.220]   but it would have been a pain in the butt for them to do it.
[01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:16.300]   And they made it much easier to manufacture.
[01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:17.900]   It's got much more mainstream appeal
[01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:21.580]   because colors are really appealing to a lot of people.
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:23.180]   They improved the FaceTime camera,
[01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:25.780]   although Craig Federico did not say selfies,
[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:27.460]   he did say self portraits.
[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:29.900]   And it's got the better LTE bands,
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:31.380]   so it's more available in more countries,
[01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:33.220]   including TDD LTE,
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:35.340]   which is what you need to go to China.
[01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:37.420]   It was never gonna be a cheap phone,
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:39.260]   it was always gonna be less expensive.
[01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:40.780]   And it's very much in the pattern
[01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:44.500]   of the iPod mini, the iPad mini, even the Mac mini,
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:48.020]   where it just adds a little bit more addressable market
[01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:48.980]   to Apple.
[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:51.580]   And if you can increase your addressable market
[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:52.900]   even by a little bit,
[01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:55.260]   it's a phenomenal increase in revenue.
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:57.500]   And I think this shows that Apple,
[01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:58.900]   they'll do the big phone next year,
[01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:01.420]   this year they're doing the slight increase
[01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:03.820]   in the affordability phone.
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:06.740]   - Yeah, I mean, I did a big analysis
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:10.220]   on what colors mean in China and elsewhere in Asia.
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:12.860]   And I really think that the colors,
[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:15.020]   they're gonna be nice in the US,
[01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:16.660]   the kids are gonna love them.
[01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:19.220]   It solves the problem of how do you,
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:22.180]   a lot of Asian phone companies like to sell
[01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:24.740]   a target phones at girls and women.
[01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:25.700]   And they do it by saying,
[01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:27.260]   "Oh, it looks just like a makeup case
[01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:28.340]   "and it's pink and all this stuff."
[01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:30.420]   And then they get eviscerated in the Western press
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:31.860]   by saying, "At Texas, it's horrible,
[01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:34.060]   "you think there are a bunch of ditzes and so on."
[01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:36.940]   And it's a big controversial thing.
[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:39.020]   These guys, and also MotoX, by the way,
[01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:41.620]   come up with a way to have a pink phone,
[01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:45.020]   which is gonna be very popular all over the world.
[01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:47.740]   Without saying, "Oh, here's a girly phone for the girls
[01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:49.260]   "that's pink and trivial."
[01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:54.140]   So that's also having cases with contrasting colors.
[01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:56.980]   So I mean, I think that this is sort of Apple
[01:29:56.980 --> 01:29:58.700]   waving the white flag and saying that,
[01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:00.620]   "Okay, we've been telling you,
[01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:02.620]   "we've put so much effort into the design.
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:04.500]   "You said that you want to put it in a case anyway.
[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.300]   "Can we at least convince you not to put it inside
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:08.300]   "a crappy looking case?"
[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:10.420]   But I don't think people realize the degree to which
[01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:12.260]   colors have a lot of symbolism in China.
[01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:16.140]   In fact, Apple's offered black and white.
[01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:19.820]   And both of those colors have extremely negative connotations
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:23.100]   in China relating to death and misfortune.
[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:25.860]   And there's a lot of the cultural things that we don't
[01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:29.060]   really talk a lot about that exist in other countries.
[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:31.140]   In our own countries, they're invisible to us.
[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:34.500]   The association of pink with girls, blue with boys,
[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:35.300]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:36.500]   Like we think those are normal,
[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:38.380]   but then other people's associations aren't.
[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:43.380]   So for example, gold is a huge symbolic color.
[01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:46.700]   Yellow also is a big one.
[01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:48.300]   Everybody likes blue globally.
[01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:50.180]   There's a whole study that's been done about
[01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:52.580]   the associations, the cultural associations of color.
[01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:55.660]   So just to wrap this part up,
[01:30:55.660 --> 01:31:00.660]   I just not only are color associations in the abstract,
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:04.180]   much more important in China and some of these other markets
[01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:09.180]   that China is one third of the smart global phone market,
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:10.180]   by the way, it's huge.
[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:14.180]   It's the most important market by far.
[01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:16.020]   Not only are color associations more important,
[01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:19.020]   but then the specific colors that they came out with
[01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:23.380]   have been very tightly targeted to appeal
[01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:27.180]   to the Chinese market and to a lesser extent
[01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:28.420]   to the Indian market.
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:32.300]   I think there's gonna be a huge rush of market share
[01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:33.420]   once these things get out there
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:35.020]   and people see them in the flesh.
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:36.020]   They're all gonna want them.
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:39.100]   And the colors are a truly important thing actually.
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:41.540]   - I thought their colors were kind of weird.
[01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:44.940]   I mean, they were very creamy sort of colors.
[01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:46.940]   Tanya, what was your reaction to the 5C?
[01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:53.340]   - I think that the colors are actually important
[01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:55.780]   for lots of different markets,
[01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:57.540]   already good comments about China,
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:32:00.380]   but I think that some people just feel like
[01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:02.620]   they're not iPhone kind of people.
[01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:05.940]   The iPhone is kind of too sophisticated,
[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:10.700]   two James Bondi, two elitist, two fancy,
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:13.460]   and that's something that just has a more of a,
[01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:15.020]   I don't know, a low brow look.
[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:17.980]   No, the plastic colors are not super,
[01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:20.740]   they're not like beautiful colors.
[01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:22.860]   I don't think most people would feel that they're beautiful,
[01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:27.580]   not most folks in North America anyway,
[01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:31.060]   but they have a different kind of appeal.
[01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:33.420]   And so I think that is going to be very important.
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:36.180]   Now for Apple, not only strategically,
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:38.900]   are they just getting out there with a whole lot more colors,
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:40.740]   they're also getting out there with a product
[01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:42.460]   that they can make a lot more easily.
[01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:44.460]   So they're gonna have a higher profit margin,
[01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:46.660]   not gonna be very important for them too.
[01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:48.420]   So I think it's exciting.
[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:51.380]   And what I would love is if Apple would publish
[01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:55.420]   the statistics on how many of the different colors
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:57.780]   are purchased and maybe break it out by country
[01:32:57.780 --> 01:32:58.980]   or some other demographics.
[01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:01.700]   I think that would be really fun to look at.
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:03.740]   - Yeah, there was some reports somewhere about
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:06.180]   how the yellow was already back ordered.
[01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:08.260]   I checked this morning and really,
[01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:11.340]   any color you want, it'll ship on the ship date.
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:12.620]   That's right.
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:15.900]   There's a, we need to sort of move along.
[01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:20.780]   So let's just all like, just like on Sunday services,
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:22.500]   you have to say the Lord's Prayer.
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:25.060]   We will say that stock analysts,
[01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:27.860]   our stock responded to the announcements
[01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:30.060]   by having a dip in the stock price.
[01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:32.220]   And this means nothing because who cares
[01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:33.820]   what the stock price means when you're making
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:36.620]   as much money as Apple does.
[01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:37.460]   Amen. - Amen.
[01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:38.300]   - Amen.
[01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:39.140]   - Amen.
[01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:41.900]   - We'll take a break.
[01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:43.420]   Which, if we're a message from the Vyar,
[01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:46.300]   good friend, Leel Uport from our friends at Audible.
[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:48.820]   - Hi Andy and everybody, thank you for letting me interrupt.
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:50.540]   I wanna talk a little bit about Audible.com.
[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:52.180]   You know we love Audible.com.
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:53.380]   Andy's a big Audible fan.
[01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:54.700]   I'm a big Audible fan.
[01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:58.220]   That's because when I was commuting from tech TV
[01:33:58.220 --> 01:34:00.100]   two hours a day in the car,
[01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:02.500]   road rage was always just around the corner.
[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:06.020]   Audible saved me from strangling some other driver
[01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:08.260]   because I was listening to great audiobooks.
[01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:11.620]   I have literally, since 2000, since I joined Audible,
[01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:13.860]   listened to over 500 books.
[01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:15.500]   I would have probably never read,
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:16.420]   and that's what's great about it.
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:19.060]   It brought literature back into my life.
[01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:22.940]   It brought nonfiction, great stories, biographies,
[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:26.060]   thrillers, I read practically all the Stephen King novels.
[01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:28.020]   I read all the Aubrey Matcheron novels.
[01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:31.500]   I love Audible.com, I know you will too.
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:35.980]   They are the guys for audiobooks, 150,000 titles,

[01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:05.980]   In fact, I listen to Andy's record.

[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:22.700]   Audible.com/MacBreak, Andy,
[01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:23.860]   what are you listening to these days?
[01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:25.060]   Will it Andy tell us?
[01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:29.900]   - A really exciting book that just got released last week.
[01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:31.740]   It's called "Hollywood Said No",
[01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:33.900]   orphaned film scripts, bastard scenes,
[01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:36.940]   and abandoned darlings from the creators of "Mr. Show".
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:40.060]   It's written by David Cross and Bob Odenkirk.
[01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:42.500]   I should not have to explain to you what "Mr. Show" is,
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:46.100]   incredible sketch comedy show that aired on HBO.
[01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:49.220]   The bad news for the show was that HBO didn't particularly
[01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:51.420]   care much about it, which is why you even can't
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:53.340]   get it on HBO Go app.
[01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:55.220]   The good news is that they didn't care much about it,
[01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:56.580]   which meant that they let these guys,
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:59.580]   just, and these women do whatever they wanted,
[01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:03.820]   and the influence of the show can't be overstated.
[01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:05.820]   It's so good.
[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:08.220]   And so this is a collection of all bunches of scripts
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:10.220]   that they've had for screenplays, for sketches
[01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:13.100]   that cannot be produced now, that's kind of dead projects,
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:15.060]   and they thought that, well, we may as well share this
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:17.660]   with people rather than just leave them on ourselves.
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:19.660]   So it is a book, but for the audiobook,
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:21.860]   they actually even got in "Brian Prosen"
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:23.740]   and it's sort of like radio shows now.
[01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:26.540]   They're performing their scripts in a certain way.
[01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:28.740]   So it's only three hours and 49 minutes.
[01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:30.620]   You know, my philosophy, if you're getting a free book,
[01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:33.860]   you may as well stick it to the man and get the underbridge Bible.
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:35.740]   But you look probably more laughs than this
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:37.060]   than even in the New Testament.
[01:36:37.060 --> 01:36:39.580]   So that's my pick for this one.
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:42.100]   Before we go to "Picks of the Week", just a few quick ones.
[01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:44.780]   We're going to move on to the "Poperi" category.
[01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:46.220]   I really had to talk about this.
[01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:49.580]   (laughs)
[01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:53.420]   I was at the launch event, of course, last week.
[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:57.500]   And in "Gagit" reporter, Miriam Ware,
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:01.100]   I've been reading her stuff, I hope from "Prausker"
[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:06.060]   last time correctly, Miriam Ware was using a Lumia 1020 phone,
[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:07.820]   third appearance of the "Lumium" phone in this podcast,
[01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:09.900]   who take pictures for the site.
[01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:12.700]   And of course, unfortunately, Tim Cook was there
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:15.220]   and said, yeah, you need to get a different phone.
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:17.660]   (laughs)
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:21.100]   So that's, I think that's definitely the indication
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:23.980]   of the difference in attitude or the public perception
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:26.100]   between Tim Cook and Steve Jobs.
[01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:29.900]   It's like, I like that, I think that Tim Cook
[01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:32.660]   is definitely the sort of person who would make a joke like that.
[01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:34.820]   And if Steve Jobs, he might have made a joke like that,
[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:38.020]   but it might feel partially sinister.
[01:37:38.020 --> 01:37:42.140]   I had a chance to, through a story that's way too long
[01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:43.220]   to share here.
[01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:46.220]   This is, this happened to be my first opportunity
[01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:48.500]   to meet Shake Hands with and have a brief discussion
[01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:49.580]   with Tim Cook.
[01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:51.940]   And it was totally circumstantial.
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:54.540]   It was the sort of thing where, okay, well, it would be awkward
[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:56.460]   here if I did not have a conversation with him
[01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:57.780]   and simply said, I don't know who you are
[01:37:57.780 --> 01:37:59.340]   and I don't care who you are.
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:01.700]   And he was friendly, he was nice, he was a vonkular
[01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:03.500]   and it made me think, okay, my career is not ended
[01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.420]   because I've had a conversation with Tim Cook.
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:06.820]   (laughs)
[01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:08.220]   - I saw.
[01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:11.540]   - Is anybody else had interactions with Tim Cook like that?
[01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:14.540]   (mumbles)
[01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:17.940]   - At least this fits in with what, it's like when you find out
[01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:21.420]   that someone, that Tom Hanks really is a really nice guy
[01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:23.500]   and the impression that you've gotten over the past
[01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:25.380]   couple of years is actually true.
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:29.100]   So, neither Maryam nor I know Tim Cook very, very well,
[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:33.260]   of course, but given an opportunity to really, really
[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:36.340]   make us feel terrible, he did not, that was a cool thing.
[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:37.340]   - I didn't know how to do it.
[01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:38.180]   - She should have asked the scenario.
[01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:39.020]   - This is so ironic.
[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:39.860]   - She's fantastic.
[01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:41.420]   (laughs)
[01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:45.860]   - I don't see, even I, like I'm a fan of Google Glass,
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:48.820]   I didn't even bring it to the West Coast with me
[01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:50.820]   'cause I knew that if I were seeing anywhere
[01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:54.820]   with Google Glass inside this venue, maybe not the politic,
[01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:56.900]   maybe not politically the best thing that I could do.
[01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:59.860]   I mean, you don't worry about politics, but still it's like,
[01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:02.780]   you don't pull the Tiger's tail unless there is a result
[01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:05.300]   that requires you to get the Tiger's tail pulled.
[01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:08.700]   - You would end up with me and Leo across the street
[01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:10.580]   in the Starbucks, hence forward.
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:12.340]   (laughs)
[01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:14.380]   - On the blacklist.
[01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:19.380]   - Yes, the mobile news van has to be at least 50 yards away
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:20.380]   at all times.
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:23.300]   Other thing that, another really interesting thing
[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:26.740]   from Wired, when they're lawyers, had a really cool article
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:30.540]   about the fingerprint scanner, not necessarily about
[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:32.740]   the five S fingerprint scanner, I should point out,
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:35.780]   but fingerprint scanners in general, mentioning that
[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:39.940]   it might influence how people,
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:41.980]   people's ability to plead the Fifth Amendment
[01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:45.340]   if they are in any sort of a legal situation,
[01:39:45.340 --> 01:39:48.940]   because, and this is them, I'm going from the article here,
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:53.100]   obviously not a lawyer here, saying that if you have,
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:55.820]   if you have your data encrypted via a password,
[01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:58.460]   the law, the Fifth Amendment says that if there's information
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:00.940]   that's inside your head, the state does not have the ability
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:02.780]   to rip it out of your head.
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:05.420]   So just like they can't force you to incriminate yourself,
[01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:08.180]   you can plead the Fifth Amendment and use that tactic
[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:10.540]   with your lawyers to try to avoid having to testify
[01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:14.980]   or having to give the answers that the nation wants to give.
[01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:15.820]   The government wants to give them,
[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:17.540]   you can say I plead the Fifth Amendment.
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:21.140]   And so, if you have information that's secured
[01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:23.700]   with a password that is inside your head,
[01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:26.660]   then you can at least try to invoke the Fifth Amendment
[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:28.060]   to say, no, I'm not gonna give you the password
[01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:29.180]   to decrypt my data.
[01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:33.300]   However, according to this article, this is a fingerprint
[01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:35.660]   authentication, that's not information inside your head,
[01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:37.940]   that's just your fingerprint, you do not have knowledge
[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:39.860]   of what these loops and worlds are.
[01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:41.620]   And so this is more like if you have the keys
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:44.980]   to a safety deposit box, you could be forced,
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:48.260]   you could, she's suggesting that you would not be able
[01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:51.260]   to try to use Fifth Amendment protection
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:53.860]   to avoid having to unlock your data,
[01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:54.700]   which is pretty interesting.
[01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:57.900]   It just goes to show that every time there's new technology,
[01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:01.020]   all the great ideas, there's always something on the side
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:02.820]   of it that we haven't really figured out yet
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:06.300]   or don't understand until it gets out into the world.
[01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:08.700]   Does creep anybody out?
[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:11.340]   I mean, even if you look at it more maliciously
[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:13.500]   than a police officer, it is probably harder
[01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:15.340]   to brute force a password out of somebody
[01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:16.780]   than it is to physically restrain them
[01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:17.780]   and stick their finger on it.
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:19.620]   So it's one of those things where convenience
[01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:21.300]   is always at war with security
[01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:23.660]   and everyone has to make up an individual decision
[01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:25.380]   about how far they wanna take security
[01:41:25.380 --> 01:41:28.540]   and how much they wanna mitigate it with convenience.
[01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:29.380]   - Yeah.
[01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:33.220]   Also, are there cases where you have data written down
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:37.340]   on paper that's in a safe and you get dragged
[01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:38.900]   before the grand jury or whatever,
[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:41.140]   and they say, tell us the information
[01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:44.220]   that's inside the safe and has anybody ever said,
[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:48.780]   "Well, it's protected by a lock combination
[01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:50.380]   "that's in my head."
[01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:52.820]   And did the judge or whatever just say,
[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:55.180]   "Well, I guess we can't ever know that information.
[01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:56.700]   "Well, let's move on."
[01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:57.540]   - I think that's--
[01:41:57.540 --> 01:41:59.380]   - Has that ever even existed?
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:01.020]   - There may seem--
[01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:01.860]   - Ready?
[01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:02.740]   - You know, I think they cover that
[01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:04.540]   in the Wired article that combinations
[01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:05.940]   that are stored in your brain--
[01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:06.780]   - Exactly, they're likely.
[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:07.620]   - Exactly, they're likely.
[01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:08.460]   - And then, can you--
[01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:10.620]   - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:12.300]   - It sounds like if you wanna hide your stuff,
[01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:14.300]   you're just gonna have to think about
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:16.340]   what you secure it behind.
[01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:17.420]   - Yeah.
[01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:18.580]   - I say, I imagine--
[01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:20.500]   - Don't put it on your phone.
[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:21.860]   - I feel like if you wanna, you know,
[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:25.300]   have super illegal stuff or super secret stuff,
[01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:26.900]   you better put it somewhere else.
[01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:28.780]   And if you put it behind a password
[01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:31.500]   that you've only memorized,
[01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:33.860]   well then you've got the question of
[01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:35.940]   if you're gonna forget your password.
[01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:37.900]   So that's a problem too.
[01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:39.660]   Something to think about.
[01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:40.500]   - Yeah, I mean--
[01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:42.020]   - Before the, when the police are knocking on the door,
[01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:44.860]   put your phone in the safe and lock the safe.
[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:45.940]   In the toilet-- - Don't flush.
[01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:47.620]   - Or flush it down the toilet.
[01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:49.580]   - Because at minimum, if they take it back
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:51.220]   to the Apple store, the genius is gonna see
[01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:52.380]   that red dot inside of there,
[01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:54.500]   not gonna let the cop have a free phone.
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:56.140]   (laughing)
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:59.180]   I'm in jail, but hell with you.
[01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:01.980]   - Another nice announcement from last week
[01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:03.980]   that Apple is going to sort of extend
[01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:07.220]   its iLife strategy from the desktop to mobile.
[01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:11.340]   And now every newly purchased iPhone and iPad
[01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:12.980]   will come with, excuse me,
[01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:16.100]   will come with a license for the iLife and iWork suites.
[01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:18.780]   Just like you can, when you configure it,
[01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:21.220]   it will give you an opportunity to download iBooks
[01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:22.460]   and other free Apple software.
[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:25.820]   We'll also let you download all these commercial apps.
[01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:28.340]   I think that's a good thing because it helps people
[01:43:28.340 --> 01:43:31.060]   think of this as the powerful device that it is.
[01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:33.900]   On the other hand, I was so looking forward
[01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:37.420]   to the new collection of productivity apps
[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:40.100]   we were gonna see now that Apple has given developers
[01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:42.260]   access to really good tech styling tools
[01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:43.540]   and stuff like that.
[01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:45.780]   They're essentially saying, well, good luck competing
[01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:48.420]   with this free app that is being supported
[01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:51.420]   by 10,000 people in one of the most powerful tech companies
[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:53.980]   in the world, but if you wanna write your own word processor
[01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:56.340]   or your own business app, go ahead.
[01:43:56.340 --> 01:43:57.660]   (laughing)
[01:43:57.660 --> 01:43:59.660]   They don't even have enough engineers to reskin them, Andy.
[01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:02.300]   I mean, it's gonna be easier to do an Apple for the next year.
[01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:03.780]   There's a lot of leather to pull up there.
[01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:05.140]   You're right, absolutely right.
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:08.740]   - I agree with you, Andy, it seems like a real mixed bag
[01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:12.620]   for great for new users who maybe are on the fence
[01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:14.540]   about getting an Apple mobile device.
[01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:17.460]   They can sort of perceive that they're getting more value
[01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:21.980]   right away, but it seems perhaps typical,
[01:44:21.980 --> 01:44:25.220]   but still unfortunate of Apple to make it all the harder
[01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:28.660]   for a third party developer to compete in that space.
[01:44:28.660 --> 01:44:30.220]   - I think it's kind of stifling.
[01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:32.820]   The iPad has so much potential that even Apple
[01:44:32.820 --> 01:44:34.100]   hasn't tapped into yet.
[01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:36.820]   They seem to be steering people now towards the iPad Mini.
[01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:39.820]   I really do think that the iPad Mini is now the default iPad
[01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:41.100]   in the line.
[01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:45.380]   And the iPad is still the productivity, the business device,
[01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:50.380]   the business computer that is prepped for 2014, 2015, 2016,
[01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:54.420]   RAS laptops are always gonna be more and more like tablets
[01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:55.860]   than laptops as they go.
[01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:58.300]   So I would like to see that next iteration
[01:44:58.300 --> 01:45:01.300]   of really, really advanced software come.
[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:04.340]   At minimum, I would like arrow keys to be enabled
[01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:05.300]   on a Bluetooth keyboard.
[01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:07.100]   And I would like to be able to boldface things
[01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:08.420]   by hitting command B.
[01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:09.300]   Those would be nice.
[01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:13.420]   So well, I suppose that I should have baby steps
[01:45:13.420 --> 01:45:14.660]   as we go there.
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:17.780]   Last thing before we go to picks of the week,
[01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:21.780]   some rumblings from all things D and 95 Mac,
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:24.220]   we're gonna see a new Apple TV.
[01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:27.180]   Maybe next month, I don't know about that.
[01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:29.860]   I mean, I literally don't know about that as usual.
[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:32.100]   (laughing)
[01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:34.780]   Sometimes you spend so much time in these shows
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:36.340]   being a wise guy that you have to say,
[01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:37.660]   okay, I'm not saying that I doubt it,
[01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:38.780]   I'm saying that I'm an idiot,
[01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:40.300]   I don't know what I'm talking about.
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:41.980]   But all things D has something interesting
[01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:44.060]   about a new feature that is gonna come to
[01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:45.700]   new software for Apple TVs,
[01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:49.980]   which is the ability to stream your purchase content
[01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:53.380]   from iTunes to any arbitrary Apple TV.
[01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:55.940]   So if you're visiting someone's house,
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:58.900]   the fact that you have bought a copy of Argo
[01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:00.940]   means that you can now stream it from your phone
[01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:03.300]   to the Apple TV without having to have that file
[01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:05.620]   actually installed on your iPhone,
[01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:07.180]   which is really, really cool.
[01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:09.540]   I mean, if Apple really wants to make Apple TV,
[01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:12.900]   put it more front and center as part of the Apple experience,
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:15.220]   they're gonna have to really give people a reason
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:16.420]   to have one in every single house
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:18.420]   and the ability to suddenly be able to access
[01:46:18.420 --> 01:46:20.380]   your entire library wherever you are
[01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:21.940]   without having to have everything on your,
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:24.020]   on your precious little 16 gigabytes of storage.
[01:46:24.020 --> 01:46:26.020]   That's a pretty cool thing.
[01:46:26.020 --> 01:46:28.220]   I guess this means that we're not gonna see an Apple,
[01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:31.100]   an Apple television set this year, maybe kind of, maybe.
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:32.780]   - Make Jean Munster cry.
[01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:33.860]   (laughing)
[01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:38.460]   - That's okay, it's like the Cubs fans or Red Sox fans,
[01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:40.740]   you know, next year, next year.
[01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:43.740]   I was, all the numbers told one story,
[01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:45.220]   but you never know, but next year,
[01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:47.180]   it's definitely gonna happen next year.
[01:46:47.180 --> 01:46:49.180]   Let's go to our last commercial,
[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:50.820]   and then after that, we will go to everybody
[01:46:50.820 --> 01:46:53.780]   for their picks of the week, Leo, what you got for us.
[01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:56.060]   - Hi guys, sorry to interrupt one more point
[01:46:56.060 --> 01:46:57.660]   before we get on with Mac Break Weekly
[01:46:57.660 --> 01:47:00.180]   and our tips and tricks and stuff.
[01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:01.740]   I wanna talk about gazelle.com.
[01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:04.700]   Now's the time, you got a new iPhone,
[01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:07.020]   it's here, are you ready to get it?
[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:08.740]   Well, maybe you wanna get rid of the old one first,
[01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:10.580]   don't just throw it in a drawer.
[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:13.780]   That's cash, that's cash, it could be in your pocket.
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:16.540]   gazelle.com wants to buy your old iPhone
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:19.740]   for a limited time, gazelle is letting you
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:21.500]   lock in today's price for your iPhone,
[01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:24.460]   but giving you until October 15th to send it in.
[01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:25.940]   That's a great deal.
[01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:28.140]   You'll have time to get the new iPhone,
[01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:30.340]   take your date off the old iPhone,
[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:32.940]   make sure you really want it before you send it in.
[01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:37.220]   I love it, gazelle always lets you lock in these prices
[01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:39.380]   for 30 days, you have till October 15th,
[01:47:39.380 --> 01:47:44.380]   that is a great deal, gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:45.780]   They've paid more than $100 million,
[01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:50.060]   so over 600,000 customers in the last few years,
[01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:53.500]   payments fast, they'll wipe the data for you.
[01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:55.380]   I always recommend you wipe it before you send it,
[01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:57.020]   but if you forget, you don't have to knock your head
[01:47:57.020 --> 01:47:59.100]   against the wall, they'll do it for you.
[01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:01.260]   They even pay the postage on anything worth more than a buck.
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:04.540]   So get a quote right now gazelle.com for your old iPhone,
[01:48:04.540 --> 01:48:07.100]   your old smartphone of any kind, tablets,
[01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:09.420]   they even buy broken iPhones and iPads.
[01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:12.180]   It's risk free, they'll send you a box,
[01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:14.580]   they'll pay the postage and then you get paid fast.
[01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:17.580]   Buy check, buy PayPal or, and this is my pro tip,
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:20.460]   you get an extra 5% if you use an Amazon gift card.
[01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:23.340]   Now's the time, get some cash for those old gadgets,
[01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:27.020]   buy the new stuff, gazelle.com.
[01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:28.300]   Andy, back to you.
[01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:33.380]   - I hope you're safe and happy wherever you are.
[01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:34.540]   Let's start with the picks of the week,
[01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:36.540]   let's start with Tonya.
[01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:40.620]   - Well, hi Andy, my pick of the week involves bicycling.
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:46.900]   So I bike on a road bike for fun and exercise all summer
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:51.380]   and on Wednesday nights I bike with a group of women.
[01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:52.860]   If you happen to be in Ithaca, New York,
[01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:56.380]   please come join us every Wednesday night, we have a ride.
[01:48:56.380 --> 01:48:59.740]   And normally I'm very iPhone involved in this group
[01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:02.620]   and I'm always the one who's looking at the radar
[01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:05.220]   to dodge around rain.
[01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:08.060]   And this year I noticed a whole lot more women
[01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:10.100]   seem to be iPhone involved,
[01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:11.620]   but they weren't looking at the radar
[01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:13.380]   and they were talking about things like
[01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:15.180]   you just push the button.
[01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:16.300]   Okay, what's going on?
[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:21.300]   So what's going on is this social networking workout service
[01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:27.180]   that has an iPhone app called Strava, S-T-R-A-V-A.
[01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:31.620]   And basically it is social networking
[01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:34.620]   with your workout buddies and other people
[01:49:34.620 --> 01:49:37.900]   with a whole lot of fun little perks.
[01:49:37.900 --> 01:49:39.660]   As far as the iPhone app goes,
[01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:41.860]   basically pretty much you do.
[01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:43.420]   You push a button when you start,
[01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:44.940]   you push a button when you stop.
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:47.060]   There's a few other things you can do in it.
[01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:49.620]   But what gets really fun is after your ride
[01:49:49.620 --> 01:49:52.100]   you can log on to the website.
[01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:56.500]   And that's where you can social network in depth
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:59.060]   with your workout buddies who care about your workout
[01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:02.220]   a lot more than your Facebook or Twitter friends do.
[01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:06.580]   And you can compare your speeds over the same route
[01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:07.780]   with your workout buddies,
[01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:10.500]   even if they completed the route on a different day.
[01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:14.340]   In fact, last summer I completed a very challenging 72 mile ride
[01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:15.380]   that I'd never done before.
[01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:20.380]   I plugged it in and all of a sudden on my kind of route map
[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:23.300]   I ended up with all these like crowns and things
[01:50:23.300 --> 01:50:26.100]   because apparently I biked up some hills faster
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:28.380]   than anyone else, which I think is probably
[01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:30.780]   'cause almost nobody else was stupid enough
[01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:32.060]   to break up those hills.
[01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:35.940]   But I'm having a lot of fun exploring it
[01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:39.700]   and if you do ride a bicycle or run
[01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:44.740]   this could be a fun way to integrate your social networking,
[01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:47.060]   keep in track of your routes,
[01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:49.860]   setting goals, getting your friends to support you
[01:50:49.860 --> 01:50:54.180]   as you meet your goals, et cetera, all in one app.
[01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:56.420]   So that is my recommendation for the week.
[01:50:56.420 --> 01:51:01.060]   - So I have friends who ride bikes
[01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:03.580]   and they are very, very familiar with this app.
[01:51:03.580 --> 01:51:06.700]   Normally, mostly in the form of,
[01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:08.500]   I'm sorry, I know that we were gonna have lunch today
[01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:11.780]   but some bastard just beat my best time in this hill
[01:51:11.780 --> 01:51:14.340]   and now I gotta go back up there and get my crown back.
[01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:17.060]   - Absolutely, those crowns, it's like,
[01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:21.420]   you know, it's like someone giving you a little icon
[01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:23.460]   and Facebook or something, it just,
[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:24.660]   it just got to get them.
[01:51:24.660 --> 01:51:26.500]   There's something very motivating about that,
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:29.020]   something about how we people are wired, I guess.
[01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:31.540]   - Tony, I know you have to go in about 10 minutes.
[01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:33.340]   So just in case, why don't I just let you go
[01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:34.500]   right here right now?
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:37.220]   I hope, I'm guessing you have another product
[01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:40.140]   that more close to home that you can plug before you go.
[01:51:40.140 --> 01:51:43.740]   - Oh, well, I suppose I could come up with something
[01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:46.020]   out of my pocket, take control books.
[01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:48.180]   We write books about how to take control
[01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:51.300]   of your computer, usually we focus on the Macintosh
[01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:54.660]   or some iPad or iPhone.
[01:51:54.660 --> 01:51:59.020]   Our latest book is Take Control of Your Digital Photos
[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:00.740]   by Jeff Carlson.
[01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:02.740]   Jeff has been writing about technology
[01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:05.420]   for just about forever and over the last decade,
[01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:08.020]   he's focused a lot on photography
[01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:11.460]   and he really talks about how to set up your camera,
[01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:15.500]   set up your import process, input your metadata
[01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:18.620]   and come up with personalized systems
[01:52:18.620 --> 01:52:21.820]   so that your photos go in, all of them go in,
[01:52:21.820 --> 01:52:24.460]   but you're able to find just the ones you want in the end.
[01:52:24.460 --> 01:52:27.380]   So that is our latest, that's the last of our kind of
[01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:32.380]   summer releases, you probably won't hear too much more
[01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:36.100]   from us until iOS or Mavericks.
[01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:38.940]   Although we do have a book in our back pocket,
[01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:40.740]   it is going to be a day and date,
[01:52:40.740 --> 01:52:43.940]   but we don't know what date or date it will be.
[01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:45.420]   So that could be very exciting
[01:52:45.420 --> 01:52:48.020]   'cause it might be before Mavericks.
[01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:49.180]   - Very good.
[01:52:49.180 --> 01:52:51.380]   Take control books, always highly, highly recommended.
[01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:53.260]   I can't tell you about the number of times
[01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:55.860]   where I had to really level up my skills
[01:52:55.860 --> 01:52:57.580]   on a certain topic really quickly
[01:52:57.580 --> 01:52:59.820]   and the first place that go is take control books.
[01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:01.220]   If they might download this,
[01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:03.020]   I know that they won't waste my time.
[01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:05.260]   I know personally the people who wrote this
[01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:07.780]   and I know that I will not look like a jerk tomorrow morning
[01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:09.980]   when I have to pretend to in front of a lot of people
[01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:11.980]   that I know a lot more about iPhone with
[01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:14.060]   and I thought that I did.
[01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:15.540]   - They were a card.
[01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:17.740]   - And the effort shows.
[01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:19.420]   Thanks, Tonya, I will let you go.
[01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:21.020]   Thanks so much for joining us this week.
[01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:21.860]   - Thank you.
[01:53:21.860 --> 01:53:24.220]   I actually have to head out on my bicycle.
[01:53:24.220 --> 01:53:27.060]   I'm biking to my car and then I'll be driving my car
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:28.180]   to pick up my son.
[01:53:28.180 --> 01:53:31.620]   So it's all very complicated and involves a bike ride
[01:53:31.620 --> 01:53:34.260]   and I do have to go or I'll be late
[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:36.980]   and that's not cool when you're picking up your kid.
[01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:40.700]   - A very, very amazing race sequence of things
[01:53:40.700 --> 01:53:42.180]   to pick up your kid, but it works for you.
[01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:43.380]   So I will not judge.
[01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:46.620]   Thanks so much, Tonya.
[01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:48.500]   - Thanks for having me.
[01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:50.740]   - Renee, what you got for us this week?
[01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:52.500]   - I have one I want to mention really quickly
[01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:53.820]   and then I'll go to my main pick.
[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:55.420]   I mean, starting tomorrow, we're gonna,
[01:53:55.420 --> 01:53:58.420]   there's gonna be a deluge of iOS 7 updated apps
[01:53:58.420 --> 01:54:01.380]   and new apps that are built specifically for iOS 7.
[01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:03.900]   So I imagine within the next 48 hours,
[01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:06.940]   anyone who has to either download apps or review apps
[01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:08.380]   is gonna be declaring bankruptcy.
[01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:11.420]   But a couple people got in just ahead of time
[01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:12.620]   and I think I was actually really bright
[01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:14.620]   because they get all the attention right now.
[01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:18.140]   And one is James Thompson, who is perpetually very clever.
[01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:19.980]   He does peak health and he updated it
[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:23.620]   with an iOS 7 skin yesterday or actually on the weekend
[01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:25.340]   so he avoided the entire rush.
[01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:27.020]   And PCALC is an RPN calculator.
[01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:28.700]   It's fantastic.
[01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:30.860]   He's a long time developer, really clever
[01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:33.300]   and always knows how to do these things right.
[01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:35.100]   So if you like calculators,
[01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:38.700]   PCALC fits right in on iOS 7.
[01:54:38.700 --> 01:54:40.580]   My main pick is a brand new app
[01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:42.740]   and it's a category of apps that's,
[01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:44.780]   for a while everyone was making a Twitter app
[01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:48.100]   and now it looks like everyone is making a weather app.
[01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:49.840]   And then I think because it's something people care
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:51.740]   about deeply, there are a lot of people who want
[01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:54.820]   just the weather, they want the way they want it.
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:57.260]   And the latest one is called Perfect Weather.
[01:54:57.260 --> 01:55:00.020]   It's by the company formerly known as AppCubby,
[01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:04.700]   now known as Contrast and they did Launch Center Pro
[01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:06.460]   and they did Timer and a bunch of other apps
[01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:07.940]   that you're probably familiar with.
[01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:10.820]   And Perfect Weather, it's US only for now,
[01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:13.980]   but it's not exactly iOS 7 style,
[01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:17.180]   which is a good thing because if every app looked like iOS 7,
[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:18.620]   I wouldn't know what to do with myself.
[01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:21.340]   So this has a lot of, it is very flat.
[01:55:21.340 --> 01:55:22.820]   It is very modern looking,
[01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:24.860]   but it's also got a lot of great textures.
[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:26.740]   It's got a lot of great experiences.
[01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:27.580]   It's got layers.
[01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:29.460]   So if you want the radar, it's there,
[01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:31.140]   but it's not getting in your way.
[01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:33.100]   If you want just to see what's happening today
[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:34.500]   or tomorrow it's there.
[01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:37.340]   It very cleverly folds away different locations
[01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:40.100]   so you can keep multiple locations available,
[01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:42.180]   but not in your face all the time.
[01:55:42.180 --> 01:55:45.620]   And it really does try to be that Apple lists,
[01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:48.020]   Apple sort of simple app that does a lot
[01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:49.940]   when you get deeper into it.
[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:52.980]   I've been playing around it for about a week
[01:55:52.980 --> 01:55:55.340]   and I've had really, really good results with it.
[01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:59.260]   So it's Perfect Weather by contrast.
[01:55:59.260 --> 01:56:00.100]   - Look super, super cool.
[01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:01.700]   How much is that again?
[01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:04.140]   - I forget the price, it's not available in Canada,
[01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:05.300]   so I had to use a beta bill.
[01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:06.940]   I'm not exactly sure what it costs.
[01:56:06.940 --> 01:56:08.460]   I'll just check quickly.
[01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:12.020]   - So you're waiting for availability
[01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:14.740]   of the Amazon App Store and weather.
[01:56:14.740 --> 01:56:16.420]   - Well, as one of the things with weather apps
[01:56:16.420 --> 01:56:19.420]   is you have to license the radar data and the weather data.
[01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:22.220]   So for example, pocket weather is fantastic,
[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:24.620]   but it's Australia only because they only have access
[01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:25.460]   to Australian data.
[01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:27.460]   This one only has access to US data.
[01:56:27.460 --> 01:56:29.180]   So sometimes these are regional apps,
[01:56:29.180 --> 01:56:30.860]   but if you're in the region that they service,
[01:56:30.860 --> 01:56:32.900]   I mean they're really good.
[01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:35.220]   - But really, if I wrote an iOS 7 app
[01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:37.180]   that simply had a JPEG of a screen that said
[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:40.500]   it's really, really cold, don't even go out there,
[01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:44.700]   that would handle 54% of all Canadian weather.
[01:56:44.700 --> 01:56:47.460]   - That'd be like the clock on 12 o'clock for me Andy.
[01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:49.460]   If you write often enough that I wouldn't bother
[01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:50.300]   with anything else.
[01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:51.740]   - There you go.
[01:56:51.740 --> 01:56:53.780]   Mike, what's your pick of the week?
[01:56:53.780 --> 01:56:57.820]   - Okay, well, the pick of the week is an app called Moves.
[01:56:57.820 --> 01:57:01.420]   And this is an interesting app that it's not obscure.
[01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:03.820]   It's a couple of people have written about it.
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:05.060]   It may have even appeared on the show,
[01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:07.460]   but it's actually gotten better lately.
[01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:11.460]   So Moves is essentially an app that tracks your movement.
[01:57:11.460 --> 01:57:14.980]   It tracks whether you're walking, cycling or running.
[01:57:14.980 --> 01:57:19.980]   And the great thing about it is that there is literally
[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:24.140]   there are literally zero excuses to not use this app.
[01:57:24.140 --> 01:57:27.180]   It's free and you don't have to do anything.
[01:57:27.180 --> 01:57:28.700]   You literally don't have to do anything
[01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:29.700]   in order to use this app.
[01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:32.580]   You simply download it, launch it,
[01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:37.460]   and then anytime you wanna check your activity level,
[01:57:37.460 --> 01:57:40.540]   you go to it and it'll show you each and every day
[01:57:40.540 --> 01:57:43.140]   how many steps you walked, how many miles you walked,
[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:46.220]   how much time you spent walking,
[01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:47.380]   and also cycling and running.
[01:57:47.380 --> 01:57:50.020]   It automatically detects what your activity is.
[01:57:50.020 --> 01:57:53.140]   So you don't have to say, "Okay, I'm walking now."
[01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:54.780]   You literally just forget about it.
[01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:58.020]   And then it gives you this really nice sort of timeline
[01:57:58.020 --> 01:58:00.660]   that they call a storyline that shows you're your whole day.
[01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:03.820]   You woke up at this time, you walked this far,
[01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:06.820]   then you went to a coffee place,
[01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:08.740]   then you were sent your duffet work all day,
[01:58:08.740 --> 01:58:11.500]   and then after that you went, and it gives you your whole day.
[01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:13.940]   And just day after day, it'll tell you
[01:58:13.940 --> 01:58:14.840]   when you broke your record,
[01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:19.060]   "Oh, this is your new record for how far you've walked
[01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:20.620]   since you got this app."
[01:58:20.620 --> 01:58:23.060]   What's cool about this, with another cool thing,
[01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:26.980]   besides the fact that it's great for lazy people like me,
[01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:28.340]   and you don't have to do anything,
[01:58:28.340 --> 01:58:29.820]   is that you can plug it into other apps.
[01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:32.860]   So there's a variety of what they call,
[01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:34.780]   there's a Connect the Dab catalog.
[01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:36.980]   So things like Memento and Narado Journal
[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:39.980]   and Grid Diary and M-Mapper, these other things
[01:58:39.980 --> 01:58:43.020]   that can harvest data and it'll just put that data
[01:58:43.020 --> 01:58:45.060]   into those other things if you're using them.
[01:58:45.060 --> 01:58:47.380]   But even if you don't plug it into anything else,
[01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:51.260]   it's just a free, super easy way for you
[01:58:51.260 --> 01:58:55.460]   to just get an idea of how much activity you're doing every day.
[01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:57.220]   And it's really colorful and fun to use.
[01:58:57.220 --> 01:58:59.620]   It's just a really pretty app.
[01:58:59.620 --> 01:59:01.980]   And when you simple to use, you tap on it
[01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:06.260]   and it'll give you the new data if you can see that.
[01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:07.620]   So I really recommend it.
[01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:09.060]   I really enjoyed it in Europe
[01:59:09.060 --> 01:59:10.900]   because we're running around sort of
[01:59:10.900 --> 01:59:15.060]   setting things, shopping, doing these different things.
[01:59:15.060 --> 01:59:17.900]   And at the end of the day, we really don't know how far we've gone.
[01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:19.260]   And so you can look at that and go,
[01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:21.700]   "Wow, not really very far, actually.
[01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:24.060]   We've gone less than a mile."
[01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:28.580]   So it's a great way for those of us who sit around too much
[01:59:28.580 --> 01:59:31.780]   to start to measure how much we're moving
[01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:34.580]   and how much time we're spending moving.
[01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:37.620]   And again, brain did simply, you don't even have to actually
[01:59:37.620 --> 01:59:40.460]   do anything in order to use it.
[01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:41.300]   - Beautiful.
[01:59:41.300 --> 01:59:42.980]   I mean, maybe it's part of our generation
[01:59:42.980 --> 01:59:44.300]   having grown up on video games
[01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:46.060]   that you can't be motivated to do something
[01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:48.300]   unless there's a score attached to it.
[01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:49.140]   Where--
[01:59:49.140 --> 01:59:49.980]   - Exactly.
[01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:50.820]   - I didn't become a care,
[01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:52.340]   I didn't become like a fuel efficient driver
[01:59:52.340 --> 01:59:55.420]   until I got a gizmo that gives me a score
[01:59:55.420 --> 01:59:57.260]   for every trip to tell me how well,
[01:59:57.260 --> 01:59:59.820]   how efficiently I drove and now I try to beat the score
[01:59:59.820 --> 02:00:01.220]   every single time I go.
[02:00:01.220 --> 02:00:02.620]   So that's gonna be--
[02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:03.460]   - Well, more to the point,
[02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:06.340]   we are activity gravitates to the things
[02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:08.020]   that really reward us with scores.
[02:00:08.020 --> 02:00:11.580]   So, I mean, one of the reasons that some type,
[02:00:11.580 --> 02:00:13.220]   personality types don't get enough exercises
[02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:15.380]   that the video game thing gives you a score,
[02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:17.780]   the amount of money you make at work gives you a score.
[02:00:17.780 --> 02:00:19.380]   You know, all these things give you a score,
[02:00:19.380 --> 02:00:20.660]   exercise doesn't give you a score.
[02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:21.500]   So--
[02:00:21.500 --> 02:00:22.340]   - Instant application.
[02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:23.180]   - And now it does.
[02:00:23.180 --> 02:00:24.020]   - Right.
[02:00:24.020 --> 02:00:27.220]   Yeah, I mean, I didn't really get into this fitness hardware
[02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:28.780]   until I was testing out the strive,
[02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:33.020]   I was in Dublin and I'm always walking, walking, walking
[02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:35.180]   when I travel 'cause that's how I love to explore.
[02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:37.500]   And when I came back, got back to the hotel
[02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:38.860]   and not feeling particularly tired and saw,
[02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:42.820]   oh, 16,000 steps in five hours.
[02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:45.260]   All right then, that's a good, that's a high number.
[02:00:45.260 --> 02:00:47.100]   I like that number, that's the benchmark
[02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:47.940]   for high numbers now.
[02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:49.900]   So, yeah, and that's another cool thing
[02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:52.220]   we're gonna see for the M7 processor on the 5S.
[02:00:52.220 --> 02:00:55.780]   I think just as something that can track your movement,
[02:00:55.780 --> 02:00:57.820]   your steps and your activity all day long
[02:00:57.820 --> 02:01:00.380]   without burning battery, that's gonna be really,
[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:02.100]   that's gonna be cool to play with.
[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:04.340]   - I'm gonna take a-- - I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:01:04.340 --> 02:01:05.660]   - I was gonna say on the talk show,
[02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:07.260]   Dave Wiscus was mentioning whether Fitbit
[02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:08.700]   and Nike's already got an app
[02:01:08.700 --> 02:01:10.260]   but whether Fitbit and all these hardware companies
[02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:12.180]   will be making dedicated apps just for the M7
[02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:14.540]   and you won't have to have a second dongle anymore.
[02:01:14.540 --> 02:01:16.420]   - Yeah, I'm sure they're gonna wanna have a way
[02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:20.180]   to lock you into one service as the canonical repository
[02:01:20.180 --> 02:01:21.380]   of your activity.
[02:01:21.380 --> 02:01:24.900]   Just like striving, it's, it's, strive is, I'm not joking.
[02:01:24.900 --> 02:01:27.380]   I've talked to so many people for whom it,
[02:01:27.380 --> 02:01:30.260]   it almost gets them upset, angry as though,
[02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:33.900]   how dare that person bike this route faster
[02:01:33.900 --> 02:01:36.100]   than I bike this route.
[02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:37.500]   First, we're gonna have some words,
[02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:38.980]   but first I'm gonna have to get that crown back.
[02:01:38.980 --> 02:01:41.860]   And once you're in the ecosystem of Nike data
[02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:43.300]   of where you're posting with your friends,
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:45.820]   it's like, you might not like Facebook,
[02:01:45.820 --> 02:01:47.140]   but if all your friends are on Facebook,
[02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:48.140]   that's where you go.
[02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:49.260]   So I'm sure that's, I'm sure you're right,
[02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:51.380]   I'm sure that's exactly what we're gonna see.
[02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:53.580]   My pick of the week is actually sort of a piggyback
[02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:56.380]   onto one of Alex Lindsey's picks of the week,
[02:01:56.380 --> 02:01:58.180]   a number, a couple of months ago.
[02:01:58.180 --> 02:02:03.220]   He recommended a version of the 511 tactical rush backpack
[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:04.260]   and I saw the site and his,
[02:02:04.260 --> 02:02:05.940]   he recommended the version of this backpack
[02:02:05.940 --> 02:02:08.660]   that is big enough for Alex Lindsey
[02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:10.700]   to go all the way around the world
[02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:14.340]   and carrying enough data to replicate NBC,
[02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:18.060]   Nightly News' ability to live cover data.
[02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:21.220]   I'm looking for, my knees are more along the lines of,
[02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:24.940]   I'm not gonna be gone for just about a day,
[02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:27.780]   I'm gonna be gone for a couple of days,
[02:02:27.780 --> 02:02:30.180]   I'm not gonna be relying just on my laptop,
[02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:31.620]   I got all kinds of little things.
[02:02:31.620 --> 02:02:33.660]   So I looked at the Rush 12,
[02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:36.020]   which is a smaller version of that same backpack
[02:02:36.020 --> 02:02:38.540]   and I really, really like it so much so that after I review it,
[02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:40.420]   I'm afraid I'm gonna have to go to the website
[02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:42.540]   and actually buy one for myself.
[02:02:42.540 --> 02:02:45.020]   What I like about it is that you never know exactly
[02:02:45.020 --> 02:02:47.380]   what you need for any one given situation.
[02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:50.180]   So the good news is that really big, well compartment
[02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:53.100]   inside here for putting a couple of days worth of clothes,
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:54.060]   that'll work fine.
[02:02:54.060 --> 02:02:55.300]   As you can see from the top here,
[02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:58.500]   it's got about 10 or 12 little like pouches and bags
[02:02:58.500 --> 02:03:00.380]   for cables and toiletries and stuff like that.
[02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:04.060]   So it's not quite so easy to lose stuff inside there.
[02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:05.780]   But on top of everything else,
[02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:07.460]   instead of giving you a tour of the entire bag,
[02:03:07.460 --> 02:03:09.460]   oh, actually one cool thing.
[02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:13.620]   It has also a reinforced compartment in the back area here,
[02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:15.380]   which is certainly big enough for an iPad,
[02:03:15.380 --> 02:03:17.940]   it's even big enough for a slim 13 inch notebook.
[02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:20.500]   So if you're ever concerned about walking through a city
[02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:22.660]   and maybe if you're not being attentive enough,
[02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:24.220]   someone is going to unzip your bag
[02:03:24.220 --> 02:03:26.140]   without your knowing it and reach it and rifle through,
[02:03:26.140 --> 02:03:28.060]   they're not getting at this pouch right here
[02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:30.380]   that's against your bag, against your back.
[02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:32.740]   Very comfortable, really thick straps.
[02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:34.660]   But the other thing that I'd like to point out
[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:38.180]   is that it has these webbing straps here
[02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:42.460]   that make it really exactly what you want when you're traveling.
[02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:43.620]   These aren't just decorative,
[02:03:43.620 --> 02:03:45.900]   they're actually a standardized system.
[02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:48.060]   So that if you decided that really,
[02:03:48.060 --> 02:03:49.460]   the only thing I really want,
[02:03:49.460 --> 02:03:53.180]   I wish this had was a way that a carrier for my tripod,
[02:03:53.180 --> 02:03:56.260]   or I wish that I've got this big camera thing
[02:03:56.260 --> 02:04:00.260]   for my SLR body that gets lost inside this bag.
[02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:02.100]   What you can do is you can buy a bag
[02:04:02.100 --> 02:04:03.300]   that's designed to loop it,
[02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:06.340]   like lock into these mesh areas.
[02:04:06.340 --> 02:04:10.020]   And essentially you now have a integral carrier
[02:04:10.020 --> 02:04:15.020]   for your tripod, an integral pouch for your medicines
[02:04:15.020 --> 02:04:17.500]   and integral pouch for whatever you want to put in there.
[02:04:17.500 --> 02:04:19.700]   So it's very, very customizable.
[02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:21.940]   And it's also just built like a tank,
[02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:25.820]   it's just thick nylon, good high quality zippers.
[02:04:25.820 --> 02:04:28.500]   So as a result, it's not the cheapest bag you can get
[02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:32.220]   for a backpack, it's cost like $110 off the site.
[02:04:32.220 --> 02:04:34.140]   But in terms of buying one thing
[02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:36.380]   that will last you for many, many years,
[02:04:36.380 --> 02:04:41.060]   as opposed to something that you will pay $70 for.
[02:04:41.060 --> 02:04:43.060]   And it will work fine for you for this year
[02:04:43.060 --> 02:04:44.740]   until you buy a different notebook
[02:04:44.740 --> 02:04:46.620]   or until you decide that you're gonna,
[02:04:46.620 --> 02:04:48.340]   as you start traveling with a couple of lenses
[02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:49.780]   instead of just one,
[02:04:49.780 --> 02:04:53.740]   this is more of a long-term investment.
[02:04:53.740 --> 02:04:55.460]   It's perfect, it's gonna be taking along with me.
[02:04:55.460 --> 02:04:56.980]   It's gonna be my trip next week,
[02:04:56.980 --> 02:04:58.900]   which is just an overnight, but I've got extra clothes,
[02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:00.700]   I'm gonna have to take a lot of tech gear.
[02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:03.100]   So it's small enough so that,
[02:05:03.100 --> 02:05:05.460]   small enough that you can slip it underneath a seat,
[02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:07.140]   big enough that it might be the only thing
[02:05:07.140 --> 02:05:08.420]   you need to carry on.
[02:05:08.420 --> 02:05:10.620]   So that is my pick of the week.
[02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:11.700]   That's it for this week.
[02:05:11.700 --> 02:05:14.300]   Let's thank everybody who made this show,
[02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:15.460]   such a wonderful success.
[02:05:15.460 --> 02:05:18.740]   Renee, I hope that you're getting some sleep.
[02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:21.020]   I hope your IMOR is successful enough
[02:05:21.020 --> 02:05:22.580]   that you can delegate some things.
[02:05:22.580 --> 02:05:24.420]   I hope you have, again, interns
[02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:26.900]   that you can just toss out the side of the road
[02:05:26.900 --> 02:05:29.340]   like an empty Starbucks cup when you're done with them,
[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:31.700]   'cause this is probably a hard week for someone like you, Renee,
[02:05:31.700 --> 02:05:32.820]   which is where people are looking forward
[02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:35.020]   to seeing at IMOR.com this week.
[02:05:35.020 --> 02:05:37.500]   - Tomorrow, first of all, we have Peter Cohen
[02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:39.620]   and Richard Devine and Ali Kazmuhan.
[02:05:39.620 --> 02:05:42.820]   Everybody doing yeoman's work so that I can work on the reviews,
[02:05:42.820 --> 02:05:45.100]   but we have the iOS 7 review coming up
[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:47.060]   and then the phone reviews,
[02:05:47.060 --> 02:05:49.900]   which we'll follow shortly thereafter.
[02:05:49.900 --> 02:05:52.220]   And I think just like you, Andy, this kind of year,
[02:05:52.220 --> 02:05:53.500]   I don't expect any sleep.
[02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:56.220]   I just expect large amounts of caffeine.
[02:05:56.220 --> 02:05:57.220]   - Exactly.
[02:05:57.220 --> 02:06:00.260]   At least we have authority to have Red Bull
[02:06:00.260 --> 02:06:02.260]   and sugary sodas this week.
[02:06:02.260 --> 02:06:06.540]   Mike, thank you for coming by this week.
[02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:08.180]   Where the heck can people find you?
[02:06:08.180 --> 02:06:09.580]   I never know where to point people,
[02:06:09.580 --> 02:06:11.500]   'cause you have such great analysis things
[02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:13.100]   that I almost never think of
[02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:15.620]   and then think I'm gonna have to find a way to rephrase
[02:06:15.620 --> 02:06:17.540]   what Mike just said so that it would occur to people
[02:06:17.540 --> 02:06:19.020]   that I actually said that instead of them
[02:06:19.020 --> 02:06:21.300]   just quoting something that Mike said.
[02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:22.140]   - Thank you.
[02:06:22.140 --> 02:06:24.580]   I'm obsessed with Google+, so I put everything
[02:06:24.580 --> 02:06:27.260]   that I write on Google+,
[02:06:27.260 --> 02:06:29.660]   and I also think out loud on Google+,
[02:06:29.660 --> 02:06:33.060]   so really just if anybody is interested
[02:06:33.060 --> 02:06:35.580]   in following me Google+, is the place to do it.
[02:06:35.580 --> 02:06:36.820]   You can also follow me on Twitter.
[02:06:36.820 --> 02:06:39.940]   I automatically post my Google+ stuff to Twitter and Facebook,
[02:06:39.940 --> 02:06:43.580]   so whatever your preferred social network is,
[02:06:43.580 --> 02:06:48.340]   just follow me there and I can be found with easy search.
[02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:49.180]   - Super.
[02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:51.980]   And you can find my writings on the Sun Time site
[02:06:51.980 --> 02:06:53.740]   as well as there's sometimes Business site
[02:06:53.740 --> 02:06:54.980]   at ChicagoGrid.com.
[02:06:54.980 --> 02:06:56.700]   If you want to check out my blog, my Twitter
[02:06:56.700 --> 02:06:59.860]   and stuff like that, you can find links to inatco.com.
[02:06:59.860 --> 02:07:02.100]   Please don't even have to download the video portion
[02:07:02.100 --> 02:07:03.900]   of this podcast to figure out how to spell my last name,
[02:07:03.900 --> 02:07:05.260]   but what your reward for figuring out
[02:07:05.260 --> 02:07:06.740]   how to spell my last name is,
[02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:09.100]   you can access inatco.com.
[02:07:09.100 --> 02:07:10.820]   That's it for Mac Break Weekly this week.
[02:07:10.820 --> 02:07:14.020]   Next week Renee is gonna be hosting while I am away.
[02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:16.220]   So we're gonna be sort of round robiting this.
[02:07:16.220 --> 02:07:17.820]   Until then, get back to work,
