[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   We're going to put that whole thing in there.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   But now it's time to begin the actual show,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   From your left, Alex Lindsey of the Pixel Core.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Oh, no.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   He's got some new -- he and Scott Borne,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   who's also here from Padango and Apple Phone Show,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   are doing a new and very popular show called --
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   "Fip, Twip, Twiff."
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Twig, twig.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   This week in Pedography.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   This week in Podiatry.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   And where do we get that?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   That's it.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   That's it.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Pixelcore.tv/Twip.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   It certainly is.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   And it's turned -- I mean, it's really turning out to be --
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I mean, not just because we're doing it,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   but it's really an enjoyable show to actually record.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I mean, it's just a really good group of people
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   who are photographers and really into it.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   We're kind of covering both technical and philosophical
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   and artistic.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   I'm sure we're --
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   You're an expert in all those things.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Photography is hot right now.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   But you wouldn't believe the response we're getting, Lee.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I mean, the show's a couple of weeks old
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   and not to mention, you know, really high rankings and iTunes,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   but the email I'm getting from people.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   It's just like -- people are literally starting emails with,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   "Oh, thank God, you guys are doing this."
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Well, there are a lot of photography podcasts.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I mean, it's not the first by any means,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   but you guys know how to do a show.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Well, we learned it off of you.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Hey, speaking of which -- thank you.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   That's the requisite Leo Suckup moment.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Well, you can't --
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I thought you handled that really well, Lee.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   At this point, I'm disdainful now.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   That's the new -- that's my new thing.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I used to be gracious and grateful,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   and now I just disdain you.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   No, I'm just --
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Your affection makes me angry.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I hate you.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I hate you.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   So let's say hello to Merlin Mann of 43.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Hello.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   How are you, Leo?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And also of 5s -- number 5, I-V-E-S.com,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   where you will find, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   5 cues -- I probably shouldn't say this one.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I think you can do another.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   You can do another one.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   How about 5 subtle changes in the event
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   that Microsoft acquires Yahoo?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I like this one.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Some of these -- I think some of these are going to be big.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Some of these are not going to be a problem for people.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Others, I think --
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Well, 5 names you can belch.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   You could go either way on that.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Can you belch Frank Black?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Shall I try?
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Well, will you -- will you -- with Barf if you fail?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Hang on, I haven't done this in a while.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Frank.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   That's enough.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   You were like, "Prove it again, Seth.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   You're excited to have the new Ponce Billy Own."
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   This is real highbrow entertainment.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   We are gussets.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   The front.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Visculus to fart.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   We didn't mention fistulas and farts.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   That's another portion of the show, which will not get aired.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Hey, I just want to ask one quick question.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   How come you can always get 43 folders right,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   but you can't get anything related to me and Alex right?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Is there a block, a metal block?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Is it part of that disdain?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   No, no, it's very easy to remember 40's.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   You can remember.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   You can remember 40's.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Applefunchow.com does not roll off the tongue.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Okay, so "Twip" -- "Twip" starting with this week in --
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   "Patai entry."
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   About 16 shows you do, so at least three-four shots.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I should be able to get that one.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   You're right.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I apologize.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   You should add a prime number.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   That a prime number.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   It's very easy to remember.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   There you go.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   You give me a good prime number that's not taken --
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   About 17 twips.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   17 twips, isn't that good?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   See, that's easy.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And it sorts to the top of lists.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Uh-oh.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Did I say that out loud?
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Whoops.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Merlin, you have to know one thing.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   This is really funny.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   I get e-mail from people all the time that, for whatever reason,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   can't reach you directly.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   And they'll say, "Tell Merlin to check out my new blog,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   43 Trains."
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Ha-ha!
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And they all name them 40, and they think it's like,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   "You're going to be thrilled about that."
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I just find that quite interesting.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Yeah, I should really spend more time on that.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I registered 83problems.org, and Merlin put a snake in my mailbox.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   So, you know, I just --
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   It looked like a snake.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   It was actually a Robert Plant.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   What's going on in that?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Oh!
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   So, in the world of Macintosh, let's start off.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   There's a number of things.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   A big update.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   A big, big update from Apple on OS X Leopard.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   In fact, an update that responds to all the criticisms people have had about Leopard.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I downloaded immediately, and all of a sudden, you can change how the folders stack.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   You can turn off that lame display.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   You can make them do the hierarchical list like they used to do.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Hallelujah!
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Can I get rid of the dock?
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Can you get rid of it?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   No, I don't think they put that in.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   So, it hasn't handled all of the --
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Your handle -- it hasn't handled yours.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   You can have -- that's interesting.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Maybe you just want to be able to turn the dock off.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   You have the ability -- you can make it opaque now.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   The menu bars are the correct.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   The menu bars are the correct.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Now, how do you do that?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Because I can't -- I saw that, but I can't find it.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Where is that?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I think it's in the preferences, isn't it?
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Oh, the Finder preferences, maybe.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Let's see.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Because I couldn't find -- no, I couldn't find that.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I only played with it for about five minutes on the one machine that we do have.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   I wonder if it's under displays.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   I looked everywhere -- System Preferences Desktop.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   That's where I looked.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Is it there?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Again, System Preferences Desktop.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   All right, System Preferences Desktop and Screen Saver.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Oh, Translucent Menu Bar.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Uncheck.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Oh!
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Thank you, Scott.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   I feel empowered.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Let's thank Shash because he's -- he's the one who's in our chat.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   He'll join us a little later.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   We're going to let him do a pick.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Andy Naco is taking the day off, but Shash, who does a show note and is about -- I think
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   he's nine, ten.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   He's like, "teen."
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   He's young gentleman.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   I'm just -- he's from the United Kingdom.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Yes.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   He's even 15.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Hey, congratulations, Shash, on the birthday.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And even though he's 15, he's like -- he's 71 in terms of his mental ability.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Exactly.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   The British accent.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   It's just amazing.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   When he sends me emails, they're like, "Okay, that's way too smart for a 15-year-old."
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   So he's got a pick this week.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Oh, good.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   So he'll be joining us -- he wanted to be on the whole show, and I said, "Well, you know,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   let's start with a pick."
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   He'd make all of us look bad for the whole.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   I don't want to be stupid.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Ah, there's your title.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   I don't want to be stupid.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   So -- He cannot -- I don't want to be stupid.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   So what else -- anybody else -- anybody else -- in the observation?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   It's got some stuff that made another update possible that happened today.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   What was that?
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Well --
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Oh, aperture.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   But let's not get to aperture.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.600]   No, but the -- what's important is the camera raw stuff related to the graphics update in
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.600]   there.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   I mean -- Yeah, so no, that was an interesting thing.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.200]   So I did 10.5.2, and then I rebooted, and it reboots twice for reasons.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.360]   I don't completely understand, but I rebooted twice, and then I got another update, a leopard
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.000]   graphics update, but only on one of my machines.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Oh.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.800]   Are you supposed to get it on all of them?
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:35.400]   I don't know, but I know that the thing I'm actually talking about is that they've updated
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.240]   their camera raw converter.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.240]   That was part of 10.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.240]   And that too, right?
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.880]   Or was that the pro -- was that the pro update?
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.640]   I think that's part of the pro update.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.120]   But that will work, you know, with the new aperture update.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.240]   So you actually won't get that update unless you have a pro app installed already.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.120]   I think so, but you know, it's very confusing.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.120]   You're right.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.720]   It's -- it's getting hard to, you know, keep score here.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.320]   However, if you -- okay, now.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.400]   Before we get to aperture, because I do want to talk about that.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.120]   People have been reporting some problems as usual.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.040]   Oh, there it is, leopard graphics update.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.720]   Yeah, but leopard graphics update.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.000]   So I only got that after I did the first update.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.480]   Well, it's included in 10.5.2.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.480]   No.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.480]   And then it uncompresses after the 10.5.2 install.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.480]   Oh.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.640]   It's got the -- there's extensive, according to unofficial Apple Web log, it includes
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.000]   those extensive Apple release notes that we've grown to love.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.280]   Apparently, it improves the stability and compatibility of your Mac.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.280]   That's all it says.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.280]   And requires 10.5.2.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.520]   The prober -- the prober loves those.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.680]   I love when they put out these -- like this huge set of changes and they're like, well,
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.680]   it makes things better.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.680]   See you next time.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.880]   So as usual with this, it's probably a good idea to back up.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.560]   Some people are reporting wireless issues.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.280]   Some people are reporting reboot issues.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.360]   You got the space.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.360]   This is a great time.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.120]   Well, it's not -- we should just start pumping this every week.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.920]   This is a great time to use SuperDuber.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.920]   Yes.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.240]   Even on a small update like this, you got the disk space.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.520]   It's worth -- do you ever do that sandboxing thing, Leo?
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.520]   No.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.520]   Tell us about that.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.520]   That's --
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.520]   I don't know.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.520]   I'm curious.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.520]   I've never used it.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.520]   I don't know what it does.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.920]   But I think that's the -- as I understand it, that's the thing that you want to use if
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.640]   you're just upgrading like your system or something.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.520]   You can try an update and if it didn't work, you can revert.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.520]   I guess so.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.520]   I'm going to find out more about that.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.760]   But this, anyway, just as a side note, if it's probably too late now, we probably -- I've
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.760]   already done mine.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.920]   So -- but I had recently SuperDuber so I don't feel bad.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.280]   Does anybody know what's coming after this OS, what they're going to name the next one?
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.520]   Yeah, they registered another big cat.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.680]   Shash probably knows.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.360]   They registered another big cat.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.360]   It's links.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.360]   Links.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.560]   So here's my browser.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.560]   So here's L-L-Y-N-X.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.560]   Here's my theory.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.360]   I'm waiting for that one.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.720]   And then I'll upgrade to this one.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.720]   Is that true?
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.720]   Is that what you do?
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.720]   You wait.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.720]   That's what I do.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.720]   I can't wait.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.720]   I try.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.720]   I'm very updated.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.000]   I have four impulse control tattooed on my forehead.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I just can't.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   I try.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.760]   You had the tattoo put on so quickly that it's got typos.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.760]   I know.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.760]   It was a mistake.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.280]   But what I said -- I need the only one that I wait a little bit on is when I see Quicktime
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.280]   updates.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.360]   I tend to kind of -- let's just see how this one goes.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.680]   Am I wrong or have they updated -- I break -- breaks production apps more often than anything
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.680]   else?
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.080]   They seem like they've updated Quicktime a number of times.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.600]   There was a serious exploit in Quicktime which they did update on both Mac and Windows a
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.600]   couple of weeks ago.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.800]   And when they fixed the DRM, when they set up DRM so that we could rent movies, they
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:33.160]   broke a lot of Adobe applications which then they fixed by fixing Quicktime.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.160]   So it's back.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.240]   But there was like a week and a half or two weeks of pain and unhappiness for some app
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.640]   for ex-users.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.400]   You want to go to 7.4.1.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:48.720]   In fact, yeah, I just run it on Windows and it wants to update as well on Windows.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.720]   That's the current version, 7.4.1.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.560]   Yeah, and that one should fix the problem that was introduced by the new DRM that's
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.560]   required.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.960]   And they pushed that out on Mac and Windows a week ago?
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.960]   I think so, yeah.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.480]   Yeah, because I've seen two in a row very quickly.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.880]   But we got a bunch of computers running in 10.4 and they're working just fine.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.120]   So we don't know really.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.120]   Does anybody know what any of this updates are?
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.720]   I mean, why the graphics update is separate?
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.720]   I don't know.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.720]   No, either.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.720]   Nobody knows.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.880]   And Apple doesn't tell.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:29.080]   But actually my first hint that Aputure was coming out was noticing the new raw converter
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.760]   as part of the new updates.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.320]   So were you able to get the new Aputure?
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.400]   Because some people on Twitter reported that you get 1.5 if you download.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.400]   No, no.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.080]   It won't be in stores till today, tomorrow, the next day.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:49.280]   It's shipping from the Apple store now, but they are offering the 1.5 trial for a free
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.280]   update.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.600]   But I got an email from Apple saying download the trial of 2.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.600]   Oh, really?
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.600]   It says...
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.920]   It gave me 1.5 when we tried it.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.440]   Yeah, I think that's an error.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.960]   It says maybe the email says, "Introducing Aputure to your best shots make even better.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.760]   Click here, free trial.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.400]   But what you get is 1.5."
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.040]   Yeah, that's what happened to me too.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.040]   Because we were trying...
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.280]   We were going to try to pick it up today and then we found out we could and we said,
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.800]   well, we'll download it and then we got 1.5.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.520]   We were just too early and they haven't updated the link.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:19.680]   Anyway, they have extensive information on their website about it, including some tutorials
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.400]   that show the new interface and some of the new features.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.560]   You're an Aputure big shot.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:29.520]   So, I mean, in fact, you were the first guy to really sell Aputure to me.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:34.880]   Derek and I taught the first public Aputure course at Macworld and I was in the first T3
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.880]   class.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.560]   So I've been using it a long time and I've always been a fan of it, but it's always
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.440]   had a few problems and I'll have to say I don't have any experience with it yet.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:47.080]   But looking at the list, it looks like they've addressed a great many of them.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.840]   All right, I just requested a serial number and now I'm downloading.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.840]   It says Aputure 2.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.240]   It says Aputure 2.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.240]   Maybe they fixed the link.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.160]   Yeah, we'll try it later.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.840]   But the biggest difference is the interface is way more smooth.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.680]   I mean, it used to be very complex.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.520]   There's all these different windows to look at.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:14.000]   And now it's just this one basic screen with one simple interface.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.040]   That's how it should be.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.320]   That's the problem with the Lightroom is that so much of the screen, I mean, you can remove
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.480]   it, but it's like Photoshop.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.200]   So much of the screen is taken up by controls.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.080]   Well, the other big deal is they lowered the price to $199.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.080]   And that's significant.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.480]   Now it started off at $499, didn't it?
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.880]   This was when they were testing out how they were going to screw up the price thing on
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.280]   the iPhone, they first tested that on Aputure.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.280]   So, okay.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.680]   Now, what was one five?
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.920]   What didn't one five drop it to was it $299?
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.920]   Yeah, $299.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.600]   It was the same price as Lightroom.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.280]   Now it's $199.99 for the upgrade.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.400]   And if you bought Aputure since January 1st, you can get the upgrade for $995.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.920]   I'm really, you know, I tried Aputure.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.440]   I tried the trial and it was a slow and buggy to me.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.600]   And that's why I went to Lightroom.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.080]   So I'm going to approach this with an open mind.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:11.340]   Here's one big difference between the two is the Aputure relies on the GPU.
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:15.120]   So the faster your graphics card, the better your Aputure experience.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:22.240]   Now, in theory, they've streamlined 2.0 to the point where it's not nearly so resource-dependent.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.760]   And it's supposed to be a better experience.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.760]   Good.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.960]   Yeah, I have to say on my on my Octo, it runs very, very, very well.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:30.960]   You have Aputure true?
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.960]   You have Aputure true?
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.560]   I've gone up for two, the older Aputure.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.920]   I should be getting Aputure true this week.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.920]   I'm getting it right now.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.600]   And that's why the, for those who are listening at home, why the Skype is starting to sound
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.600]   so bad.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.920]   I'm wondering about it.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.440]   But in 18 seconds, everything will clear up.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.400]   I'm doing research in the show.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.800]   In the meantime.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.960]   So I'm certainly going to, I'm going to certainly take a look at that.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:00.040]   I think that the update, it's really interesting, you know, now to have an opaque menu and
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:05.480]   to have the stacks back, you know, or the proper folders back is really.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.840]   It's a, it's a, you can navigate through the folders you'd like you used to.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.920]   Yeah, it's really an admission from Apple that they made a mistake in Leopard.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.400]   Yeah, we'll look for that press release any day.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:22.080]   Well, and you know, it might have been, I think the Leopard, you know, made the deadline
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.080]   of you to make.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.720]   And I think that it might not have been completely cooked when it came out.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.720]   It was mostly cooked.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.400]   They're credit, they at least fixed it pretty darn quick.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.400]   I mean, that's response that I have to say, I have to give them credit.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.600]   That's really responding.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.600]   They could have just sat back and said, oh, you know, hang with it for a little while.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.600]   You'll get used to it.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.480]   I think one of the things you learn with software and I think sometimes like Google would be
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:49.600]   the first company to tell you this is there's no matter how much testing you do with a piece
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.960]   of software and, you know, any, an indie Mac developer, I think would agree with this.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.520]   You can test and test and test and test.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.000]   I mean, limited data, but until you get like orders of magnitude more people using it,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.640]   you're never going to squish every little bug.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.840]   You and a UI or a UX bug that really takes an extraordinary amount of like live people
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.840]   using it.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.680]   And you know, I think that's where you hear a groundswell, you know, when it hits that
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.680]   point.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.680]   I don't know.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.680]   I wouldn't put it that negatively.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.680]   I think they're being responsive to the customer.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.680]   But this isn't even a bug.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:20.160]   I mean, this is just a user interface choice that they made and people went, and they,
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.800]   they brought back the old way of doing it.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.320]   I can't remember them doing that before, to be honest.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.480]   I think it is good.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.840]   I think it is good for a company like Apple to be responsive that way.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:37.040]   And I worry that they're becoming so successful that, you know, arrogance could creep into
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.040]   their way of thinking.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.600]   And this shows that maybe that's not happening yet.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.080]   Steve Jobs arrogant?
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.080]   No.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.080]   I don't know.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.080]   I don't think so.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.760]   He's not that kind of guy.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:52.040]   Well, for instance, I just have this gnawing question.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:58.800]   Why did we not, at least announce aperture at, you know, the largest photography trade
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.480]   show in the United States, PMA?
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.360]   Well, just a few weeks ago, that's a good point.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.280]   PMA would have been the place to do it, wouldn't it?
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.560]   Well, I know that there are, there are, as someone who has to release products.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:16.320]   I know that sometimes we will release products the week after or two weeks after a, one or
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.160]   two weeks after a big event.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:23.600]   And mostly because in the area that we're releasing into, it usually there's a news void.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.480]   So everyone puts out a whole bunch of stuff during that event thinking that that's the
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.120]   best way to get press, but sometimes you're kind of in a crowd.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.560]   And so with a lot of our products, we've waited until the week after or two weeks after and
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.240]   dropped it in because nothing else is going on.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:42.320]   And we actually get more PR out of it than we would if we did it along with everybody
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.320]   else.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.480]   I don't know if that's Apple's timing.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.840]   They may just decide that they have timing of we're going to release a product, you know,
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.880]   we were releasing products at a certain rate.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.840]   My guess is Apple would probably just say we're releasing products at a certain rate.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.000]   And you know, it doesn't help us to squish two of these together or whatever.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.960]   Well, I'm sorry, I have to interrupt this show.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.960]   I'm going home.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.960]   Apple two is TV two is out.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.960]   I was just about to say that.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.960]   See you later.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.960]   Are you downloading it, Merlin?
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.960]   I was just about to mute and go walk.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.960]   I'm out of here.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.960]   Goodbye.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:14.960]   See you later.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:19.560]   I tried to download it this morning.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.400]   That's how much I've been waiting for this thing.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.120]   The rest of this show, the audio quality, ladies and gentlemen, may suffer somewhat
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.600]   as all of the hosts download the YouTube.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.080]   I love my Apple TV.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.360]   I really do.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.960]   I use the heck out of it.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.080]   This is a big day for Apple.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:41.040]   And I want to thank, I personally want to thank Cupertino for not waiting until after
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.240]   we record Mac Break Weekly to do all this.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.200]   For the first time ever, they've moved their release into where it shouldn't be.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.160]   They're paying attention.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.600]   Although the Apple TV take two, you could have done that a little earlier.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.000]   Have you seen that on blogs and stuff?
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.320]   Are you seeing anything official about that?
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.320]   I'm seeing it on Twitter.
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.680]   I haven't seen anything official yet.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:05.080]   Apple Insider, the ultimate Apple web blog, reporting it.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.160]   A lot of people are talking about it.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.080]   Let me see if anybody on Twitter has installed it yet.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.080]   It looks like Sean King sent his wife a message on Twitter.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.080]   Come on home, honey.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.080]   Let's watch movies.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.080]   I don't know what they're going to rent.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:23.840]   You don't think we should get like a special red hotline to Cupertino that we can use during
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.120]   Mac Break Weekly?
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:29.720]   You know, they've actually called during the show.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.840]   They called, remember that time where we were speculating about, I can't remember which
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.600]   one it was, an invitation to an event.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.600]   Oh, that's right.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.600]   They called during the end of the show.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.280]   They called during the show, but I had the phone turned off.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.280]   So you know what?
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.280]   I'm turning the phone on.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.280]   Apple, do you listen?
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.720]   Steve, the phone is on if you want to call.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.720]   You got the number, Steve.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.560]   Just give me a ring.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:52.640]   You know, there is supposedly there's going to be a, you know, they rented a crew, a camera
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.160]   crew for later this month.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.880]   They were supposed to have another special announcement.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.640]   Well, you know what that's got to be, the SDK, because they've got to announce that in
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.640]   February.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.480]   Oh, February, right.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.880]   But I wonder 16 gig HSDPA.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.560]   Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.640]   We're going to tie in the 3G iPhone to the SDK.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.000]   Yeah, that's what I would do.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.200]   Maybe flash support.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.200]   Oh, that's the other thing to start.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.200]   Okay.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.200]   Okay.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:27.400]   Now, I have, you know, I have not, I have no Apple source on this, but I do have an Adobe
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.920]   source that leads me to believe we will see something very soon.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:38.400]   You know, I have to say the air, you laugh, but then, but when it happens, you eat crow.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.400]   Okay.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:44.120]   Well, let's say I've got, let's say I've got five Adobe sources and look, they agree
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.120]   with you.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.920]   How is it even going to know?
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.200]   How does that mean you got an Adobe source?
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.040]   Like, well, I'm, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.560]   Adobe that claims it's going to happen soon.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.560]   It's, that's what you do.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.640]   You talk about news, you have from news sources.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.640]   That's what I'm doing.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.440]   And I'm simply, I'm simply mentioning, it seems like on the face of it, you could just
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.160]   be making that up and we have no way to find out.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.960]   But here's, here's what happens.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.600]   If it doesn't happen, then I say my source is bogus and I don't relate information from
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.120]   that source in the future.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.440]   But lately my sources have been pretty good.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.440]   They've been off a bit.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.320]   I had a source that said we were going to get the 16 gig iPhone at Mac.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:23.560]   Well, it was three weeks later, but he was right about the three, the 16 gig iPhone.
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.680]   You know, you can't, if the thing is ready, it's sitting, you know, in a warehouse somewhere
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.280]   and Steve just doesn't mention it.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.080]   You can't really hold it against the source.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.080]   No.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.240]   He doesn't know what Steve's going to say.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.240]   He just knows the thing.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.600]   There's a lot of buzz about flash for the iPhone.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.840]   And it's when my experience is when you get, you know, a lot of buzz happening around something,
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.360]   it usually means something's going on and you talk to your sources.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.120]   The sources say, yeah, we kind of think that's going to happen like any day.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.240]   And I tried to get Apple sources, but you know, the problem with Apple sources, I always
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.400]   feel bad talking to them because if they talk to me and then I say anything, they lose
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.400]   their job.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:01.280]   You know, I have to say, here's my, here's my rumor and I know nobody at Adobe.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.160]   I pay full retail for everything.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:09.680]   Sons of, but my rumor is that forget flash, they're going to put air on the iPhone and
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:13.240]   that's going to be part of the SDK.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.680]   And I have no source that says that.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.680]   So you would get the scoop, Leo, wouldn't that, but now just, I mean, doesn't that make
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.680]   you salivate a little bit?
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.920]   That would be awesome.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.440]   Because then cross platform, right?
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.800]   Well, air is great.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.560]   I mean, air is a pretty revolutionary piece of software.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.560]   But it does.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.920]   I mean, that doesn't necessarily mean flash would be included.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.920]   Yeah, I would think so, right?
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.920]   You'd have to.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.560]   I mean, you'd have to have support for flash on there.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.040]   And I think that, I mean, I just really think that there's a lot of things that want to
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.520]   be interactive on, you know, beyond web pages.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.520]   And the only way to do that was with flash right now.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.960]   Wouldn't it be great though, if you put air on because then you develop stuff, the nice
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.720]   thing about air is when you write, write something in air, it runs on everything.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.200]   It's like kind of compete with the SDK.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.880]   Well, what I'm thinking is maybe that is the SDK.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.680]   I think that there wouldn't be any way to control, would there be any way to control,
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.960]   okay, because you still control how you get it on there.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.080]   You control it even more because there's sandboxing.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.960]   There's a lot of, there's a lot of advantage to doing something in Java or something like
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.800]   air because for security reasons.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.800]   Okay.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.920]   However, there's one problem here.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.040]   How much love is there between Apple and Adobe?
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.600]   Really?
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.480]   That would be a big vote for air.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.720]   That's the kind of big deal that Adobe wants to make for air.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.080]   Don't you think?
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.680]   You guys with all the Adobe contacts, what do you think?
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.720]   Well, Adobe would sure like to do more business with Apple.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.920]   I don't know that Apple wants to do more business with Adobe.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.760]   That's the feel I get.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:49.240]   I mean, all the way back to the iPhone announcement, we covered the iPhone dev camp, which Adobe
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.920]   agreed to host.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.280]   It was at the San Francisco Adobe headquarters.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.760]   They opened up their doors and let the iPhone dev camp take place, which is literally a
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.360]   few days after the June release the iPhone.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:05.240]   I talked with several Adobe people on microphone and aired those interviews.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.080]   Those are very authentic sources, Merlin.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.480]   You can listen to their words.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:14.280]   They said, "On my show, flat out, we would love to put Flash on the iPhone.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.520]   We're willing to talk to Apple."
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.400]   It's not a problem from Adobe's perspective.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:25.320]   It's Apple and Alex and I have occasionally speculated that perhaps they want to see if
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.200]   they can still try to make quick time more dominant.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.040]   But I don't think that's going to work.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.080]   Let's face it, a lot of people rely on Flash.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.240]   We at Penango would love to see it because that would mean our player automatically works
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.840]   on the iPhone without any extra work from us.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.840]   This is kind of interesting.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.840]   I just got any help.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:42.840]   I don't know.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.840]   I got any help from a source of McDonald's.
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.480]   It says, "Ding, fries are done."
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.360]   I'm going to try and see if I can go in and verify that.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.360]   Fry's done.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:58.880]   Hey, would you put your own fries in your fistula form and come in with the phone?
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.960]   What the hell it says is, "Ding, fries are done."
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.000]   I've only got this from one source, so I might want to go some hope.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.600]   I could see why Adobe would love, first of all, Apple's got always in the back pocket
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.960]   the threat that they might do a Photoshop clone.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.160]   They're fighting them with aperture over Lightroom.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:22.520]   I could see why Adobe would want to reach out to Apple if only to make sure they don't
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.960]   do a Photoshop clone.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.440]   Why would Apple reach out to Adobe?
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.440]   What's in it for Apple?
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.240]   Isn't there some talk of them acquiring Adobe?
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.320]   Wasn't there a lot of loose talk about that at some point?
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.520]   That's an interesting thought.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.520]   Am I wrong?
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.600]   What was all the talk about somebody buying Adobe?
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.600]   Who was that supposed to be?
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:43.720]   I think it was a lot of talk from a lot of sources that didn't know what they were talking
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.720]   about.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.800]   Well, that's a pretty good synergy.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.520]   I could see Apple trying to acquire Adobe.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.600]   I could see it, but I just don't think.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.880]   I think that would be a very powerful mix.
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.080]   It would be a very powerful mix.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.840]   I think there might be some SEC.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.120]   You know, there wouldn't be because the Mac market is so small and I don't think there'd
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.760]   be any issue, a regulation issue.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.800]   Windows is such a dominant monopoly.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:11.200]   Anything that strengthens anything outside of Microsoft is going to be seen as positive
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.200]   for competition.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:18.560]   Okay, but you know, and keep in mind, anything that they did as long as they kept some of
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:25.400]   that stuff cross-platform, that would also completely mitigate those kind of claims.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.120]   If they made any of it work on...
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.120]   Absolutely.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.200]   And Air does work on everything, including Linux.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.200]   But Apple doesn't have...
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.200]   Other than iTunes, Apple doesn't really have a history of being cross-platform.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.200]   Right.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.200]   I know, but I'm just saying if they worked with Adobe and they kept what they have as cross-platform...
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.200]   Right.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.200]   Of course, they'd have to.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.160]   They're running down the ultimate rattle because this is just our fantasy for the show.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.160]   This isn't going to happen.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.400]   Are you saying that any other parts of the show aren't fantasies?
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.400]   I mean, I'm...
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.320]   No, "Apperture 2.0" really is out, Leo.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.320]   I know.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.320]   And I downloaded it.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.280]   I can't tell if it's "Apperture 2" because I'm waiting for my serial number from Adobe
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.280]   still.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.280]   You want to just give me...
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.280]   Do you mean Apple?
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.920]   Oh, so you see, there's the problem right there.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.440]   I confuse the two as many do.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.720]   I cannot give you a serial number that would be illegal.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.160]   But just temporarily.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.560]   That would still be illegal.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.320]   Just like for me to do the trial, they're going to send me one.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.480]   We'll talk later.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.480]   And this new Leo, he's really getting out there.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.480]   He's a great guy.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.480]   You're high-right.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.480]   This new Leo is in your face.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.480]   I am.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.480]   I like that.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.480]   I'm trying to do that.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.480]   What do you think?
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.480]   I'm just trying to add it.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.120]   No, seriously, dude, I think this is at least something that's worth trying.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.680]   You've been very, very gracious with people for your entire career as far as I can tell.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.680]   Oh, screw off, Merlin.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.680]   Exactly.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.920]   You need to get in front of this issue, Leo.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.680]   You need to get in front of this issue.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:48.400]   If you were to carefully edit the show, you could make a wonderful parody of Mac Break
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.920]   Weekly just from the material.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.320]   It would be funny, wouldn't it?
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.320]   No, I am.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.800]   I'm sick of this Uncle Leo BS.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.800]   I want to be the man.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   You're going to be the man of Leo.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.640]   You're going to be like the technology pimp.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.440]   You're just going to be slapping bitches left.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.440]   Don't say the pimp word.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.440]   You saw what happened to the shooster.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.200]   You're going to have Hillary Clinton on your tail if you're not careful.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.200]   All right.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.200]   I'm installing it.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.200]   I'm installing it.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.200]   It's running.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.920]   I got my serial number from Apple.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.920]   Thank you.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.920]   Let's run it.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.920]   It's installed.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.920]   Let's see what it is.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.920]   I think they fixed it.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:22.020]   Can we get new back Mac Break Weekly theme song like the Sopranos music to introduce you,
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.020]   Leo?
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.020]   This is Godfather.
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.020]   That's close.
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.020]   Oh, I'm off you, sir.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.020]   The same.
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.020]   Yes.
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.020]   It is 2.0 now.
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.020]   All right.
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.020]   Let's see.
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.020]   We know.
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.020]   We know.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.020]   Get yourself a gun.
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:39.680]   Get yourself a gun.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.520]   Start using aperture.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.160]   Okay.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.160]   So I'm running it.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.720]   Do you want to use aperture when you connect to your digital camera?
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.160]   Yeah, why not?
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.160]   You can change that.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.600]   You can change that later if you change your.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.960]   It is a very, I like, you know what?
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:53.960]   It looks more.
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:54.960]   You don't know.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.960]   It looks like eye photo.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:56.960]   It looks a lot more like eye photo.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:57.960]   Is it still?
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.360]   Is it lots of HUD looking stuff?
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.360]   Is it HUD-y?
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.040]   There are huds available, but they're not meant.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.840]   They don't have to sit on the screen.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.420]   I think I may be alone in this.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:09.100]   You know, I might develop a friend seem to like huds a lot more than I do.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.100]   I can't get into it.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.260]   When you say HUD, what do you mean?
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.260]   Heads up.
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.260]   Heads up display.
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:17.740]   The black kind of, you know, the, how do you describe it?
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.260]   It's that look that all the apps have now.
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.100]   How it that's translucent.
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.100]   Translucent floaty palettes?
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.100]   Oh, okay.
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.100]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.260]   Instead of a window, you've got this big kind of translucent, very dark gray thing with
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.260]   stuff in it.
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.740]   It doesn't, I don't know.
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.620]   It disrupts my Mac based sense of place in the world.
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:35.360]   Like windows I get, I get windows and I get palettes.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.080]   I'm liking what you want.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.160]   Now here's the question.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.800]   Can I, what plugins can I use with this?
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.680]   Can I use Photoshop plugins with it?
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.680]   Negative.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.680]   Negatory.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.120]   Apple remains closed in that regard.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:53.160]   You can use plugins that do things like export stuff to Flickr and anything on export.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:57.760]   You can use lots of plugins on export, but no filters, effects, et cetera.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.800]   Aperture has never been positioned as a Photoshop replacement.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:06.320]   Although I will note with some genuine interest that there is a retouch tool in this version,
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:10.120]   which is something I heard originally they would load to do for fear that Adobe would
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.120]   look at it as competition.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.760]   Hey, so it seems like such an obvious thing though.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.160]   I have a question, Scott.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:22.680]   This is going to sound, I hate to reveal how incredibly stupid I actually am, but aperture
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.960]   is mostly for organizing photos, right?
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:29.280]   It's for like taking, you've got a huge, you just shot raw for like three days.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.440]   You get all these photos.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.400]   You pull that down and then you're going to use that to decide what to keep.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.400]   You're going to tag stuff.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.400]   Is that the idea?
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.600]   It's unlike I photo, it's a much more sophisticated way to organize your stuff, right?
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.600]   Is that primarily what's for?
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:46.640]   It's my, I think one of the strengths of aperture is its ability to help you go through your
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:53.240]   images, tag them, keyword them, select the best images, catalog them and move them into
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.400]   a position where you can do very basic stuff with them just good enough to get a print.
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:01.880]   If you do a good job of capturing the camera, you don't really need another step like Photoshop.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.200]   You can move right out of aperture.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:08.600]   I moved a lot of images that I'm working on from my new photography book right from aperture
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:12.240]   without any editing because I was fortunate enough to get them right in the camera.
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:17.520]   There you can do simple things like crop, resize, but that's its strength.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.520]   It's not a Photoshop.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.800]   It's a prosumer, it's a prosumer like organizing app and like if you've got like a buttload
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.360]   of photos, this is the way to make sure you always have some kind of taxonomy for camera
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.360]   keeping your stuff organized.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.320]   Well, it's more on the pro less on the sumer.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.240]   It's still a fairly app.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:39.360]   They're getting to the price point now though where you would consider it as an alternative
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.360]   to a photo.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.360]   I'm considering right now.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:46.480]   I mean, because you run into walls like now, since we had a youngster, I'm taking a lot
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.480]   more photos.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.880]   It's the overhead of iPhoto is awful heavy for what I'm getting out of it.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.880]   No, I'm wondering.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:57.240]   I'm doing that right now and I have to say that the idea behind Lightroom is that you
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.080]   use it for a lot of adjustments.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:02.040]   It's not merely an organizer.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:06.160]   Many photojournalists, people who aren't going to modify parts of a picture but want to modify
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:10.000]   the picture as a whole, white balance hue, chromatic aberration, that kind of thing,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.400]   would use Lightroom alone.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.040]   This doesn't seem to have all of those features.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.040]   Am I wrong?
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.160]   It actually has most of the same features.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:22.440]   The main difference is Lightroom uses the Adobe camera rock converter.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:27.840]   Which by the photographic community has been set as the standard.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.160]   This doesn't mean that Apple's aperture rock converter is in any way bad.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.400]   I think it's very good.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.080]   However, it's different.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:37.280]   It's like we just talked about with the OS update.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:40.880]   When people are used to something, they're used to it by Golly.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.840]   People are used to the Adobe camera rock converter and it is an extremely good converter.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.960]   Up to now, the aperture converter, the Apple converter and aperture, I should say, has
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:50.960]   not been as good.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:55.840]   With this new release, we now have some of the same controls that are available in ACR.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.320]   They're starting to move more neck and neck.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:03.640]   Also Lightroom has been better about keeping the camera modules updated in ACR than Apple
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.640]   has.
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:08.160]   Apple, just now with this release, is catching up to some of the new cameras that have been
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.800]   out for weeks or months that ACR has already been servicing.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:16.760]   The other thing I would say is if you are an iPhoto user, this integrates so nicely with
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:17.760]   iPhoto.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.760]   You can see iPhoto pictures.
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:19.760]   You can import them right in.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.760]   There's an iPhoto browser.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.000]   Lightroom knows nothing about iPhoto.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.920]   It also works very well with Doc Mack for those who suffer the Doc Mack syndrome.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:33.400]   As somebody, what I end up doing is importing both into Lightroom and iPhoto, wasting a
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.840]   lot of space.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.200]   That's probably not the best work.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.600]   It really starts to add up.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:43.640]   My biggest thing is I've gotten into that week to photographer habit of taking several
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.400]   photos of the same thing and picking the best one, which is great.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.600]   I think a good habit for a young photographer or a newish photographer.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:53.920]   Boy, you sure if you're shooting raw, you really take up some disk space.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.920]   Part of it for me is trying to find a way to manage the stuff i don't need to keep.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.440]   It's kind of hard to do.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.320]   This is non-destructive, just like Lightroom, right?
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.320]   You still have your...
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.920]   Both are completely non-destructive.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.000]   I don't have enough experience in Lightroom.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.760]   Our good friend Fred over to Adobe has agreed to help Alex and i get a little more Lightroom
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:17.600]   experience so we can be a better judge of what we think of both products side by side.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.000]   I have played with it.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.320]   Maybe it's just because of...
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.680]   I used Aputure first.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.400]   I've used Aputure for three years now.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.080]   I'm very comfortable with it.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.680]   It's hard for me to get my arms around the Lightroom approach.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:33.360]   I'm going to be very open-minded, though, and hope that the Adobe guys can show me something.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:38.160]   I think it's great that both programs exist because they create that competition.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.840]   We all know that it's necessary to keep these things being innovative.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:46.240]   I was, in fact, quite worried that Aputure might just disappear because Adobe does a lot of
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:52.160]   marketing for Lightroom and Apple's marketing for Aputure seems virtually non-existent sometimes.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.080]   Perhaps it's just a different company philosophy.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.080]   They're both good programs.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.480]   There's no doubt about lots of people use Lightroom.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:02.000]   I will say that Adobe has a lot more people out pimping Lightroom than Apple has Aputure.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Right.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   I'll tell you, I'm a fan of Lightroom.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.840]   I use Lightroom regularly.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.160]   I do like the Lightroom interface.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.480]   I like the kinds of adjustments.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.920]   I like DNG, which is Adobe's negative.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.240]   Aperture supports that as well.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.240]   It does.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.240]   That's good.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.080]   Where Aputure really shines is in this loop.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.400]   Adobe really has only one level of zoom.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.920]   Oh, the loop is cool and they just got cooler because now there's a built-in 50% zoom preset.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.640]   I have to say that I'm impressed with the loop.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:32.160]   When you really want to zoom in and look close, I mean, you can go up to 1,600%.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.440]   You can really see this stuff.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.720]   It's very easy to find what you're looking for.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.200]   The loop works really well.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.680]   That's something that Aputure could, I mean, Lightroom could absolutely use.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.680]   It doesn't.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:47.200]   When we were doing Aputure 1.0 demos, Derek and I were sort of like the only two people
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.080]   out there pimping Aputure.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:52.040]   We would just go do the loop demo and everybody would do an on.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.720]   We'd sit back and let ourselves be congratulated.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.560]   It was a pretty easy gig.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.200]   We'll save the rest of this conversation.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.280]   This really should be on Twitch.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.000]   This will be a Twitch conversation.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   We'll save the rest of it for Twitch.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   This week will definitely be digging into it.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.160]   But I have to-- I'm also going to be talking more on this week in Fries.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.520]   Twitch.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.720]   Do you believe in the Canola oil approach, Merlin?
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.640]   Scott, I really like speaking to you.
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:21.680]   Guys, I am really so deep on NDA on the Fries issue right now that I feel like for me to
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.360]   even get out there and get into the transpats, get into the Canolas, this is going to be
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.960]   a problem for everybody.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.280]   I require you to open the kimono.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.080]   Yeah, or my source is kimono.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.120]   Yeah, I want to say that.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.120]   That sounds x-ray.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.280]   Can I just say one thing, Merlin, and I hope you'll bring this back to the powers it be.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.280]   Just one word.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.280]   Yes.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.280]   Lard.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:44.120]   When I worked at McDonald's in 1985, there was no question about it.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.760]   There was a big ass piece of lard that you dropped in there.
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.800]   You'd washed the grease every other night.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.640]   There was a big machine that you'd have vacuum cleaner that you would clean it with.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.800]   And no, no, there was no doubt about it.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.800]   It was-- that was-- yeah.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.800]   And there was a big old white block of it.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.040]   If either lard or tallow, but one or the other.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:04.400]   You know what, Leo, I have some sources inside what was formerly the lard division.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.600]   It's a different BU now.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:09.560]   But I can get in there and I will put that in front of them.
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.560]   Thank you.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.080]   Can you ask them to drill down on the lard, Merlin?
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.400]   Yeah, well, obviously, this is an issue that's going to-- at the end of the day, this is an
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:19.160]   issue that's going to impact a lot of people.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.160]   So really, net net.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.320]   I'm going to get behind this issue.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.680]   I expect to see a report on my desk first thing in the morning.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.680]   Screw you, Leo.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.000]   Oh, don't do that.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   No.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   I was trying the new Merlin.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   Oh, sorry.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   We can't both be the new man.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.080]   Yeah, I'll be the-- I'll be the-- I'll be the--
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.080]   Oh, God.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.080]   --lunky.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.080]   I'll be the flunky.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.320]   Can I say I am so happy today?
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:49.800]   I was happy at Macworld Expo because they-- Electronic Arts had Spore in the gaming area.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:54.840]   And now they have announced that September 7th, Spore will come out and it will come out
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:59.240]   on the Mac as well as on Windows.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.320]   Do you all know what Spore is?
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.320]   It looks awesome.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.440]   This is incredibly detailed, like, you're an organism game.
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.960]   I don't know if there's urine involved, but Will Wright, who's the designer.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:09.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.840]   Put that line right out of my mouth, Leo.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.120]   Will Wright is a guy who did Sims City.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.520]   I mean, he's the king of Sims.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:22.560]   He's been working on this game, I think, for three years.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:26.800]   They've announced-- they announced today that it will be available for the PC, Nintendo
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:31.200]   DS, mobile phones, and, yes, Macintosh.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.680]   I have been waiting for a great Mac game for some time.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.720]   There hasn't been a really good Mac game in a while.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:36.720]   This is the most--
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.440]   Not since "Chop Lifter."
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:45.760]   And the truth is, I've been really disappointed by the lack of originality in the gaming community.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.360]   It's all just first person shooters.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:52.080]   You know, what is the real difference between Gears of War and Call of Duty?
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.880]   Not that much.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.600]   It's still a gun, and you shoot somebody.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.840]   This is not-- there are no guns.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:02.560]   You start with a single-cell organism, which you design.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:08.400]   You build up through all the stages of evolution to spaceflight.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:12.720]   They call it massively multiplayer online gaming.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.560]   I'm not sure exactly what that means.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.320]   It sounds like you don't play against other people, but there is some interaction online
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.200]   between your creations and their creations.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.680]   It looks like a game for single people.
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:27.280]   Man, this looks like I'm looking at the wiki entry, and it looks really absorbing.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.280]   I can't wait.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.760]   Yeah, you know, that's the negative, is there?
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.760]   I don't know if I can--
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.920]   But would you have to give up your little guild game if you do this?
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:42.840]   I am willing to take my 27-elf warrior night elf thing and retire him.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.320]   I'll kill him off whatever.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:48.760]   I want to be a three-legged sprawl with claws.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.000]   So that's where I'm going.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   That's where I'm heading.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.680]   You've got to get points for ambition.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.120]   I mean, just reading this entry, it sounds like this is a wild game.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:04.440]   And they've had planned by May or April-- actually, they planned to have this out Christmas last
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.440]   year.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:09.560]   The last I heard was maybe March/April/May, they would have out the character builders.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:13.800]   They may still do that, but September 7th is the official release date.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:20.680]   And apparently it was the Star, the Interstellar Flight module that they were having a little
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.680]   trouble with.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:24.000]   They saved the best for last.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.960]   I'm really excited about this.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:30.720]   No, I'm afraid that my problem with games is not that I don't like them.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.800]   It's just that I like them too much.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.320]   Yeah, I know many people who actually won't do them because of that.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:39.080]   Did you guys ever say "King of Kong," the movie about the guy who's trying to set the
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:42.000]   high score on Donkey Kong?
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   It's a pretty good movie.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.400]   It's somewhat controversial how much of it is exactly accurate.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.080]   But this is wonderful scene where this guy has a Donkey Kong box in his garage and he's
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:52.640]   videotaping himself trying to get the highest score on Donkey Kong.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:57.640]   And his son is just screaming at him, "Quit playing the game."
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.000]   And it just tugs at your heart.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.320]   It's like every time now there's some new game out there, I just imagine my daughter screaming
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:10.680]   with a poopy diaper while I'm trying to make my drowelves some high-hard boots.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.640]   That's the most serious, shut up.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.640]   I know.
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:14.640]   I know.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.640]   I know.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.600]   I was really surprised Netflix has announced that they're not going to support HD DVD
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.600]   anymore.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.600]   Is that the death knell?
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.600]   Is that totally...
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:23.600]   It's over.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:29.600]   Best Buy is now saying "Only Blu-ray, no more HD DVD."
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:36.440]   I think it's a domino effect and I think you're really seeing them fall.
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.200]   Just got the Blu-ray version of Blade Runner Man.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.200]   It's sweet.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.200]   Oh, I got to order that.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.880]   And it comes with this whole kit of cool little things.
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:49.080]   You get a cool little silver thing that looks like the origami and you give a little copy
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.920]   of the Blade Runner police car and some stills from the movie.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.080]   How much is that?
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.080]   You're a weird...
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.080]   It's 100 bucks.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.800]   When you're watching that Scott, when they're doing that little zoom in, going between the
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.960]   testing guy's eye and the Tyrell building and they're slowly zooming in, when you're watching
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:08.720]   it in 720, you can actually see the guy inside the window of the building.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.480]   It's unbelievable detail.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:14.880]   I was having trouble because I was having an uncorrelated pupil response for some reason
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:19.440]   during that test.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.440]   I don't know what that means, but...
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.720]   You guys are really nerdy.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:28.840]   Scott, tell me in single words, only the good things to come into your mind about your mother.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.840]   My mother?
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:32.840]   I'll tell you about my mother.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.000]   I'll tell you about my mother.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.480]   I got that mother right here.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:42.880]   Before we trigger Scott's post-traumatic stress syndrome, let's get to our picks.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:46.920]   Are there any other news stories you want to talk about here?
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:53.840]   Just quickly an iPhone note, O2 says that data usage is out of control since the iPhone.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.400]   That's what they were afraid of.
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.520]   What they ever thought it would ever be.
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:01.320]   The whole world has gone nuts and it's even going to get worse because they're changing
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:02.720]   their plans to be more affordable.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.960]   Apparently the iPhone is a bigger hit than people realized in Europe.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:11.360]   Lots of rumors that the iPhone 16 will drop to $3.99 soon.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:15.320]   And Austria now has the iPhone.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.320]   That's the big one.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.320]   We sort of led the show with that.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:23.200]   Sorry, I buried the lead again.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:28.920]   The Land of Mozart has the iPhone.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.160]   You guys, you business guys, you paranoid business guys who follow this crap.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:37.360]   Is the AT&T Starbucks thing meaningful to Apple in any way?
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.360]   We don't know because AT&T has said whether or not they're going to include the iPhone.
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.880]   I'm being opaque.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:46.280]   This week Starbucks announced that they are switching from frickin T-Mobile, and I don't
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:50.840]   usually say frickin T-Mobile to AT&T as their provider.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:53.240]   And they're going to toss in anybody who's got a Starbucks card.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.240]   Is this correct?
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.240]   It gets two hours of free.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.240]   Now when they say Starbucks card, I'm curious.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:00.080]   Does that mean a coffee card or does that mean a Starbucks Visa card?
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.080]   I think it's their refillable.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:04.080]   There's coffee cards.
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:06.920]   That's a debit card.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.480]   So that's a very low bar.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.680]   I mean, anybody, you can give them a buck and get a debit card.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:11.920]   That's such a good idea.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.920]   You've got to imagine Starbucks got to be kicking back some money for that.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:15.920]   I've got a debit card.
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:16.920]   I'm charging it up.
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:21.240]   They must have some deal where you get on a serial number on that though, right?
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:24.760]   I've always thought that the Starbucks should just give away the bandwidth in some sort
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:25.760]   of way.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.680]   I mean, only because I have T-Mobile.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:30.920]   And the only reason I have T-Mobile is so that when I'm traveling, I can go into a Starbucks
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:31.920]   and check my email.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:32.920]   I hate using T-Mobile.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:33.920]   I hate their hotspot stuff.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:34.920]   I mean, not to write T-Mobile.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:35.920]   I'm sure they're a fine company.
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:36.920]   Why are you saying them?
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.160]   Oh, I have this totally vexing.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.240]   I'm totally vexing to use.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.440]   And it's such a racket.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.440]   That $10.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.440]   I find it like I've had to sign some T-Mobile.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.440]   Oh, well, I find it.
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:45.440]   I pay 30 bucks a month.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.920]   I pay 30 bucks a month and I use it all the time, all over the country.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:51.160]   So I don't really, I just sign and so I...
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.160]   That's what I do too.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.360]   I wish it were international, however.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.120]   Are we supposed to do free connectivity through LPC?
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.120]   Is there supposed to be something like that?
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.120]   Yes, and I signed up for that.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.680]   You get a year free T-Mobile.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.680]   Well, thanks now.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:03.680]   Well, I know.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:08.040]   And then of course, as soon as I sign up for it, I got my OPC.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.040]   I sign up for the T-Mobile.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:12.400]   And you go through a little rigmarole and then there you have an account.
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.960]   And you can use it on any computer, by the way, not just your OPC.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.680]   And then Starbucks drops them.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.680]   Nice.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:21.160]   Well, I believe that Starbucks is going to continue to let T-Mobile, at least for some
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:26.320]   period of time, continue to let the T-Mobile users still use it.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.560]   Because I looked at that because I was going to cancel my T-Mobile account.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.560]   I was like, well, that's the...
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.720]   Yeah, but who cares?
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.880]   Because you have a Starbucks card.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:33.880]   I mean, that's not a big deal.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.040]   And you can use it for two hours.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.680]   You use it for more than two hours.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:37.680]   Sometimes...
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:38.680]   Oh, really?
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:41.240]   Yeah, sometimes I'll be in like New York City and I'll sit there for most of the time.
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:42.320]   Which is go next door.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:44.120]   There's another Starbucks in the bathroom.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.120]   That's true.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.120]   That's true.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.120]   That's true.
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:50.360]   That's our growth strategy for this year is going to be to put an additional Starbucks
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:52.760]   inside of the ladies and the gents.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.080]   We want to really expand capacity.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.080]   There you go.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:57.840]   Well, you never have to go more than five feet without a Starbucks.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.360]   Actually in Vancouver, there's one intersection.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:02.560]   I think I mentioned this before, one intersection with two Starbucks, Catty Corner from each
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.560]   other.
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:04.560]   So you don't have to cross the street.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.560]   I don't have to cross the street.
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:06.560]   You can see four.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:07.560]   There's one place down...
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:08.560]   It's kind of toward the name of the market.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:09.560]   You'll probably know where this is.
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:10.560]   Yeah, it used to be.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.560]   I remember you could see at least three.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:12.560]   And I...
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:14.560]   From one spot.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:15.560]   You stand there and you can see three Starbucks?
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:16.560]   Yeah, it's like...
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.320]   I have a home in Seattle and let me tell you something.
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.560]   You guys ain't seen nothing.
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.960]   From our office, there's 12 Starbucks within three blocks.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:28.400]   In Gig Harbor, Washington, which is the little sailboat harbor where my home is, there is
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.880]   one corner where there are four Starbucks.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:31.880]   Wow.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:32.880]   On each side.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:36.760]   The funny thing is that there's a good reason for that is that people literally, including
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.440]   me, won't walk across the street to get a coffee.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:43.640]   So they opened up a tea, like a tea barrier or whatever they call that, but not tea berry,
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:47.440]   but the Terrian coffee, something or other, right next to our office.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.320]   And there's a Starbucks right across the street.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.560]   I haven't been to the Starbucks in like four months.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:55.520]   Because they also try and pick up cheap properties that are on the right-hand side of the road.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.880]   So people don't have to cross over.
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:57.880]   That's the other thing.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:00.440]   The big strategy is that people don't have to, if there is driving involved, they never
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.440]   have to make a left turn.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.440]   That's right.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.440]   All got to write in, right now.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.440]   It is all about the right...
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.440]   Unless you're going the other direction.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:08.000]   Well, let's just believe that's why they have it on both sides of the street.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.960]   Oh, right in, right out.
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:14.560]   Why don't they just have a guy standing on the curb with a cup of coffee in his hand
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.400]   as you go by, like in a marathon?
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.400]   Give it to you.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.400]   They just give it to you.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.400]   They throw it at you and you wait.
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.400]   Well, you just hold a...
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.280]   They throw money in a basket all day.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:26.840]   Hey, they got carts in downtown Seattle in front of places like the Nordstrom store that
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:29.120]   do 400 grand a year.
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:30.280]   Just a little cart.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.120]   Just a little teeny cart.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:36.920]   Just a guy with a cart selling coffee 400 grand a year.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:41.320]   If they could just legalize crack, yeah, these guys would know how to distribute it.
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.320]   Let me tell you.
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.320]   Which is that?
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.800]   They got the system in place, man.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.880]   Essentially, that's what this is.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:48.480]   They found an addictive product.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:53.200]   I think they read somewhere that they actually caffeine is more addictive than cocaine.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.800]   I mean, that's really the story here, right?
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:00.040]   I would be willing to test that side by side, if anybody's.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.800]   I will be a one man cohort.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:05.520]   And I would actually have some guys I could find that would test it for us.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:09.920]   We were having lunch yesterday and the guys were smoking crack right outside.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.920]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:11.920]   There's nothing like that.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.520]   We should do some tests right there.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.520]   Stick around.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.520]   That wasn't Ben, was it?
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:17.520]   What?
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:21.040]   I was wondering what happened to the Merlin Man Show, and now I know.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.800]   Well, Ben's got a lot of problems.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.880]   It's not that I procrastinate.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.400]   You look at him.
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.600]   You look at him and you still think he'd be doing crack.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:31.600]   He seems so normal.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:33.600]   He seems so quiet.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.600]   This is mean.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.600]   This is just mean.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.440]   I am not going to go for this.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.440]   But I do.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:43.000]   Now that I've mentioned the Merlin Show, I suppose I should ask.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   Is that complete?
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   I mean, it's been a while now.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.160]   The truth is that I'm coming, I mean, like you care.
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:51.720]   I'm coming back from like what had been a pretty full time father thing.
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.640]   I mean, hopefully I'm still going to be a father.
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:57.000]   No, I miss you on this show and I'm really glad that you have come back.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.280]   I've been as officially back in my life.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.360]   He's officially my conciliary running my life again.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.080]   So yeah, the more podcast stuff will be coming and hopefully more lunch stuff.
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:07.520]   Alex says I need to do different stuff for the Merlin Show.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.160]   So I'm going to ask him what I need to do differently.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:11.000]   No, I love the Merlin Show.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.720]   You know, Merlin Show was very successful.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.360]   You were, I mean, you're an example of a guy.
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:16.920]   I mean, talk about this is amazing.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.520]   I mean, here's a guy's on the top of iTunes on everything.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.520]   You're like Sinatra and you just.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.520]   I left it all behind.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.520]   I'm like Chappelle.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.520]   You know, I just walked away.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.520]   Chappelle, you walked away.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.520]   Except not rich.
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.520]   You didn't go, I'm rich, bitch.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.120]   And he's gone.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.120]   Anyway, well, you're sweet to ask.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.120]   Yeah, that's something I want to work on.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.120]   Sweet to ask.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:37.120]   I'm building capacity as Alex says.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.120]   That's that this quarter is all about building capacity.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.640]   No, we were, look, believe me, I'm not, I don't want you to get more busy because we
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.520]   really appreciate having you on the Mac break weekly.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.520]   You make the show.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.520]   This is the only thing I'll do every week, Leo.
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.520]   Thank you.
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:48.520]   This is the only thing I'll do this right.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:49.520]   Thank you.
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.520]   I really appreciate that.
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:51.520]   You're so gracious, Leo.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.520]   Thank you.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.520]   Shut up.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:59.400]   Uh, let's take a break and then we're going to get your picks of the week.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:01.000]   So get ready with your picks.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.480]   This is the point of the show.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.920]   The reason we do the commercial here is to give each of the panelists a chance to quickly
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.600]   skip scrounge to their My Applications folder.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:12.520]   I don't, and this also gives me a chance to not have to use my special Mac break picture.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:13.520]   Go ahead.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.520]   Take a break.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.520]   Banana.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:19.360]   Hey, I actually, I have a, I have a recommendation.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:20.360]   An audible recommendation?
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:21.360]   Do.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:22.360]   All right.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.360]   Well, let me mention audiblepodcast.com/macbreak.
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:25.960]   That's the place to go.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:30.000]   You can sign up there and get, you'll immediately get a credit for a free book and we like to
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.800]   every week suggest a book for you.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:33.800]   Go ahead.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.400]   So it actually want to Grammy this week.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:39.800]   It was Barack Obama's Audacity of Hope.
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:40.800]   Really?
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:41.800]   He got a Grammy, huh?
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:42.800]   He won a Grammy with it.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:43.800]   Best spoken word.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:44.800]   That's great.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:45.800]   And it was so funny.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:50.040]   I downloaded it when it came out and, you know, it just sat on my iPod.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:54.120]   And so I saw it and I was like, oh, I'll get to it eventually.
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:51:00.080]   And, and when I actually, um, actually turned it on and listened to it, it was exceptional.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:04.520]   You know, and it's, it's a really, it's, it's not, I don't know, it's not at all what I expected.
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.000]   I think I expected it to be some.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.600]   I don't, I don't know what I expected, but it really gave an interesting inner workings
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:13.880]   of the Senate and how things are working, you know, his experience of those things.
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:16.640]   Um, and not as much of a rah rah that I expected.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:20.240]   And anyway, it was, uh, it's an exceptional book.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.240]   I'll take the side.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.240]   The guy's a good writer.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.240]   I mean, that's the thing.
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:24.240]   He's good.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.240]   He's good.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:26.240]   Right.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.240]   Does he read it too?
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.240]   He reads it.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.240]   Good.
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.240]   And because he's, because he's going to mean, you know, you'd want to, does he do the, well,
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:32.240]   actually we've played a couple of clip from it before on another show.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:35.280]   He's, he's kind of offhand and just himself.
[00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.280]   It is.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:42.000]   It's really well written, really well read and really worth listening to.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   Good.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.840]   Obama, the, a bass, a capacity of hope.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:46.840]   Sorry.
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:48.320]   It's another book.
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.440]   Just say 43 folders in Vermont.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:56.160]   You miss, you miss spoke, but that was funny, Mr. Leo.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:59.800]   The obesity of hope by Barack Adama.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:01.760]   And you can get that at audible.com.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:02.920]   Well, it's easy to find.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.680]   Just search for Obama on a dot audible.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:06.800]   What's a nice thing about audible is you can search for books.

[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.800]   even erotica and sexuality.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:23.560]   Well, you just want to make sure we get emails this week, don't you?
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:24.560]   I'm 12.
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:28.400]   I like the way that that just made Merlin laugh.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.640]   Hey, I didn't expect you to say that, Mr. Leo.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.640]   That was very funny.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.960]   Well, I did his Valentine's Day coming up.
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:39.040]   You might be interested in embed with Susie Bright, number 328, intoxicating ecstasy for
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.080]   Valentine's Day.
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.560]   I think Barack Obama is actually her guest on that.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.440]   I think my wife and I are going to give each other a full night's sleep.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.680]   Yeah, I know.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:48.680]   I know.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:49.680]   I know the feeling.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.680]   Absolutely.
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:55.760]   When you have a baby, you know, erotica and sexuality goes right next to fiction.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:01.040]   Also history, kids and young adults, mysteries and thrillers, romance, sci-fi, self development,
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:03.800]   there's a whole lot of stuff on audible.com.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.800]   I highly recommend to check it out.
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:11.200]   AudiblePodcast.com/MacBreak for your free book and Barack Obama's Audacity of Hope is
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:16.160]   a good choice, a very good choice for your book of the week.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:20.560]   You must be 18 or older to purchase Susie Bright's.
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:26.600]   By the way, not come by three copies because you're, you know, then you could.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:28.000]   I could buy many more.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.280]   All right, time for our picks of the week.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.400]   My friends, Merlin, you want to start?
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:36.080]   Did you, did you, did you, did you, did you make sure, right?
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:37.080]   I did make sure.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:40.920]   Um, let me make sure I understand this every time a rug.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.680]   Anyway, um, no, the Balski jokes.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.640]   My thing of the week is really cool.
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:51.680]   You know how, um, back in the day before iTunes, um, maybe, I don't know if Soundjam
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:56.600]   did this back in the day, if you wanted to get CDDB info about, um, a song, it was kind
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.440]   of a pain in the butt and you had to use a, an outside app.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:03.320]   But we don't really have anything like that yet for video.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:07.680]   It's really easy because I guess, you know, video can be lots of different sorts of things.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:11.520]   But if you've made a backup copy of something of a DVD, for example, uh, there's a really
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:14.320]   neat little app called MetaX, one word.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.600]   You can Google that for the Earl.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:19.520]   It's kind of a nasty Mac.com, um, Earl.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:23.920]   But MetaX is an app where you can drop a whole bunch of, I think pretty much any kind
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:29.720]   of movie file on, I do video file and then point it at, it'll say like basically, okay,
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:32.240]   I just searched Amazon is this thing.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.840]   Is this the thing that you think this is?
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:34.840]   Yes, it is.
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:36.840]   And it will add that metadata for you.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:41.120]   Um, very including things like, yeah, it's very much like the way it works inside of
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.120]   iTunes.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:45.800]   Um, this is apparently based on something called atomic parsley, I guess we should give credit
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:46.800]   to them too.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:50.160]   Uh, I've never used atomic parsley, but I have used MetaX.
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.800]   It is, I think, I guess donation where.
[00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.800]   So if I, so I just, for instance, ordered Aaron Sorkin sports night.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:58.600]   So I'm going to get it on DVD from Netflix and then usually what I do is rip it so I
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.080]   can watch it on the, uh, on the iPhone.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.080]   I just over the iPod touch.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:03.080]   So I know how it works with episodes.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.080]   Episodes are true.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.080]   Okay.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.080]   See that's some, so it's more for movies.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:11.920]   But I did, the reason I learned about MetaX is a handbrake actually has a bit where you
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.320]   can tick a button and say, hand this off to MetaX.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.320]   Oh, okay.
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:16.320]   So that's right.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.320]   I learned about it.
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.320]   I thought it seemed kind of interesting.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.320]   So yeah.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.680]   So if you've got stuff that you want to be able to, you know, for whatever reason get the
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.720]   information about, it's a handy way to do that.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.600]   So this is a, this is a good adjunct or something like handbrake.
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.600]   Absolutely.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:31.680]   So this is MetaX.
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:32.680]   It's at K e.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:33.840]   Oh, this is such a crazy earl.
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:34.840]   Look at it.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:35.840]   You see that earl.
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:37.840]   Wow.
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:38.840]   It's cursed.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:39.840]   Cursor made it.
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:40.840]   Really, this is easy enough.
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:44.760]   You can just write the cursed editor dot net slash page 53 slash page 54 slash page 54 dot
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:45.760]   HTML.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:46.760]   Um.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:49.360]   Now come on page 53 and page 54.
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:51.720]   I ask you, I'm gonna give you the Ron Paul version.
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:54.440]   I'm just going to say go Google meta X one word.
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:57.460]   Yeah, that is, that is it.
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:58.460]   And it worked.
[00:55:58.460 --> 00:55:59.460]   It's the number one hit.
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:00.460]   You could even press.
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:01.460]   I feel lucky.
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:05.020]   Speaking of lucky, Scott born who made it out of name all in one piece.
[00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:06.020]   Yeah.
[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:07.020]   Here I am.
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:08.020]   Old God, you're there.
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:11.200]   I am looking for somewhere to put my rifle.
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:13.660]   What was that battle?
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:15.460]   And me to ban me to.
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:21.060]   So yeah, a lot of man be to be an Emmy to to you.
[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:22.060]   I don't know how he spell it.
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:23.060]   It's via the means.
[00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:24.060]   Okay.
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:27.300]   I just want to, I want it because your brothers and arms who are listening might go, wow,
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:29.380]   he was a band me to.
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:31.340]   And most of them won't because they mostly got killed.
[00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:32.340]   Oh boy.
[00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:33.340]   Jesus.
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.340]   That's all.
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:36.780]   Let's move on to something that's more fun to talk about.
[00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:38.380]   You know, I just want to say hats off to you.
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:39.380]   Scott, I'm kidding.
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:41.260]   That's a fact that I learned today.
[00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:44.060]   And I think that's pretty, pretty cool that you did that.
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:46.180]   We, we, it's called the craft Berlin.
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:47.620]   Don't make me out to be here.
[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:50.740]   In the pre show, in the pre show we took, we started talking about this and I, I had
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:54.940]   learned that you were a vet because we got somebody sent us a note saying, don't talk
[00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:56.820]   about politics.
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:59.740]   And you, you mentioned that you were a vet and that and I, and I had no idea.
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:00.740]   So, yeah.
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:04.220]   Well, I don't like to talk about it much because I don't think it matters.
[00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:07.820]   I was drafted and it was like, go to Canada, go to jail or go to war.
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:08.820]   So matters.
[00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:09.820]   It matters.
[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:12.780]   You served, you served a kind of eight, eight days later.
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:14.940]   Had I been born eight days later, would not have been drafted.
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:15.940]   I know.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:16.940]   And that's the thing.
[00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:17.940]   I mean, you, you and I aren't that different than age.
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:22.220]   I mean, it's very, anybody old enough listening, remember when you went to the high school basketball
[00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:23.620]   game and they read the numbers?
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:24.620]   Yep.
[00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:28.300]   Well, my number was three and a guy next to the law heard of a guy in Columbus who was
[00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:29.500]   two who didn't have to go.
[00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:30.500]   Yeah.
[00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:31.500]   Yeah.
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:32.500]   Right.
[00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:33.500]   Yeah.
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:34.500]   I was 254 on that one.
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:35.500]   When I told my dad, he says, how's your Vietnam?
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:36.500]   Oh man.
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:37.500]   Yeah.
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:38.500]   Did you, dad?
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:41.060]   He did not want me to go.
[00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:42.380]   Did he serve?
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:43.380]   No, no.
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:45.540]   So he hasn't served in his stuff.
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:47.260]   And my cousins had just been killed there.
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:50.860]   So it was a kind of a matter of where we're going down the wrong direction here.
[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:52.420]   You were saying I was lucky and I am lucky.
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:56.300]   I'm here and I'm here because I'm lucky I get to talk about image magic.
[00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:59.460]   Oh, I love image magic as a photographer.
[00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:04.940]   I deal with images and, you know, every once in a while, you don't feel like opening up
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:10.340]   Photoshop and bridge and taking the 24 minutes that that takes to happen.
[00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:15.820]   And you just want to convert something to, you know, J-Pake or, you know, PDF or TIFF.
[00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:22.380]   Well, this little program is unbelievable because you can basically convert images into
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:27.700]   more than 100 formats and I have to confess some I have never even heard of.
[00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:31.780]   This is an open source project that is on, I first learned about on Linux.
[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:35.620]   But because we're using BSD, yeah, because we're using BSD, we can use it.
[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:38.420]   With that image magic, it's the one that runs on a, like on a server.
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:39.420]   Yeah.
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:40.420]   Oh, yeah, totally.
[00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:41.420]   I see K.
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:42.420]   Right.
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:46.540]   And the list of things this thing does for free is staggering.
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:47.540]   Yeah.
[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:49.620]   I mean, it's absolutely staggering.
[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:54.620]   You can convert, I'll say it right now, hands down, you got a format you can't convert with
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:55.620]   this.
[00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:58.900]   Well, then I'm guessing you can't open that format because if you can open it, this thing
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:58:59.900]   will work on it.
[00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:02.380]   You can resize, rotate, crop.
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:05.860]   If you just want to do like real basic image stuff and you don't want it, you're too cheap
[00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:09.860]   to spend the money for, you know, a software program that does that, take a look at this
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:10.860]   thing.
[00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:17.300]   I got it because somebody was trying to convert an image from some like really arcane old,
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:20.940]   you know, photo software that doesn't even exist anymore.
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:24.180]   And I did research and found this thing and sure enough, it would convert it.
[00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:31.540]   So I mean, it works with, you know, DPX, EXR, JPEG 2000, photo CD, which is what I was,
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:35.260]   one of the things I was trying to convert because that format's kind of dead now.
[00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:36.260]   It does it.
[00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:37.260]   It's amazing.
[00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:38.260]   Holy smokes.
[00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:39.740]   I'm looking through the list right now.
[00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:43.500]   Is there a graphic user interface to this that you can download for the Mac?
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:44.900]   I guess that's what you're talking about.
[00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:45.900]   Yeah.
[00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:46.900]   Yeah.
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:50.540]   So image magic, M-A-G-I-C-K dot org.
[00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:51.540]   That's great.
[00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:54.740]   Because it always struck me as one of those things that's like FFmpeg, where it's like
[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:59.580]   there's so many things that you can do with it that it's like overwhelming unless you've
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:04.620]   got some like subset to help you, you know, GUI that's going to help you organize that.
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:09.300]   Well, you know, I use it all the time on my servers because many PHP programs, including,
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:13.500]   you know, WordPress and so forth, will call it as an image tool.
[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.700]   So I've been aware of it for a long time.
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:17.540]   Not what I didn't know and I'm really thrilled to hear is that there's a GUI for it on the
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:18.540]   Mac.
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:19.540]   That's makes it very forget.
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:22.740]   You know, you probably don't need graphic converter or debabilizer because you've got
[01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:24.580]   image magic.
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:27.060]   This thing's been out for ages.
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:28.060]   Does everything.
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:29.060]   Yeah.
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.060]   Yeah.
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:35.500]   It's probably not new to most people, but you know, I'm not, I'm not, I wasn't familiar
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:36.500]   with it.
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.860]   And when I found it, I felt like, wow, look what I discovered.
[01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:39.860]   Yeah.
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.620]   And everybody was talking about going, yeah, I got that on my server.
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:42.620]   No problem.
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:45.620]   It's, but it's somebody might be listening who's never heard of it.
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:46.620]   So that's my pick.
[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:51.740]   And uncharacteristically, it is zero Alex's.
[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:56.660]   And I do want to point out over at Twit, we have on, on our, on our blog at TwitPhoto.com,
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:02.260]   somebody has actually created a currency sign now to represent an Alex.
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:03.260]   What does it look like?
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:05.260]   I just have to go look at it.
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:06.260]   It's different.
[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:09.700]   But I mean, you know, you got your, you got your S with the two lines for it for a dollar.
[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.060]   We now have an Alex currency signal.
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:15.740]   And we're thinking that it's possible that the US government might be adopting this anytime
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:16.740]   soon.
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:20.220]   So if you see an Alex hundred dollar bill, you'll know what that is.
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:21.460]   It's inflation proof.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:22.460]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:27.060]   It's, it's the first currency tied to the price of what is it?
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:28.060]   Photoshop?
[01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.260]   What is it that you shop?
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:32.860]   It's about time.
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:36.660]   It's like a hundred years from now when they're studying our economy, they'll look back on
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:38.260]   this moment and go, well, it started off.
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.260]   The whole thing started, of course, as I told someone that no professional app should
[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:42.700]   ever cost more than Photoshop.
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:44.460]   It's like, that's enough.
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:45.460]   Yeah.
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:49.460]   And, and of course, times have changed and now you pay thirteen hundred bucks for it.
[01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:53.060]   It's a Final Cut studio, but it actually Photoshop.
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:57.220]   You get the photo, the full Photoshop studio now is well, they extend in version.
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.060]   The creative suite or whatever they call it.
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.060]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:01.060]   Yeah.
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:04.180]   So we're going to talk to Shash in just a second.
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:07.660]   He's got a pick, but before we do that, I have a, I have a pick.
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:09.220]   Alex Lindsey has a pick.
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:13.260]   This one's, I have to admit, just a precursor, this is self-serving to some degree, but
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:14.460]   it's, it's really cool.
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:17.300]   So this is about a third of an Alex, a little less than a third of an Alex.
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.420]   And this is actually our own product, but we're pretty proud of it.
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.940]   We released a DV-Mat Pro and Conduit.
[01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:26.300]   We're shipping that as of last week.
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:31.020]   And these are, you know, pro apps that we, you know, we use a lot internally.
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:34.780]   So DV-Mat makes it really, really easy to do great green screen, very, very fast with
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:37.380]   little DV and HDB cameras.
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:42.020]   And Conduit is like having like a, it lets you basically do notal compositing like you'd
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:47.180]   seen in Shake except live while you're looking at the video feed coming in.
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:50.420]   And with the power of notal compositing.
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:51.420]   Yeah.
[01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:52.420]   Is that what you said?
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:53.420]   Notal compositing?
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:54.420]   Yeah.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.420]   So it has notal compositing.
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:58.460]   And we, you know, we went around, we built these little, this little notal compositor that
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:02.580]   would let us do work in final cut in motion as a plug-in.
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:05.500]   And then, and then we were like, then we were like, well, it'd be really cool if we did
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.180]   an After Effects and so we did it in After Effects.
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:09.060]   And we were like, oh, it'd be really cool if we did this in Photoshop.
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:10.660]   So we built one for Photoshop.
[01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:13.860]   And then we go to Live One so that we could look at scopes and do the composite live while
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:16.460]   we're watching the video coming in.
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:20.820]   And, and, and then we decided it was too complicated to sell them as a bunch of little products
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:23.100]   because they'd all be like $59 or $99.
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.980]   And so we just bundled the whole thing up to one.
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:26.980]   So it's just, it's called the Conduit Suite.
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:32.540]   And what it means is that you can composite stuff, let's say in Photoshop and use the same
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:37.580]   compositing tree, the same tools that you used in Final Cut or After Effects or Motion
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.340]   or you can do it live.
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:42.780]   And for people doing, you know, green screen or one, a little bit more power for Photoshop
[01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:49.340]   or After Effects and have that kind of open-ended control where we made that available.
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:51.260]   And then, DV Matt, we've had out for a long time.
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:56.540]   It's just, we think this new version is probably, it's all GPU accelerated.
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:58.860]   It's probably the best cure.
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:03.180]   I hate to say that it's probably one of the best cures in the world right now.
[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:06.780]   Mostly because a lot of other ones haven't been developed heavily recently.
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:09.660]   And so we rewrote it from the ground up.
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.380]   And anyway, we're pretty proud of them.
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:13.100]   Can I ask you a question Alex?
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:18.180]   Is it possible to get a translation of everything you just said for the average person?
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:20.500]   It makes, it makes the green go away.
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:26.060]   So when you're when you're in about eight months and you'll see it.
[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:31.620]   You shoot someone with green behind it and then you click on it and the green goes away
[01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:33.580]   and some other thing comes up behind it.
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:35.820]   Hang on, hang on Alex, you got to dumb it down.
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:38.900]   If you're going to make Star Wars on your camera and you want to make one then, puppets
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.140]   look like it's a floating in space.
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:42.580]   You're going to make one of them.
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:45.380]   It's like a welcome Matt, but putting it around the green.
[01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:48.340]   And when you do that on your camera, the puppet's going to look like he's a floating
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:49.340]   in space.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:51.780]   And now dealing with that green screen, it's bad.
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:55.580]   Y'all know, y'all know that now they have shotgun racks for beds.
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:56.580]   I never heard of that.
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.580]   I got one.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:59.580]   You get one for both sides.
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:04.580]   For those of you who've never tuned in to our show, Matt Breakley, please disregard
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:06.100]   this entire episode.
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:07.100]   It's not in any way representative.
[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:10.940]   I just want to remind you that I'm not a redneck.
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:11.940]   I'm an Appalachian American.
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:12.940]   Thank you.
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:13.940]   Are you a pro?
[01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:16.700]   It was I wasn't trying to dish your product, Alex.
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.540]   I was just trying to understand it.
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.540]   Yeah, no.
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:21.900]   So it's these are really notally challenged.
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:25.140]   These are these are not probably the average Mac break.
[01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:27.060]   Listener is probably not doing a lot of green.
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:29.500]   But there are the Mac only product.
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:36.940]   We kind of, you know, we, but for the folks doing pro stuff, it's it's a pretty cool little
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:37.940]   app.
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:38.940]   You know, it's a hoot.
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:39.940]   Hoot.
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:40.940]   You know, it's a hoot.
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:41.940]   Holler.
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:43.860]   He did a whole segment on this on my TV show.
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:44.860]   I did.
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:45.860]   I did.
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:46.860]   I did.
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:47.860]   And I can't wait to.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:48.860]   The letters.
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:49.860]   The ratings will get even lower.
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:52.860]   I did.
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:55.140]   Be more sense when I do it on the TV show.
[01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:58.140]   It's hard to talk about it with you have to show it when you see it.
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:05:59.140]   It's pretty cool.
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:00.140]   And I had a.
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:02.940]   If you go to the garage stock, there's videos and you can watch it.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:04.220]   You can watch it.
[01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:08.540]   I want to say that when Alex does these demos, we're always at the same trade shows together.
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:10.420]   We're usually sharing the stage here and there.
[01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:15.780]   And when he does these demos, inexplicably to me, hundreds of people come and stand there
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:16.780]   transformed.
[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:20.820]   But I'm not convinced that half of them still know what happened.
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:21.820]   Just one.
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:25.260]   Well, I mean, the biggest thing right now is because of the GPU and because of the HDMI
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:29.260]   coming out of these little HP 20s, the biggest thing that gets people's attention is these
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:30.260]   in conduit.
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:33.060]   I'm glad you clarified because I think really.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:37.020]   Hey, so there's a GPU is this graphics processor.
[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:38.500]   It makes everything go fast.
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:42.580]   And if you ever plays Johnson rod, you're not going to go to the torsion on the.
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:43.580]   It's got a double.
[01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:45.380]   It's got a double overhead.
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:48.820]   It's time to talk about a show called inside the black box.
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:52.500]   Yes, which hasn't been updated for a little while, but we're working on it.
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.220]   I'm actually talking to Stu.
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:58.060]   Shash just send me a chat saying, Oh my God, this is geeky.
[01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.020]   All right, let's get it on geeky.
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:01.300]   Let's get it on geeky.
[01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:04.620]   Let's go across the pod.
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:05.620]   He's across the pond.
[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:10.060]   He's in the UK, but get the pun because his podcast is called across the pod.
[01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.060]   Get it?
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.060]   Shash.
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:15.060]   Hey, how are you?
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:16.060]   Shash.
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:18.940]   Yeah, I'm fine.
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:22.100]   Just start on stock pick.
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:24.580]   Image magic is the engine that pass pixel maitre.
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:26.620]   So if you have pixel maitre, you have image magic.
[01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:27.620]   Oh, is that true?
[01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:28.620]   I didn't know that.
[01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:30.500]   Did you did you understand what he just said?
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:33.820]   Because he has a rather strong Yorkshire accent.
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:36.340]   If you have, I don't know, where you from?
[01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:37.340]   Shash.
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:38.620]   Oh, down south near London.
[01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:39.620]   London.
[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:40.620]   Here's a strong one.
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:42.780]   No, is that what you call that a London accent?
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:47.340]   Yorkshire accent is the guy sitting around the money Python skit where they talked about
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:49.260]   how hard it was when they were younger.
[01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:50.260]   That's the Yorkshire accent, right?
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:52.180]   That's a very funny skit.
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:53.260]   Yeah, that's a classic.
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:08:02.140]   So Shash said that pixel maitre uses image magic as it's underlying graphics engine.
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:03.140]   I didn't know that.
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:04.140]   It does.
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:05.780]   Does it have all the capabilities of him?
[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:06.780]   I don't think it does.
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:07.780]   Of him.
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:08.780]   It does not.
[01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:13.740]   Pixel will do all of the conversions, but it won't do some of the really advanced stuff
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:14.740]   that image magic will do.
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:17.860]   But if you just need the conversions, pixel maitre would you?
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:18.860]   Cool.
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:20.460]   You have your own pick, Shash.
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:21.940]   Yes.
[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:23.460]   I have sort of two picks.
[01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:27.860]   The first is a half pick, which is anyone in the old days remember the game Return to
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:30.340]   Dark Castle rather Dark Castle.
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:31.340]   Yes.
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:32.860]   Well, now let's return to Dark Castle.
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:33.860]   Can you get it?
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:37.740]   I mean, it wasn't, you know, it's funny because I wanted to make that a pick for so long.
[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:39.420]   I thought it was only OS 9.
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:41.580]   I thought there was only only only OS 9.
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:44.700]   So they have a version now for a.
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:45.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:47.700]   It's the sequel Zsculp.com.
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:48.700]   Zsculp.com.
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:54.340]   It's currently in beta.
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:09:00.500]   Apparently, well, the last beta they did was 22 January to July, rather 2005, which
[01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:01.500]   is a bit weird.
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:06.420]   But I did see a blog post recently saying they've got they're very close to release to manufacture,
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:07.420]   which sounds good.
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:08.420]   Good.
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:09.420]   And it's still good.
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:10.420]   Yeah.
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:11.420]   Yeah.
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:12.420]   Yep.
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:13.420]   Yep.
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:14.420]   I've seen the video.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:15.420]   It does that.
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:18.420]   That part is labeled scariest enemies ever.
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:19.420]   Yeah.
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:28.860]   And my main pick, which is something Merlin's scene is things from cultured code, which
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:30.700]   is a GTT application.
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:32.220]   The other one.
[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:35.300]   But the key about this one is that it's XML powered.
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:41.620]   So it will import KGDT files from other application, but you can it's XML.
[01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:44.660]   So other applications can build plugins.
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:48.020]   And this is the one I think that's going to get a vast developer base around it, building
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:50.060]   stuff to integrate with it.
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.460]   Is it THINGS?
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:52.460]   Yes.
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:53.460]   Just no.
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:54.460]   Yeah.
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:55.460]   Yeah.
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:56.460]   That's the one.
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:58.260]   And it's a pretty too.
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:09:59.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:00.260]   Yeah.
[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:02.100]   It's got the iTunes sidebar and everything.
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:03.100]   Where would we find that?
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.100]   I know you'll put it in the show notes.
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.100]   It's sashdes@sonodes.com.
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.100]   Cool.
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:07.100]   So you've seen it, Merlin.
[01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.100]   You've seen every GTD application.
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:09.100]   Yeah.
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:10.100]   And I haven't seen all of them.
[01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:11.100]   I kind of got out of that evaluating it.
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:12.100]   It is pretty.
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:13.100]   It's really pretty.
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.100]   And it's a lot of people are a lot of people are really liking it.
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:23.740]   I need to spend more time with it, but I know a lot of folks who read 43 folders are
[01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:25.100]   big fans.
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:28.260]   And I got a demo of it or something or a preview of it.
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:29.260]   Yeah.
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:30.260]   Public based.
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:31.260]   The Mac heist thing.
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.420]   So I didn't spend a lot of time with it.
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:33.420]   Yeah.
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:34.420]   No, I think it looked real impressive.
[01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:35.420]   Yeah.
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:36.420]   $39 now.
[01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:39.460]   It'll be $49 when it's released sometime soon.
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.020]   It is very pretty.
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:43.780]   It looks a little like I GTD.
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:46.900]   And it has the aforementioned HUDs if you want to use those.
[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:50.740]   Has HUDs like those HUDs or don't like them.
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:55.060]   And you're saying it supports plugins through an open XML format?
[01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:56.820]   Yeah, users open XML.
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:00.820]   So Alex will know that the final cut suite, for example, uses XML.
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:04.260]   The other applications can interact with those without opening things.
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:05.340]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:07.860]   So the file format is open XML.
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:10.260]   So it means it's easily accessible to other programs.
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:12.300]   Easy accessible to the program scripts.
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:13.460]   You know, anything else you want to do.
[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:17.260]   I mean, you can go in and look for what's changing and figure out what you need to change
[01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:19.100]   and you don't need to reopen the application.
[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:20.580]   And it's very powerful.
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:22.300]   It's the way every now.
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.860]   Yeah, that's very cool.
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:28.660]   And what's really cool about it is that it.
[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:31.740]   I'm like omnifocus, which I've tried.
[01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:35.220]   And I've tried mainly because I've heard my link did a lot of influence with it.
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.220]   But it's his program, actually.
[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:39.260]   We tell everybody it's his program.
[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:42.420]   Yeah, practically so inaccurate.
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:44.340]   That's why I say it just drives you crazy.
[01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:45.900]   That's why.
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:50.900]   But this is slightly unconventional in the way it lays out.
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:56.860]   It has like just a rolling layout and it's got the iTunes sidebar with the contacts
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:57.940]   and trash and everything.
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:03.180]   And so if you've seen GTT applications in the past and you just don't like that layout,
[01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:06.780]   this is a very good application to check out.
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:08.660]   All right.
[01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:09.660]   All right.
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:12.220]   I'm sorry, I was playing Dark Castle.
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:13.220]   I apologize.
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:15.220]   Oh boy, this is exciting.
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:18.660]   I don't think you should get Dark Castle.
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:21.220]   Alex, after desktop tower defense.
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:22.780]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:23.780]   Desktop tower defense.
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:24.780]   It's my, I don't know.
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.020]   I don't want to cheat on it.
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:28.020]   It's really my one game.
[01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:29.380]   But what need you not?
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:30.780]   Is this clangregate.com?
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.380]   You will stay there for days.
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:33.380]   Cogregate with it.
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:34.380]   No, no, no, no.
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:36.660]   I don't go there at all because I like my one game.
[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:39.020]   I don't want to know about other games.
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:43.180]   I've had a problem with games in the past and now that I've found one, I just don't
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:45.020]   want to, I don't want to lose it.
[01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:46.820]   Does that make sense?
[01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:47.820]   Yes.
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:48.820]   Yes.
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:50.940]   Makes a lot of sense to me.
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:54.140]   Next thing I know, I'll be playing games all day and not doing when you work, which
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:55.540]   is what, and you're stabbing me.
[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:56.540]   You want time to go?
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:59.780]   Well, I think, oh, I didn't do a pick, did I?
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:00.780]   I love it.
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:01.780]   Are you there?
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:04.620]   You got to quit playing games if you're going to pick.
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:08.380]   I'm playing Dark Castle, do you mind?
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:12.660]   I want to get to the, I'm trying to get to the, part so I could play it in case you
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:14.180]   forgot we're doing a show here.
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:15.180]   Oh, all right.
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:16.180]   I'll stop.
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:17.180]   I want that.
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:18.180]   You can go to mackymstein.com.
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:23.420]   They have a, a YouTube video of it or just go to YouTube and type in return to Dark Castle
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:24.780]   so you can get that there.
[01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:26.820]   That was my favorite game when I was your age.
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:27.820]   No, it wasn't your age.
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:30.740]   I was 38, but it's, it's been a while.
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:35.660]   I used to be a crystal caliber man, the, the pinball game.
[01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:36.660]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:39.020]   Your favorite game when you were a Shaz's age was Monopoly.
[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:40.660]   No, it was his age.
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:42.180]   My favorite game was Gallagher.
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:43.180]   The Gallagher.
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:45.180]   It was that game with rocks.
[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:46.180]   Tempest.
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:47.900]   Tempest was fun.
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:50.820]   Actually lately I've been playing a lot of peggle on the iPod.
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:53.940]   It's the first iPod game that actually makes sense with the iPod controls because there's
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:54.940]   only two things.
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:57.340]   You go around in a circle or you press fire.
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:58.340]   Piggles.
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:13:59.340]   Fun.
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:00.340]   If you play peggle.
[01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:01.340]   Guitar hero for Mac.
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:02.340]   There is going to be a guitar hero for Mac.
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:03.340]   I heard.
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:04.340]   No, I spy he shipped it.
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.980]   Craig Stevenson was playing with it on Mac Rectecker.
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:11.940]   Oh, well I just, what I get for not listening to Mac break tech.
[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:14.420]   Shash listens to every podcast everywhere.
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:17.260]   When you're 15, you have that kind of time.
[01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:18.260]   Yes.
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:19.780]   My pick is, is aptly named.
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.020]   It's called Spaz.
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:24.820]   I want to apologize for that name.
[01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:25.820]   It's an air.
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:28.060]   The reason I like it, it's an air application.
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:29.060]   And I'm really.
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:34.220]   I'm really been playing a lot of, playing a lot up with the air and different air applications.
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:38.620]   It's from Funkitron, F-U-N-K-A-T-R-O-N.com.
[01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:42.620]   And it's a, it's a open source Twitter client.
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:46.620]   Now you probably use Twitterific which is kind of the canonical Macintosh Twitter client.
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:50.020]   It's very Twitterific like although I think it's prettier.
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:53.700]   Because it's air, you can run it not just on the Mac but you can also run it on your PCs
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:56.980]   and on your Linux box and anything else that will run Adobe Air.
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:00.740]   Uses Adobe Air beta 3 so you need to have that downloaded.
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:05.380]   It is free and it does a very, I think a very nice job of a Twitter.
[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:08.340]   Have you played with, I know you're a big Twitter user Merlin.
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:09.340]   Are you, I haven't noticed.
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:11.420]   What do you use to post to Twitter most of the time?
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:13.860]   I would lose my mind if I use anything but the web.
[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:18.140]   Because I mean everybody rags me for being on Twitter so much but I don't like leave it
[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:19.140]   open.
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:22.340]   And that's the thing with Twitterific and spaz as well.
[01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:24.820]   Spaz doesn't use a growl, it has its own pop ups but every time.
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:27.620]   No, Twitterific is beautiful but it's kind of, I mean it's not, I don't mean this is
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:29.380]   a slam but it's kind of my nightmare.
[01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:31.780]   I mean to have something like blinking at me all the time.
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:32.780]   It's always there, yeah.
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:34.180]   Totally lose the web.
[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:36.220]   Not good for ADD types.
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:40.180]   I got too much into Twitter so I just said leave it at the web.
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:41.180]   Are you on Twitter?
[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:42.180]   Shh.
[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:43.180]   Oh yeah, name's Tech Priest.
[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:44.900]   Oh see I didn't know that.
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:45.900]   Tech Priest?
[01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:46.900]   Yeah.
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:47.900]   Okay.
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:51.780]   It's a reference to Warhammer which is a tabletop game.
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:52.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:59.020]   Alright so Funkitron.com spaz, it is, if you're using Twitterific you might want to take a
[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:00.940]   look at spaz if you don't like that kind of thing.
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:02.180]   Don't.
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:03.180]   We are out of time.
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:04.180]   Shh.
[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:05.180]   Shh.
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:06.180]   I want to thank you for doing the show notes.
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:07.180]   You do a great job.
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:11.180]   When you usually a day or two after the show, Shh will show up with the show notes and I'll
[01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:13.540]   post them when I get around to it which is often another day.
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:16.900]   But we do get them there and if you go back to older shows you'll see lots of links and
[01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:17.900]   so forth.
[01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:18.900]   Thanks, Josh.
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:19.900]   We'll talk to you later.
[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:20.900]   See you.
[01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:21.900]   Take care.
[01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:22.900]   Thanks man.
[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:23.900]   And I want to thank all you for being here, Mr. Scott Borne.
[01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:26.620]   Okay, let me see now if I can do this exactly right.
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:32.700]   ApplephoneShow.com, Padango.com and the new Twip this week in photography.
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:34.180]   You're such a pro.
[01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:35.180]   You see?
[01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:36.180]   See?
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:41.020]   And Alex is also on that and other great photography experts and should they go to Pixelcore.tv?
[01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:42.260]   Alex for Twip?
[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:46.820]   Yes, they can go to Pixelcore.tv where they can also of course just go to iTunes and download
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:47.820]   it from there.
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:50.820]   Yeah, lately I've also, they can look at the blog which is TwipPhoto.com.
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:52.620]   Oh, TwipPhoto.com, cool.
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:56.540]   Lately I've been just saying like on the radio show, I realize it's no good to say go to
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:57.540]   Twip.tv.
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:01.900]   I've been saying we're on iTunes search for Leo on iTunes because that's really how people
[01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:05.100]   don't go to the website anymore.
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:06.700]   It's a lot of times it's the easiest way to find a quick.
[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:08.180]   Yeah, they just subscribe on that.
[01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:11.260]   I think it's like number, I think Twip, I think Twip it right now is like number eight
[01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:14.740]   or nine on the iTunes podcast list, the overall list.
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:16.980]   It's been a long time since the tech podcast has been up.
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:17.980]   I know.
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:19.180]   Thank you for resurrecting it.
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:23.540]   Everybody should make subscribe and get it to number one.
[01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:26.220]   We've been number one on technology haven't we?
[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:27.220]   Oh, I'm sure.
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:28.220]   We're number 12 now.
[01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:29.220]   You're probably number one right now.
[01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:32.900]   What kind of stuff, what kind of stuff we get scored as highly now?
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:33.900]   It's all in.
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.900]   It's all in.
[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:35.900]   It's all in.
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:36.900]   So, so aren't we interested?
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:40.020]   No, we're still up there and subscribe and push us to number one.
[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:41.020]   We've never had a number one.
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:42.020]   Wouldn't that be a great?
[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:44.660]   Oh, I've had many number ones.
[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:48.580]   I've had many number ones, but it not in a long time.
[01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:49.580]   You know, used to be.
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:53.780]   I could put out a new podcast that go right straight to number one, but now of course
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:56.860]   it's more mainstream stuff is dominates the podcast list.
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:18:05.500]   I had a number one a little bit earlier when you guys were doing your pics.
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:06.500]   Best of you two.
[01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:07.500]   You'll fix it.
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:08.500]   No, I'm never going to fix this.
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:09.500]   You'll fix that.
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:10.500]   I can't fix this show.
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:11.500]   The Supervideopod.com.
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:12.500]   I'd spend all day.
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.980]   Wait, wait, don't tell me fresh air, car talk real time.
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:18.580]   This week in photography, number nine.
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:19.580]   Number nine.
[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:20.580]   That's really great.
[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:21.580]   Get number one.
[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:23.100]   Look, we can hit number one right now.
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:29.700]   If everybody who's listening to this show subscribes to Twimp, we would hit number one.
[01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:31.660]   We can't fix the people that will send this show.
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:33.060]   What does it take to get to number one?
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:37.660]   How many subscriptions in one day do you need to get to number one on iTunes?
[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:39.660]   My estimate is about 10,000.
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:40.660]   In one day?
[01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:41.660]   No.
[01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:42.660]   Yeah, it's my estimate.
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:43.660]   Really?
[01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:44.660]   It's my estimate.
[01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:46.940]   Don't we all agree that iTunes tends a very heavily favored new stuff?
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:47.940]   Yeah, no, no.
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:48.940]   The way they do it is it's...
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:50.780]   That's why everybody has to do it today.
[01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:53.500]   Like when you hear this podcast, you do it as soon as you hear it.
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:54.780]   It all happens at one time.
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:57.940]   Today, what they do is it's from a week, but it's heavily weighted towards today.
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:00.700]   It's very much like a billboard chart or anything like that.
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:01.700]   It's not designed to show...
[01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:04.060]   It's a number of new subscriptions.
[01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:05.060]   Yeah.
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:08.780]   It's not designed to show overall most listened to by any way, any more than the billboard
[01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:11.140]   top 10 is designed to show record sales.
[01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:14.820]   It's designed to show what's happening this week.
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:16.060]   They don't explain that really.
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:20.620]   They just say today's top podcasts and top could mean of all time or today.
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:23.540]   In fact, it means today.
[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:25.700]   You are the number one tech podcast, Alex.
[01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:26.700]   Congratulations.
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:27.700]   Okay.
[01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:28.700]   That's very good.
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:30.500]   That's very good.
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:32.660]   And Alex and Scott.
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:36.140]   And Merlin Mann is at 43folders.com as well.
[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:37.140]   Mm-hmm.
[01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:38.140]   Prime number.
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:39.140]   Mm-hmm.
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:40.140]   Definitely.
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:41.900]   I thank you all for joining us.
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:42.900]   We'll see you next week.
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:47.260]   Another Mac break weekly is broke.
[01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:54.100]   The guy on the other end of the phone was one of those smart and used car salesmen pipes
[01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:55.100]   that you don't want to buy.
[01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:56.340]   And he's like, "You don't want that.
[01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:57.340]   It's going out of it."
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:59.420]   Next Tuesday, they're taking it off the market completely.
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.420]   It won't be supported in any way, shape, or form.
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:03.660]   If you crash, well, you'll just be totally out of luck.
[01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:05.660]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:07.660]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:09.660]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:12.240]   (upbeat music)
