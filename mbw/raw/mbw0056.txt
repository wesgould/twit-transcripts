[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.440]   >> This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 55 for September 5th, 2007.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.040]   The beat goes on.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.040]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.280]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.240]   We are at the beautiful Gotham restaurant in downtown Vancouver with a kind of an odd
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:52.480]   panel because we've all eaten a lot of meat and steak really.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.000]   >> And none of us were in San Francisco for the event.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.360]   But you know what, it's still a great panel starting with Alex Lindsey,
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.080]   who is of course a Mac Break Weekly regular up here to do the lab with me.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.200]   >> Yes, and I was actually there but I was getting ready to come here.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.480]   >> You could have been at the event.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.480]   >> I could have but I just felt like I could just watch it on the screen.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.520]   >> Scott Bournway, any kind of podcast broadcast via Jiku.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.840]   >> I heard that was great, was it?
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.040]   >> Randall Schwartz was there.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.320]   >> Yes, so well I wasn't there at the event but I was listening to, not listening to.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.600]   But watching Scott Bourn's Jiku cast essentially.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.240]   And the great thing about that is that as you make Jiku comments,
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.800]   other people can make comments on the comments.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.760]   So every comment he made, we had a thread following from that and
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.520]   it was a great place to have a discussion.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.560]   >> I wish I'd watched, I was trying to refresh and
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.080]   gadget every five seconds, what a pain in the butt.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.720]   Somebody got to tell them about Ajax.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.320]   Sean Carothers is here from the lab, rats and the lab.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.560]   >> Yes, and I was also sitting there on the set of the lab,
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.120]   refreshing and gadget over and over, probably 10,000 times.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.200]   >> You know, how many times have they done these now?
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.320]   First of all, they put the new stuff at the bottom, so you have to scroll all the way down.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.840]   They allow comments, there were about 375 comments before the thing had even begun.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.120]   >> So you're scrolling to the middle really.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.360]   >> Yeah, it's crazy, at least Gizmodo did it at the top and that was an improvement.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.600]   But I wish I'd known about Scott, I would have gone to Jiku.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.320]   Also, here Franklin Harris, he is with, what is the name of that thing?
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.760]   >> Digital underpants.tv.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.000]   >> Thank you very much.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.880]   Digitalunderground.tv, a very fine podcast.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.640]   And I too have my middle finger sore from hitting the trackpad, refreshing.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.000]   Yes, you know, you don't really need to be at these events anymore.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.920]   >> I have to admit, I was tempted, it was two blocks away while I was getting ready to pack up and come here.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.760]   And I just felt like I can check in at 11.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.000]   It really, that hour isn't really going to kill me.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.280]   >> No, and you know what, John and Paul and Ringo didn't show up.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.040]   John wouldn't have shown up, I don't think, but Paul and Ringo didn't show up.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.640]   >> Paul and Ringo.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.160]   >> They might have.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.120]   >> They never enough.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.840]   >> I had this fantasy, because I know Steve loves the Beatles, and I had this wild fantasy
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.120]   that he would get Paul and Ringo, and then he'd put big screens up of John and George and do a Beatles reunion.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.040]   And I know that Steve has kind of enough of an ego that he would want to be the guy who did the Beatles reunion, right?
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.200]   >> Enough money as well to put it all together.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.240]   >> Well, skip kind of around a little bit, but it looked like a Beatles event.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.080]   The beat goes on, that was the last line in the last Beatles press release.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.200]   There was a lot of kind of magical mystery imagery in the invitation, but no Beatles at the event.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.840]   What happened?
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.680]   >> It really felt, and you never know, but it really felt like a deal that didn't quite get finished.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.120]   >> It's been feeling like that for a year.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.360]   Remember in January, Mackerel D'Expo, when Steve Jobs is demonstrating the iPhone, I guess it was,
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.880]   he bought a Beatles song on iTunes, which you can't do, and you still can't do.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.640]   So maybe it's just- >> He can though.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.120]   >> He can.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.240]   He could buy anything he wants.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.760]   >> Anything he wants, absolutely.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.600]   So he said that he pointed out that 600 million copies of iTunes have been downloaded.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.360]   Of course, at this table, we've already downloaded 10,000 between ourselves.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.800]   I mean, you just keep downloading.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.000]   I don't know what that number means.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.320]   >> Right.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.600]   And there's one more tonight, obviously, because you've got to update iTunes to be able to handle
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.640]   the stuff that was announced today.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.800]   >> Right.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.920]   Although it seems like the only thing you're adding is iPhone ringtones.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.440]   >> And when you're looking at three billion songs and 600 million iTunes,
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.360]   each iTunes is only downloaded five songs.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.960]   >> Yeah, you know what, you're right.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.600]   That's actually not a good number to show.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.200]   I wouldn't show both of those numbers together.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.080]   >> He did though.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.960]   That's funny.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.360]   They did show an interesting number.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.920]   In fact, they remarked on this on gadget,
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.000]   32% of all music now released in the US in the past year is digital only.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.360]   It was never released on CD.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.040]   >> It doesn't surprise me at all.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.560]   >> You're a music collector and you'd still-
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.360]   >> Yeah, I'm a music collector and I'm a package fetishist, totally.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.120]   But going around Vancouver, which is not a particularly small city,
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.560]   I can't find half of what I want.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.120]   So I end up either getting it through Amazon or downloading it digitally now.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.440]   >> Well, I mean, why press a CD these days, right?
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.520]   >> There's no real pressing need if you-
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.960]   >> So to speak.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.600]   >> Well, it really actually limits, in many ways, a CD or trying to do CD distribution
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.600]   really limits your audience much more than just doing a digital distribution at this point.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.320]   >> Right.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.280]   >> I think that, I mean, there's some people who nostalgically want to,
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.040]   I don't know, buy a CD.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.360]   I still buy some of them because I want the DRM free.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.120]   I want to be able to do 256 or higher.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.680]   >> Sean's demonstrating a turntable on the show this week.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.800]   >> I'm going back to vinyl, man.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.840]   >> Oh, that's crazy.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.360]   >> That's insane.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.600]   So clearly an iPod event like this is all about music.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.320]   And so we've got new iPods.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.880]   The shuffles are unchanged, although what more colors now?
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.360]   >> Yeah, they've got pew smo.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.880]   >> They've also got a project red.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.080]   >> That's kind of cool.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.560]   New Nannos, they were the fatties.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.600]   Isn't that a surprise?
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.800]   >> Well, I mean, last week there was a picture leaked around the internet
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.120]   that everyone was claiming was a fake, and they look identical to that photoshopped document that was.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.200]   >> Well, and of course Apple set it out of season to sizzling.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.840]   It's our property.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.040]   I guess it was their property.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.520]   Although we're hearing, none of us have touched them because we weren't there.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.080]   But from those who did, that it's so thin that even though it looks foreshortened,
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.600]   it's still a very tiny iPod.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.080]   And what's neat is that screen is capable of doing video, right?
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.120]   >> Yeah, it's good.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.680]   >> It's good for people like you because the Lab Rats has,
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.600]   you know, that means pretty much every iPod made now can display out Lab Rats except for the shuffle.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.400]   >> Well, I'm off for that.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.080]   >> You too, Alex Lindsey.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.360]   >> Yeah, it's exciting.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.040]   I think that one of the things that we're seeing is Apple really asserting a lot of dominance over,
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.840]   you know, making sure that every player can play video now.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.560]   We waited and waited and waited for Apple to provide video-capable
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.480]   iPods all the way across the board.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.600]   And now we have them.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.480]   And I think that this is going to be a big deal for quick time.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.440]   I think it's also going to be a pressure time for flash and anything else because
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.080]   this is the way people are getting the content out there right now.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.960]   >> A big deal for OS X too because it looks like at least most of these devices are running OS X now,
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.800]   not the iPod operating system.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.120]   >> Yeah, the speculation now is that because of the operating system being ported to the iPhone
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.480]   and now running on the arm, that since you're using the arm all the way across,
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.200]   it makes sense to actually now in the same OS X, they keep sharing the same engineering on all of them.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.400]   >> And you can do CoverFlow?
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.440]   >> Yeah, CoverFlow.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.440]   I'm not really excited about CoverFlow, but yeah, sure.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.240]   >> Come on.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.200]   >> I'm not.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.280]   I'll get us Twitter podcasts on my--
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.720]   >> It's the same damn line, I'm going by.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.560]   Well, it's true.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.080]   If you don't buy stuff at the iTunes music store, you probably don't have a lot of cover art.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.440]   And the iTunes is terrible at getting cover art anywhere else.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.960]   So I mean, most of my stuff doesn't.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.400]   I use CoverSCAT to try to fill in the gaps, so that's a painful process.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.640]   But still, I mean, the fact that it can do cover flow shows that it's got something going on out of the hood, right?
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.480]   >> The one thing that was missing out of this demonstration today was the iPhone shuffle.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.200]   >> The iPhone shuffle.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.760]   >> Because life is random, you can just call anybody you want, but what you got button?
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.280]   >> You have no screen, no controls, you just push one button and you'll get who you get.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.320]   And you'll be happy.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.840]   >> That was speculated for this one apparently.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.040]   >> I like that idea.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.480]   They have an iPod classic.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.960]   I don't know if that's really got to find a market.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.040]   Well, except for the 160 gigabyte, which Sean Carothers will buy.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:56.920]   >> Yeah, I love that.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.800]   Although 40,000 songs in your pocket--
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.960]   >> I've already got that many, just sitting there waiting.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.080]   >> Could you fill it up?
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.960]   >> In my pocket.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.600]   >> Yes.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.280]   >> I thought that was a rather large bulge.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.000]   >> I've got the 80 gigabyte version now.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.440]   It's filled and I'm always--
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.160]   >> Really?
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:11.560]   >> Yes.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:16.840]   And there's always this one song that's not on there, this one album that I want to put on there as well.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.960]   >> I think it's interesting that Apple has not abandoned the hard drive.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.760]   In fact, they really increased the capacity, they doubled it.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.520]   So the smallest hard drive iPod you can get now is 80 gigabytes.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.960]   That's 250 and I knew that that would drop in price because I just bought one about a month or two ago.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.760]   And I paid 350, it's now 250.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.560]   And for the same price I paid, I could have got 160 gigabytes.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.040]   That's okay.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.320]   >> You can get a rebate.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.160]   >> Steve owes me money anyway for this iPhone thing, which we'll talk about in a second.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.840]   But the big announcement that--
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.320]   and I think the one everybody's really happy to see is this iPhone--
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.840]   or I'm sorry, iPod Touch.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:54.440]   >> That's the one I wanted to see 160 gigs on because, you know, with this bigger screen on this.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.640]   And you want to be able to stream a lot of video and video is very data intensive.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.760]   You want more space.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.280]   >> It's almost like they've got two lines.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.520]   They've got the iPod Classic and the Shuffle, which are the old style.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.200]   And they've got now this new Nano and this iPod Touch which is the new style.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.680]   They've kind of split the product line in half.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:18.040]   >> What are the advantages though of going with the non-disc version for the large screen?
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.280]   I'm finding this on flights as I can see, watch six hours of video in a nice wide screen.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.320]   >> Much better battery life.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.640]   >> Because there's not spending any particles around it.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.560]   >> They're claiming seven hours of video time.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.680]   >> Well, that's sort of what I'm getting.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.360]   Six to seven hours of my iPhone, yeah.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.720]   >> That's pretty nice, isn't it?
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.480]   >> They're actually starting to venture away from the portable audio player
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.320]   into something like a portable media player.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.760]   Giving companies like Arco's to run for their money with their new devices.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.840]   >> Yeah, I think that's a good point.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.040]   And of course, the iPhone Touch has this great iPhone screen,
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.600]   which I don't think there's any iPod Touch.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.160]   I don't think there's any device with a screen that good.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.080]   I mean, even the Arco's.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.760]   >> The new new new new.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.880]   >> Ray scale, dude.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.320]   >> Newton version two.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.800]   >> And the thing is, is that it's so much more than an iPod now.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.960]   I mean, you know, you're really, you know, this new iPod has all the other features that you have.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.600]   >> It's a PDA.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.080]   >> It really is.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.040]   I mean, you have everything except for the phone, you know, on this iPhone.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.520]   >> Wi-Fi, you've got contacts, you've got address book.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.960]   You can, Safari, you could surf the net.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.600]   >> Yeah, so it really is a lot more than simply just an iPod.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.760]   And I think that that's what a lot of us wanted.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.960]   We don't want to carry a PDA around an or iPod and, you know, and for me and my phone, you know, so that.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.000]   >> Well, that's why I like the iPhone.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   I mean, I don't know if I'll buy an iPod Touch because I already have the iPhone.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.880]   Although I like the 16 gigs, I'd love to see that extra space.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.120]   >> Yeah, see, with the OS 10 back end on this thing and the Wi-Fi capability,
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.960]   it's no wonder they had to drop the price on the iPhone itself,
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.440]   because now you put Skype on the same, find a hotspot.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.800]   And this thing essentially does everything that the iPhone can do.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.040]   >> Is there enough power on these iPod Touch's Randall to run Skype, do you think?
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.200]   What kind of arm chip is in there, do you know?
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.440]   >> I don't think it's going to be able to run Skype.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.200]   I think we're going to have problems getting to that.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.280]   Because we'd also have to have an open source version of Skype,
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.400]   because the protocol is not open.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.080]   >> There is a PDA version of Skype for Windows Mobile.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.320]   So, I mean, it should be more than K86.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.360]   That's actually a 6-ton arm.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.080]   >> That's Excal, yeah.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:11.720]   >> All right.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.760]   So that's not going to be an I think it's going to be a little low power.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.680]   The other thing is that we don't know if this iPod Touch has audio in.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.440]   If it doesn't have audio in, then--
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.560]   >> It doesn't have speakers.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.200]   So you're right.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.680]   You probably aren't going to be able to do that.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.880]   >> Although, well, wait a minute now.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.760]   There are-- Belkin allows you to do audio in by a little addition to a standard iPod.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.880]   >> And a lot of those other companies.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:32.920]   Yeah, you can tune with you.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:33.880]   >> Whatever they call it.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.920]   >> So there's no reason.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.080]   >> So those devices aren't currently supported by the iPhone.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.320]   I know I have both of them and iPhone hates those.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.440]   So there might not be the--
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.960]   >> Apple could make it impossible.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.960]   >> It's possible to make it impossible.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.280]   >> How long--
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.160]   >> Thank you.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.840]   >> That's fascinating.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.840]   How long do you think before we start seeing iPhone-style apps,
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.160]   third-party apps on the iPod Touch?
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.480]   >> Well, I think that a lot of the technology's already figured out
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.360]   because I think they're--
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.320]   I don't think they're going to make a radical change in the sync file format,
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.080]   which is the big thing to start figuring out.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.520]   They're not going to make a lot of change
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.280]   and sort of where things are laid out and things like that
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.120]   on the actual layout of the disk.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.160]   And knowing how fast these guys work to go from--
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.440]   here's a black box to--
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.080]   >> It's amazing.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.960]   >> Oh, by the way, we can hack anything we want in here now, pretty much.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.560]   >> I installed the Null River iPhone app installer today,
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.720]   and it's a third-party apps.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.600]   It's everything you want it.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.960]   I mean, it's pretty impressive.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.120]   >> Well, the fact is there's an entire tool chain that works with Xcode.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.640]   I mean, it just looks like it's the real thing.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.440]   >> And that's why, right?
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.480]   Because they really know it.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.280]   It's Darwin.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.280]   >> Yeah, and well, I'm fascinated.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.280]   I wonder what actually what Apple is going to release
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.320]   when they eventually release the software development kit for the iPhone.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.360]   I mean, I bet-- I wonder if they just waited for everybody else to solve it
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.800]   and now they're going to release this.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.320]   >> And the big thing that by not releasing an SDK,
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:51.560]   the big thing that Apple-- it leaves Apple open to is people can create all the apps they want.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.720]   They can create all the services that was not responsible.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.720]   >> But if Apple changes something and it breaks,
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.040]   hey, we didn't-- we didn't-- we didn't-- we didn't sanction this.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.120]   And that leaves them with the freedom that they have
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.960]   and all the apps that people want.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.840]   So Apple may just kind of look a blind eye to it.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.360]   >> They may encourage it in some ways.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:08.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.520]   >> Yeah, I know that people freaked out that when the iPhone
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.120]   was first released without the SDK.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.000]   But what I looked at is that, you know, what if they-- exactly what you said,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.280]   when they walk in an interface, they restuck with it
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.720]   and they didn't want to walk in an interface yet.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.320]   They knew that they were in moving target,
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.000]   trying to get apps out there, trying to get things going on.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   I know how much work it takes to produce an SDK,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.920]   although the development work that takes for that,
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.360]   to really publish it and make it right.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.240]   And they didn't do that.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.040]   >> Now they essentially have a PDA without third-party apps,
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.400]   which is kind of a weird position to be in with this iPod touch.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.320]   I imagine they want third-party apps on that thing, maybe not Skype,
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.160]   but they want third-party apps on that thing.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.440]   Again, they've got lots of space.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.200]   There's lots of free icon space on there.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.320]   >> I'm thinking that we might wait all the way until WWDC next year
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.400]   before we see Apple release any kind of SDK.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.640]   That would be the time-- if you're going to release an SDK,
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.400]   the time would be WWDC next year.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:53.880]   Otherwise--
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.320]   >> Well, also sell 10 million and there's a nice market for you, right?
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:57.640]   >> Exactly.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.360]   You walk right into it.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.120]   But right now, watch what people are doing,
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.240]   watch what they get done and just build the SDK
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.600]   from what people are already creating
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.720]   and what they're running up against.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:05.960]   >> All right.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.480]   Who buys an iPod touch?
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.040]   Eight and 16 gigabytes.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.080]   The prices are--
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.120]   >> Go ahead.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.920]   >> In the US, Verizon users buy the iPod touch
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.960]   because the Verizon is so much better than AT&T as far as--
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.440]   >> Right.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.360]   >> Or if you live in Vermont.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:22.680]   >> Right.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.320]   I mean, you just really-- I have to admit,
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.880]   with my iPhone, my coverage is about--
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.280]   feels half of what my Verizon was.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.480]   But now you're not going to go back.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.440]   You like your iPhone.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:32.840]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.360]   And I have to admit, when we started,
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.840]   when we were talking about the iPhone, I said,
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.200]   you know, what I really want is everything but the iPhone.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.760]   You know, I want everything but the iPhone.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.480]   I don't want to--
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.280]   you know, I don't really want the phone.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.720]   I'm happy with just having a--
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.160]   >> Well, now they've got it.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.040]   >> And I got it.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.880]   >> I kind of want to keep the iPhone.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.480]   >> I kind of like having it all in one piece.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.360]   >> You know, I like--
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.080]   >> I don't want to--
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.720]   I wouldn't want to carry an iPod touch and an iPhone.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.600]   >> I was sitting--
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.440]   you know, I was in Zimbabwe last week,
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.400]   text messaging all over the world to keep things going
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.320]   on my little iPhone and not--
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.000]   I would never want to go back, you know.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.280]   So I was quite happy.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.080]   >> Is there anything missing from the iPod touch
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.760]   that should have been there?
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:13.320]   It seemed--
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.280]   >> Bigger hard drive.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.640]   >> You really want a hard drive version.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.760]   Look how slim it is though.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.120]   It's actually thinner than the iPhone.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.720]   >> Yeah, I love the size of that thing
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.680]   and I understand definitely why from a battery perspective,
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.800]   you wouldn't put the hard drive in there.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.600]   But I want that touch screen interface and the capacity.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.800]   >> There's no speakers on it either,
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.680]   which I thought was kind of cool.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.920]   You can actually listen or watch a movie on the iPhone
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.360]   without plugging in the headphones.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.400]   >> It's also interesting that the iPhone still doesn't have
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.720]   Bluetooth support for the iPod part.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.440]   And I'm wondering if they left Bluetooth entirely out
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.640]   of the iPod touch, or whether it's in there,
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.960]   but also now support stereo Bluetooth headsets.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.080]   That would be interesting to see.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.200]   >> Love to see its support.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.320]   What is that called?
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.560]   Yeah, you the guy who told me that.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.360]   >> A2DP.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:52.920]   >> A2DP?
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.200]   >> It's not a droid.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.480]   >> It's not a droid.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.480]   It's a-- it's blue, but it's not a droid.
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.280]   All right, anything else to say?
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.320]   I think we covered it.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.960]   >> We didn't really get into the iPhone.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.600]   So we kind of got up to it, but there's the--
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.920]   you know, of course, they dropped the price by 200 bucks.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.840]   >> Goddamn them, they're the other--
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.160]   >> So on-- so I mean, there's a battle
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.360]   apparently going on right now.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.880]   I got some email on the Apple forums
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.360]   where people are putting up infuriated,
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:23.000]   you know, that, hey, we just bought this two months ago,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.920]   and it's 200 bucks less now,
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.280]   and Apple's plugged down as fast as they can.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.880]   I understand that was going on on Jai-Koo2,
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.680]   even as Scott was taking the notes during the event.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.600]   >> There was certainly quite a few people that I saw
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.560]   that in that particular thread,
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.640]   as soon as the price drop was announced, including me.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.840]   >> That's a big price drop.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.200]   >> A huge price drop, and it was--
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.880]   you know, it's even $100 lower than the refurbs.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.520]   And actually, somebody said,
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.520]   well, does the refurge $100 less than that?
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.560]   Maybe.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.560]   >> Well, it's interesting.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.200]   Apple's got a 10-day price guarantee policy,
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:53.000]   but the restocking fee is a lot cheaper than the price drop.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.520]   So a lot of people are actually saying,
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.000]   I might as well just return our iPhones, and then go buy.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.840]   >> Could I return when I bought on the 29s?
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.680]   >> I believe you have a 90-day return policy.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.280]   >> Oh, let's all return our iPhones.
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.560]   >> Whoa, there we go.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.880]   >> I think we're stocking fees only like $55,
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.040]   and then, you know, pay your $55--
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.560]   >> If you have your box and everything else.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.600]   >> If you have your box and everything, obviously.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.400]   >> Oh, shoot.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.040]   I mean, I think--
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.600]   >> So I just bought an 80 gig iPod,
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.720]   now $100 less.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.800]   I just bought an iPhone now, $200.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.320]   Steve owes me $300.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.920]   >> You could just send me one of those
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.560]   new iPod--
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.560]   >> Welcome to the world of technology, guys.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.520]   >> The thing is--
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.480]   >> That was quick.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.000]   >> With all technology, I have to admit.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.120]   I approach it as, is it worth it for me right now--
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:32.280]   >> Right.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.320]   >> To buy what I'm going to buy,
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.840]   and if it's not, I don't buy it, and if it is.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.280]   I don't think about what it's going to be
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.720]   two weeks from now or three weeks from now,
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.320]   because it's going to be less.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.840]   >> I have to say, though, a 33% price drop in two months
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:43.640]   is pretty big.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.640]   >> I mean, the thing that excites me more than anything else,
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.760]   though, is that as an iPhone owner, it is to our--
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.520]   you know, it's to our advantage to have the iPhone
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.720]   become bigger and bigger and bigger,
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.160]   because it means there's more available,
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.280]   there's more people using it,
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.320]   and so them dropping the price and increasing the market,
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.040]   you know, getting to 5 million, 10 million users,
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.120]   benefits us in the long term.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.000]   I don't really care what the price--
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.880]   >> Read the tea leaves, though.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.080]   Did the price drop come about
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.680]   because they weren't selling enough iPhones,
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.040]   or because why not?
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.880]   >> I think it's because they were selling them so well,
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.600]   they could afford the recoup on the investment
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.560]   for the engineering already.
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:20.600]   >> And it has to be dropped to fit into the new line, too, right?
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.280]   >> Right, and I think that they're going for the jugular.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.560]   I mean, at $3.99, it was causing pain.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.120]   At $3.99, the smartphone market.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:28.920]   >> It's going to go crazy.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.200]   I mean, they do dominate.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.040]   We know this in the smartphone market.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.040]   >> Well, and the only value add between that
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.880]   and the iPod Touch is the phone functionality,
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.720]   so they really can't be too much more.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.480]   >> Yeah, I mean, they add really no choice.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.960]   >> So for a hundred bucks more, you get a phone.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.400]   That's not a bad deal.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.720]   >> Yeah, I think with the release of the iPod Touch today,
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.400]   they would lose a lot of the market for the iPhone.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.600]   People that were sort of waffling,
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.120]   whether they actually wanted the phone functionality,
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.160]   because now all those cool features,
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.600]   like the touch screen, you can get it elsewhere,
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.120]   and have a great music device,
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.520]   not have to pay extra for your data plan.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.400]   >> I wonder who's going to--
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.120]   well, I guess people who want the capacity to buy the classic,
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.040]   but boy, doesn't that iPod Touch really look like the way to go?
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.040]   >> I really want one, but I can't justify it.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.000]   >> Right, yeah.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.680]   >> I think the classic is a swan song.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.600]   I mean, I think that's going to be the last.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.560]   If you're a collector, I think--
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.280]   >> How about the nano?
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.880]   Who buys the new nano?
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.080]   >> I think the nano is a lot--
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.040]   it could be a lot of fun.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.520]   I mean, you know, I have just about all--
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.400]   >> Kids, it's for kids.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.320]   >> Yeah, I think that someone doesn't want to spend
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.120]   quite that much money.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.480]   I mean, one of the things that's really interesting
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:29.160]   is Apple really has sewn up from $99 all the way up to $400.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.160]   I mean, they have every $50.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.240]   There's a product for you.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.840]   You know, depending on how much money you want to spend.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.560]   >> $79, actually.
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.680]   >> $79, $79.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.320]   >> That's the shuffle.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.440]   Yeah, for one gig shuffle.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.280]   >> And you can get all those colors.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.960]   >> I mean, I want the nano.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.760]   I travel a lot.
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.880]   I like to take media with me.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.360]   I like to sit--
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.960]   >> Would you watch movies on that screen?
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.200]   >> No, but I'd actually hook it up to a TV and watch it.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.600]   And like Alex, I'm not really worried about the super high
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.160]   resolution.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.240]   I'm more worried about the content of what I'm actually
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:53.640]   watching.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.440]   It's a great little thing.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.640]   It's some senior sure pocket.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.160]   It's got video functionality now.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.280]   So I can find me in a hotel.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.760]   I can hook it up to a TV, sit back with the remote,
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.360]   and just watch.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.480]   >> And something like Ask An Ninja would look great on that.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.440]   >> Yeah, that's true.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.360]   Again, as I said, this is--
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.360]   everybody here-- well, two of us, Randall, and I do audio only.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:17.400]   But the three of you, Alex, Frank, and Sean, do video podcasts.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.200]   So it does open up a market when you get tens of millions
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.360]   of people with all with video now.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.760]   >> And I think that, yeah, it's going to be this.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:28.120]   We're just in the very, very early curve.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.040]   For those of us who've been doing video for a long time
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.840]   for the web, it seems like we're at the end of it.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.800]   But this is the beginning.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.200]   I mean, and when you see all of this ubiquity going across
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.480]   all the iPod lines, next year is going to be a big year for video.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.840]   >> Big year for Starbucks, too.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.520]   It seems like Starbucks is a big winner in this.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.240]   >> And that, no.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.280]   Now Starbucks is the new record store for the digital age.
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.240]   >> For yuppies, anyway.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.280]   >> For people who want to go somewhere and buy music,
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.480]   they can get online at any Starbucks eventually,
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.160]   any Starbucks for free.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.480]   And if you hear something that's playing in the Starbucks,
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.080]   you just press the button that pops up on your iPod touch
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.480]   that says this is what's playing now, buy it.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.680]   >> I just saw a full circle thing.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.720]   I just saw what we didn't mention earlier.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:11.800]   But because this new iPod Touch has the YouTube application
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.120]   and iMovie08 pushes to YouTube,
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.320]   we now have a full circle publishing system for the beginner.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.000]   >> Very good point.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.240]   Yeah, I mean, it's a very natural connection.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:25.640]   >> And as we look at what NBC Bonehead had last week,
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.240]   with this whole, we're going to take--
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.440]   >> Well, no, they are on Amazon now.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.120]   That's going to be such a great platform.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.640]   >> Yeah, right.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.280]   Yeah, so when you look at that, the--
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.400]   >> Unbox for the undead.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.640]   [laughter]
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.120]   >> But the--
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.080]   >> The brains.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:39.800]   >> When we look at--
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.760]   >> The brains.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.920]   >> When we look at the media machine
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.760]   trying to figure out how they're going to knock Apple down.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.160]   They're trying to figure out ways to get to lock--
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.040]   the problem is that Apple is slowly building a vertical market.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.560]   They're building a point where they--
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.040]   the publishers, whether they're using Final Cut or iMovie
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.200]   or anything else, all the way to distribution.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.040]   I mean, this is a vertical market
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.280]   that makes Croupp's arms look like a walk in the park.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.280]   I mean, you know, they have the whole process.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.320]   >> It's integration.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.360]   >> And if Apple got pushed too hard,
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.040]   they would just simply open that pipe.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:12.600]   >> Right.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.360]   >> And it would be over.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.560]   I mean, for a lot of these big--
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.600]   >> Well, they've been slowly Python-like squeezing out
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.480]   everybody else.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.640]   Now they've got-- as you said, it's full circle.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.720]   They've got every piece of the pie.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.040]   And this Starbucks thing is a really good example, you know?
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.000]   I mean, Starbucks has done very well as a music retailer
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.640]   by just having four or five CDs.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.600]   They know their market.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.680]   >> Well, if someone's willing to pay $3.50 for a coffee,
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.600]   they'll probably pay 99 cents for a song.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.040]   >> Like for a song, big deal, you know?
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.400]   >> But I'm just going to say it's every piece of the pie
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.360]   and a cappuccino.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:42.840]   >> Right.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.640]   >> Right.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.920]   So I mean, I do like this,
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.000]   and I think this is a really innovative way
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.440]   to think about music retailing.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.680]   I mean, to say, well, it's a destination.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.800]   They're already there.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.320]   It shows up on their iPod.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.760]   You're listening to this song.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.080]   Press one button and you own it.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.200]   I think that's pretty clever.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.880]   And, you know, did you see the stats?
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.760]   I mean, 18 times a month, the average Starbucks customer
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.720]   goes into the Starbucks.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.600]   18 times a month.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.840]   >> Steve Gibson makes up at least 17, although that's true.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.720]   >> Oh, that's true.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.560]   How many quinty ventilates can you drink?
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.160]   >> The question is, is when does this expand?
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.480]   I'm at a concert and I can download the song.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.960]   So I'm at a-- you know, there's all kinds of--
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.480]   >> Oh, you're right.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.680]   >> You know, this is just the tip of the iceberg of this.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.400]   I can buy stuff.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.880]   And this is what Google wants to go towards, which is--
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.920]   >> Apple's got it, though.
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.480]   They're here.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.000]   They've got it already.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.920]   It's just a button push away.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.880]   I mean, those 99 cents start to add up, don't they?
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:35.640]   And if you're a record label, now you want to be in that.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.320]   Starbucks, you want to be on that list.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.200]   You want to be there.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.000]   That's the place to be.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:39.880]   Forget CDs.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.960]   >> I'm not going to forget CDs.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.080]   >> Forget CDs.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.080]   >> No, yeah, forget CDs.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.040]   Final, final.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.080]   >> No.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.680]   >> He's going the wrong direction.
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.760]   >> That's because Sean doesn't have a nine-month-old at home.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.160]   You'll quickly forget CDs and vinyl real quick.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.160]   >> Digital is clearly the way to go.
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.600]   And I actually pooped.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.680]   Somebody asked me last week, you think they'll put Wi-Fi in.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.720]   I said, no, that's crazy.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.080]   You kill the battery life.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.520]   What's the market?
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.840]   You know, I mean, if you're Zoom right now,
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.600]   you've got to think, what the hell?
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.320]   We missed them.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.320]   I mean, they've got to be going, this is--
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.280]   what are we thinking?
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.040]   >> They dropped their price today by $100.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.400]   >> They're $199.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.200]   >> And it's not going to make any--
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.280]   >> And you still can't buy a song using Wi-Fi.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.960]   >> Well, $197 more than I'm willing to pay.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.840]   >> But I can squirt.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.640]   I can squirt.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.840]   I can squirt.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.000]   >> If you can find someone to squirt too.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.320]   >> I did see a rumor that they were talking about actually
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.000]   having some sort of app that comes in later
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.520]   that actually works like squirting with these eye touch pod.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.040]   >> So you could go iPod to iPod.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.240]   Interesting.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.280]   >> Circle click.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.720]   >> Circle click.
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.880]   >> No, I don't think they call it that.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.840]   I-- if they do, Steve Ballmer thought that up.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.440]   >> You must not circle.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.960]   >> No, but once again, Microsoft Day Late Dollar Short.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.920]   They even had the hardware and they couldn't pull the trigger.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.440]   It's amazing.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.200]   Once again, I think Apple shows themselves
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.960]   to really be the masters of marketing.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.320]   >> And now you can get ringtones.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.640]   >> Yeah, I'm not so excited about that.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.120]   99 cents and you still have to buy this.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.080]   I don't understand how that works.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:01.960]   Do you have to buy the song?
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.080]   Is it $2 really?
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.360]   >> You have to buy the song.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.320]   And only some songs are going to be marked in the iTunes store
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.280]   to say these are qualified to be able to download a ringtone as well.
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.600]   >> So I can't get the ringtone by also by the song.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.000]   >> And it's also-- it tells us to be one of the songs
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.520]   that's marked as ringtoneable.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.040]   >> This is not going anywhere.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:22.920]   >> Or-- you know, I can go download iToner from Ambrosia Software.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:26.440]   I can-- you know, I can get any song that I want.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.320]   I can cut it in GarageBand and I can simply load it right on.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.240]   >> You know when I realized this is for the kids.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.600]   Who buys ringtones?
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.720]   It's kids.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.680]   They're impulsive.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.960]   They're daddy pays for it.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.400]   I know, because I'm paying for it.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.240]   >> To the kids by iPhones.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.240]   >> Well, my kids will.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.440]   They won't buy this generation.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.240]   But I think you're going to see these phones in the hands of kids pretty quick.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:45.880]   >> Just wait three months.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.160]   They'll be 99 bucks.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:47.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.640]   And then-- and you're trying to get on my-- you're trying to--
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.200]   I have a steak knife and I'm not afraid to use it.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.480]   >> Back.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.280]   >> No, I mean, frankly, that's the market for--
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.000]   and it's a-- what, it's a $3 billion market, the ringtone market.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.040]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.520]   Everybody-- you know, almost every phone you can make your own ringtones.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.240]   Nobody does.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.240]   >> Well, I accept you, Alex.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.720]   >> Well, here's the thing is that when--
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.320]   when people would give me the description of how they were putting ringtones on their phone,
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.360]   I was like, "You're insane."
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:18.200]   I mean, they have to send it to a website that then sends them a picture message.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:18.760]   >> Oh, that's crazy.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.240]   >> And so the thing is, is that I had no interest in that.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.600]   And it was until I was, you know,
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.760]   got into test this little piece of software where--
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.320]   >> But this became a $3 billion market.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.120]   >> It did because--
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:28.680]   >> Because people were--
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.880]   >> Because it was too much of a pain.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.960]   But now I have an app that all I have to do is drag a song onto and hit sync.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.320]   And I'm adding songs all the time.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.920]   Like, when I'm sitting on the plane, I go,
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.200]   "What kind of ringtones am I going to make?"
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.400]   >> I agree with you. I think that application for some market will be good.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.400]   But I think Apple probably will make money on the ringtones.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.920]   >> And it won't even make a dent.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.200]   That application, a lot of people will be very happy.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.760]   And it won't even make a dent in the bottom line because you're right.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.160]   People are going to go, "You know, I just want to ringtone."
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:53.800]   >> It's in.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.800]   You know, and that'll pay for it.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.760]   So big deal.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.520]   >> You know, like my kid buys--
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.200]   you know, on Verizon, you buy a ringtone.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.000]   It's only good for--
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.680]   about 50. It's good for three months.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.720]   Then you have to buy it again.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.440]   So, you know, this is actually a deal.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.840]   >> But I mean, the wrong business, exactly.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.320]   >> Exactly.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.240]   >> But I think that the iPhone is the end of a lot of those business models.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.360]   I mean, because the thing is, is that because we can hack it,
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.080]   because we can add so much to it, because there's a real OS on it,
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.600]   there's-- you can't control it.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.280]   We've already seen all these apps come out.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.800]   You can't control it the way the phone companies have controlled these phones up until now.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.880]   And they just-- these business models aren't going to continue at the same level that they did before,
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.280]   where they get hobble us for three months here and there.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.240]   People aren't going to put up with it.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.600]   >> No, I don't think so.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.480]   >> Well, especially if the Gphone actually materializes,
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:41.960]   you know, there's going to be so much competition from having real OSs in these phones that are
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.200]   real open and really plug into.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.120]   >> And real companies who get it.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.640]   >> You know, they're not monopolists.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.960]   >> When you look at Apple and Google, they get it.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.800]   You know, they get the idea to something--
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:56.200]   you know, that-- and they're going to untie a lot of these pieces
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.800]   that have really kept us all wound up.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.240]   >> They are coming at it from opposite directions,
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.920]   which is sort of interesting, but they're meeting in the middle,
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.200]   which is really interesting too.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.680]   >> And clearly there's an Apple Google synergy.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.280]   I mean, that's-- there's no doubt.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.920]   You know, look at you putting YouTube on an iPod.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.000]   I mean, Google's got to love this, right?
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.560]   >> I'm loving it.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.000]   I mean, I have to admit, I now find myself, you know, I'll be sitting at the airport.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.120]   >> Chocolate rain!
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.080]   >> No!
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.280]   >> No!
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.080]   >> No!
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.520]   >> Oh!
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.960]   >> Everywhere!
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:24.920]   Everywhere!
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.800]   >> All my wife plays now.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.920]   >> Oh, good.
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.800]   Oh, yeah, that's good.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.760]   That's wonderful.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.760]   >> Tays on days very happy.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.160]   Well, it sounds like it's going to be a good Christmas for Apple.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.440]   They came up with some good products.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.960]   They have a very complete line now, as you point out, at every price point.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.520]   They've got an iPhone, but also an iPod Touch,
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.040]   which everybody's going to want.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.200]   I think the iPhone publicity will really help that,
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.120]   and suddenly it's at $250.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.520]   Well, yeah, maybe I will get one, you know?
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.360]   I think this is a good move all around.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.480]   Any mistakes Apple made?
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.440]   Anything they did wrong?
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.480]   >> Ringtones.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.040]   >> Ringtones.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.600]   Maybe getting the Beatles on stage would have been nice,
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.000]   but who's this TJ Salt install?
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:01.880]   What the hell?
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.360]   >> Punstall?
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.000]   >> Katie Dunst.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.600]   >> Kate Tell- Who's she?
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.520]   >> She's some British American artist.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:07.800]   Doesn't quite go together.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.680]   >> No.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.440]   And then Steve says she's hot.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.560]   >> Yeah, I guess.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.520]   >> I don't know.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.000]   I don't think Steve should be saying that kind of thing on stage.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.800]   He might have had a good day, but he's not going to have a great night.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.240]   And on that note, we want to thank you for joining us.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.560]   It's a quick one, but we just wanted to get something out to let you know,
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.640]   and I really want to thank everybody here,
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.400]   especially Frank who bought the steak.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.200]   >> Franklin Harris.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.640]   >> One steak amongst all of us here.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.480]   >> Digitalunderpants.tv.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.760]   >> Yeah, well, it was a good steak though.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.240]   >> Yeah, it was.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.680]   And just to know that the price of the dinner could have bought you,
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.400]   an iPhone and a half.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.760]   [LAUGH]
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.800]   >> That's what I thought.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.280]   >> Cost.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.200]   >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.800]   Digitalunderground.tv.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.960]   I'm going to say it a few more times just for that.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.320]   Anything else you want to plug?
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.600]   Who's your sponsor?
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:54.360]   >> Well, we just started working on a completely new kind of hacking,
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.480]   blogging site.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.080]   The demand for all the stuff we've been doing on Digitalunderground has been so great that
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:03.240]   we can't produce the videos fast enough, so we've kind of got a site called Technocrat.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:07.080]   TCH.NOCR.AT.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.320]   Once again, TCH.NORC.AT.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.600]   >> And Randall knows it and likes it.
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.200]   >> Yeah, I've gone a couple times.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.400]   >> That's cool, all right.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.160]   >> Yeah, we've got, if you think, General Motors and Vonage and
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.920]   ING Bank.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.520]   >> I'm doing something wrong here.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.320]   Alex Lindsey at the Pixel Core, Pixel Core.tv.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:31.960]   >> And also the guys over at Kenji and John and Ben over at Macbreak Tech are going to be doing a
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.960]   live Q&A on Monday.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.320]   >> So how are they doing live?
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.280]   >> You know, they've got their own thing.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.840]   They've got their own thing that they figured out, so it's MacbreakTech.com.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.120]   Go up there and check it out.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.840]   And it should be a lot of fun.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:45.560]   It's an experiment.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.360]   >> That's a great idea.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.720]   I think that'll do very well.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.480]   LabRats.tv?
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.840]   >> Yes, and if Fandy Walker was here, he'd be probably bringing us all down.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.280]   I think, I think he'd be stupid.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.000]   I hate everything.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:55.960]   >> By the June.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.160]   >> By the June.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.000]   >> The June can squirt.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.520]   >> Yeah, the June can squirt.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.640]   At the beginning, he's got to.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.520]   >> And the June.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.320]   >> Bet he's not here.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.400]   >> Thank you, Shankar others, for being here.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.520]   Randall Schwartz is Merlin at Stonehenge.com.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:12.120]   And of course, the chief host at Geek Cruises News is you've got a cruise coming up.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.720]   Something, what do you, you have seen a lot of you.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.240]   Are you not doing those cruises anymore?
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.000]   >> We had a six-month lull.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   >> I was going to say, because usually you're on a boat.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.040]   >> But of course, you're missing the other thing that you and I do together, Floss Weekly.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:22.840]   >> Oh, I forgot.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:27.080]   Yeah, now brand new host of Floss Weekly just put out a show on Git and we've got more coming.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.120]   >> We've got two so far.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.240]   We've got a couple more in the wings.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.880]   I'm waiting to get those perfectly lined up before we get a talk a little bit.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.760]   >> I totally forgot about that.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.120]   >> Should really promote my own podcast once in a while.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.120]   >> That's the problem, yeah.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.720]   >> In fact, somebody suggested that they wanted to actually take Floss Weekly and make it their ringtone.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:41.960]   So.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:46.440]   >> You know, that's a good, that song that Floss Weekly theme was done by a very talented
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:52.280]   guy, the guy behind Lullibot, Jeff Robbins, who was with a group called Orbit,
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.040]   which I'm sure Shankar others remembers, because he knows all of this music trivia.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:56.840]   They had a couple of hits.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.840]   >> Yeah, maybe for Orbit, does that ring a bell?
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:31:59.400]   >> Maybe, yes.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.560]   >> Or, orbital or orbit.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.080]   >> I don't know.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.760]   >> I know orbital.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:05.720]   >> Maybe it's orbital.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.280]   >> Oh, yeah, I know.
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.160]   >> It's probably orbital.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.040]   >> There was orbit as well.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.080]   There were a lot of orb bands.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.480]   >> Mm, there was the problem right there.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.360]   And I don't think his name is Jeff Robbins either, but I'll fix that in post.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.160]   So we- >> So we want to-
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.040]   >> No, we won't.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.240]   >> No, we won't.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.520]   I just like saying that.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.480]   There's no post.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.760]   Oh, there are posts when I'm dead.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:28.440]   >> Can you fix the price that you paid for that iPhone original post?
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.240]   >> I'm bringing it.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.080]   There's a restocking fee, but I'm taking it back.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.800]   Ladies and gentlemen, another back break is broke!
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:43.800]   [MUSIC]
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:53.800]   [MUSIC]
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.380]   (upbeat music)
