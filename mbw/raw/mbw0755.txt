[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Andy Inako, Renee Ritchie, Alex Lindsey.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.960]   They're all here we're going to talk about. Microsoft's AR announcements and what that means
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.280]   for Apple. Ming-Chi Quo's latest rumors on the iPhone 13. All the Apple stores are open in the
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.400]   US for the first time in a year. And the iMac processor that's in the Perseverance rover. It's
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:32.800]   all coming up next. The Mac Break Weekly. This is Detroit.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:44.160]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 755. Recorded Tuesday, March 2nd, 2021.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.480]   Put the fun in fungible. It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we come with the latest news
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.360]   from Apple with Renee Ritchie from youtube.com/ReneeRitchie. YouTube's Renee Ritchie. Hi Renee.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.400]   Hi Leo. I'm recovering today Leo. What's the matter? Yesterday a bunch of YouTubers very kindly
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.160]   roasted me on Clubhouse with Arques and Thomas Frank and Devin, Dr. Mike and a bunch of others
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.160]   and they just went through my entire channel and dragged me across the earth. Oh god I don't
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.280]   want to do that. That sounds awful. My brain is well it was incredibly helpful because you never
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.160]   know what you don't know and they have so much expertise and so much collective wisdom and experience
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.200]   but my brain had to absorb a lot and they are so because you don't hear them talk shop much.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.320]   You hear them mostly talk about product but they are legit geniuses about all this how all this
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.400]   stuff works. So it was a valuable notes session but it was conducted in public which is humiliating.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.240]   It was it was fine and they were all very good but like like you don't hear Marquez talk about
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.600]   like his strategy very often or like Dr. Mike or Devin and it was just fascinating to hear
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.680]   and also sometimes they have the same struggles. So it makes you feel like like yeah I'm struggling
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.320]   to like do I teleprompter bullet point do I go completely add and they're like yeah we went through
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.560]   Clubhouse I have such mixed feelings both pro and con on Clubhouse. There's some good stuff. There's
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.640]   some useful stuff is just a mystery. That's Andy and I go chortling in the background.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.880]   Chortle is the word I think we'll use for your laugh. It's a chortle. I'll try to be supportive and
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.680]   being out loud being outspoken about my appreciation for the wit wisdom and etc.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.800]   Oh my god. Chortle sounds like a Pokemon character doesn't it?
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.080]   Or nay. Did you get a chortle? I got a yeah mega turtle. And a war chortle.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:38.160]   And he's from many places. Currently WGBH in Boston. It's great to have you.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:46.320]   I think we now have three people who live in your vicinity. As you know Patrick
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:55.040]   Tela Handy our coder lives near near you. And I understand Lou Marresca from this week in Enterprise
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.520]   Tech is moving to your name. He's looking the house down the road. So I hope you guys I just
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.480]   imagine you guys at a diner some morning trading war stories. I just think it'd be great.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.720]   Well, once we will pull together to get like fiber at one of the best diners locally.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.120]   There you go. Just basically three booths set up for each one. That's a show. Yeah.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.160]   My dinner was Andy. It's a deductible waffles. I'm all for it. Tax to die. Hey, and also with
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.480]   this Alex Lindsey wearing his fisherman sweater today. It must be chilly in Marin County Alex with
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.400]   090 dot media. Hello Alex. It was chilly when I got up. You get up at like four in the morning
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.320]   to do your office hours. You're insane.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.720]   Four in the morning is kind of you know middle of the morning. But I got up early for me 7am because
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.720]   Microsoft had a we thought it was going to be an important keynote at Ignite.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.760]   Satya Nadella. Well, you know, we see a lot of him the CEO and I wasn't coming for that. I wasn't
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.760]   going to get up early for that. But then Alex Kippman who's in charge of their HoloLens. He
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.720]   invented actually he's kind of an inventor. Time magazine's top 25 nerds of 2010. He
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:12.800]   was seriously he invented Connect. He invented HoloLens. Yeah. And so we thought it would be
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.160]   really interesting. I wish we had that clip. You don't have that on the instant replay button.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.520]   Do you still John? Because it was a very weird event.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.560]   They were talking they really isn't a new HoloLens, which is the Microsoft
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.920]   headset. They call it mixed reality. It's really an augmented reality
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.240]   headset. But the weirdest thing was the way they ended with Gila LibertÃ© of
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:49.440]   Cirque de Soleil. Let me see if I can find a little more. He's gotten the weird in his life.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.440]   Let me see if I can. Oh, oh, this is weird. This is just the green. So this confirms what I thought,
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.680]   which was that the whole thing was shot ahead of time on green screen, not in HoloLens at all.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:09.600]   I've been working with artists and building community. This is bizarre. Okay. That confirms
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:17.520]   what I thought. That's not what I wanted. Here is the I want to show he has a new thing called
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:29.600]   Han. Is it Han Tai? VR. It's a new. Yeah. No, not hand tie. See, I keep getting the wrong result.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.160]   There seems to be a lot of octopuses in that one. I don't want that one. Here it is. Hanai.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:41.280]   Hanai world. And oh, that's good. This is in typewriter face. This is not even a career.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.920]   Not what I want. All right. Well, anyway, I wanted to show it because it was so bizarre.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.080]   You can watch it on our Twitter. I just saw it because we're on Instagramming that it was starting.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.920]   And so I was going to watch this for Christina, but then it was Satya so I didn't. Yeah, Satya's,
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.240]   Satya's a great CEO. There's no, I mean, he's taken Microsoft to the moon. Fantastic.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:07.280]   But as a public speaker, he veers into corporate mumbo jumbo. And it feels like there's no
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.280]   content, content free. I mean, there is. They announced what they call Microsoft mesh, which is
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.400]   a mashup of all the Microsoft products. I want space. It doesn't sound like anything.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.320]   Man, if somebody can ask you a word, if somebody in the chat room could find a link
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.920]   to the Cirque du Soleil virtual reality world that they showed, it was very strange because
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.960]   they have this whole thing. James Cameron of Avatar fame. The director was there talking about how
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.480]   he uses HoloLens for his deep sea exploration. There was some oceanographers there from OceanX.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.760]   So, you know, they showed videos of people using it for surgery and using it for
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:50.720]   industrial instruction and stuff. But they end with this, with this. And this is what
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.280]   Gee is going to do. The next Cirque du Soleil. And it's like a virtual burning man,
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.560]   except that there are a lot of people standing around with no legs and no arms. So the only
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:06.480]   dancing they can do is this. It's very strange. So it's Cirque du Soleil. It's Cirque du Soleil,
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:12.640]   but it's cartoon Cirque du Soleil. Cirque du Oive is that what we're pointing at? Anyway,
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:19.600]   oh, you found it. Okay. Okay. Set on a backdrop of global transformation. So there's Gee. I don't
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.240]   know if we can. There we go. We've also seen unprecedented innovation. Is it animated?
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.600]   Really? It's just still? Oh, there we go. So this is, so they did this whole thing.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:37.680]   Thank you, John. Notice he's using edge. They did this whole thing. And then they just stopped.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.200]   There was no more. There was no goodbye or anything. They just took us to this beach.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:49.600]   When they're a bunch of people, some have legs, some have no legs. I don't understand.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.920]   Which makes it good to know that the second life community never disbanded.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.960]   I think what really is going on is those four people with legs are green screened.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.400]   Yeah. The other people are in all space art space VR, which is Microsoft's VR thing,
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.840]   and they have no arms and legs. And then there's animated dancers, cartoon dancers in the background,
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.440]   they have arms and legs. So it's it is mixed reality in the sense that this is never going
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:22.800]   to happen in all space VR because. Oh, why? The limbs are in app purchases. Yeah. You need to
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:28.080]   buy tokens. This is exactly as weird as I thought it was when I saw it this morning.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:36.400]   Yeah. See, I don't get this. This is this is to me like I enjoy like new vaudeville. I enjoy people
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.760]   like, Hey, look, we're we're juggling stores. We're breathing fire. We're doing acrobatics.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:48.720]   Why do you have to wrap it in this like pastry shell of no, no, here is Oofeld and he's looking
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.680]   very clean because they're from Montreal. And it's a cherry. It's like, no, no, you can't play
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.960]   Montreal. I love Cirque du Soleil. I agree with you, Andy. I understand it is
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.920]   it is circus wrapped in this weird new age veneer. I love Cirque du Soleil, but this is the new age
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:09.600]   veneer minus the circus. So it's even less forgot the circus just the solids. I forgot the circus
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.320]   parts just the solids. And by the way, I understand Gee's interest in this Cirque du Soleil went
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:20.320]   bankrupt in November because you can't have live shows. So they're probably looking for something,
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.320]   you know, you could do virtually. I just think the timing is bad on this because
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.040]   we're all going to get out of COVID in a few months. And the last thing we want to do is sit with
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.960]   headsets in our living room. We want to go out. Who has these headsets? Like, is this a Microsoft
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.560]   thing? Because HoloLens, it's three. Microsoft doesn't have a lot of commercial headsets. Actually,
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.520]   I think they said you could do this with Quest and Vive as well. Okay, good. And the and the
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.280]   and the and the Holo lenses are actually been pretty successful in the industry. You know,
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.360]   industrial industrial solutions. They've been very successful, probably the most successful
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.920]   headsets when it comes to stuff like AEC and other things like that, where you're able to
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.880]   utilize. That's how it ended. It was like, where did Alex go? He's standing on somebody's shoulder.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.440]   So I actually it's appropriate to play this because of course, Apple's watching this going.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.640]   Okay, guys, this is what we're not going to do. Yeah. Not this not this not this not this.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:21.360]   Okay, this is what not to do. I think Microsoft's real interest is a purely corporate that, you
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.760]   know, that we're going to have, you know, conferences, some people will be in real life and other people
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:32.720]   will be 3D hologram projections. But you have to wear the HoloLens to do. You got to sell these
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.520]   things to people who are buying them. And right now, it's not consumers. It is people who can make
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.000]   thousands of dollars for every implementation of it you create. And that's, you know, training.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.480]   That is VR. And I've been in the testing phase of a lot of different headsets where we're
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.600]   generating revenue that people are generating content for people to watch in their heads.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.680]   So they come to you to say, Alex, make some demos so that people will get excited about this.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.080]   No, we did the whole shows. Like we did, we did the first. So I think the first one, the first
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:11.680]   4K, it was 4K per eye multi camera live stream for connect 4, I think connect 3 or connect 4.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:17.040]   Oh, I'm sure. We did. And so that was that was like 3 or 4 Ozos. And that was 4K per eye.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:24.240]   And we put them right up on the stage and everything else. And it's good. I mean,
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:29.280]   it's interesting for a while, but it's not something that even at that resolution that we
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.920]   were that excited about. And I think the problem is, is that's the issue. Do you really want to
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:40.880]   watch this for that long? And does it really give you that experience? And what we're finding is that
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:47.040]   a lot of what's more engaging is the stuff that I do every morning where you just talk to people.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:52.800]   Like turns out, actually talking to people having an authentic conversation that's well managed
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.160]   is way better than the avatar. You don't have to wear a visor to do it.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:02.000]   Well, an advertisement that stuff will get here and so will 360 and all those other things. But
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.200]   the resolutions aren't both the geometry and the video aren't high enough yet to do it for a long
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.680]   period of time where what people really are engaged with is actually what they really want is just
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.560]   human contact to talk to each other and try ideas. Especially now. I mean, as soon as you can,
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.440]   as soon as we can emerge from our quarantines, I think the last thing anybody's want to do is
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:27.120]   have a virtual. Can we? Will the world stop ending Leo? Someday. Someday. We're really
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:32.960]   we're really debating that. Like the podcast conference, which is called podcast movement for
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.160]   reasons I don't understand, is coming up in August. And at first it was going to be virtual. And now
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:45.760]   they're saying, Oh yeah, we can do it in person. And we're going, I don't know. Should we go? I don't
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:51.920]   know. I mean, the the the the hard part is is that it's are you going to have enough people that want
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.320]   to do it that way? And also have we moved to some other point? You know, there's a lot of people that
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:01.760]   are not as interested. One of the things that I think we talked about the other day on the last
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.280]   week was just that once people move away from airports, when they move away from the city centers
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.120]   that had airports with direct flights, yeah, they're like, Do we have to do that? Right.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.000]   Like, because I'm getting pretty used to the zoom meetings and I think there'll be a lot less
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.280]   business travel for sure. But I think for social and personal things, people are going to want to
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.360]   get together, right? They're going to go to concerts and movies and parties and all that.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.600]   When they can, I think that one of the things that I mean, again, like the the morning session
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.840]   that I do, we have people on five different continents talking every morning. So yeah,
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.960]   so there's not really any way for us to get together other than there's literally no way for
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.920]   us to do this in the real world. And so so I think that that's going to be the kind of thing that you
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:45.360]   see a fair bit of is that our communities have actually gotten much more global as a result of
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.160]   what's happened is because we're online. It doesn't really matter where people are. And so
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.960]   your friendships and a lot of other things have expanded. And so it just you're definitely,
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.840]   I'm definitely going to have people over to my house and go over to the people's houses and have
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:02.240]   dinner. I can't wait for that. But I think that we're we're turning a corner in like what we see
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.280]   as as our community beyond just the people in our town or in our state and really just globally.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:14.240]   It's yeah, it's hard to predict what's going to happen a year from now, assuming that we conquer
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:20.160]   COVID-19 and people feel like it's safe to emerge. I mean, the big thing is that the ROI, the
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:27.600]   four events online is getting is starting to crest to be higher than the ROI for physical events. And
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.320]   so the, you know, like there was a point where we were shooting stage plays, you know, with with
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:37.520]   cameras, these crazy things that it put things on celluloid. And but the stage plays were the big
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.440]   thing, right? I mean, the plays and the musicals were the big thing. And you had these little goofy
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.280]   little cameras that they would shoot. But there was some point where the camera, the cameras had
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.520]   a bigger business. The stage and you invented a new way and you invented a new way, a form of
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:54.960]   expression to you, right, stop shooting a proscenium stage. And you started going right in with the
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.920]   camera and, you know, location shooting and all that. Plays are still amazing. And musicals are
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.680]   still amazing. And operas are still amazing. And people still go to it. So it's not that it goes
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:09.120]   away. It's just that, but something else got a lot bigger because it scales. You know, it just,
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:14.640]   it doesn't, it doesn't require physical apparatus to get bigger. You know, and that's where, you know,
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.400]   to, you know, and that's where it's always that's always going to win in the end.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:28.240]   It's interesting because, who did I see? Oh, I'm going to somebody said this and it got in my
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:34.640]   head. Now I've forgotten the source of it. But his or her point was we've already created virtual
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:40.080]   reality experiences. What is a virtual reality experience? It's a, it's a experience that you
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.520]   have that is viscerally emotions. You're, you know, your brain starts working, but you're not really
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:53.360]   there. That's a movie. And that that's really all a movie is designed to do brings music and images
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:16:00.000]   together and dialogue together in such a way that it stimulates in you love or sadness or horror
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.120]   or excitement. And those are all think about it. They're virtual experiences. You're staring at a
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.160]   screen with flickering images on it. But we've gotten very good at doing that. So we already
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.080]   have virtual reality. You're crying. You're crying.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:18.640]   Nope. I like that too. A lot of people playing Call of Duty. You're playing, you know, Fortnite
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:24.320]   are totally immersed. Yeah. Yeah. There haven't games yet have not quite yet reached the
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:30.240]   refinement and emotional variety that movies have. Movies are the best at this point.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.320]   We're getting there like last of us, I think. Yeah. They're getting there. But there's still,
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.760]   if you really notice, there's a kind of a gulf between a game and a movie. And I think the,
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:45.120]   if you put it on a scale of one to 10, if the movies are at 10 and VR is at seven,
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:50.960]   I mean, gaming is at seven VR is like two at this point, right? Am I wrong?
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.840]   No. Well, they announced that VR drone today. I don't know if you saw it, but all the videos
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:02.080]   went up for DJI's new first person drone where you put on the VR helmet and you pilot the drone.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.880]   Just Dean had one. Peter McKinnon had one. My son does this. It's called FPV.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:14.240]   And the problem with it is, by the way, DJI has made an FPV headset for a long time. He has it.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:21.040]   The problem with it is it's disorienting is, because you're on the drone. But what you can do
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:26.880]   is amazing. If you go to YouTube and look up FPV drone videos, it's amazing because it's fast
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:34.000]   and you're right there. And frankly, for me, I prefer that experience. Third person. I don't
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.640]   want to actually be on the drone. But Henry said he's got to do a simulator. He's been doing a
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.120]   simulator for months before he actually takes a drone out because it's damn hard to fly these
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:47.280]   things. Yeah. I have so much respect for Superman now, Leo. I never realized what he had to.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:50.800]   At least at my speed. You better have full nerves of steel.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.440]   That's why technology is one half of the problem, but developing the storytelling tools
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:00.000]   that we're capturing is going to be another. That's exactly right. To your point earlier on,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.320]   one of the most famous shots in movie history was from Rosemary's Baby, where the central
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.400]   character knows that something fishy is going on, kind of suspects doesn't know what's going on.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.120]   And so one of the antagonists is like often another room making a phone call. And the director
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.000]   placed it so that the door is sort of half open and so that you can sort of see that other character
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.080]   dialing the phone, but not quite. And invariably he reports that he had the effect that he wanted
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.560]   because he going to the theater, you see every as soon as that scene happens, everybody in the
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.360]   theater just like leans over a little bit as though they're trying to like see behind the door.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:41.840]   And that's the sort of stuff that virtual reality and gaming has to really take take light of where
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:47.840]   you are so you are so involved in this thing that you forget that there is actually any sort of a
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:52.720]   technological or optical interface between you and what's going on in front of you. And a lot of
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:57.520]   that is just going to simply be where do you put the camera? Do you go on tight here? Do you go
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.160]   why? Do you let the audience look where they want to look or do you force you guide them to look
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:11.760]   someplace specifically? So that's where I think with virtual reality, we're now in the era of
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:17.520]   the train pulling into the station. And that's the big that's the big movie. And we have to wait
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:25.040]   for people to figure out how to do a citizen came. And by the way, we've done such a good job with
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:30.640]   movies convincing us we're watching something real. We forget it's just we're sitting in a room with
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:35.840]   a screen and light and sound projected to make us feel like we're an immersive thing so that we
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:43.120]   peek around the door. It's already perfected without wearing a helmet. It's done. But it's going to
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:48.720]   be a long time before we get the art of that state. But I don't know if we need to do something long,
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:54.560]   you know, in a long format either like this this idea of two and a half hours we've decided somehow
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:20:01.200]   that's important. I find that we watch more regular shows now or we cut the movies up because we just
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:07.200]   don't have enough time to watch them all at one time, except for the weekends. And so I don't know
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:14.800]   if if the movie format will eventually survive, you know, it'll survive as a as a as a format. But
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.000]   I think that the vast majority of things are going to move to series for instance. And then
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   when you think about a series, wouldn't it be great, especially when more and more is a CG. So you
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.080]   think about Mandalorian, wouldn't it be great for you to sit on the set and watch a scene,
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:35.520]   you know, or take a Pixar film and just watch the scene is it. But this just that scene. You
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:40.080]   watch the whole thing the way you want to watch it. Yeah, but that's not the problem and either or.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:45.200]   Well, it's there. There's a lot of big problems that have to be solved. Like,
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.640]   if you're just if you're standing there and in the environment and you can walk around and look
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:56.000]   where you want to look, how do you see that? Hey, look, I need to indicate the story. I don't indicate
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.520]   that he's picking up something that is very, very important. But maybe you got so fascinated
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.480]   with, Oh, well, what does this touch panel do that? There's so much going on that manipulates
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.760]   how you're looking at what communicates what's important that you have to have control of the
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:18.480]   situation. That's that's assuming that that the story is linear. So imagine, you know, you you
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:23.200]   have a scene that is two minutes long that a whole bunch of things happen right at the very end.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.160]   And you might have to watch that scene a couple times to figure out what happened.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.840]   And so the idea is, is that you're watching it over and over again, or you're experiencing
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:35.680]   over and over again, and you're examining yourself where time, a linear time line is not what is
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:41.120]   important, you know, and and it is an exploration of that space as opposed to, you know, getting on
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:46.960]   a train, you're just in it. And so for instance, as again, as a as an add on as a value add to a
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.840]   movie, let's say you watch the next born identity or whatever it is, you don't want to watch the
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.800]   whole thing that way. But what if you were able to go back as the movie extras and be in a scene
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.600]   and just watch it as if you were there, you know, for that one moment, that's valuable right now.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.880]   I don't know again, I don't know if you need to tell stories in the in virtual in the virtual world
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:12.880]   as much as you need to give people places to explore. It's a it's a new thing. It is a new thing.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:18.800]   And I do I do like the idea of going back and being able to look at things in a different way and
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:25.280]   revisit other details. But you're sort of reminding me of what annoys me so much about Disney's
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:32.080]   method of storytelling, which is that when I when I maybe maybe this is because this is the way that
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.880]   my brain has been trained through reading books and through watching movies through throughout the
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:42.240]   20th century. But I really want to see a story with a beginning and a middle and an end, even if it's
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:47.040]   like the Harry Potter movies and Lord of the Rings movies, where every movie feels like one book
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.840]   in a series of books, I still want a story that has a beginning and a middle and an end. So what
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:57.760]   annoys me even when it says about a intellectual property that I love like Star Wars or the Marvel
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:03.360]   Superheroes, it annoys me that wait, wait a minute, why is everybody so what do they why do they hold
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:09.280]   so long on this weird object and then never mention it again? Or why did this one person have this one
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:13.520]   scene with this guy we've never seen before? And then he leaves again and says, Oh, no, you
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:18.160]   needed to see like the Agents of Shield season two because he's a character. Well, I didn't see
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:23.200]   the Agents of Shield. Why are you like confusing the story with something that I have to do research
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.880]   and have to go back and backtrack through other properties in order to see it? That's the sort of
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:33.520]   frustration that I imagine when I think about a pure virtual reality experience that's not like a
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:39.760]   free what I do enjoy the idea of open world exploration like in Red Dead Redemption 2 where
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.000]   there's just there are stories that you can sort of click into or abandon. But if you just want to
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.840]   wander around you, this looks like a kind of weird funky swamp. I want to just sort of ride my horse
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.280]   around there for a while. And then there are story elements you can sort of pick up there.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.480]   It's just a different form of storytelling that a lot of people are going to have to figure out
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:00.400]   how to adapt to if they're going to have a have a on the audience's part be open enough to figure
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:05.280]   out how to have a good time here. But also in the story tellers part realize that no,
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:11.120]   you are lazy. You are not doing your job. Your job is not to simply like put all these sets and
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.680]   costumes out there and have me figure out what story you're trying to tell with it. You have to
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.920]   tell a story. I'm supposed to be sitting here and letting you play a story out and for me.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.400]   Are you still heard about Secret Wars and Christ's Land figure of Sandy because I feel you.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:29.520]   I'm with you on it. Well, the worst was a terrible series to begin with.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:34.800]   So that's just not in the short term though in the short term. In the long term, we don't know
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:40.880]   what's going to happen. But in the short term using VR and AR to add richness to something that
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.400]   already exists. So you still have the story that you're talking about Andy. You still have the
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:51.360]   Infinity Wars or you still have. But wouldn't it be fun after you watch the story? I would love to
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:57.920]   go to the headquarters. I'd love to go to Tony Stark's lab and walk around a little bit.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.840]   I'm not interested in before the show and there's no story. I just want to walk around and explore
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.320]   or go to the Death Star and be able to walk around certain places just to kind of look at it and
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.560]   check it out as if it was a museum. So if you think about it as a museum of the film,
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:18.000]   that I get to go experience digitally or I go to a historical location. So I go to Gettysburg
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.800]   and I get to see what it was like during the battle while I'm standing there. When I take my
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:27.760]   goggles off from that, I'm going to have a different experience of the physical space from a one-minute
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:33.200]   experience in VR where I have suddenly have context of what actually happened in the dark sense.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.520]   You have a little roundhouse. That makes a lot more sense to be honest.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.600]   We've seen something like this that's really, really interesting. There was a book, a big
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:45.120]   paperback book that was released like concurrent with the Blues Brothers movie. I think it was called
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:54.000]   Blues Brothers dossier. And all it was was a letter size paperback book. So it's not like you're
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.280]   getting this box full of stuff. But every page was, there's no story in there. It's just here is all
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:07.040]   the paperwork associated with the story. So you get to here is here is the birth of Jake
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.720]   Blues is birth certificate. Here is Elwood Blues is birth certificate. Here's the here are their
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:16.560]   report cards at the orphanage. Here is like the arrest report for each member of the band. Here are
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:21.840]   the priors that they did. Here are like the receipts for things that the members of the band
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.640]   and actually paid for. And that is exactly what you're talking about.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.160]   Yeah, that's a limited audience. That's an enthusiast audience.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.800]   But that's what happened to DVD extras. I love DVD extras. I love the
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.320]   director's commentary. They're still there, but they're not because it's.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.160]   I watch all of them. It's yes. We do because we're film buffs.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.480]   I prefer them to the movies. I agree. But I think that that's a small minority.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.520]   If there's not extras, I won't buy them. I'll just.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.240]   I feel the same way. Like the only reason I buy movies is that I can have.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.760]   But we're an absolute minority.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.160]   Minority, but that's why they put them in there.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:54.960]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.640]   But that's why they put them in there. And again, it's not a matter of it replacing the
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.000]   revenue of the film. But if it makes a couple extra million dollars, you know, like if I can.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:02.800]   Yeah, it's incremental.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:07.200]   If you think of the Art of Star Wars book, if you look at the Art of Star Wars, what if I could
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:12.560]   take a pod racer and just pull it out in AR and look at it or even sit in it, you know, or.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.560]   It's not a non trivial amount of work though. It's not completely incremental.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.720]   In fact, one of the reasons DVD extras started to disappear is because the directors and actors,
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:25.840]   the last thing they wanted to do six months after the movies done is come back to the studio and
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.160]   talking and working on it. They work in separate shows. Yeah.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:34.320]   But like Disney Plus is putting them up as a separate series of shows that they're filming
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:38.400]   concurrently with the episodes being made. And then they get this whole extra viewing.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:45.360]   There is this growing fan thing going on that HBO discovered, I think, with Game of Thrones
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.560]   and started putting Easter eggs in just for them and stuff like that.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.240]   So maybe the watchman podcast, they made it themselves. Instead of letting a bunch of fans
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:58.880]   make it, they made their own podcast talking dead, you know, walking dead show. Clearly,
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:03.520]   people are starting to understand it may not be a giant audience, but it's big enough audience
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.560]   to monetize and to make it work. Oh God, is Apple going to make their own podcast?
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.720]   We can't let that happen. I think they are. I have bad news for you. We're at a luck.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.720]   They can't do back break. It's ours. It's ours, man. No, I'll sell it to them.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.320]   For the right price. It's a non-fungible token. That's what it is.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.800]   I mean, they have a couple billion in the social questions, don't they?
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.160]   It's trivial for them, not for us. Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:30.880]   So to bring it back to Apple, thank you, Renee.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:37.200]   What does Apple do with AR? I mean, we know, I think it's safe to say,
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:41.920]   not necessarily there will be a product, but that they are working hard on something
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:48.000]   that they hope to productize. It's an Apple Watch. It's just the next generation Apple Watch.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.280]   It takes the exact same thing. The clock that was in the town hall becomes the grandfather clock
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:57.760]   in your living room becomes the pocket watch becomes the wrist watch. This is the same thing.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:02.400]   The computer at IBM becomes the computer in your home becomes a computer in your pocket,
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.480]   becomes a computer on your wrist, and they all can do fewer things because they're smaller and
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.040]   less powerful, but because of their position, they can do more convenient things. So instead of
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.400]   having to even look at your watch, you just see things in your peripheral vision,
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.680]   and it's got, because you're wearing it, it's got sensors. Computing it's a next generation
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:23.040]   Apple Watch. Yeah, we've seen this progress in every area. We've seen this progression that you
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.720]   just described happen. It doesn't mean, though, that the next step is glasses or earbuds, or,
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.760]   I mean, it's just that's what happens. It's just a convenience thing. Like, why even
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.280]   bought? Like, we're turning into those people from the Pixar movies, Leo. Like, why even bother?
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.920]   Lifting up my wrist is hard. It's too slow. Oh, you mean to people in Wall-E in those little pods with
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.200]   this piece? Yeah, that's what we're putting. But even like just I'm talking to you, and I don't
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   remember your wife's name. I don't remember my appointment, and I don't have to be rude and look
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.960]   at my watch. I just get a little notification saying, Andy said, "Where the hell are you? We're
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:56.160]   starting the show." And I'm like, "Oh, okay." It's just an escalation of convenience and sensors.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:02.080]   I think that if Apple does it better than they did iBooks,
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:07.040]   you were so excited when iBooks came out. You thought because I could see what was possible.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:11.200]   Yeah, that desktop published. You know, people be able to make beautiful books and it just died
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.680]   on the vine. And do you think it was Apple's fault or was? Who's fault? It was Apple's fault.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.960]   Yeah, it was Apple's fault. What did they do wrong?
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.840]   So number one is they went to traditional publishers to build the test cases. Big mistake.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:28.160]   So they went to people who don't understand the new, they don't never go to the incumbent
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.640]   to tell you how to use the next new thing. So Pearson gave them a bunch of books that had
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:37.360]   serrables in them. It was not. And so what they should have done is taken the folks that made
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:41.680]   elements, the app. Those are the people that you give a billion dollars to and say build a bunch
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:46.800]   of stuff and let people see what it is. Because elements, the app on the iPad app elements,
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.640]   is what's possible. That's the beginning of what's possible.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:56.320]   But wait, I would say that was high on the cool factor, but it wasn't deep.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.480]   So you got each one without the periodic table. You could see, you could rotate it.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.840]   Yeah. But what you didn't do, chemistry experiments with them, I mean, it's just the beginning.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:09.200]   But if you think about having the problem with it is that they had to write an app to do that.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.560]   They couldn't do that in iBooks. So elements was...
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.840]   Oh, I didn't know that. That's interesting.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.080]   Yeah. So it was an application because those tools weren't available.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:23.040]   The issue is that they need to make it so that it's easy to make an app.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:28.800]   If they made something that's easy to make that, you end up with an entirely new publishing thing.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:33.120]   And then you have to push money into it to publish it. Apple needs to spend billions
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:37.200]   on content that proves to people that this works. And that this is interesting.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.880]   So people can see that because what happens is they need to see the test.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:49.920]   And so the thing is that iBooks didn't go to interact with publishers or people who understood
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.680]   interactive. They went to old publishers and said, "We want to show people a textbook,
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.120]   so show us a textbook on this." But that's still way too many words.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:03.040]   Anyway, so the idea though is that they didn't fuel the system and they didn't make it easy
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:09.360]   enough to build whizbang things. Now, what we've seen over the last decade is
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:14.640]   keynote getting better and better and better and more smoothly able to build a lot of different
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.920]   kinds of content. Pages being able to now... Basically, Pages has like 80% of iBooks built into it.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:24.800]   And so those are a lot of things that are starting to build up. And then you start to see USDZ
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:29.360]   showing up over at in motion and final cut. Well, that's eventually going to be everywhere.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:36.000]   Right? I mean, right now I can text you a 3D model that I shot with my iPhone 12. I can just
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.160]   like digitize something and send it to you. And when you open it up, it will pop out in front of
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.600]   your... If you have an iPhone, even an older iPhone, if I text you a USDZ model, you can actually
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:52.000]   pick it up and look at it in 3D. Now, so what we're... Alex, I'm always trying to figure out if
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.560]   you're a visionary or a fanboy. Because... He's just saying, "I'm already doing that." I know, but
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:04.320]   you can do it, but does anybody want it? Is the question? Okay, well, I mean... So the thing is,
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:11.600]   is that where we're going to get to, like with objects, objects, is do I know whether that couch
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:19.600]   looks good in my house? Amazon right now has an army of modelers that are betting on that happening.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:25.440]   So, one of the big problems you have in buying furniture, buying other things like that is not
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:29.120]   knowing what it's going to look like when it gets here. Now you can tell, because with LIDAR,
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:33.760]   when the phone has LIDAR, it means that it can scale it automatically. So I can just... I can
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:38.400]   put a car in my living room and see exactly what it looks like. I can move it all around, I can look
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:44.240]   at it close up, I can back away. More importantly, I can send you a brochure that lets you...
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:57.040]   that lets you pop open... pop out the thing into a model. And that helps us, like I know that when
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:01.280]   we want to pre-visualize the space, we LIDAR it or we build it and sketch it up or whatever,
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:06.560]   and now we can make all of that work. And so, it'll start in very interesting areas like that,
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:10.400]   but for education, imagine being able to take any object I want to show students and all of them
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:15.040]   have access to that at that moment. And they can rotate it around, they can talk about things
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.440]   and more importantly, I can annotate it. That's what mesh... that's one of the things mesh can do.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:25.040]   Sure. And even students at home can see that. But they have to have a holl... holl...
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:30.480]   Yeah, well, hey, you know, life's so... So, not perfect. Yeah, so actually they don't have to have
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:36.720]   a holl... it works with the quest too, which is cheap. They're all going that way. I mean,
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:42.080]   but the big thing is, is that there's going to be a lot of things like even just being able to
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:49.920]   pick up my phone. And we've already done tests for this. We scanned an arena. And so, the big thing is,
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:54.080]   is like where we're going with like ultra wide band. So ultra wide band will get you to, you know,
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.000]   a couple centimeters, I don't know, 10 or 15 centimeters, six to 10 centimeters, something like that.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.080]   So you can know basically where your phone is. What that does is it reduces the database that
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:09.520]   you have to search. I'm simplifying it, but it reduces the data it has to search within that
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:15.920]   object within that building to only that six to eight inches and 360. Then it matches objects in
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:22.800]   that real world to the phone looking for them. At that point, Apple, I mean, the phone, this is
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.160]   why privacy is so important. I want one of the reasons privacy is important, Apple,
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:30.720]   is the phone knows where you are and where you're pointed to less than a millimeter. So it is,
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.280]   it is completely locked into where you are. Now, what I can do is I can start adding stuff. And
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:40.560]   the most important thing to add in an arena, where's the bathroom? I'm looking for the bathroom,
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:45.840]   and where can I buy hot dogs? And so I have big arrows appearing to tell you where to go and how
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:50.480]   to get there. But it could also imagine rebranding. But am I going to buy a device just so I could
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.000]   find the bathroom in the stadium or the hot dogs? You're not going to buy a device if it's on your
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   phone. If it's on your phone, you just pick up your phone and look through it and just say,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.120]   hey, where's my son? In other words, we already have already. No, it's something that's the big
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:06.320]   thing is that you don't have to buy anything new. It's just your phone that's there to tell you
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:11.520]   where to go. 65 million people have bought these already. And so the thing is, I pick it up and it
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:17.760]   shows me where those things go. But I could also reskin the entire arena for Elton John this week
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.000]   and Taylor Swift the next week, where when you look through it, it's not just telling you that,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.760]   but there's a whole little world and there's things to play with and there's things that you can do.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:32.320]   And those are the kind of things. And the I'm not paying for that as a user, it's part of my
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:36.320]   ticket that I pay for. The way that Taylor Swift will give you those little bracelets,
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:41.280]   those little light bracelets, those are $8 each. And when you pay $150 for your ticket,
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:45.280]   you get one of those. You get a bracelet. And then you have a whole lot of concerts,
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.800]   the projection systems. We've talked about this before at these concerts,
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:55.280]   allow them to do amazing things with scenery and set. And imagine if eventually HoloLens or
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:00.960]   whatever comes out and it's small enough and light enough that you can wear them in a show,
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:06.720]   you'll have entirely different experiences. And again, walking into a museum and now you can
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:12.160]   annotate everything in the museum in 3D, telling you all the things about it and playing audio for
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:15.120]   you and everything else. And you just pick up your phone and look at it and it's going to tell you
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:19.040]   this. I remember when they said storytelling is going to be completely different. This is like
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:23.920]   20, 30 years ago, because you're going to be choose your own adventure. It's fully interactive.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:30.320]   But nobody who creates stories wanted to do that. I don't think choose your own adventure. I think
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.040]   it's a horrible idea. I'm not saying choose your own adventure. I'm talking about your
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:38.480]   story. I'm just saying you've got to get creators who are able right now, Steven Spielberg is able
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:43.760]   to tug at every possible emotion on screen. You need to get people like that won't be Spielberg,
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:48.480]   obviously, but the next generation like that to do the take these new platforms and create
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:54.160]   content that is equally immersive. No, I don't think you need to. I think you should need to get
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:38:03.040]   Home Depot and Amazon and other folks to use it as an educational titles and sales for
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:07.680]   materials and for all those other things. There's so much you don't have to go after that. Well,
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:12.080]   eventually though, if you want them, sure, but we'll figure it out organically. But I don't think
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:16.560]   that but we're talking there's 10 years of not. There's 10 years of not having to worry about
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:21.360]   a narrative narrative content. You could do this for 10 years. That's the last thing
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:25.680]   I understand. And the problem is that Gettysburg thing you described is sufficient to jump
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.840]   start this Gettysburg. If they did that, they would make millions a year by people paying 20 bucks
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:34.480]   at the tourist, you know, they'd walk in you buy the Gettysburg. Very silly. That's why not just sell
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:42.000]   VR set. But what we need is cheap VR sets. Yeah, we're a lot of this. We're a lot of this
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.640]   tends to hold our phone to do that. Go ahead, Danny. Go ahead. Where a lot of this tends to fall
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:52.000]   down is that that's lovely. It's going to cost a lot of money to create these experiences for
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.400]   that for that Gettysburg background. They are also need to upgrade the bathrooms. They also need
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:04.160]   to make sure to say that, well, there's here's a bottleneck for people coming through to simply
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:08.160]   get to the battlefield. We need to make sure there are more guest services. We make we need to make
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:13.520]   sure that we have we have content that's available to people of every language and every
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:21.600]   physical ability that they possibly have. And these basic simple things that apply to everybody
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:27.360]   are almost always going to take precedence over really great ideas that involve people who have
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:32.480]   the right technology or can really appreciate that kind of stuff. The way you're talking about
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:38.640]   it when you're talking about iBooks, when the biggest fault that that Apple had there was that
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:44.480]   essentially they came to Pearson and said, hi, we want you to spend a good deal of money to help
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:50.160]   us sell iPads. Wait a minute, but you don't have internet. No, no, no. See, if you create content
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:56.640]   that can only run on our iPad, it'll make everybody know how wonderful our iPads are and help us
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:03.840]   to sell more iPads to schools and to educators. But what's in it for us? Well, not much, but
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:09.200]   we'll sell more iPads. This is a surprise. This is a large problem that you have to kind of deal
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:13.440]   with that you have to make sure you have you can't assume that everybody has the right phone to
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:17.440]   to run this sort of stuff. And you can't you have to make sure that whatever content you're
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:22.000]   asking all these facilities to create, even if it is sort of a side pocket thing that
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.360]   it is not going to be locked to any one platform past present or future. You sure as hell aren't
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:33.120]   going to tell them that we want to make we want you to invest in again money that could be put into
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:38.720]   better guests services, better bathrooms, or even a hot lunch program for our disadvantaged kids.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:43.520]   But and say we want to help you to sell iPhones because this this thing that we're proposing will
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:48.720]   only work well on our VR headset or on our iPhone set. So, but that's not how you do it. You take
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:52.720]   the people who say yes, and then you pay for it as the platform like Apple pays for it. Like the
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:56.800]   Gettysburg experience is not paid for by Gettysburg. Gettysburg experience is paid for by Apple.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.560]   That's what they need to do. They need to spend the money on doing that and then making it available
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:04.720]   even for free or for a low amount of money because they're trying to prove the model because what
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:10.000]   happens right behind that is a whole lot of other work. You have to you create that test.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:16.560]   You prove that business model. I mean, so I've done a lot of work doing that. I mean, when we
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:21.840]   did the Hangouts launches, what I was paid to do was prove it was paid for those Hangout launches
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:26.160]   were paid for by Google. Those those the Facebook live stuff was paid for by Facebook.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:32.240]   So the thing is, is that it is so the thing is now then a whole bunch of people hired us to do it
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:44.560]   for them because no one wants to be caught falling behind. It's the whole clubhouse thing. It's
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:48.240]   the whole whatever. So, what happens is suddenly there's a lot of really cool content that excites
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:54.480]   people on a platform and you launch it. But the companies that do that spend millions of dollars
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:42:00.880]   doing examples that build up the demand for it and then everybody else starts jumping into it.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:05.680]   None of these things get paid for by just putting it out there and hoping people use it.
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:10.800]   I'm starting to become John C. de Vorek and it'll never happen. I don't buy it.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:16.640]   I love the vision. I think that's great. And I think Apple clearly sees that as a
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:22.080]   somewhere that they'd like to go. And then they see it. Yeah, you could do it on the phone in the
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:28.720]   iPad right now, but they see it as a thing that you do with eyeglasses and that may be yours off.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:34.080]   I have to say, I mean, I remember, look, you for 25 bucks, you can go to eBay and buy a virtual
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:41.120]   tour of the Louvre and the Musee Dors say on CD-ROM, right? Remember when CD-ROMs came out,
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:45.600]   everybody started doing all these? CD interactive. Yeah, and we thought this would be like the next
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.520]   big thing. And it just... It was like, press the button and it would rotate in front of you.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:54.560]   Yes, exactly. Yeah, but the tech is... I mean, it was just not good enough.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:59.760]   Is that what you're saying? I mean, I'm doing a lot of R&D on this.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:03.920]   Yeah, I have to defer to you because you have more experience that you can't even talk about
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:09.440]   making these experiences. But the tech has come a long way. Back then, you could barely
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.760]   rotate something around. Now we can push. So right now, the iPhone can handle about two to three
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:18.160]   million polygons. Now, when I was doing games, the two to three million polygons at 30 frames a
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:23.120]   second is about what we're testing out right now. That's a lot of data. We can do a lot. And if we
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:31.120]   drop it down into the half million polygons, which still looks really good, we're getting
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:36.240]   incredible frame rates and so on and so forth. And so the thing is that that stuff is pretty
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:40.320]   exciting. And when you pop up, especially when you start taking photogrammetry, where you're
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:46.240]   taking photos and you're turning into 3D models that look very realistic, it is... You just amaze
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:53.680]   that it's in your house and being able to do it. And I feel bad for a lot of the school systems
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:58.720]   that are buying all these Chromebooks. Because when this stuff hits, two to three years, when
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:03.040]   this hits, all the schools that invested in Macs and iPads and everything else are going to be
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:08.480]   doing stuff that is incredible. And the other school systems are all going to be stuck with
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:11.280]   Chromebooks. And they all had the money right now to buy them because of all the money that's
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:19.600]   coming in. And so... Andy and I are skeptical. But I would never bet against Alex Lindsay either.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:26.080]   So I'm just saying that people are... The reason why the school systems were buying Chromebooks
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:31.760]   is because they're best suited for purpose. They're not... They're issues that they need this
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:38.400]   hardware today right now. And for those issues, an iPad just ain't going to cut it. And a lot of
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:42.880]   it isn't just simply a question of having a visionary enough school system that understands,
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:46.800]   "Hey, what's education going to be like five years from now?" A lot of it is that they've got
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:51.920]   regulations that they can't buy a certain piece of hardware unless it conforms to certain very,
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:55.600]   very dull aspects to it. I mean, the possibility is going to be part of it.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.560]   There are schools that are using the iPad.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:03.600]   Simply having a keyboard is one of it. And it's just not as simple as that. All I'm saying is that
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:11.280]   we don't solve problems necessary. Every solution has to be fit to purpose. And sometimes,
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:18.000]   whether you're directing the... Director at the Gettysburg National Park,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.040]   whether you're a director at a museum, whether you're a director of a school system,
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:26.720]   it's all about fitness for purpose. And sometimes what is your goal? And the technology is either
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:30.960]   going to further that goal, or it's just a nice idea that may or may not play out.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.720]   And sometimes the right idea for furthering your goal is let's put in more bathrooms.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:38.240]   All right. I'm going to table this discussion because it could go on for hours,
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:42.080]   and we have other things to talk about. I know we will revisit this, though.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.720]   And then I know Alex, is that a threat, Leo?
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:48.320]   Yeah. No, and I want to hear more because I do honestly...
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.280]   This is what Andy and I sound like when we're having dinner together.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.520]   I know like... No, and I appreciate it.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.280]   It's great. The two of us love doing it.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:59.200]   Yeah. It's like our... This is like my favorite thing to do is to hear an argument Andy.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.920]   It is a puzzlement because... Well, he takes...
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.200]   You know, apples invest a lot of money into that virtual museum stuff
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.800]   because they saw that as something that they wanted to do.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:13.840]   Predicting the future is hard. To back you up, though, a little bit,
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:18.160]   what Microsoft announced today is really kind of about that as well.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:22.960]   And they made a point of saying, "Yeah, here I'll give you the quote.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:27.760]   If you want the fully immersive head-mounted experience, get a HoloLens,
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:34.480]   or an HP Reverb G2 or an Oculus Quest 2 for 3D volumetric experience
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.840]   to phones and tablets on iOS or Android for convenience
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:42.960]   through to the fully tethered experience in PCs and Mac for two-dimensional viewpoint."
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.920]   And so their mesh stuff is designed to work across the board.
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:49.600]   And that's what makes sense. And I imagine Apple will do the same thing.
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.720]   I feel like in some ways Microsoft's the John the Baptist
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:57.840]   in this scenario preparing the way for the Jesus glasses, but I could be wrong.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:01.920]   I'm not even going to put my foot in that.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.280]   I know, that's a bad one.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.680]   Thank God, Father Roberts, not here. He's crucified me.
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:10.320]   Interesting choice of words, but that's a part of the point.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.760]   Maybe I made another mistake.
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.320]   Yeah. Okay. Moving on.
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:19.360]   In just a bit, I want to talk about rumors because poor Renee has been left out of this
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:20.960]   conversation, but he's the king of rumors.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.960]   So I was just placing side bets on Dogecoin's.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:31.920]   There, Mingchi Kuo, or as you say, Guo-ji Ming Ming-ji Guogo,
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:36.320]   has been very busy, right?
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.920]   In analyst note after analyst note.
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:38.800]   Holy cow.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:43.360]   I think it was one note, but every blog wants to have eight posts out of one note.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.160]   Oh, maybe that's it.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:48.400]   iPhone 13, here's the disappointment.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:54.400]   No USB-C. Do you think it will not have a port or will it be a lightning port, Renee?
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:59.040]   No. So he said that Apple is not going to go USB-C, and he stated a slew of reasons,
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.920]   including the waterproofing, the slightly worse, the size is slightly bigger,
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.920]   and USB-C is aging out the same way.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.120]   Lightning is aging out.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.960]   He thinks they're going to go portless, but it's not ready yet.
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:09.680]   Not yet.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:13.840]   Their contact technology is not good enough yet, so they're going to do that in a future version.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:16.480]   And this one is going to still have all the ports on all the models,
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.440]   including a mini, which I think some people were fearful would go away.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:23.920]   Yeah, because the mini did not sell, or at least the rumor is it did not sell all that well this time
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:28.160]   around. In fact, supposedly they stopped production on the mini. They had enough.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:32.480]   Five percent, but we don't know what their expectations were, and they planned so far ahead
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:37.040]   that they probably got that all tooled up already anyway, because it sounds like an S-year.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.080]   He also said no notch, hole punch.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:46.240]   So this year, slightly smaller notch, because in one of the ways they're increasing battery
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:50.800]   capacity is to flatten out the Face ID system, and that's going to let them have a smaller notch.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:55.280]   Next year, a hole punch the year after that under display, which I think is aggressive,
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:59.280]   because when you look at the current under display cameras, it's basically like that
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:05.760]   photo, like butter over too much bread. It's just it's smoochie, and you can see the pixelation,
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.400]   because all they're doing is spreading the pixels around to try to shoot through them,
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:13.200]   and then using AI, like machine learning to patch the holes in the camera.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:17.360]   And it looks it right now. He equivocated over touch ID.
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:24.160]   He said, "Our latest survey indicates there is no visibility on the current schedule for the
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:29.040]   iPhone to adopt either USB-C or Touch ID in the sensor."
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:34.320]   We believe the phone will significantly improve the user experience if it adopts the power button
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:39.840]   with the ID Touch ID sensor. However, there is no visibility on the timing of adopting this
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:43.040]   new specification. He had it in his iPhone.
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:50:09.120]   He did also say that not next year, not this year, not next year, but in 2023,
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:19.520]   he believes Apple might do a foldable phone, a 7.5 to 8-inch foldable phone in 2023.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:26.480]   Having some significant experience with both the Microsoft Duo, which is a two-screen
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:33.600]   phone and the Galaxy Fold 2, which is a foldable phone, I'm going to say no hurry, Apple.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:39.520]   The idea is basically an iPhone Pro Max that would open up into an iPad Mini that would have
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:45.120]   Apple Pencil support. Again, they've been prototyping this stuff since 2010.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:49.520]   They just don't think it's ready for prime time. I don't know if their latest rumors are trying to
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:55.440]   use ceramic shield to improve the strength of ceramic impregnation in the substrate to try to
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:51:00.560]   improve the strength of the display. They're a patient company. They don't rush anything to
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:05.760]   market, so we'll see what those timelines really are. But they did say that this is not in production.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:09.120]   This is still an early testing phase. It's not even moved to a product yet.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:15.120]   Alex, you're not going to like this. Lidar is still only in the Pro and Pro Max versions of the iPhone
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:22.720]   13. I heard... It's just a rumor. It's just a rumor. I think the thing that most interested
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:27.680]   in is 120 frames a second. Yes, higher frame rate. Why do you like that?
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:34.480]   Well, I think that that is our... For this decade, that'll be our resting space is 120 frames a
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:40.800]   second 8K HDR with surround is going to be where we eventually find our way this decade. I don't
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:45.920]   know when we'll go higher than that. You're starting to see that those pieces slowly come into play.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:51.840]   I don't know if Apple will get to that. I think 4K 120 is probably where we get to.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:52:00.160]   But 120 frames a second is past the human... What most people will call human frame rate,
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:05.440]   which is somewhere between 60 and 90 frames a second, is where you stop. It just starts looking
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:12.240]   like it's there. At 120, you're over that. 120 is also interesting because it's evenly divisible
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:17.840]   by 60, 30, and 24. Oh, I didn't even think of 24.
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:24.480]   So once you get to all three of the main frame rates are supported by 120 frames a second.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:31.520]   If you capture 120 frames a second and you say, "Well, I really wish it was 24," you can interpolate...
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:37.040]   The tricky part is in reinterpolating the motion blur. So you have to figure out how you're going to
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:41.200]   do that. But that's a really known thing. It's just processor power. So we're getting to a point
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:46.160]   where we have the processor frames for every key frame and somehow add motion blur from those
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:50.560]   four frames to the key frame. But you have all that information. So between those four frames,
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:54.880]   you can calculate the pixel velocity. Yeah. So you can re-interpret those frames.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:53:00.160]   Does it? Yeah, it does that to show movies at 20 frames per second. With the promotion?
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:04.800]   Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. And it also saves the battery power, sorry.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:10.560]   Right. Yeah. And it's... So in movies, it's a little different because it only shows, though.
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:16.400]   It's showing them, I think, four times, I think, for each frame. But what I'm talking about is
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:19.840]   going back down. The problem is that when you go... It's one thing to go from the movies from
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:25.520]   24 to 120 or whatever, but going the other direction, if you shoot at 120 and your shutter speed is
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:29.920]   set for 120 and you go down to 24, it'll look really stuttery because of the motion blur.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:35.200]   Right. Slickering. And so... So you have to reinsert the motion blur on every mode on people's arms.
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:38.400]   But you have the data. But unlike upscaling. You have all that data. You have the data.
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:42.640]   Right. And so you have the data. And so you can calculate... Basically, you can interpolate between
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:47.360]   those key frames. You can build a curve between every pixel and then rebuild that.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:52.320]   So interestingly, the guy I was referring to earlier who said we've actually solved virtual reality.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:59.120]   It's called a motion picture. Also said that the reason 24 frames is good is that Dreamlike
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:05.600]   state is part of the whole thing of kind of suspended disbelief entering the Dreamlike state.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:09.200]   And he was skeptical about the higher frame. That way so far, Papras don't work.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:13.200]   Yeah. He was skeptical about the higher frame. Also, my understanding, and maybe Alex can speak
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:17.600]   to this, is that it's 120 still isn't... For Apple, 120 still isn't enough. They don't think it's
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:21.600]   high enough. They've patented 240. But most people, they want to get to 480.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:27.040]   Also divisible by 24 by the way. But apparently at 480, you can no longer see the flicker of a
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:31.760]   single diode. That becomes a constant source of illumination for you. And it's incredibly
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:36.240]   power draining now. But they've patented 240. And I think they're pushing to 480 next.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.400]   I wouldn't think you could see a flicker left and your problem.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:44.800]   After 60. We don't see the flickers. Can art fluorescent 60 hertz? Remember,
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:49.040]   it's not a frame rate. It's hertz. Yeah. It's the frame rate now.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:56.640]   Yeah. And so the big thing at 120 is that it may not be good for film. You may leave film at
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:03.200]   23 and 8. It is hilarious that our entire frame rate for a billions and billions and billions
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.800]   of dollars of industry is based on some cheap filmmakers in the early 20s.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:07.800]   Saving just saving time. Saving just saving time.
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:10.400]   Stomp. More cellular. Like they're like, how low can we go before we have to,
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:14.960]   it might have been an accident that worked. It might have been the same thing that they did to
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:22.160]   save money. It turned out it actually worked. It's got cultural inertia. It's cultural inertia.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:25.680]   I mean, we just decided that that was it. And we watched it a lot and we're fine with it.
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:28.240]   And so what do you do? Do you do 30 or 60?
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:34.000]   I have to admit, just because I can see the interpolation on the TV. So I will turn everything
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.440]   to 23 and 8 all the time. It looks awful. I don't see it. It looks like it's rubber,
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:41.280]   but it's plastic. But it's not. But that rubber. But the thing is, is that
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:46.560]   rubbery look that everyone complains about is not because it's 60 frames a second. It's the
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:54.320]   interpolation that looks soft. And so it's. And so the. So anyway, the where this is really
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:56:01.520]   interesting at 120 frames a second, let's say 8K is sports, is documentaries, is real
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:08.400]   nature nature things, concerts, all those things. Because imagine having an 85 and 85 inch 8K 120
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:13.520]   frames per second watching a concert is going to look amazing. It's going to be looking like you
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:20.720]   are there. And in fact, the biggest problem I had with some of the stuff that we've done at
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:26.880]   really large scale 8K 120 frames per second HDR is actual camera movement becomes uncomfortable
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:32.640]   for the viewer. So it actually changes it where if you move like what I find is that if if at that
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:39.120]   resolution and that size, if it fills my periphery, so all I can see is the screen at 8K 120 frame
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:44.800]   per second HDR, when you move the camera, I can feel it in my stomach. It's actually less comfortable
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:51.360]   to watch because my brain has stopped thinking that I'm looking at a movie. Like it is like it
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:55.920]   just looks at it and it's processing it as reality, which has a whole bunch of opens up
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:57:00.720]   can of worms of all things we should worry about. But the point is that that's a different experience.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:06.320]   I mean, you can literally have at that point, if that continues to be the case as they work,
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:14.160]   you get a rollercoaster ride that is in your house. But you literally feel it at that
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:19.120]   in the same way that you feel it in VR, but you really feel it at that resolution.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:24.320]   At Universal Studios, if you've ever been the Simpsons ride, which is you're just in a
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:29.360]   thing that's going like this, in fact, they even say if you start to get nauseous,
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.480]   just look over and your bags are over there and they're not moving.
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:38.800]   Yeah, you go, "Oh, I feel better." I feel better now. But that your gut feels like you're going down
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:44.080]   because it's a rollercoaster ride. Now that was the very first or at least a very early VR ride
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:50.160]   experience. Now they've got, I mean, the Transformers ride is with practicals as well as video and
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:54.640]   it's very effective. I mean, it completely fools you. I mean, the big challenge with that.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:59.440]   That was very virtual for a long time at Universal, which was very weird to look at.
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:03.840]   It's nauseating. It really is because it's not, you know you're not doing anything.
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:09.040]   Go ahead. I mean, the big issue that you have to get over at some point is also the,
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:14.240]   for a lot of these higher resolution, higher frame rate is going to be our bandwidth caps
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:19.440]   in the United States for our bandwidth. So at one point, whatever terabytes that Comcast
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:24.480]   give you won't, I mean, one movie will be a terabyte. Right. Right. That's going to be a big problem.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:30.720]   But I think the most in Norway, if you want to watch these things, sorry.
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:35.600]   I think like most content though, like they delivered on device. Like we have the full HDR
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:40.320]   Dolby Vision system on the iPhone now and YouTube doesn't support it. Nobody really supports it.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:46.000]   A lot of the, like the streaming services do, but we're creating Samsung phones go up to 8K now.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.920]   So you're shooting your own content at that point. That always seems to lead what you can play back
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:51.760]   like one or two years anyway. Yeah.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:58.160]   Only Apple had its own content distribution. They could, they could start producing 120
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:01.360]   frames per second HDR stuff if they, they only had their own channel.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:04.960]   Only. Do you know anything we don't know? Yeah. No, no, I'm making it.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:08.320]   By the way, Ted, I knew it. Ted, last. I will tell you one golden.
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:11.760]   Hello. We missed one. We missed one phone. There was, they also, uh,
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:16.160]   Wilmington also reported on an iPhone SE three, which is not the previously reported one that
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:20.160]   was supposed to be full screen with touch ID and the power button and slightly larger.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:24.240]   This one would be, and I don't, I have to believe in this because it doesn't seem right to me,
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:28.800]   but it would be exactly the same body, but with 5G and an even more powerful processor.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.520]   And I don't know how that battery would last more than three hours if that's,
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:36.640]   if that's seriously a device that's being made. Here's a rumor. Uh, I think you won't like Alex
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:43.680]   Lindsay. This is from a patent Lee Apple. They spotted an update to the final cut pro trademark
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:51.520]   registration in which Apple added the words rental of software to say that Final Cut Pro
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:57.600]   was protected. Yeah. Uh, we've actually talked about this a lot at an office hours already.
[00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:02.080]   Would you rent Final Cut Pro? I think some people will. Absolutely. And I don't think that,
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:05.920]   I think it's more equitable to be honest. If you like a bill to continue to develop,
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:10.320]   I always feel guilty because I paid for logic. I don't know. Eight years ago,
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:14.640]   for a final cut, 10 years ago, I got an update for 10. Yeah. I feel like that's wrong. Because of
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:21.040]   the phrasing of the patent, my guess is that this is for bonus, like they've done a lot of bonus
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:25.520]   content where you get a lot of additional resources, especially in logic, especially in garage band.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:29.280]   And there's a whole bunch of services that if they use Final Cut as a platform, there's a whole
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.440]   bunch of services they can deliver over the top of that. Yeah. On a subscription basis or part of
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:38.000]   the Apple one bundle, just increasing the value of the Apple one bundle will increase the value of
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.480]   all of Apple service. Was there consensus on office hours? Did, because you have a lot of creators
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:47.920]   on all of this. Well, I think that a lot of folks, the pressure that Apple has also is
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:53.520]   resolved that is free, you know, to do the base first eventually. Yeah. Yeah. And so, and so the,
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:58.320]   but I think that number one is we don't think that Apple is going to get, you know, we're not
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.400]   going to force everybody who already owns it to go into some kind of rental. And you probably will
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:07.040]   still be able to buy it. That's the guess. And then, and then beyond that, but the nice thing about
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:11.120]   it is, oh, I want to, I want to play with Final Cut right now. There's no way to really other than
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.720]   the 90 day that they gave. There's no way to say, Oh, well, I might, I don't know how much I'm
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.680]   going to use it. Maybe I'll just pay 10 bucks a month or five bucks a month. I don't think it would
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:24.560]   be nearly as much as what Adobe charges. So I think that I think that you might even have a
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.680]   pro pack that is, you know, a fraction of money compared to what Adobe has been charging for what
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.880]   they're doing. And then that allows you to get into it and not force you into a one year agreement.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:38.640]   You just want to use it for the next three or four months. Those are all things that I think
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:43.120]   Apple could do to be more aggressive about letting people play with the software. The $300, I think,
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:47.520]   is a high market. They gave you 90 days for free. And then you could just rent, you could rent it
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:54.320]   after that for, you know, X number of dollars a month. There's probably a higher uptick of using
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.680]   the software. So I think that, and then you could buy it if you want it. If you want to rent it,
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:00.800]   I think they just let you buy it in the same way that you buy movies or you rent movies. And I don't
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.040]   think that Apple has to separate those. And so if anything, I think it makes it more accessible to
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.880]   more people. Actually, Microsoft has announced that they're going to, they call it the perpetual
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:13.680]   license, you know, by the box software, Microsoft Office, there's going to be a Mac version as well
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.920]   as a Windows version later this year. They're going to continue to offer that. But it's mostly
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:22.560]   intended for businesses where they don't want anything to change. They don't subscribe.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.720]   So you feel like Microsoft is going to be completely SAS? Like I think even Windows is going to be
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.600]   SAS soon. Just their entire thing is so Asia and cloud focused.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:38.080]   I think it's going to be like, Alex described where you, there will be some skew where you can buy
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:44.320]   it outright. It'll probably be much more expensive. You know, buying office is prohibitively expensive.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:51.040]   It's a lot cheaper to rent it as long as you don't add up the years over time. I have a feeling they'll
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:57.920]   figure out a way to do both. I don't know. Microsoft One, you just plug in your computer and they
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:02.080]   stream you everything like a Chromebook. Well, I think I've been an advocate. I think it's going
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:05.760]   to happen this year. They call it Microsoft Virtual Desktop or Windows Virtual Desktop where you
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:11.520]   don't own Windows. You don't even have it installed. But this answers your M1 Mac problem.
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.480]   Yes. You don't even have to care that it's an M1 Mac. You just use one of Windows.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:19.520]   It'll be fantastic for us Mac users because it's just a virtual Windows in the cloud.
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:25.760]   It also solves the security issues, which are big. There's still a lot of zero days every month.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.520]   Microsoft has to fix all these things. It'd be great if they could just fix it in the background
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:34.160]   in your virtual Windows. But again, there'll always be people. I know there are people who say,
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.800]   oh, no, I have to own it. It has to be on my computer. And so I think they'll offer,
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.680]   you know, they'll have to offer both. But I think that's what they'd like the future
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:50.000]   of Windows to be. Ted Lasso, Apple TV Plus's first Golden Globe win 90 old
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:56.240]   white men from the foreign press decided that Jason Sudeikis was the best comedy actor.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:00.000]   But what a nice person to win that.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.760]   Best mother. It's so congenial.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:07.840]   Yeah, I tried to watch the Golden Globes. I'm a fan. I love it. But I realized why I love it
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:13.920]   is because they're on the Beverly Hilton getting soused. And then they come up and they do long
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:18.000]   drunken speeches. And boy, when you're doing it virtually, as they did, I mean, I mean, I was
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.800]   working had a party like he was showing up on Instagram.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:21.360]   You can tell.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:22.480]   Yeah, I'm just partying away.
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:27.360]   Yeah, that's what some of these people do is they, because everybody's in their home or somewhere.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:32.640]   And so one of the people do is they get a group of people together, their pot, I guess.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:36.080]   The construction of the show was pretty rough.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:40.480]   It did not go well. It wasn't an alphabet.
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.760]   It was just, yeah.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:46.000]   It was a lot of amateur mistakes. You know, just it was that was kind of the amazing thing was.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.800]   My favorite was the first accepted speech. The guy's on mute.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:53.680]   Maybe that just threw them off.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.600]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.200]   Was it Jeff Bezos again? That's so embarrassing.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:04.880]   No, it was the guy from the guy who played Fred, the Black Panther, Fred Hampton.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:07.760]   I can't remember his name, but he was great.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.800]   Segan?
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:15.440]   No, no, no, no, no, no, but he was great because he was muted.
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:20.400]   And so they went back to the stage and the poor, I think it was Kirsten Bell going,
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:24.320]   "Well, okay, I'm sure he says thank you," and starts to move on.
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:27.760]   And then he goes, "Wait a minute. Don't do me dirty. Don't do me dirty."
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.800]   So apparently he got unmuted. He probably was just his microphone.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.400]   We always tell people that. Look at your microphone. See if it's switched off.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:39.760]   Anyway, Golden Globes are kind of meaningless, kind of fun to watch.
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.680]   Not so good virtually.
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:44.240]   You're just saying that because it's foreign press, like America gets a press and then the
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.840]   whole rest of the world gets taken.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:52.480]   90 dudes, 90 people, very easy to get them all drunk at the same screening.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.840]   They used to send like, "Hey, I'm a junk repose of nothing.
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.760]   A junk 500-dollar watch. Please, everybody."
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:01.600]   And then actually what I love was the influencer marketing.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:06.800]   Of late, they have decided either they're too old to care or they've just decided this is good
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:10.480]   business, but whoever's hosting puts them down mercilessly.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:13.840]   Started with Ricky Gervais, Tina Fey and Noodle.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:16.000]   He was brutal, but so were Tina Fey and Amy Paul.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.760]   This year, yeah.
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.480]   They were, what, not Amy. What's Amy?
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.000]   Amy and Paula.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:22.880]   It was Amy Poehler.
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.040]   Okay, I confused her with another Amy.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:28.240]   They were brutal. Yeah, they were calling.
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.240]   They said, "There's three cats. There's two of them are dead."
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.200]   We don't know.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:31.600]   That was better.
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:36.720]   Anyway, that was, I guess they were trying to bring back the drunken vibe,
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.600]   even though they were in different places too.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:46.960]   Could you, see, as they just roasted you, Renee, on the clubhouse roast,
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:51.200]   I just imagine Alex Lindsey sitting there with a illustrator and just going,
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.280]   "Well, that's terrible. That's wrong."
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.160]   You can see the wire. You can see the wire.
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:56.640]   You can still do that.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:01.200]   I haven't done any recently, but I'm going to start doing very, very soon.
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.400]   It would be so much.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:07.760]   This might be the first one because there's been enough build up now that I started thinking about.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:11.520]   I took too much on on the first round of tear downs,
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:14.080]   and so I just didn't know where I would go with it, so I stopped doing it.
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:17.920]   Now I've got tons of things to talk about, because especially with this stuff.
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.800]   Well, I wish you were here for the Microsoft event earlier today,
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:23.760]   because it really looked like some of it was live,
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:26.880]   but most of it was pre-recorded on green screen,
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:31.600]   not with a hollow lens, that it was basically faking the whole thing.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.600]   And I know if you were there, you could have said,
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.440]   "Oh, yeah, I could see that that's green screen."
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:36.720]   I know you'd been able to see it.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.880]   Oh, well, next time.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:43.280]   Maybe we'll get you in a telestrator and for the next Microsoft event.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:44.720]   We'll do it live.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:49.360]   It is a good time for you to get back into this,
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:53.760]   because it would have been punching down if you'd been doing this.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.240]   Like in the first three or four months where,
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:00.400]   "Hey, I've never hosted a late night talk show from my living room.
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.880]   We're freaking this out as we go."
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.960]   But it's been a year, say to say.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:05.840]   It's been a year.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:08.960]   If you haven't figured it out by now with all the resources of a network,
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:13.520]   it's time to take your seat in the dunking booth, sir, or madam.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:17.760]   Well, I think that there's been a bit of just desperate to go back,
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.760]   a bit of resignation of it just doesn't, it's just going to stink.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.600]   And so we're just going to do the best we can.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:27.360]   And I think that there may be some, if this got really good,
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.920]   it would empower a whole bunch of people to replace us.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.760]   If you showed people, "Wow, it could look really good at your house."
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:36.720]   And then everyone's going to go, "I could build a broadcast network out of my house."
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.400]   And then that would be not good.
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:41.680]   Can I just say that I'm hoping that there is some lasting effects of this?
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:46.800]   I kind of enjoy more that, like on last week tonight,
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:51.040]   where John Oliver, when he's trying to lay down this very, very serious,
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:54.000]   like with lots of jokes in it, but making this serious, serious case,
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.800]   not having to stop every 30 seconds for laughter and hoots and hollers.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:03.120]   And also, other late night shows, we can just get people who can just show up on screen.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:06.320]   They don't have to, they're probably not there with their publicists,
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:07.760]   like right two feet away.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:12.320]   They probably didn't get a $3,000 suit or dress made for this effect.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.240]   I kind of like that it's more casual.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.400]   I hope that part of that stays.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:20.160]   I mean, maybe part of the lesson that they're learning is that there are people
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:26.880]   on YouTube who've got tens of millions of subscribers and followers
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.240]   who are making millions and millions of dollars every month.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:35.440]   And they're probably not having to go through as much crap as any host
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.680]   of any mid-market talk show has to deal with.
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:44.240]   Actually, this morning, John Hankey, who's the CEO of Niantic, joined virtually.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:47.280]   And I think he was actually like off mic.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:50.400]   I like he was standing way far away and he sounded like,
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:51.600]   I could just hear the whole room.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:55.360]   Well, I mean, COVID protocols, you don't want to get too close to the VR.
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.080]   You don't know where it's been.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:56.080]   You don't know where it's been.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.760]   To play and explore the world together.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.320]   No, where are they?
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:01.600]   I think he just doesn't want to be in the frame with this thing.
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:02.640]   This thing is creepy.
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:03.360]   There's no arm.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:09.840]   This is the proof of concept, not for consumer use version of Pokemon Go, Renee.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.200]   Who's going a brand new one?
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.280]   Or just walking through a familiar neighborhood.
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.400]   And this is the anniversary Leo.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:18.080]   And all of a sudden he's on mic, which means they pre-taped this, obviously.
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.000]   We imagine a real world.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.040]   But this, you can already do this, Renee, with phones.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:23.040]   Yes.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.920]   I mean, who's going to walk around in the park?
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.040]   We're in Holland.
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:28.880]   Right now, Holland's tethered, isn't it?
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.880]   Not even.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.920]   This is ridiculous.
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:32.720]   It's not even safe.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.400]   I mean, someone's kind of muggy so quickly.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:34.960]   Yeah, right.
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.840]   Can I have that?
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:38.480]   Also, so we can feel the view.
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:38.960]   There's a lot of really good stuff with...
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.680]   He's feeding Pikachu a little bit.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:43.760]   And the answer to AR stuff is getting really good now.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.800]   Like they're doing a lot of the multi...
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.360]   behind trees or behind tables.
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.640]   They're doing a really good job putting on,
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.240]   especially with the LIDAR, it's instant.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:55.040]   And it works really well, but it's still bound to the phone.
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.400]   I don't think that's a problem, though.
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:57.520]   No, I think it works fine.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.240]   I mean, you're playing the game, so holding your phone while you're playing,
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.720]   it's not a big issue, I don't think.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:08.080]   All right, we're going to go to the speed round in just a second.
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.000]   Oh, it's their 25th anniversary, Leo.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.360]   They made a whole big...
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.160]   For 9th, I think.
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:13.200]   ...of old this week everywhere.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.480]   Yeah, no, for Pokemon.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:17.120]   The most valuable franchise in history, apparently.
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.440]   25 years, wow.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:24.880]   Yeah, they had a great video that showed everything from the original games and cards
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.560]   as they developed every feature.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.680]   There was a bunch of them in Japan.
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:30.320]   I'd never known like Pokemon cameras and all sorts of things,
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.000]   but it's amazing how big...
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.360]   When you step back, you know,
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.960]   some like Star Wars is big and Disney is big,
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.360]   but wow, it's Pokemon much bigger than I thought it was.
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:38.160]   Yeah, yep.
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:42.960]   Is it an Nintendo creation originally, right?
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.720]   It's owned by three companies.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.240]   The Pokemon companies owned by Nintendo,
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.720]   Game Freak, and one other company that I can't remember.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.720]   Game Freak does the programs.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:53.200]   Nintendo, I think, well, they do Nintendo games.
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:54.480]   There's another company that...
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.320]   The first was Nintendo first or...?
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.320]   I think it was a joint venture.
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.760]   Oh, it's always a joint venture.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:00.080]   Okay.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:01.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.800]   I'm looking forward to the 25th anniversary for Animal Crossing.
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.680]   That's gonna...
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:06.880]   I'm gonna party down.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.280]   If I could just make Pokemon Crossing,
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.320]   I think it would break records.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.560]   Well, they have Mario now, by the way.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.640]   In my Animal Crossing, all of a sudden,
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.040]   yesterday, I could buy Mario goods.
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:19.280]   So there's coins, there's turtles.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:19.920]   They announced an open world...
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.400]   They announced an open world Pokemon game this week.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.600]   Everyone was freaking out.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:26.000]   Pokemon Legends, RCS, or Arcius.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:26.800]   It's gonna be a...
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:29.920]   I think the first or the next big Pokemon open world.
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.960]   How do you play that?
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.320]   Is that on the Switch?
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:32.720]   It's coming out.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:33.840]   It's gonna be on the Switch, I think.
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.160]   Switch.
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:35.920]   And you just walk around and...
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.040]   This is a good example of...
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:38.480]   Which could be indentured servances.
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.400]   How the game is what matters, not the device,
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:44.720]   because the Switch is low res and low quality hand health.
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.240]   It's experience C-bay for it.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:46.640]   It's not...
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:47.040]   Yeah, it's not that...
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.320]   And there's so much nostalgia.
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:51.760]   Like, they managed to sell stuff to all your kids.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:52.480]   And...
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.400]   I have zero nostalgia for Animal Crossing.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.760]   I know a lot of players have played it for years.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.760]   I never played it before, and I still am loving it.
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.520]   It's a well-designed game.
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:02.720]   Have you played it yet?
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:03.520]   Don't start.
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.400]   I quit Pokemon.
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.480]   I played a little bit, but I saw what it did to Justine,
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.920]   and then I figured I already had that problem.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.360]   It's done that to me.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:10.080]   It's done that to me.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.240]   I wake up every morning to see what new things...
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.640]   Your turnips.
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.360]   So you can...
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:15.840]   So you can...
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.040]   Now you can buy a...
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.400]   From Mario, I didn't play Mario,
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.520]   but you can buy one of those tubes that they goes down into.
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:23.360]   You can teleport on your island.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.160]   So I bought two.
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.680]   I put one there, one in my house,
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:26.560]   and one in downtown,
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.080]   and I can teleport downtown.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.760]   It's better than the boring tunnel.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:30.080]   All right.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.160]   Stop.
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:32.560]   We're gonna...
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:38.400]   My only question is, is there a NFT somewhere in there?
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:39.600]   You know, that's what it comes with.
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:39.760]   Probably...
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:40.400]   That's what I know.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:44.000]   Before the show, we were talking about a NFTs.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:44.720]   Holy cow.
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.800]   Holy cow.
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:47.120]   All right.
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.280]   Speed round next.
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.120]   Speed round time.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.440]   Apple stores all 270 open.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.760]   All of them in the United States
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:00.480]   open for the first time since March of last year.
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.560]   Who would have thought,
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.720]   when we shut down a year ago,
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:08.000]   that we'd just now be reopening, right?
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.640]   Yeah.
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.720]   Especially, like Apple,
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:13.680]   where everything is...
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:14.960]   If the whole thing is laid out to,
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.480]   please pick up this thing, touch it.
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:17.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.080]   Feel it.
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.640]   I wonder how much it costs them to shut those stores down.
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.960]   They weren't all shut down all the same time.
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.880]   I think you really want to look at the financials,
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:27.520]   because I think their financials seem to be hurting pretty badly
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:28.000]   in the last...
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.040]   On retail.
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:29.920]   Based on...
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:30.800]   No, you're lying,
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.080]   because they had the best quarter at all.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:32.960]   Whatever evolved...
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.560]   Any company in the history of man.
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:37.920]   Whatever they lost in the physical one,
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.320]   I think they may have been the virtual one.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:42.160]   Here's a great
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:46.400]   graphic animated gift from...
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.960]   This is from 9-5 Mac.
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:51.520]   Going through the date you see on the lower right,
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:53.120]   green is open, red is closed.
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:54.400]   You can see them all closing,
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.600]   then opening, then closing,
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.200]   then opening, then closing.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.240]   It's been a really tough...
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:58.880]   It's been pretty good.
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:14:59.120]   I had a few.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.920]   Well, and I think they've done a good job, right?
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.800]   I'm actually surprised that they're opening up.
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.160]   It seems a little early.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:06.960]   Me too.
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:07.760]   A little premature.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.200]   They opened up movie theaters here.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.720]   It's so weird in Quebec.
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:12.800]   They didn't cancel spring break,
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:13.920]   like they did in Ontario,
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:15.520]   and they said movie theaters could open,
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.600]   even though a lot of other stuff is closed.
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.200]   And now we're celebrating
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:22.080]   that our rate is slightly worse than every place
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:23.200]   that didn't impose a curfew.
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:25.440]   And still like, we're the only ones with a curfew.
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:28.800]   And it's gotten like parody theater at this point.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:29.600]   It's very bizarre.
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:32.240]   When they say open though,
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:33.760]   the question is are they open like they are...
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:34.640]   The other ones have been open,
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:35.920]   which is basically you get in the line
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:37.040]   and wait to pick up your stuff.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.320]   Ah, that's a question.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.000]   It's not like people are wandering around.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.520]   I mean, the one in Quarterman there,
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:42.640]   it's in store shopping now.
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:43.120]   Not before here.
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.320]   I think that's how they're defining it.
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.480]   Most of the so many of the stores happen open
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:51.600]   for just in store pickup for that kind of availability.
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.200]   Except in Texas,
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.480]   where everything's open,
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.680]   no masks, all businesses, 100% capacity.
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.200]   Go for it.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:00.560]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:00.960]   Yeehaw.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.920]   Yeehaw.
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:02.320]   Yeehaw.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:02.720]   Yeehaw.
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:03.760]   The shopper.
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:04.160]   It's real.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.840]   I wonder what the rest of the world thinks.
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:08.080]   It seems like, you know, when you're talking about France,
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.680]   you're talking about France or Germany.
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:10.480]   You're talking about Germany.
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:11.280]   We're talking about the United States.
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:13.520]   You're talking about 50 different states
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.920]   who are incredibly fractious
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:18.080]   and have completely different personalities.
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:20.720]   It doesn't seem like one country in many regards.
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:21.600]   That's the best part.
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:22.080]   I know.
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:22.480]   I know.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.280]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.200]   If you don't choose the flavor you want,
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:25.520]   yeah.
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:27.120]   If you don't like it, just go somewhere else.
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.400]   Whether you don't have to leave a country,
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.280]   you don't need a passport,
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:29.920]   you can just move.
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:30.480]   You can just like,
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.280]   I'm just going to move over here.
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:31.840]   I don't need to get,
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.920]   I don't need to go through any kind of customs
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:34.400]   or anything else.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.520]   It's hard for business though,
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:36.160]   because for instance,
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.920]   well, Apple's store is a problem.
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:38.880]   For instance,
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:40.720]   that there was a failed bill in North Dakota,
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:44.400]   but now Minnesota is going to take up the gauntlet,
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:49.920]   introducing legislation that would force Apple
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:52.160]   to allow developers to side load
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:53.920]   and to use alternative in-app payments.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:54.560]   In other words,
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:56.640]   effectively undermine the store.
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:59.120]   Arizona is thinking about it too,
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:02.240]   and there was a story in Protocol this week.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:06.000]   Apple and Google lobbyists are swarming Arizona
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.160]   over a bill that would reform the app store.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.160]   It's all a lobbyist money.
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:14.160]   It's all it is, it's a lobbyist money.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:16.480]   Yeah, well, that's who makes it.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:17.600]   As always, with lawsuits,
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.680]   it's lawyers, with legislation,
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:20.400]   it's the lobbyists.
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:23.840]   Arizona's version is kind of interesting though.
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.560]   It's not saying you have to force people,
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.640]   you have to allow people to side loads,
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:33.040]   side loads, apps from anywhere.
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:34.000]   It is saying that,
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.720]   for a user who lives in Arizona,
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:41.920]   you can't force a developer who lives in Arizona
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.400]   to use Apple's payment processor.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.840]   So if they want to get out of doing that,
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.440]   then they can simply get out of doing that.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:52.640]   So I'm not sure if it's going to move to Arizona.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:53.520]   Is that the deal?
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:53.920]   Exactly.
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:56.720]   So that's, or they would suddenly,
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:57.360]   like guess what?
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:03.200]   I'm buying all 400 of you condos in Arizona.
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.800]   You have to live there for six months,
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.120]   six months plus one day out of the year.
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:10.320]   I'm not sure if any of these are going to hold water.
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.040]   As this is lobbyists talk,
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:16.320]   but in this case, kind of accurate lobbyists talk that,
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.160]   oh, well, Arizona can't do that
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:21.360]   because the Commerce Clause of the Constitution
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.040]   says that only the federal government
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.040]   can regulate interstate commerce.
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.760]   But I'm at least glad that Apple has to fight this,
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:30.320]   excuse me, Apple and Google have to fight this fight
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.320]   in multiple states and keep justifying
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.720]   why they run the app stores the way they do.
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:40.400]   And we already saw that as silly as the previous law,
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:41.040]   as well as who was.
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.120]   At least it got Apple to say, okay, guess what?
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:45.440]   How about if we drop the,
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:48.560]   if we drop the fees for companies and developers
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.640]   that are not making quite so much money
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.440]   as Netflix and Comixology and Amazon?
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:55.680]   I hope that this continues.
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:58.800]   I think someone to, it's, someone walked up and said,
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.240]   hey, you know, all the people that are making less
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.560]   than a million dollars, that's like 98% of our developers.
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:03.600]   Why don't we just give them a break?
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.800]   It doesn't cost us anything to do that.
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:05.200]   That's true.
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.520]   I mean, like, I mean, that was the math was just like,
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.360]   but they, but it wasn't something
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:10.640]   that was already being discussed.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:12.240]   It wasn't something they were planning to do anyway.
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:13.440]   That's what, hey, wait a minute.
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:14.000]   That's right.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.200]   That's stupid that we're not doing this
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:18.240]   and it's costing us like political points here.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:21.680]   So to be fair, the all, you know, the coalition for app fairness,
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:24.720]   which is Epic Games, Spotify, Tyle, the match.
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:25.360]   Yeah, the worst people.
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:29.200]   They're the ones who are getting these bills in Georgia now,
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.280]   Hawaii, Minnesota, this Arizona bill.
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:34.960]   Although the sponsor of the Arizona bill,
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:37.120]   representative Regina Cobb said,
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.720]   we went through a very difficult weekend.
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:40.400]   We're Apple and Google hired probably
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:42.080]   almost every lobbyist in town.
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:45.520]   Although every lobbyist who wasn't currently working
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.520]   for the coalition for app fairness.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.760]   It's the, it's the lobbyist full employment act
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:50.480]   is what it really is.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.120]   Go ahead, Rene.
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:54.880]   We often elect the absolute worst, the most least competent,
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.920]   like politics has become the lowest common denominator job
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:01.520]   in the world and they're not savvy about any of these things.
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.640]   And that's not even an American problem.
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:03.840]   That's an international problem.
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:06.160]   I really hope the companies get ahead of this
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:08.160]   because we've seen things like a lot of the,
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.360]   the EU legislation.
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:12.560]   It wasn't well thought out or well implemented.
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:13.840]   So now you have cookie,
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:16.320]   like we have to turn off cookie things every time we go to a website
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:18.320]   and a bunch of websites pulled out of Europe.
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:20.560]   And that's not a good solution to anybody.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:22.880]   So my hope is that Apple looks at this and if they need to,
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:25.520]   they preemptively do a really well thought out,
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:28.240]   well secured version of Gatekeeper and iOS.
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.600]   They might have to scare me somehow.
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:29.920]   Yeah.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.000]   They can just say, look for people who want it.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.200]   We, and we know Epic hates the Android version of Gatekeeper.
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.720]   So like if Epic hates it,
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:39.280]   but it satisfies all the regulations anyway,
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:41.360]   that to me is like an ideal outcome.
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.920]   And then people who really have signaled that they are an adult
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.320]   and they want to take care of doing this, can do it.
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.000]   But like my mom doesn't have to worry about it.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.200]   My dad doesn't have to worry about it.
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:52.800]   They can just keep using a single simple store for themselves
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:56.240]   rather than just letting a bunch of state,
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:59.520]   lobby legislators write up the worst possible laws imaginable.
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:00.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:03.200]   It's not just they're, it's not just they're writing them up.
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:05.920]   It's like taking the, taking the text of a law,
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:09.040]   a proposed legislation that they got from lobbyists to begin with.
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.680]   I will say though that number one,
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:15.200]   a lot of these legislators, they don't have a lot of savviness,
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.200]   but they have people on staff who are very savvy,
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.280]   who get, who give them a lot of good advice.
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:21.520]   But the other part is, I see I keep looking at this
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.040]   from the consumer point of view.
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:27.520]   If there is, if there is one good part about people like that,
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.680]   creating and drafting this law, I mean,
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:31.600]   non-savvy legislators,
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:34.960]   sometimes you really do have to be outside of the bubble to say,
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:35.520]   wait a minute.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:41.120]   So you're telling me that if I buy a movie through an app,
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.320]   that's not an Apple app,
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:47.680]   this company has to pay a 30% tariff to Apple for doing what?
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:50.640]   Well, they process the payment, but that doesn't cost 30.
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:54.880]   Can we evaluate why this makes a good, this is a good idea?
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.720]   And then suddenly those of us who are in the bubble who are like,
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:58.240]   yeah, you know what?
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:02.720]   Why do I have to leave the Comixology app in order to buy a comic book?
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:09.840]   Because Apple deserves like a dollar 10 cents out of the last issue of the Red Hood.
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.120]   Yeah, the customer should come first.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:14.000]   The customer experience should be the guiding light for everyone of these decisions.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.200]   I think they're playing it, I think it's selling it, but the customer.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:20.320]   I think that number one is I don't think it'll go anywhere,
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:21.600]   because it's not constitutional.
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:22.160]   Right.
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:22.880]   He's not going to make it.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:26.560]   And they're talking about a conservative court and unconstitutional law.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:27.920]   It's just the dead weight.
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:30.000]   You know, and so it doesn't, it's none of these facts.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:36.080]   Honestly, it's not going to make it through the Republican Senate, the state Senate,
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.360]   which is Republican controlled.
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.920]   They're going to say, screw that business.
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:46.640]   So it's a lots, but I think Apple doesn't want to take a chance to have a chance on it.
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:50.240]   Well, and also they just don't want, they don't want the PR to keep on unwinding.
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:54.160]   And so well, but then there's the Apple Epic trial, which is coming May 3rd.
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:57.120]   That's going to be a big headline for some years.
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.480]   They found what's his name yet.
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:22:59.520]   They can't find the.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:00.720]   Better lawyers.
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:01.520]   Scott Horstahl.
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:03.280]   I think that's better lawyers.
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:05.280]   We don't have his number, Alex.
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.400]   What do you want?
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:07.600]   Here's his Twitter ID.
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:08.960]   Would you remember the judge?
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:09.760]   Do you have a monitor?
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.520]   It's lawyer twice last time.
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:12.560]   Like, is this all you have?
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.680]   And he's like, I feel like if I open it up again, you're going to yell again.
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:20.240]   For the larger one, though, one of the things that that I've been thinking about,
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:24.160]   related to this is that there is some point where you go, well, we're giving you acts.
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:27.680]   So you can charge outside of the, you know, if you're going to be able to charge outside,
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:32.480]   why are we giving you free access to all the services that we have?
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:36.080]   So for instance, why are we giving you bits for free?
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:39.840]   And so that because, you know, a lot of, you know, the cable companies charge for bits.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:43.920]   So what if Apple started just, if you're not going to charge, if you're going to not charge
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:46.240]   inside of our system, we're going to charge you for every transaction.
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:51.440]   Like literally every interaction with the framework, you know, like, and, you know,
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:54.880]   so it's a penny every interaction and it'll be getting more expensive than it was before.
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:57.760]   You know, so there's a lot of things that Apple can do here that can, yeah,
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:01.920]   we, if you're not going to go in our system, that we, we're just going to charge you for
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:04.640]   every time you go in and out of it. And there's not any reason why they couldn't,
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:10.640]   you know, and so, and so the thing is, is that, because it's absurd to think that someone can just
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:14.480]   do something for free inside of a platform that's already there. And especially now that they've
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:20.560]   dropped it in general down to 15%, it is, it's absurd to think that we can, that,
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:25.920]   that there shouldn't be rent to do that. Because I can tell you as a, as someone who's building
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:29.440]   apps right now, I'm not doing anything outside the app store because I don't want to deal with it.
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:32.720]   I don't want to deal with it. And I'm just like, I'm just going to be Apple to do this. I don't
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:41.920]   want to deal with it. Yeah. So Judge Gonzalez Rogers says May 3rd. I guess what was holding it up was
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:50.240]   COVID, but she's decided it'll possibly be a Zoom trial. It is a bench trial, which means she
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:57.040]   makes a decision. There's no jury on this. I don't know if that's good for Apple or bad for Apple.
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:02.320]   I guess it's a piece. She's really smart though. Yeah, she's smart. Yeah. She also,
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:09.760]   technologically savvy. Yeah. Not all judges. Yeah. She says the number of persons in the
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:15.840]   courtroom will be very limited. Some testimony will be in person, but there are plexiglass shields,
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:24.000]   which may or may not do anything. Anyway, and we'll be able to listen to it. There'll be a YouTube
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.040]   audio stream. The court has a live streaming channel. So it won't be video, but there will be
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:33.680]   an audio stream starting May 3rd. That'll be a hot ticket.
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:40.320]   I used when I was a kid, I went living in Santa Cruz. I still like to go to trials.
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:45.040]   I used to go to trial all the time. My dad was a federal prosecutor. That's right. So it's kind of
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:50.960]   interesting. Well, we only went the rest of most of it's boring. What we went to watch was my dad
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:54.240]   cross examined. So my dad would be like, Oh, yeah, because he did public corruption. So it was always
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.520]   someone who thought that they were important because they were a politician and he would take
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:02.720]   them down. We just got to watch my dad smack around. I think it's a little too dark, but criminal
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:07.600]   cases are fun to watch. Well, especially when your dad has a has a success rate of like 98%.
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:12.960]   Someone was going to get hurt. You're not allowed to bring pom poms and cheer or anything.
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:16.080]   Oh, no, but we definitely will. We wanted to bring popcorn. We were in line.
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:25.200]   Let's see. What else is going on? This is our our speed news hackers release a new jailbreak
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:31.280]   tool for almost every iPhone. This is a cat and mouse game Apple must be really tired. This is
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:38.800]   from the uncover team. It works on iOS 11 iPhone 5s and later all the way up to iOS 14.3.
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:50.880]   Apple said, you know, that this there are three flaws, including CVE 2021 1782,
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:59.440]   which was fixed in 14.4. So later versions of the iPhone are of the of iOS are okay.
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:06.400]   So I do people still jailbreak? Is that really still? I'm obviously somebody spent a lot of time
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:09.760]   figuring it out. Yep. I don't know why you'd want to.
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:18.400]   Perseverance. Now, this is kind of a misleading gizmodo headline. Perseverance, the new rover on
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:27.920]   Mars, isn't exactly a 1990s iMac processor in there. Not exactly. Is the blue dalmatian or
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:33.040]   the flower power? It's a power PC 750 processor. And I guess if you had the iMac G3,
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:41.120]   that was the processor. But these are hardened for a cosmic rays and stuff. There's some big
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:49.760]   differences between the ones in your iMac G3 and the Perseverance rover. But it is a power PC
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:55.920]   architecture. Yeah, absolutely. I have to say that this is I'm not a nit picker. I'm a pet ant.
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:00.240]   There's a difference. There's a difference in a whole team. But yeah, but every time I saw this
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:06.320]   headlines, it's not the same press as in the iMac. But yeah, it's a really is a great lesson about
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:12.000]   how, again, designing things for space where it's designed to have a mission of X number of years
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:19.040]   without any tech support, without any local onsite hardware swaps or tech support. And hardware
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:24.560]   that historically goes well, well, well beyond what it was originally mandated for on the side of
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:30.960]   the box. And the stuff that they have to do is so they have to, it tells a story about how
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:37.840]   you don't necessarily always take the most technologically advanced component or technology
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:43.360]   or solution you have available to you. You tend to go for the ones that you are familiar with.
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:47.840]   You see that they've been through fire and come out unscathed. You trust them. And so that's why
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:51.920]   you pick this one thing. And again, it's suitable for its fitness for purpose. It's fit for the
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:59.120]   purpose. The fact that it's not exceeding the, what the envelope, what you needed to do is fine.
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:02.480]   So long as the damn thing will continue to work five years from now. And you're not as much of a
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:08.800]   hurry as the average person sitting at their desk is, you know, you have a little time on Mars to
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:15.520]   calculate. It is a 233 megahertz processor, but it does have dynamic branch prediction. It was the
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:21.760]   first, the first power PC chip to have branch prediction. I think that one of the big advantages
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:26.480]   of the G3 over the chips in that timeframe is a larger L2 cache. Yes. So it gave it a lot more,
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:34.640]   a lot more bang for the buck. Yeah. And I don't think your iMac G3 could withstand temperatures
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:42.480]   between minus 55 and 125 degrees Celsius. That's 67 degrees below and Fahrenheit, 257 degrees,
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:49.520]   more than boiling in Fahrenheit. It's pretty hot. Also, it has to withstand 200,000 to a million
[01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:57.440]   rads of radiation. So this is actually not a power PC 750. It's dubbed a rad 750.
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:00.880]   That's a sound Dr. John Osterman yet. I mean, that was his whole mission. It was just a brand
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:06.560]   that was back to Washington and featured. And it also costs more than $200,000, which I think is
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:11.360]   a little more than that iMac cost back in even the fifth, even the anniversary iMac.
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:17.600]   Even the end of course. Why don't we going to get new iMacs? Lisa, Lisa asked me when she can have
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:23.920]   my M1. WDC, I think, is probably the June, June, you think? Yeah, my guess is between June and
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:28.960]   October, depending on how about new new MacBook Pros you think will have. That's what I'm hoping
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:33.760]   for in June. I need that 16 inch. I'm still on an Intel Mac because I need the like right now for
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:38.480]   Mac break weekly, I've got my power cable plugged in. I've got my camera plugged in and I've got
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:43.040]   ethernet plugged in and that's three ports, which none of the M1 Macs support that a breakout box,
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:47.200]   which never works as well. And I want the 16 inch screen because I do funnel a car pro all day.
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:51.840]   And I want the biggest screen I can possibly get. So just I'm stuck on Intel until they do it, Leo.
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:59.280]   Well, Lisa knows that I will buy whatever the newest thing is. So she's basically putting dibs on
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:06.080]   my current 13 inch MacBook Pro. But you know what that M1 chip, she will want it. I really think,
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:10.800]   I've never seen a max launch so fast. It's a beautiful thing. It's iPad responsive.
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:15.040]   Yeah, it's really, really nice. It's going to be a great opportunity for people who,
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:20.320]   there are going to be so many early adopters like Renee and like myself, who bought the first M1
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:24.320]   MacBook because they needed something, excuse me, I'll speak for myself. I needed something
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:29.040]   right now. I couldn't wait for second generation hardware. That's going to be a great time to pick
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:33.840]   up some bargains on the second hand market. Yeah, absolutely, especially if you like Intel.
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:39.360]   By the way, if you have the DTK Mac mini that you were given as a developer last year,
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:43.440]   you have till the end of March to return it. Box it up. Box it up.
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:49.280]   Reboxing boys. Anybody? Anybody? Alex? No, I don't.
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:54.320]   All of my Mac mini's are recent. More recent.
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:32:00.240]   Excited. I'll just use those ones. With Mac mini's, you never really give them away.
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:04.720]   They just deal with smaller things. You know, and you just keep using them until they just
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:08.640]   stop running. I mean, they're just so, I mean, I have Mac minis that I'm still using. They're like
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:11.440]   2010. You know, like they're just, you know, they're just managing stuff. I'm actually thinking,
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:18.880]   if they do an updated Mac mini with the M1X chip or whatever, I might even buy that instead of an
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:22.640]   iMac and just use my own monitors. I feel like I'm a little limited because I have to,
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:27.120]   once you buy the monitor. There's so much I/O. So the big thing with the Mac mini is,
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:29.200]   is that if you're not going to move it a lot, there's a lot of I.
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:31.520]   Right. And I want that. There's a lot of I/O. Yeah.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:38.880]   The M1 Mac mini's a little less I/O, right? Yeah. It's got an HDMI. It's got a couple.
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:43.040]   Three. I want one with the like the whole back is full of holes.
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:47.600]   Exactly. I want the harmonica. Because then you'll get the harmonic of that mini.
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:51.280]   That weird spider eye thing like the Mac Proleo. That's not what you want. You want ports,
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:54.800]   not just holes. You want ports. I want to see the thing I'm looking for is that I
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:33:01.520]   I would I hate to hate to be this like elitist, but like two screens isn't cutting it for me. I need
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:06.880]   once once I got my first once I got my first system together with three screens. I do have
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:13.920]   like three identical screens. They're not 4K. I like having like just the regular HD screens by
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:18.160]   having three of them. See? One, two, three. I just can't get. Here's what's bothering me about the
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:24.480]   iMac is I have to have that iMac screen in the middle. What I really want is a 51 59 inch curved
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:29.840]   screen that goes all the way around my head. Yeah. Even that would be better than three screens.
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:33.600]   No bezels. You just but it's like three screens. In fact, the Mac treats it like three screens.
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:39.280]   I think there's Lisa has one. There's a menu bar on the on one half of the screen.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:44.320]   So it's obviously seeing different screens. Then you really got it. Then there's no bezels,
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:51.920]   Andy. It's like you surround Mac. I guess maybe I'm just being influenced by having having
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:57.120]   having fallen in love with with war games. It's like I want the I want the the the the
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:01.440]   NORAD screens where there's like a million different screens. Yeah. Each one's doing a different thing.
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:06.160]   And that it's again, it's also like I'm joking. But I the way that at least the way that my brain
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:10.640]   works, I love the idea of this is the screen that's in front of me. I'm doing a full I've got a full
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:15.520]   screen editor because that's the thing I'm writing on my left. Yeah. I've got like my research and
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:20.080]   my right to the and to the right. I've got so I've got that's that's I've got these things
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:26.000]   compartmentalized. And now that I've been using exclusively this, I have the the M1 MacBook in
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:32.000]   front of me right now. Now that I've got like a screen that's sort of below that like deck of
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.240]   screens, I only have one screen in front of me. But now I'm like, I don't think I want to do without
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:41.280]   having like a floor level, like a desk level screen underneath everything else. Because now
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:47.840]   that's my I'm so used to having like my full screen like chat window in there. Or if I'm recording
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:55.360]   a podcast, my full screen control deck for for audio hijack. And so I'm afraid that I might have
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:35:01.200]   to buy a Mac a Mac Pro if only so that now I can have like the minimum number of screens that I
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:08.480]   want for this damn the mini Mac Pro. And he show us your setup. Can we see are using it now? Can we
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:13.680]   see it? Can you pick up the camera and turn it around? I can the chat room is demanding a look.
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:15.520]   Here here we go.
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:28.320]   Mini crayman 2000. The future. Holy cow. Now I know. Holy cow. Look at that. He loves his tape
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:34.480]   decks, which we absolutely need. Yeah. Here is it's all on the audio interface for here. Yeah.
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:38.560]   Well, this is kind of janky because I'm in the middle of like absolutely tearing down my office
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:41.680]   and trying to put everything back together. Yes, we won't judge. This is no judgment. This is what
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:46.400]   this is what I'm talking about here, where I kind of like having this like sort of like surface.
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:51.760]   What's that red dot? What's that thing? That is the cap to the beverage that I was enjoying.
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:36:01.520]   Unique control service. I like Coca-Cola. This is the no. And this is like the thing of a
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:06.400]   Bob that gets everything actually working with this thing. Yep. This is like always a stack of
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:11.440]   like stuff that I. Wow, there's a naked lady on your desktop. Oh, no, no. It's it's like 100 years
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:17.040]   old. It's a still naked lady. Even if she's 100 years old, it's Diana.
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:23.600]   Got a sudden unframpering. That day above 25. No, no, this is this is the woman who modeled for
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:28.800]   this is someone as someone that doing like long term research on. And so I couldn't get a I couldn't
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:33.120]   get a print of this painting that she posed for. But I got like a vintage postcard of it's that
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:41.280]   has to go and why are you doing research on her? Is she relative? No, it's just it's all in the
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:48.000]   simplest long the shortest way possible. I got in I got like into like this huge, huge rattle
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.880]   of research. And there was a piece of sculpture that I kind of like a piece of public sculpture.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:58.400]   Oh, I remember that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You talked about her. Yeah. It's the it's the it's the statue
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:04.320]   that's in the middle of the Boston Public Library. Right. Same lady. Yeah. And so there's a whole
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:11.120]   bunch of like urban myths about that statue that after this is this the courtyard there were
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:15.760]   that statue is is one of my standard, hey, I've got an hour or two to kill. I'm gonna go do some
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:19.360]   work, but here's a pretty place where I can go sit and work. And there's like all kinds of urban
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:25.200]   legends about like who posed for it? What was the history of this? And the and I just casually tried
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:29.760]   to find the answer to two different questions. And now it's like five years later. And I'm
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:40.160]   reading French newspapers from 1889 through 1895 looking for mentions of it's it's it's quite
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:44.800]   a fun rat hole, but it's it's a rat hole. So I'm trying to figure out exactly what happens.
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:49.840]   And you told us that when this statue came out, it wasn't the nudity people found offensive. It
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:57.520]   was the fact that she was happy. It was there's again, this could be three hours long. So I'll try
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:03.120]   to cut this. This is a topic where I put I put up the mental shot clock to say, I'm now Andy,
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:06.880]   I know you are interested in this, but the person you're talking to might not be so you're going
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:13.440]   to talk about this for 15 seconds. Lisa loved the tour you gave her. Yeah. And she said,
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:17.760]   next time we're in Boston, we're going to we got to get Andy to give us that tour again.
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:24.640]   So the 15 second answer is that this was at one time it was one of the most famous works of art
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:29.920]   in the entire world. It brought prestige to American sculpture. It was donated to the Boston
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:36.160]   Public Library than under construction. But it was rejected because it became a
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:41.680]   way for it came a target of a lot of like political skullduggery with all the preachers saying,
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:45.520]   Oh, well, she's she's look, she's dancing and she's holding grapes and look, she
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:49.840]   she must be the only reason why she'd be dancing and smiling and holding grapes is that she's drunk.
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:54.800]   And if people come to the library and see this drunken dancing girl, they'll like go into the
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:01.120]   go into prostitution and stuff and it became such a such a like a year-long fight that yeah, it's
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:06.240]   but it's a it's a great story. That's why I keep digging more and more and more into it. The more
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:12.640]   I dig into it, the more interesting stuff I could. I would buy the NFT for that statue. I would.
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:21.600]   I'm sorry, I'll end I'll clip this at this at this point. But unfortunately, I found out that
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:26.560]   reproductions of it was again was so popular and the artist was very, very shrewd business person.
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:32.960]   So he he allowed like reproductions of it and various sizes to be made and sold. And so I've
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:38.240]   been looking at like auction sites, actual art auction sites and saying, oh yeah. So the 34
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:45.200]   34 inch version of this like that was done like in 1900. Wow, I didn't think it would be that cheap.
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:53.520]   I do have that much money. Oh, Andy. And then and then if I and then if I like work to put it on your
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:59.440]   front porch and then the women's Christian temperature, you can pick at you. I don't know what what I
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:04.240]   want to do is I want to do an Alex Lindsay. I want to do photogrammetry. Oh, yes. And like so that I
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:08.960]   can like 3D print as many copies of this as I want to run over and do that for you if you.
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:13.200]   Yeah, let's do it. No, he's he's invited over. I would consult. We'll figure it out. When you get
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:17.920]   it when you get a bio, I'll come out. I'll come out. We'll so you're not you're not helping because
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:23.360]   it's it's like the amount of money that it's it's it's money that I have and money that I will be
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:28.240]   making. You could buy a used Volkswagen for the same price. So don't you know, yeah, I mean, I could
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:33.120]   yeah, I keep the the weasel on my shoulder, keep saying, but what if you were to you've got a lot
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:39.280]   of people who like enjoy your writing and your speaking? What if you said that please crowd fund
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:47.120]   the basis of your channel and he's back an alien tiktok channel. Oh, what if I were to just put
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:51.840]   it behind me and that would be like part of the set. Yeah, like the doctor. Yeah. I think we digitize
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:58.800]   it. We digitize it. We have a limited run NFT. And then that's the actually you probably know this
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:05.680]   Alex downtown at the main crossroads of Petaluma. There is a water fountain put up by the Women's
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:12.960]   Christian Temperance Union in 1908 or something. It's still there. Don't drink the water. But
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:18.000]   that I think it says something like total abstinence is the only way to solve the alcohol
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.840]   problem or something like that. You could bring pretty funny because there's a bar there. I know.
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:28.800]   Kind of a bar. Let's put this way. It sells bottles that you could take with you. That kind of bar.
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:33.360]   Yeah. These people these people got intense one one of the quotes from a from a newspaper from one
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:41.680]   of these people was that it would have been as inappropriate if the Boston Public Library had put
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:47.120]   a bronze statue of John Wilkes Booth in the middle of the library. And this was like 30 years after
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:52.400]   Oh, geez. In the assassination. So my God. It got intense. It was a thing, man. Yeah, it was a thing.
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:59.520]   Drunken. So there is going to be a new Apple arcade game coming soon from the creator final fantasy.
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:07.680]   Look at this. It's called Fantasian. If those graphics are any indication, it looks like stop motion.
[01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:14.000]   I will play this game. The tale begins in a realm governed by machines.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:21.600]   It is an RPG. It is set against a backdrop made from 150 handmade
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:26.960]   dioramas that blend physical environments and 3D characters. Doesn't that sound cool?
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:35.360]   They're working on it right now. Mist Walker is the developer. But as you might imagine,
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:42.880]   you could see here. There's a lot of work that goes into this as with any stop motion film.
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:47.360]   The game uses veterans who worked on projects like Godzilla Attack on Titan and Ultimate.
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:51.520]   Ever do a stop motion anything Alex who feels like that's the. That's the.
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:56.320]   For fun. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely done some for fun. I haven't had to do it.
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:04.400]   Professionally coming soon. No exact date. Here's the. Here's the trailer.
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:10.960]   So I'm going to see what this looks like. This might be quite. Everything will reach zero.
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:18.240]   Wow. That looks. It's very more involved than Apple arcade games. I've seen the.
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:20.960]   Yeah. Normally. Well, this is why I'm interested because Apple is not pretty golf.
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:25.520]   Yeah. Seemed like throw. Throw a way sort of or very casual. Little little little.
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:30.800]   Chachkis. Chachkis. That's a good way. This doesn't look. Chachkis. Here's the.
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:36.320]   Here's the 3D town. Let me jump to that. Because there's a lot of this is like.
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:41.840]   Manga style animation. Maybe this is just the trailer. Yeah. This is just the trailer. You're
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:45.840]   not going to see the. Yeah. You only see one little glimpse of the actual physical.
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:56.560]   Town. All right. Get your gentlemen. Prepare your picks. As they say, because that's what's coming up
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:03.360]   next on Mac break weekly. Let's start our picks of the week with Alex. I'm going to start with
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:09.600]   the expensive guy Alex Lindsey. Kick it off. Mine's not expensive again. I. I. I. I. I. Yeah. Maybe the
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:15.200]   last one was expensive. Anyway, this one is actually not that expensive. And I. Sitting somewhere right
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:17.920]   over on the other side of my table, but you can get. You can cut to it. This is a little imagine.
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:24.560]   Hoto. The Wuhoto phone tripod mount. I have gone through so many of these and this is by far.
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:29.680]   The best one I've used so far. So if you're looking at, I had to buy a bunch of these to mount a bunch
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:36.160]   of. Kind of. Word is. Hoto. I have no idea. I have no idea, but it's. But I got a couple of these.
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:43.120]   And it just has all the things. It's spring loaded. It's all metal. You can rotate it. It's got great
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:47.920]   locking mechanisms. It's got great mounting mechanisms. And so, you know, if you're looking for
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:51.440]   something about how you're going to like, I have to mount a lot of these to tripods and the other
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:57.440]   things. And and so it took me, you know, I'm buying these all the time. I don't know how many different
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:04.480]   versions I have of of I of phone mounts. What color is this? It's got it's comes in a
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:10.960]   chinese. Yeah, I think it's black. It's a Chinese word for black. Yeah. Yeah. So it's.
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:15.520]   But you'll see these little clamps. You know, and so and what's nice is those little, you know,
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:20.160]   the quarter 20 inputs are, you know, you can you actually have a couple places you can put it.
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:24.960]   Which they all over it. Yeah, they're all over. Oh, these are all quarter 20s here.
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:29.920]   Oh, look at that. Yeah, the quarter 20s in the back. Yeah. And so it's so it's it's a little bit
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:33.840]   more beefy than a lot of the other ones that I've used. So you could put lights on it as well
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:38.080]   as mounted on tripod. You can mount things to it to it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Like there, you can
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:45.360]   see a little light. And so it's a great little it's just a it's a really, really useful little
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:49.920]   mount. And again, it's been one of those things that I've had trouble finding one that really felt
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:54.240]   solid that was like, I don't have to screw it in. It really has a strong spring. So you can just kind
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:59.040]   of pull it in there and drop it in. But you can also kind of lock it as well. And it's it's um,
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:04.320]   anyway, I thought it was it felt a little basic, but I was like, man, I'm just using these all the
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:08.400]   time. I should probably mention it. No, you should. This one's working. You should. I just bought it.
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:13.680]   It's one thirty fifths of Alex. I just I just bought one too. It's because it's not only because
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:21.760]   if I if I can like add to add to what Alex is saying, I love a big not the cheap plastic ones. You get
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:26.240]   free with a tripod, but these nice ones that are metal and they have a screw that locks it in because
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:32.880]   not only is it good for a tripod mount, but if you if you if you put it on like one end of the of
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:38.400]   the iPhone, it really makes a great like gripping handle if you're kind of walking around someplace
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:43.040]   and taking pictures with it. It also allows you to screw like a little hands, a little hand cord
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:48.320]   hand strap into the tripod mount. So now I can mom walk around the museum on walk around the park
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:52.560]   or whatever. I can be walking around quickly taking pictures without feeling that I'm going to drop
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:57.280]   this thing or if I try to get things from from a weird angle, like I've got to raise it over my
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:01.920]   head, I'm going to drop it into a lake or something. It's it's it's one of the most useful 10 or 20
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:09.600]   bucks you can possibly spend if you really like iPhone photography. Very nice, very nice pick.
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:15.760]   Thank you. Alex Andy and I co your pick of the week. My pick is an app that's been around for 10
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:22.320]   years. I only discovered about a month ago. It's called workflow.com. Oh, I love workflow. Yeah,
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:27.920]   good choice. What I and here's here's my again, there's another shot clock sort of moment.
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:35.520]   I do have and I got this whatever happens inside my brain. I really, when I start something, I need
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:42.720]   to just be able to just blast thoughts or blast ideas or blast pieces of research or factoids
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:47.840]   into a document and then later on, I'll find I'll figure out like what kind of shape
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:52.480]   what I'm looking at with all this stuff when I see in front of me or I've got a big project such
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:58.560]   as I've got I've been doing lots of really, really awesome and awful things around the house over
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:02.320]   the past year and some some projects that have been started but not finished about, okay, I want
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:06.560]   to fix the bathroom. Okay, I want to put up these shelving and I don't know what's it seems like
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:13.440]   a huge impossible task to get the entire house in order but what I but it helps if I can break
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:17.600]   this down into smaller, smaller tasks such as okay, I'm going to create a list of just all the
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:21.520]   different rooms and sections of the house and then for okay, bathroom, I'm going to make a list of
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:25.680]   everything that I need to do or fix or upgrade inside the bathroom and then for each one of these
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:29.520]   things, here's all the things I need to do to get that done and it sounds like I'm describing an
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:35.280]   outliner and I actually am and that's what workflowy presents itself as a simple like a cloud-based
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:40.000]   outliner that will work either through a mobile app that you've got installed on your iPhone or
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:45.040]   your Android device or a really, really beautiful web app that will work in anything with a web
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:50.480]   browser but it's not just an outliner and what I like two things about it that it's absolutely
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:56.640]   super, super dead simple. It does not try to impose upon you all kinds of features that are
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:02.080]   extraneous like no, I don't want to I don't want to schedule like living room. It's just it's just
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:05.760]   an item in this list. Okay, yeah, I don't need just no, I don't want to assign a priority
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:09.760]   delivery room just please get out of my way and let me just write down the stuff that I need to
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:18.800]   get out of my head. But the the other cool thing is that it's I love the way that there's so much
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:23.600]   power that's hidden behind a very, very simple user interface so that yes, it will look like an
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:27.360]   outline as you're writing it but if you double click on an item suddenly it's almost like you've
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:33.040]   got a document window underneath that that outline item and so it allows you to do really,
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:39.440]   really complicated things but all that all makes sense inside your head because you yourself
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:45.120]   are imposing your own order and structure upon it and so I'm also I was also very pleased to find
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:51.120]   out that this is five bucks a month or $50 per year so my biggest worry was that all these like
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:56.640]   really great like information tools and oh no it's free, it's free, it's free. Oh god, what are you
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:01.440]   collecting about me and how are you going to use this information? So I love the fact that it is
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:04.720]   really just two developers who've been doing this for about 10 years, it's been getting progressively
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:10.640]   better every single year and within there is a free level to it which lets you do X number of
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:19.360]   lists or X number of items and it's but I wound up using it so much in the first week that yeah,
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:24.640]   it was very, very easy for me to spend the money and I still love Omni Outliner, it's still
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:30.480]   the Mac based app, it's still a wonderful app, I still own it and I still think it's one of the
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:36.880]   most beautiful and useful Mac apps ever made. Unfortunately, the way that I'm using computers
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:43.440]   and information in 2021 is such that I'm using two or three or four different devices and operating
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:48.320]   systems, I can't lock something that's that important into just I need not only do I need
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:53.200]   to be using an Apple device but I have to be I have to be using like an Apple device to do it.
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:57.120]   Unfortunately, this is why I've been look I've missed it so much over the past few years,
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:51:02.640]   I didn't realize how much I missed it until I discovered Workflow. So try it out, create an
[01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:07.040]   account, give it a try. Like I said, if you the first thing you do with it is just what is a
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:12.240]   project you need to get on top of and just just blasting out here are things I want to do and
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:17.200]   here's how to organize it, you might find out that this is there is a hole in your in your head
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:20.000]   that this workflow will patch very, very nicely.
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:27.200]   Windows as well as Mac as well as iOS. It's a you know it's challenging because the website
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:32.800]   there's not a lot of information. Yeah, exactly. What it does or how it works or even screenshots
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:38.320]   but you can download a demo version and try it right. Is it a to-do list? What is it?
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:46.480]   It really is whatever you want to do with it. It's exactly it's so I mean it has basic tools
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:50.880]   I don't think it does. There are other tools that are kind of similar to it that will let you
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:55.360]   create things as scheduled items and to-dos and check boxes and stuff like this.
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:52:01.200]   This is what I liked about it is that this does not try it gets completely out of the way
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:05.920]   that that really bare bones website that you just showed off which is what scared me off to
[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:11.680]   begin with saying okay I don't see like a big amount of text maybe this is just like the Raytheon
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:21.120]   Corporation is trying to learn about how people organize their houses by giving us free tools.
[01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:26.800]   No, no, but that simplified website really is their aesthetic. When you start using this tool
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:32.480]   like the web version of this tool you discover that yes it really is that simple but sometimes
[01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:38.400]   power comes from simplicity and this is one of those cases. How much if you decided to buy it?
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:44.800]   Five bucks a month or you buy years access for 50 bucks? Okay. Work flowy,
[01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:50.720]   W-O-R-T. Horrible name. I hate the name but it's like Smucker's Jam. It's like okay with a name
[01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:59.680]   like Workflowy. It's got to be good. All right Renee Richie it's your turn. What's your pick of
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:04.800]   the week? So I'm sure I'm sure that this has been picked before but I started using it again.
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:10.400]   It's DICE by P.Cal. You picked it before. You picked it before. I think so.
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:14.320]   You're picking it again. It's okay. You can pick it every time. I don't care. Yeah because
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:20.400]   it's a great update to it. I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons with my God kids and with Georgia
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:25.680]   over Zoom lately just because we wanted to. It's a great way to work on storytelling and
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:32.560]   like presentation, acting, skills, math, all those sorts of things, strategy and James is just a
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:37.040]   constant delight. He is one of the most amazing developers I know and he will make sure that
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:41.680]   like if there is an AR platform for Apple he will have a nice NP-Calc ready for it.
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:46.160]   Not just day one but he'll be showing off screenshots of it from the moment the
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:52.080]   announcement is made. He's just a developer's developer and he puts so much delight and whimsy
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:58.000]   into everything that he crafts. So because I don't have DICE and I didn't want to just order
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:02.240]   set of DICE because I'm trying to live a more minimalistic lifestyle. I've been using it on
[01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:07.680]   the iPhone and I was sketchy about it at first. I wasn't certain because I like the tactile feel
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:11.680]   of DICE and even when they fall off the table and go flying across the room and I run for them and
[01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:16.640]   that role doesn't count all of those things. But it works really well. It's got a very visceral feel.
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:22.320]   Like he uses the, I was going to call it a rumble pack like I'm playing a Sony game but he uses
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:27.280]   the Taptic Engine very well. Like the DICE fall, they don't go away so you never like have to
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:31.360]   reroll something. I forgot what I rolled before. You can roll percentages. The latest feature in
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:36.240]   the update he launched this week lets you do things like if you're generating ability scores,
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:40.400]   you can roll four DICE and automatically get rid of the lowest one. So you only have to deal with
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:44.720]   the numbers in front of you and you can keep them up there. So there's an historic record. If
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:49.200]   someone doesn't trust one of your roles or you forget what one of your roles is and I found it
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:53.040]   just to be like the perfect, it even goes to sleep. If you don't want to, if you want to leave the app
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:57.840]   open while you're playing it, it goes into like a snooze mode to reduce the power drain on it.
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:04.800]   It is so thoughtful and considerate and well executed and now that we still have to play,
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:10.240]   we're still not back to normal and we're still, especially in Quebec, we still have a curfew
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:15.760]   every night so you can't play games with friends and even if you could see them. So it's just been
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:20.080]   absolutely delightful to have these virtual, like you said before, like the virtual reality does
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:24.720]   exist in some ways in our phone just based on the quality of the experience. And I was reminded
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:30.400]   again this week, starting up playing again how absolutely fantastic the app was.
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:37.520]   Nice. Yes, P. Calc. So dice. Something simple, but it's so gorgeous just to watch it work.
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:42.880]   Yeah. So beautifully done. You can tell James doesn't do apps because he
[01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:48.480]   wants to make a living. I mean, he does it because he's fascinated. And as soon as Apple comes out
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:53.760]   with something new, he's immediately on it. He loves programming. He loves working on apps.
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:56:00.480]   He's so invested. He's so invested in everything that he does. I don't know what kind of award we
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:07.840]   give people who are just like one of the eternal souls of Apple development, but he is definitely
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:12.640]   one of those award games. I think it's what makes the Apple ecosystem so great, to be honest with you.
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:20.080]   Starting in 1984, the people who gravitated to it and fell in love with it and developed for it
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:25.200]   are a different breed. I mean, James is a perfect example of that. Absolutely.
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:32.560]   Yeah. I'm not every time that I get tempted away from, as you know, my phone is an Android phone.
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:40.160]   My tablet is iOS. But every time I switch between the two, there is absolutely no question about the
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:46.160]   level of creativity and craftsmanship and love that goes into iOS apps that doesn't, again,
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:50.560]   not throwing shade against Android. If I didn't love the apps that are available on Android,
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:55.920]   I wouldn't be using it. But God, there's nothing. There aren't as many developers like him doing
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:57:02.400]   stuff for Android as there are on iOS. That's saying something. iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Apple,
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:07.360]   watch, there's a sticker for I'm amazing. She's got it for everybody. Every platform.
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:09.520]   And the app. It's amazing. Yeah, and the menu too.
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:17.200]   My very first app that I wrote ever was the role, the role dies for non-player characters,
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:20.240]   because it was taking me a long time to build all these characters that were behind you.
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:26.320]   So I wrote it on my Apple 2E. So I'm his version is better. It's really what a computer was
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:31.200]   worn to do, actually. Renee, what came to you playing with these dice?
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:36.240]   Dungeons and Dragons, but the second edition advanced Dungeons and Dragons, because that's what
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:40.480]   me and Georgia and her husband are familiar with from our youth. We looked at the fifth edition one.
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:44.640]   It was just way too complicated for our tender brands. So you guys still got all the stuff in
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:50.400]   the second edition from advanced. I had it. I have boxes and boxes of it. And her husband is
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:56.640]   a huge Ravenloft fan. So he's the right answer. He had it. Yeah. I was driving around Petaluma the
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:02.480]   other day. There's a Warhammer store in town. Oh, I'm so jealous. What the like what?
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:08.560]   It's amazing. Like there's all these nerves like Steve Troughton Smith and Simon Clark,
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:12.320]   who does all the environmental videos. And then they stream painting Warhammer monitors on the
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:17.520]   weekend. And it's the most delightful thing. It must be a booming thing in Petaluma, because
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:22.240]   how else would you be able to sustain a store? There's also and you would love this.
[01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:26.000]   But you guys have to make a trip. There's a vintage gaming store where they sell,
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:33.280]   you know, Game Boys and stuff. It's incredible. And it's on the main drag down town. Have you ever
[01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:40.080]   been in there, Alex? It's the main drag down town. So the rent must be, you know, for Petaluma,
[01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:45.920]   at least 50 cents a square foot. And, you know, I don't know how they sustain themselves. They've
[01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:50.240]   survived through the pandemic when a lot of stuff has gone out of business in Petaluma.
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:57.360]   So really in truth, this should be your pick, Renee, because I don't know who David Dobrik is,
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:04.160]   but I know as a YouTuber, you must know Dobrik. He has millions and millions and billions.
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:06.240]   And he's been tick-tocking lately.
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:11.920]   Followers. Yeah. And apparently he had an app that he developed some time ago that is suddenly
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:21.840]   all the rage, top of the charts for photo apps. Now, here's the ad that he made for the app.
[01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:25.840]   I'm just going to play a little bit of, oh, I hope it launches. There it is.
[01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:34.720]   You don't know. I just want to show this because David is 24 years old.
[01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:41.520]   It's incredible. Like the YouTubers are like 22, 24. They're like millionaires off his
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:47.520]   kid videos. And he made this movie of himself as, you know, I would say in his 70s,
[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:54.400]   looking through old Polaroids from the good old days. And he's in tears. And it kind of explains
[01:59:55.120 --> 02:00:02.480]   what his app is all about. Dyspo got a big article in the New York Times. Look at that. Number four
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:10.160]   on the charts, just below Snapchat and right above Twitch on the Apple charts. Taylor Lawrence
[02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:16.320]   did a big article in the New York Times. So now it's all the rage. And of course, just like Clubhouse,
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:23.360]   just like all the hot apps, it's invite only. Thank you. I mentioned it in our staff meeting
[02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:27.600]   today. And Michael Sargent said, what that old thing I've had, I've added forever.
[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:31.200]   I said, well, you said, well, it's not as cool as Micah. Micah was like 800 times
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:36.160]   cooler than anyone. He said me and invites. So he did. The funny thing is I've taken a bunch
[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:40.800]   of pictures. It looks like a disposable camera. You get us little, you don't get a big frame. You
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:45.680]   don't get filters. You don't get editing. In fact, if you take a picture, which I'll do right now,
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:49.920]   I'll take a picture of you guys. You don't even get to see the dramatic. It's like getting
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:53.680]   automatic. And you don't get to see the pictures till 9am the next day.
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:01:00.240]   So I've taken all these pictures today on Twitter. I've taken 14 pictures on this role. You get
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:04.800]   different roles and they'll be developed. And I guess they'll then be public. You can share them.
[02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:10.800]   You can follow me at Leo LePort on Dyspo. You know about this? Anybody? Is anybody is this?
[02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:18.160]   It was nice to me. I'm sure you know, I see nice that like that. Oh, yeah. Remember that? Yeah.
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:23.280]   Which he's all one of you very authentic. And yeah. That's the idea is that in this, you know,
[02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:30.080]   age of, you know, highly refined Instagram images, he wanted to make something where you couldn't,
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:35.280]   you couldn't refine it. Remember the original Instagram, you would get like yelled at,
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:39.120]   castigated if you used like a professional camera was supposed to be for mobile. I know.
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:43.280]   I know. I know. People are building VR sets. I know. It would hear it.
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:52.160]   So yeah. So, Dyspo, of course, hot on clubhouse. Youtubers are sharing tips and growth hacks.
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:58.720]   It's kind of like Visco a little bit via CEO. There is apparently a bunch of Dyspo boys.
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:05.840]   Some photos have even hit the online art markets as NFTs. I mean, it's the ultimate NFT because
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:13.200]   you can only take it. You can't edit it. So I just wanted to mention it. You have to get
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:18.000]   an invite from somebody, maybe somebody like Michael Sargent who's, you know, been around for a long
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:24.240]   time. But I will, I will post my, my role, which is around, let's say today on Twitter is the name
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:28.400]   of this role. And then I have a LaPorts at home role that I'm going to start when I get home.
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:34.400]   I don't really understand it. I don't know what's going to happen at 9am tomorrow,
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:42.640]   but I'll fight out. Yeah. No caption. This is, this is exactly the plot of, of, of the hangover,
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:50.480]   you know, Yo, my God. Let's look at the pictures on your camera. I didn't even think of that. Oh, my
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:57.600]   God. This, this, Mr. Dobrik, as they call him in the New York Times has 69 million followers on
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:04.320]   YouTube's, but his photos on this bowl only have 420 likes. That sounds like an artificially low
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:10.160]   number somehow. Anyway, I would, I would go, I would go for a service that you, you don't get
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:14.560]   to see how many likes you get. You don't get to see, you don't get to add any captions or anything
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:19.120]   like that. Anything that helps you to monetize this or to use this to develop your social brand.
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:24.480]   Nope. What let you do this? Just, he got seed money in October from Alexis Hohaney and the
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:31.520]   founder of Reddit. And they just did a $20 million raise series A raise, valuing him at $200 million.
[02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:35.520]   This is the trend, isn't it? It's not even a public app. You can't,
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:40.560]   probably shouldn't even have mentioned it. But you might want to download it. You can request
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:50.400]   an invitation and be on waiting list D. I. S P O as in disposable. Wild. Let's hope we're not
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:56.800]   disposable. We are fungible, but not disposable. How about that? We're, we're fun. Fun. Put the
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:04:01.280]   fun back in fungible. That's what we do. Andy and I go, when are you going to be on the
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:06.400]   run back in, take the money out. Yeah. Grimes. We mentioned this before the show, but I didn't
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:12.480]   mention it in the show. Grimes, Elon Musk's baby mama. I don't know what I call her, but she's an
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:20.720]   indie rock star. Just 20 minutes, a little less than half an hour, 28 minutes, made $5.8 million
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:26.720]   selling NFT tokens for her artwork. $5.8 million.
[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:33.600]   I'm curious how many transactions got to $5.8 million, too. That's the interesting thing is that a lot
[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:38.160]   of these are very small amounts of money. No, no, she only had a few images.
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:48.560]   What image was for $300,000? A one image. Yeah. She sold 20, I sound like 28 images in 28,
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:53.760]   20 images in 28 minutes, something like that. It's great, great. That's real money, too, by the way.
[02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:59.680]   That's not Bitcoin. Yeah. I'm relieved and surprised in 2021. Anybody has that much money
[02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:02.960]   to spend on anything. Yeah, who's buying it? Yeah, somebody's got to spend some money.
[02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:08.320]   Andy, when are you going to be on GBH in Boston? That will not be fun. I'm going to be on
[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:14.080]   Thursday at one with my weekly high tech, Heidi Ho. Just go to wgbhnews.org to stream it either
[02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:18.880]   live or later on. Just search for my name. You can also see all my past high tech, Heidi Ho's.
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:22.640]   Now, unfortunately, they're not. I don't think that they label them. Andy not goes high tech,
[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:29.920]   Heidi Ho, but that's going to be my my fungible name for it. Andy's idea. Heidi, Heidi Ho.
[02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:37.600]   Hi, I do. Thank you, Andy. Renee, Richie, YouTube.com/Renee, Richie, anything coming up that we should
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:44.640]   know about here? I'm just I'm at 11 months now, Indi Leo. Good man. Was it been that long?
[02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:50.480]   That last month, it was April 1st. Not just joke. You're about to cross a quarter of a million
[02:05:50.480 --> 02:05:55.840]   subscribers. That's fantastic. I'm trying. I'm getting there. What I like is just the community
[02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:59.520]   that is building. A lot of those community are people from Macbreak, which I really appreciate,
[02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:04.560]   because it's so great just to see, they're so supportive. Everybody here is so supportive,
[02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:08.560]   and it's really nice to grow something new and something that's finally mine and not just owned
[02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:12.880]   by some faceless corporation. God bless you. You deserve it. Happy. You're the greatest.
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:18.080]   I didn't mention the one story, but because I think it's bogus, but maybe you have a take on it
[02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:26.080]   about Apple's M1 SSDs and the high rate levels. Is that cause of concern about them wearing out?
[02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:34.160]   I've been looking into it. M1 doesn't treat an SSD any differently than Intel does. Apple uses
[02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:39.280]   custom firmware. It has custom controllers, and it uses Top Shelf high-performance SSDs for
[02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:42.960]   everything. Everything I've checked, everyone I've checked with says there is absolutely no
[02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:48.320]   difference. Now there could be some unintended interaction on the software side. There could be
[02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:54.240]   the tools that are reporting it. It could not be optimized for M1, and it could be that some apps
[02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:58.160]   that have been ported over were not ported over very well. There's some evidence that it's
[02:06:58.160 --> 02:07:03.600]   Rosetta 2 apps that are causing the problem that might be an issue. They could be memory-leaking,
[02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:08.640]   but I think no one is going to have immediate SSD damage in a day or two, which is why I was
[02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:14.080]   not sure about the reporting because it was scaring a lot of people. Apple is absolutely
[02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:18.480]   looking into it because they see all of these. I also found that there hasn't been any large
[02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:25.680]   amount of complaints about it. It hasn't hit Apple's care centers at all. There's almost zero
[02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:29.200]   visibility there. It's one of those things that we're having real problems.
[02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:36.000]   I deal with things like this on the tech guy, the radio show all the time. People run monitoring
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:41.120]   utilities, and all of a sudden get freaked out. My CPUs at 100%.
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:48.480]   I think sometimes maybe it'd be better not to know. You're overreacting to information you
[02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:51.920]   probably shouldn't have in the first place, I guess. But I do know Apple's on it. So if there
[02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:55.360]   is anything, there's too many things to be immediate. I'm sure they would have said something right
[02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:58.880]   away if there was something immediate, but it sounds like it might be edge case, like you said,
[02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:04.240]   Rosetta, or M1 port memory leak issues that... Or it's just a reporting tool and they'll get updated.
[02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:09.600]   I'm going to guess. We should find out. I have a feeling if there is important news,
[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:14.480]   Renee will make a video. YouTube.com. Everyone who bought them has Apple care right now.
[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:16.800]   You have the first year of Apple care. All that stuff is covered.
[02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:21.120]   Well, and the reason people are concerned is it's in the chip. You can't open the thing
[02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:29.200]   and put a new SSD in it. That's why. Office hours begin early in the morning and continue
[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:30.480]   through late afternoon.
[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:38.000]   Depends on the... They only ran six hours today. Oh my god.
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:42.560]   It was really... It was easy going. We had such a deep... So we have a band now.
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:44.320]   Have a music band?
[02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:48.080]   Yeah, the remotes. So the remotes. I love it.
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:50.640]   So you can have a liquid license next month or two.
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:56.000]   It is. It's a bar where everybody knows your name. It's exactly what it is.
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:59.840]   It is so that. So the guys started getting together and they said,
[02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:05.760]   you know, there's enough musicians here. And the guys did a Christmas song. So to Grant,
[02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:13.200]   Grant Whitehead and Victor Cajeo did a Christmas song. And I was like, you know, we just do a band.
[02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:16.720]   And so then they did a band.
[02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:19.040]   You know what I want to see on office hours?
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:23.360]   How to do that live. How to get overcome latency issues.
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:29.360]   Do you think that I... So have a figure that we sing. So if you're in office hours and you're in our
[02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:34.400]   panel and it's your birthday, we actually sing to you. We sing happy birthday. It sounds
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:41.120]   awesome. Horrific. Horrible. But that's part of the... We've learned that that's the joy of it,
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:45.840]   is how bad it sounds. Like it's a brighter passage. Then you get to have one... Once a year,
[02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:49.600]   everyone's going to sing this horrible version of a happy birthday to you. We thought we were
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:56.160]   going to try to make it better, but we've decided just to embrace it. And so... But our last, I think
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:10:01.840]   our last victim was Hasmuk, who is in... He is in South Africa in Cape Town. So people all over the
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:06.320]   world singing that birthday to you over Zoom. Here is the... Horribly. Here is the remote
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:09.440]   plane. So these guys, no one has met each other.
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:17.840]   And Norway, you know, all over the U.S. But they're not doing this live, right? They're getting a
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:22.400]   click track or something. No. They each had a click track and they each recorded it. But I mean,
[02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:28.480]   like... So we're doing this weekend. Is that Victor on sax? He's good. Yeah. Victor rocks it.
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:37.280]   Yeah. I had no idea that Victor was echoed on sax. Oh yeah. And then Brian, who's there on the
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:42.880]   keyboards, he's the one that wrote the song. Wow. So he, you know, and... Chazzy. Yeah, it was
[02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:50.400]   really, really fun. And so, yeah. So the... This is their first song. And then the edit is done in
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:11:00.640]   final cut. It's all mixed in logic. But it's like, you know, crazy, you know, and then... Oh, it was
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:08.400]   colored and resolved. So that was a whole resolve pass that went to the video. And so the guys just
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:16.720]   crushed it. This is amazing. Alex has really created something completely unique and phenomenal
[02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:22.320]   with his office hours. And I... You're just doing it out of the love of it. It's got to be an immense
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:27.520]   amount of labor. But people love it now. There's Jeffrey Powers playing the drums. You create
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:31.920]   different musicals and different musicals. People will come into fillet. Yeah. You know, it's...
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:37.360]   I can't figure out either in the sense that it's never an effort. Like I get up in the morning,
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:40.560]   I'm just looking forward to hanging out with my... With my phone. It's buddies. I just like...
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:45.600]   It's like me in this show. It is. You know, I can vouch for that. If you get a great group of
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:49.360]   people... We have a smaller group, but if you get a great group of people together,
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:55.840]   getting together every week and talking or every day or twice a day, whatever you do or
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:12:01.280]   for hours. But you got to get like... Some days we have a band, but today we spent
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:09.600]   an hour talking about gain stage on mixers. And it was like people who are like hardcore
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:15.200]   audio engineers having these deep conversations about gain stage and digital versus on analog and
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:21.600]   where the pre-amp is and where the... It can get very, very technical. And this weekend...
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:25.440]   I think that's why we're doing it. It's not dumbed down. It's solid. It's not dumbed down.
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:31.200]   Sometimes it's lighter than other times, but it's always solid content. And it's always just...
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:35.520]   Because people can ask questions there that are like, "I don't understand how this USB interface
[02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:43.280]   works all the way up to HDR questions or... And so this weekend we're doing... Well, tomorrow
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:49.600]   we're talking about the future of what we call digital first events. And then... I'm sorry,
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:54.000]   tomorrow we're talking about Ray Maxwell's on tomorrow. He's talking about drones.
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:57.680]   You brought that Maxwell to us. Yeah, he's a professional drum pilot. He's amazing.
[02:12:57.680 --> 02:13:02.160]   Yeah. He's amazing. And then, but like on Saturday, we're actually... We have future
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:05.200]   of education, all these educators from all over the US are talking about...
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:07.600]   No, that's something you've always been interested in. That's great.
[02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:12.560]   And then we're teaching Resolve. So the guys from Ripple Training are doing an hour of resolve.
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:19.440]   And then... Wow. And then 10 to one o'clock where the remotes are going to break everything down.
[02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:22.880]   So here's how we did the records. Here's what the click tracks were. Here's what the mix was
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:26.800]   in the logic. Here's how it was edited and final cut. Here's how it was colored and resolved.
[02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:30.880]   And all of those bits and pieces and what it took and how it was put up on Frame.io and all those
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:35.520]   things that are there are all getting covered. And so that's... So Saturday, I think, is like
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:40.480]   the early days, like eight hours of doing it. It's going to be grand.
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:45.360]   So you might think, "Oh, I just go to the YouTube channel and watch No,
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:50.960]   because they only record One-R to One-R to two hours. The YouTube is like the light version for
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:54.720]   people to get to know whether they like it or not. But you will find if you pick a show
[02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:59.280]   and you scroll down, you will find a link. Oh, wait a minute. There's no link on this.
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:02.880]   Oh, that one might not have been updated yet. But there's a little link to the Zoom
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:07.440]   so you can register. And if you go into the Zoom, you can watch...
[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:11.920]   Ask questions. Kind of like Clubhouse. You can be invited up on stage two, right?
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:16.240]   Yeah. It's basically you invented Clubhouse before Clubhouse.
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:20.240]   Someone would probably listen to this and go, "Hey, you do this." All you need is audio for this.
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:23.600]   But Ben, at least you told me the other day she was listening to it on Clubhouse. So are you
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:30.000]   doing Clubhouse all the time? So, yeah. So we're... We've been doing some tests of
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:35.120]   doing... Just dreaming to Clubhouse every day, and then, which we'll probably start doing this
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:41.920]   month. And then on Wednesday nights, at seven o'clock, we actually do a Clubhouse version of
[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:48.080]   Office Hours. So we just a bunch of us get together and do it. And of course, my Clubhouse rig is a
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:52.800]   little different because I have... You showed us. I have a week. Yeah. Bluetooth Adante, yes.
[02:14:52.800 --> 02:15:01.360]   Yeah. Yeah. Alex will be on Twitter on Sunday. Yes. You were all upset about a Stanford
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:06.240]   University press release about Zuri's fatigue. We're going to talk about that. And you say it's BS.
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:10.960]   So Alex will debunk. We're going to talk about what makes...
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:16.320]   We're going to talk about like how... Number one is all the problems with that article, which were
[02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:21.440]   Legion. And then we'll talk about what actually makes a difference. Good.
[02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:27.760]   That will be this Sunday for the big show this week in tech. We will be back here next Tuesday
[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:34.480]   for another gripping edition of Mac Break Weekly for all the Apple fans out there. We do it 11 a.m.
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:41.360]   Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time. That is, I think, 1800 UTC. The only reason I mentioned the time is
[02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:45.360]   because there is a live stream you can watch. It's not like Office Hours or anything, but you can
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:52.720]   watch the live stream at twit.tv/live. We haven't figured out that part where there's hundreds of
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:56.720]   people asking questions. Although that might be fun. We tried that in the early days. You had a
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:01.760]   platform. We tried that in the early days. I don't know. This is the fourth... So we have a...
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:06.480]   You could use it if you want our version, but the fourth version of what we started, what we tried
[02:16:06.480 --> 02:16:12.000]   12 years ago or 12 years ago is... So the fourth edition is what we use in Office Hours. So you
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.000]   actually don't ask questions inside of Zoom. You ask it inside of Macano, which is... Okay.
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:21.120]   So that's still around. Maybe we could have docked it once a month. It's much nicer. You could
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:25.920]   help us do an Office Hours Mac Break Weekly maybe. That'd be kind of fun. Yeah. That'd be a lot of fun.
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:30.320]   Watch live at twit.tv/live. If you're watching live, we do have interactivity. We've got a live
[02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:37.440]   chat. We haven't had that for 20 years. IRC.twit.tv. It's community run. We'd love to have you in
[02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:41.840]   there. If you want to visit our forum, which you can visit anytime of the day or night,
[02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:48.800]   it's for people who don't watch live. That's twit.community. Our Mastodon instance is twit.social. So you can
[02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:57.760]   do microblogging, tweet style there. Mastodon is a federated system that we are one of many,
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:02.640]   many, many servers at twit.social. It's a lot of fun I go in there all the time. We're almost up to
[02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:08.480]   1,000 users now in Mastodon, which is pretty cool for our particular instance. On-demand versions of
[02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:14.240]   the show available at twit.tv/mbw. As with everything we do, we put it up on the website. But you can
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:20.240]   also get it on YouTube. There's a YouTube channel dedicated to Mac Break Weekly, or you can subscribe
[02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:25.040]   in your favorite podcast client. That way you'll get it automatically the minute it's available
[02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:30.320]   of a Tuesday evening. Thank you, everybody, for being here. Now it's time to get back to work,
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:33.840]   because Office Hours is about to begin. See you later. Bye-bye.
[02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:41.120]   Hey folks, I'm Ant Prud, host of Hands of Photography here on Twit.tv. I know some of you have gotten
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:46.160]   yourself a brand new camera, or you just had a camera sitting around and can't quite figure out
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:53.200]   how to get the most out of it. Well, I have a solution. My show hands on photography. So subscribe
[02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:56.960]   right now to learn how to get the most out of that camera. I'm going to show you how to make
[02:17:56.960 --> 02:18:02.880]   those images pop. I don't care if it's a Canon camera. I don't care if it's a Sony, Nikon,
[02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:08.960]   iPhone, Android, or even an inexpensive Android device. I got you covered. So head on over to
