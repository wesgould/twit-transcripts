[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.400]   The Mac Break Weekly stalwarts Andy and not co-from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.400]   Beautiful view.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:11.400]   And I think that's what I'm talking about.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:32.400]   I'm so glad you're here.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:41.400]   And a special visitor for Episode 500, a visitor from the east, the far east from Finland.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   We have an OZO on this set.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.400]   Yeah, it's the, you know, we're looking at the next 500 episodes.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.400]   And this might be hopefully part of it.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.400]   This is the new Nokia OZO.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.400]   We're testing it right now.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.400]   Now, wait a minute.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.400]   Now, this is a VR 360 degree VR camera.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   As I remember cost $60,000?
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   Yes.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   And how many cameras?
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.400]   One Tesla.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.400]   Well, we already figured out, I think it's what is it, 150 galaxies.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.400]   But I think it's only 85 galaxies.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.400]   I think it's not quite 100 GCL.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.400]   It's a well under two digits.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   Exactly.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.400]   Exactly.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   So how many cameras are that thing?
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.400]   Tell us a little bit about it.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.400]   So there's eight cameras.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   And what they're doing is that they actually, you'll notice that the cameras, you're getting kind of the back of it from the back of it from the back of it.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.400]   But the cameras are about the same distance between each other as your eyes.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   So it's able to use that to help build, you know, a stereo pair.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.400]   Now you can either do it in what we would call mono or stereo, depending on how you grab and how you stitch it.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   And so it, what's nice about it is this is the first one that's kind of simple and straightforward to use.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   I mean, I know it's expensive, but the big thing for us is that it is, you know, when you think about production, it just works.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   You've got a single SDI feed out the back of it that carries all the data.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.400]   And it gives it, it's their own proprietary encoding.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.400]   So it comes out of that and it just looks like.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   So I'm looking on the screen on the Nokia site and it looks like eight fisheye images.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.400]   And those will then be stitched together by, is there, is there, they have their own software, I presume?
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.400]   Yes, yes.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.400]   Well, they have that.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   And you can also use these can be exported out as individual feeds.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   Oh, there's our feed.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   Yeah, there's our feed.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   And that's what it looks like when you're shooting.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.400]   No, I don't, if you're looking, if you're watching this video on the OZO and you're seeing that, you're really confused at this point.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.400]   So if you're watching on the OZO, you can actually, and we're going to post this.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.400]   We're going to post this, but you can actually look around, you can look behind you, see our studio audience, all two of them.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.400]   You can see Jason, our technical director in the back waving.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.400]   You can pick your nose.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   No, you are never on camera.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.400]   Everybody's on camera.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.400]   Everybody is.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.400]   And this is spectacular.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.400]   I mean, this is my dream is to have this in the studio.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.400]   You can't stream live with it yet.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.400]   Not yet.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:17.400]   Because of the horsepower to stitch it, which you tell me is currently takes four hours to do one minute.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.400]   Now, the thing is, is that we're doing a lot of post processing that makes it a lot better than even live will be.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.400]   So what's the fun stream live now?
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.400]   Is it HD quality for the final?
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.400]   It'll actually be 4K.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.400]   4K.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.400]   Yeah, because the problem is, you have to remember that when you look in your goggles, you're looking at only a small piece of a big sphere.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.400]   So if it's less than 4K, it gets pretty soft.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.400]   Now, when you're previewing it, like right now, if someone put on the goggles over there, we've got the DK2 over there.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.400]   And if you put those goggles on, you can actually watch it live.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.400]   Oh, so you can't stream that live.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   And what it's doing is actually switching between the cameras really, really carefully so that you might see it pop every once in a while.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.400]   That gives you a raw feed.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.400]   So you can look at the raw feed, and that's good for previewing and so on and so forth.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   And the live feed is, you know, is stitching.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.400]   Now, the other cool thing is it's got lots of little mics on it.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.400]   So it's actually able to do 5.1 surround sound.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:12.400]   See, this is a huge part of it that I think we're a little bit missing in the current generation of VR gear is that you don't have that amazing sound.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.400]   Right.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.400]   The sound should match the image.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.400]   And this is built for that.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.400]   So you see those little mics there?
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400]   How would you view that?
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   I mean, people can watch this, you know, on a 2D screen on YouTube, some of you are doing that.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.400]   Or with cardboard, and then you can look around, or a gear VR.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.400]   If you had an Oculus Rift, you'd have stereo sound, but you couldn't.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.400]   But you wouldn't have like my head turns and I'll hear what's over.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.400]   I wouldn't shift with my head.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.400]   Not saying.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.400]   But a lot of people are working on that.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:49.400]   So knowing where that is and knowing where that sound is is something that's kind of future proofing because this is like state of the art.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.400]   And the art's not there.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.400]   And the viewing art.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.400]   This is like you when you shut a 1080p.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.400]   I know.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.400]   The first 1080p podcast.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.400]   I had to be, I had to get out on that front edge.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.400]   And so that's what we've done for 15 years.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.400]   And so, yeah.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.400]   And we build our own rigs.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.400]   So we've got, you know, we've got Go Pro rigs.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.400]   We've got Blackmagic rigs.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.400]   You could Gef tape it and you know, eight GoPros together.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.400]   Exactly.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.400]   But the problem really gets into is when you actually want to do production with it.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.400]   So I actually want to do this regularly.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.400]   I want to be able to go to a set and just have it work.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.400]   You know, this is the kind of camera you're looking for when you just want to go there and have it work.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.400]   And I think that, you know, that's the kind of thing that we're trying to solve.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.400]   And so we're testing it right now.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.400]   And we've only had it for a couple days.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.400]   But we're pretty excited about it.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.400]   This is really, thank you so much for bringing this along.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.400]   We're going to, so those, if you want to see the output of this, we'll put it up on YouTube
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.400]   and you'll be able to download it from our feed.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.400]   If you have a gear VR, you can watch it that way or put it on your phone when you use Google Cardboard.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.400]   But the easiest would be probably right on the Twit specials feed.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   We'll put it on YouTube.com/Twit and YouTube.com/Twit Specials.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   And you can watch it there.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.400]   This will be a special kind of two minute version because...
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.400]   Well, let's see.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.400]   We're six minutes in.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.400]   So this is going to take a day just to render.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.400]   Currently.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.400]   In the current technology.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.400]   But that's how 1080p works out.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:19.400]   We, it took us three months to get the first 1080p, or two months to put the first 1080p.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.400]   I had to release a whole episode of the Rode 1080p just to stall.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.400]   I know.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.400]   So because I didn't have anything else to put out.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.400]   And so, you know, this is the way it always begins.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.400]   Well, thank you so much for letting us sample this.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:37.400]   You can, well, great way to celebrate our first 500 episodes of Mac Break Weekly and look ahead to the next 500.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.400]   So, thank you.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.400]   And so you can cut there and we'll make that into a little mini thing.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.400]   And then if you want to talk more about it on your pick, you can.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.400]   Like availability and stuff like that.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.400]   Wow.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.400]   We have a preview of our comment.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.400]   We're going to be making a show, 1000s.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.400]   And to think that today we can do that on our phones.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.400]   Well, look how happy.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.400]   Look how fast this happens.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.400]   I mean, how long ago was the first Mac Break 10 years ago, I guess?
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.400]   And you had a Lucas, the camera that Lucas used as a model camera.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.400]   Well, it was, yeah, it was, it was used for a lot of the green screen and everything else.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.400]   We had a couple of those cameras.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.400]   So these were the, these were the, the, the, the F nine fifties.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.400]   F nine fifties.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.400]   That's what episode three was shot in the F nine fifties, wasn't it?
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.400]   And so we had, and we had those cameras actually that were used in episode three.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.400]   And so it's still, it's still working.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.400]   You know that, that was still, you made a podcast that you could bear, you could barely edit.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.400]   And no one could watch because I remember on computers of that day, you couldn't watch
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.400]   it smoothly.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.400]   Right.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.400]   I mean, this you, so that's, we've done it again.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.400]   You've done it again.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.400]   It's my job.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.400]   Thank you.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.400]   That's so cool.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.720]   Those city else's were okay.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.200]   So that was 10 years ago.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.200]   And those city altas were more expensive.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.400]   And fine was about, and I bought them used.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.200]   So knew they were about a quarter million dollars each.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.600]   So four times more expensive.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.240]   And the workflow didn't take more than a few years to get to the point where it was trivial
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.240]   to do 1080p workflow.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.240]   It took us about six months.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.640]   You know, like before we got it, we got it working.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.240]   I mean, it was, I mean, other people, I mean, but we had to build, we had huge raids and now
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.840]   this little, little, little Drobo that you have there is faster.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.560]   I mean, I could, I could actually edit off of it.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.520]   I could capture to that, you know, and that's the point.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.640]   This stuff is coming along very, it's more, it's accelerating.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.000]   It's not even, you can't even say it's going to be as fast as that was.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   It will be much faster.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Because it's just all exciting.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.040]   Well, and, and, and the other thing is this is the technology is about to explode.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.440]   I mean, people are spending so much money.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.000]   Like this is great right now.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.480]   We go to NAB in a couple of weeks.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.520]   There's going to be a whole bunch of new toys, a whole bunch of new software.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.200]   Everyone's talking about it right now.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.320]   So we'll be broadcasting live from NAB, by the way.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.400]   We're going to be in the U stream, the live U booth.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.160]   I'll be there one day, but the rest of the team will be there all week and we'll definitely
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.160]   be covering VR.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.160]   VR is the next, we're getting our Oculus Rift this week.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.640]   We're going to be putting, we're going to, we're going to be turning on the ultimate VR
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.880]   gaming machine, the $5,000 computer we built.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.080]   You know, you saw it, I don't know if you saw Palmer Lucky flew to Alaska to deliver the
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.080]   first Oculus Rift.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.960]   The guy didn't even have a computer he could plug it into.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:18.480]   Because only 18% of all the Windows machines in the world are powerful enough today to run
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.720]   that thing.
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.440]   So this is what happens.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.880]   This is, you get on the cutting edge.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.800]   But I'm really glad that we could put out at least that four minute video so people could
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.000]   get an experience of what, you know, in a few years.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.680]   And I'd love to hear feedback.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.800]   Is this one version of the show that we, or all the shows that we should put out?
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.840]   As we're designing the new studio, we're being very cognizant of the fact that it'll be eventually
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.680]   360 space.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.880]   So we know where we will put the Oso.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.160]   We know how we will use it.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.480]   So we're, you know, what you're already thinking about that as you build.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.480]   Serious, serious question.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.800]   Are you actually considering considering that you're, we want to make this new studio as
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.320]   forward thinking as possible?
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.440]   Are you actually contemplating having actual blinds in there?
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.400]   Like a place where there's no camera that can possibly hit this section of the set.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.840]   And to the extent of even putting up walls that go from floor to ceiling.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.520]   The set will be partly for that reason fully enclosed.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.600]   Unlike this set, I always like the idea of having an open set.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.480]   The rest of the staff hates it.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.200]   So they can't make noise.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.160]   They think I don't care if they make noise, but others might.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.080]   And so they have to walk around tiptoes and stuff.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.720]   And so the open set idea really didn't work.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:32.520]   So what we're doing this time is we're built where it's an enclosed set with, with all
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.360]   of these sets in it.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.800]   In fact, if you go downstairs in the basement, you can see we've marked it out on the basement.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.000]   And it's as spacious as this, but it is enclosed.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.760]   Once you're in that space, though, Andy, there's nowhere private.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:52.640]   I guess you could crawl down underneath the TD desk and you could be okay.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.840]   You can hide behind it.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.520]   You can put a raised floor that people can crawl under that have little things that pop
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.520]   up.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.360]   So they can just crawl up under the table like a little gopher.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.680]   So the codename for this space is going to be North Korea.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.600]   There is no place under which you are not under surveillance.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.320]   Or the Panopticon, maybe we'll call it.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:14.120]   Colleen Henry, our first engineer, wanted to build a UV hat that would have invisible,
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.440]   very bright ultraviolet light that would blind cameras.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.320]   So you could walk, you could put the hat on and walk into the studio and you just look
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.680]   like a ball of light.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.680]   Maybe we'll do that.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.680]   Colleen's kind of like a ball of light.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.960]   I don't think she barely needs the LEDs.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.880]   There's so much energy in it.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.480]   I send people over and everyone's going to work with or run some stuff and then they
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.280]   come back and they're like, "Oh, I'm a headache."
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.280]   I'm trying to keep up.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.280]   She's so great.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:50.360]   Anyway, I saw, I watched the other night, I watched a movie, Keanu Reeves of the host
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.120]   but it wasn't written by him.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:56.640]   In interviews, all these directors came out in 2012 about the conversion from film to
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.240]   digital, which was called side by side.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.320]   Highly recommended, even though it's out of date because it's four years old now.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.400]   At that time, they're saying, "Finch David Fincher is saying things like, 'You know,
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.960]   it's not too long before most movies are going to be shot all in digital.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.680]   Last year, about a hundred films were shot on film.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.680]   The rest were shot."
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:22.680]   Well, they had to actually, last year, the studios had to dump money to keep the film
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.680]   being made.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.680]   Kodak was like, "Okay, we're done."
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.040]   It doesn't financially make any sense anymore.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.160]   So the film, they were a handful of people and companies that still wanted to shoot on
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:37.480]   film and they put off the inevitable, which is that they're going to keep film for a
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.480]   little while longer.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.160]   But distribution is gone.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:48.200]   The theaters now don't really want to have, and distribution makes way more sense because
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.080]   now what happens is every play is being able to be managed.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.400]   So you speak film, you don't know how many times the theaters are on it.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.400]   Well, they would say that.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.400]   They say, "Now they know they have a counter."
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.400]   They know exactly.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.240]   George Lucas is interviewing, and he said, "You know, we'd make the movie and we'd
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.480]   know what it looked like in our offices, but we'd know that it would look different in
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.280]   every single theater and it would get worse over time."
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.080]   Well, and you can't control how bright the projectionist is, you know, what the lamp
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.080]   is, any of that's.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.840]   Well, on the penny, and the penny-pincher is what they want to know is how many times
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.840]   was it played?
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.640]   So do they add the small theater with film?
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.120]   They could add two or three more showings a day and make a little extra money without
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.040]   reporting it, whereas the--
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.040]   Digital, you know.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.120]   For the digital, every time you play it because the theater doesn't own the projector.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.160]   And the distribution of the projector.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.160]   Well, the cost of putting film, not just printing it, but putting it on a truck and shipping
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.160]   it.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.160]   $1,500 a reel.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.120]   So you're talking about like Harry Potter costs about $7 or $8 million just to put it
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.280]   in the theaters on the first one.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.200]   And now it's just, you know, it's a drive.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.920]   James Cameron's talking about Titanic.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.440]   He says, "We didn't expect it, but that movie lasted in theaters so long that the film was
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.640]   literally falling apart on the projector."
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:59.080]   Well, and then the other thing that you could get away with in the early years, you know,
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.120]   early days was the-- or in film days was that you could be out of focus.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:07.840]   You know, focusing in all fairness, focus pulling or keeping the camera in focus is
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.720]   so hard that you really have specialists to do this.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:16.760]   And even then, people are moving, the camera's moving, all these other things.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.040]   Generally when you're watching something in the theater, you were watching the fourth
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.520]   or fifth generation of the film.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.200]   You know, they have the master, then they make-- they cut a couple of masters, then they
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.680]   cut a couple more, and then-- because otherwise you don't want to use up your master running
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.360]   it over and over again to build these films.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:36.120]   And so anyway, you're looking at third, fourth, fifth generation that's going to the theaters,
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.600]   and it softens every single time.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.320]   So when you're-- we were kind of used to watching things that are kind of-- even if it was out
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.320]   of focus, it looked fine.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.040]   Like, just everything looked a little soft.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:48.800]   And now, when things are out of focus, whether you're watching at home on your 70-inch TV
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.240]   or on the film, you can really tell that, oh, they were a little off there.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.200]   They got the ears and not the nose, and they got the-- you know, whatever it was, you know,
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.960]   those things all become much more difficult.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.000]   It was going to be my pick, but I'll find something else.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.040]   It was a really interesting movie, as dated as it was.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.120]   For instance, they're talking a fincher about the social network, which is shot on
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.120]   reds.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.320]   I think it was the first movie on red epic.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.800]   And I mean, they talk about the development of the red, because I guess Panavision had
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:24.240]   done a digital camera that they were so tied to the past that they actually had a film
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.240]   magazine with the memory in it that they would put on the digital camera.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.640]   And you couldn't play it back from the film magazine.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.360]   They said, no, no, that's the digital negative.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.640]   You can't touch-- you can't do dailies with that.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.640]   Sorry.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.200]   So it was a flop, but then along comes red, and they're-- you know, they say, well, we're
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.560]   not going to try to make it look like a Panavision camera.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.320]   And they changed the price dramatically.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.320]   And--
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.280]   So Fincher's saying, we had to figure out a way to get this epic on these little tiny
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:59.400]   crew boats on rowing down the Harvard rowing team with the Winkle-Vie twins on it.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.920]   And it was so heavy that it would tip the boat.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:07.000]   So they went back to red, and they said, what can you do?
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.640]   And red said, OK, we'll get back to you.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.600]   Two days later, I said, yeah, so we figured out carbon fiber, we bored out the inside.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.600]   Oh, great.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.160]   When you get it, well, I've got one on my desk right now.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.160]   We'll have it out for you.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.720]   And they made it like 12 pounds so that they could put it on the boat.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.320]   It's a complete revolution.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:27.120]   And Andy, I know you recommended a really wonderful book about Hollywood, where they
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.840]   talked about how the film changed in the '70s, because these cameras went from being so
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:37.120]   big you had to shoot in a studio to small enough that you could shoot on location in
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.040]   movies like Bonnie and Clyde and McCabe and Mrs. Miller happened because you could go
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.760]   into the location and shoot.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.240]   And this is an equivalent revolution, you know?
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.240]   It's an amazing--
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.040]   Yeah, the Easy Riders Raging Bulls, I think.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.600]   That was a great book, by the way.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.160]   Yeah, it's because it's not as though these were the only movies that in the '70s, the
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.680]   only movies that were ever shot that way.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.160]   But there's a reason why in "Saturday Night Fever," you have this shot that follows John
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.720]   Travolta off of a street in Brooklyn into a paint store.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.400]   And you can actually see the ceiling of the paint store.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.240]   That's because just 10 years earlier, the only way to get that shot would have been
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.640]   to build a set off of an actual street that was rigged for lighting.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.400]   We're asking you to simply take a camera, put a guy in a shopping cart even, and just
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.400]   roll them for one place.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.640]   The French connection is another great example of that.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:26.160]   So the technology really informs what-- it suddenly makes things possible that were once
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.160]   only imaginary.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:32.600]   Point-- and you look at the-- like a black magic micro studio camera, you know, is 4K,
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.240]   micro four thirds, $1,200, $1,300.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:42.280]   And you know, we buy them like little chiclets because you can make VR rigs, you can put
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:46.520]   them up over top of things, and you can shade them from the switcher.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.520]   So the whole thing is, is our ability to control everything, and it changes.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.520]   You've got to watch everything.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.320]   They talk about color timing, and it's called color timing because it was originally how
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:57.280]   long you left the negatives in the developing bath.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:02.280]   And so it was literally time, and how it's just-- it's a fascinating movie.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.160]   I'll find another pick for the end of the show, but side by side, it's 99 cents right
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.480]   now on Amazon, so it's an inexpensive rental.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:15.280]   And you know, Keanu Reeves is the only negative, but he does interview the watchowscales,
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.520]   which is great because they have a rapport, of course, because they were did the matrix
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.520]   together.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.520]   And they're fascinating.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.520]   They're all, you know, digital.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.240]   You really see this divide.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.760]   You have Vittorio Sitaro, Sitaro, whatever his name is, the cinematographer, the godfather
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:32.680]   on the one side, and then these new young guys like Fincher and the Wachowski's on the other
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.200]   side, and there's really a golf, there's a divide.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.440]   >> He couldn't turn, do you know what I guess he said?
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.640]   He's going to stop making films because if he can't have film.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.640]   >> He wants film.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.640]   >> He's like, but look at hateful aid.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.640]   It's a painting.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.640]   >> Right.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:48.080]   >> I did the other day I got the Blu-ray of Barry and Lyndon because I had read Roger
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.040]   Ebert's pain to it.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.000]   And he talks about how a coup, and I think it was a terrible movie when it came out.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.360]   I thought it was a horrible movie.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:07.280]   It was boring, but I know, I know I was a complete, you know, idiot, but so once I read
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.320]   Ebert's review, I said, oh, I have to rethink this movie.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:16.080]   He said every frame is an 18th century painting, and it really is true.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.160]   It's truly a gorgeous.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.520]   >> It just goes show there's nothing that's inherently superior about any medium.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:26.720]   You just have some filmmakers that their thinking is so locked into 70 millimeter that they
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.880]   can not only can't they think really in terms of doing it in any other way, but they are
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:36.520]   uniquely well positioned to make a movie that can't possibly be shot any other way.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:43.240]   And then you have the Bucharski sisters that are so digitally minded that they can't,
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.760]   you feel as though it would be limiting for them to shoot in anything other than digital
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.040]   or anything that's in any way practical.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.880]   >> That's the word I was looking for.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.640]   Punter show in the chat room said, Philistine.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.400]   >> Yes, that's what I was.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:01.200]   >> And someday I'll look back at my digs at Keanu Reeves and I'll go, what was I thinking?
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.200]   The greatest actor of our time?
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.200]   >> Of our century.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:11.120]   >> But Barry Linden is one of the reasons it was bad at the time is because of Ryan O'Neill,
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.280]   who was a terrific actor.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:21.040]   But as Ebert points out, perfect because he's this bland, kind of the banality of evil.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.520]   He's just this kind of bland creep.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.960]   So now I appreciate it.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.480]   And I watched it.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:32.280]   But I watched last night, I watched Death and Venice, another similar movie from 1971.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.840]   It's paintings.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:39.080]   And so I almost realized that when you're a filmmaker and a cinematographer and you're
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.000]   using film, it's almost like what we do as photographers.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.880]   You're really thinking about--
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.080]   >> When it's done well.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.080]   >> The film of it.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.880]   >> And there's a lot of films that you watch that just look like they're assembled.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:55.520]   They said this right story, they had the right close-ups they had.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:01.960]   And then there's ones that are amazingly made with great editing and all those things that
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.960]   pull it together.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.400]   And I'll make things to do if you-- and I will end this week in film in a second.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:13.200]   But one of the great things to do is turn off the audio and just watch films because that
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.720]   is the way that you see how it goes.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.240]   You can't do it if the audio is on because you just-- you can't get not get caught into
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.880]   it but take a great film or film that you like a lot.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.440]   And I used to do this for every film.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:28.280]   I'd watch it once and then I'd watch it again when I like cutting everything up and trying
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.280]   to observe things.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.880]   And then I'd watch it silently.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.080]   And then oftentimes I'd watch it, I'd listen to it.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.200]   And those are kind of the ways I'd feel like through a film that I liked.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.360]   I didn't do that with every film.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.520]   Every film that I thought was a good film because you learn a lot in each one of those
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.640]   things what the sound design was like or what the framing was like.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.640]   But you should watch it.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.640]   >> You should watch death and Venice.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.000]   You know, it's funny, it's just very little dialogue.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.160]   And so you almost are watching it with the sound off.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.960]   It's just all natural sound.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.960]   And it's very slow.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:00.160]   It's a movie you wouldn't-- you couldn't probably make today.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.240]   But Visconti really had that same vision.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.920]   And of course it's Venice.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.320]   So it really is a painting.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.720]   The whole thing is a painting.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.840]   All right, I don't mind talking about this stuff.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:12.840]   This is great.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.840]   This is part of the creative process.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.480]   And after all, if you're into Macintosh--
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.720]   >> It's all done on a Mac.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.720]   >> You're creative.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.720]   It's all done on a Mac.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.720]   >> A lot of it's done on Mac.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.720]   >> We'll take a break, come back.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.000]   We do have some things to say.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.800]   Renee Richie was at the event.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.800]   Was it this week?
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.240]   Was it just a week ago?
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.240]   >> Yep.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.240]   >> Hard to believe.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.240]   >> So fast.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.400]   >> So we haven't yet-- I don't think we got-- I guess no we did from Clayton last week.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.400]   We got kind of a hands-on.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.640]   But I'd love to hear what your hands-on is.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:43.120]   Tomorrow or day after tomorrow, the new iPads arrive.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.120]   And it looks like Renee might have a little tiny phone in his hand.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.640]   He's there, you have massive mitts.
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.040]   >> He's breaking a cargo.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.080]   He doesn't care anymore.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.520]   >> When did the embargo lift?
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.520]   >> Same day.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.760]   I mean, they didn't have one this time.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.680]   Yeah, I was so nervous.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.680]   >> Wow.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.040]   >> Well, we'll talk about that in just a second.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.040]   There's a line to talk about.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.280]   >> And you know, we could talk about movies too.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.280]   >> Excellent.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.400]   Everybody in this room is in the movies.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.880]   If we haven't lost them by episode 500, we're--
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.880]   >> [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.880]   >> Let's shake them off.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:16.320]   >> We're spending all the goodwill we have left.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:21.040]   We do what it says on the side of the box, which is nothing.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.280]   It's a show about nothing.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.520]   >> We're taking a break.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.960]   We're breaking from the Mac.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.360]   We're going to actually take a little break to talk about the Drobo, which is a very
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.360]   Mac-ish device.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.080]   I remember when the first Drobo's came out.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.960]   And they were a sponsor of Mac break when they first came out.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.960]   I believe.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.960]   >> Yup, absolutely.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.720]   >> And I remember Scott Bourn bought like 800 of them.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.320]   And there's a little Drobo house.
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.320]   >> Yes.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.320]   >> Drobo fast.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.760]   >> They've come a long way, baby.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.480]   I love the new Drobo's.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.560]   This is the Drobo mini.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.600]   I really, really like this.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.600]   This is mine.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.920]   So don't get any ideas, Lindsay.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.920]   >> I bought one myself.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.960]   It's a really good idea because it's small, which means it's portable.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:07.040]   So if you are recording massive amounts of video from an OZO camera or you are a videographer,
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:13.080]   photographer, and you're traveling and you want to have redundant backup, this is a
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.920]   great solution.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:21.800]   On the back of the Drobo mini, you'll see it has two Thunderbolt ports, a USB 3 port.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.480]   And I love the locking connector.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.880]   I mean, this is the opposite of MagSafe.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.360]   You can't get it out.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.480]   If you stumble on this wire, that's drobo for data.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.480]   >> MagSafe's secure for data.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.480]   >> Yeah.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.360]   Well, you don't want it to fall out, right?
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.360]   >> Exactly.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.400]   >> As with all Drobo's, the magnetic panel has lights that tells you what's going on inside
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.920]   the Drobo, but can also be removed.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:47.760]   And the Drobo can be updated while in operation.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.360]   All of these drives are hot, swappable.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.360]   I'll prove it.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.360]   I'll pull it out right now.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.800]   I think it's okay to do that.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:53.800]   >> No, don't do it.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.640]   >> Not during a write, maybe.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.600]   But what's nice is what happens if you fill up the capacity of any drive, and the thing
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.360]   that Drobo does, it's called beyond RAID.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:07.560]   Normally, if you have a RAID 5 enclosure, the smallest drive in the enclosure determines
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.360]   the size of all the drives.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:15.240]   If you have five or six drives, then they're all five terabytes, but one's one terabyte,
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.160]   they all show up as one terabyte drives.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.960]   Not with a Drobo, it's additive.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.000]   You can mix and match, which is really great because it means you can take whatever drives
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.640]   you've got and throw them in.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:30.200]   When a drive gets full or the capacity of Drobo, of course, is the total of all of those,
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.640]   minus some percentage for redundancy.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.920]   But when it starts to fill up any individual drive, a light goes off, and you just pop it
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:41.600]   out and you put in a new one, it rebuilds, and you're using it the whole time.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.840]   It's good to go the whole time.
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.120]   So and this one has a really nice feature.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.440]   I won't pop this out, but I will show you.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.200]   You can also add, and this is optional.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:58.000]   You don't have to add it, but it has a MSATA SSD slot for acceleration.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.800]   So we've put an SSD in here, and that really speeds up copies of small files, reads of
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:03.800]   small files.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:10.280]   So really useful if you use Lightroom or Apple Photos and you're transferring a lot of small
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.280]   files around.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.920]   This is a real speed up.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.080]   Now that's the Drobo Mini.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:20.040]   This is a direct connect drive, perfect for traveling, but there's also the 5N, which
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.920]   is their network attached storage.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.640]   You can use that as a media server, a file server, a backup solution.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.400]   You just plug into your router.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:31.240]   And I have the 5N at home, and then my travel one is this little one.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.240]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:38.080]   I mean, a lot of people we know are all in on Drobo.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.320]   The apps let you back up data to two different cloud service providers.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.760]   So or you can use BitTorrent Sync or a mix of the above.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.640]   It also works well with Plex and the new Apple TV.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.760]   That's the Drobo, and there's the 5D with five drives up to 40 terabytes.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.000]   They just released the B810i.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   This is an ISCSI SAN, eight bays, that means up to 64 terabytes.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   And Dataware tiering offers storage capabilities usually found in much more expensive enterprise
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.600]   solutions, believe me.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.480]   I wish they'd had this when we bought our SAN.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.880]   You can use it for collaboration, testing, development, backup, smart volumes, let you
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:21.120]   create up to 255 individual drives, each with a maximum capacity of 64 terabytes.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.280]   So you can do the math.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.760]   I don't know how that adds up.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.000]   That's a mess, a storage, a pass along.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.960]   Of course, as with all Drobo's, they're reliable data received by your Drobo, not yet written
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.960]   to disk is protected.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.200]   If there's a sudden power loss, it's got its own battery inside.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:41.880]   And of course, that EUSB device to protect the data.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.840]   If there's power failure, you can add or replace.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.840]   The new Drobo drives easily.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.840]   You saw I did it.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.280]   No tools required.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.960]   Beyond RAID, they're fast.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.800]   You can get Ethernet, ISCSI, Thunderbolt, USB 3.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.120]   Visit Drobo.com/twit.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:00.320]   You can find out more, check out their complete line of products, and use the code TWIT100
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.320]   when you buy to save 100 bucks.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.320]   What?
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:09.400]   100 bucks off the purchase of a Drobo, many of 5D, a 5N, or the new Drobo 810i.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:14.720]   Drobo.com/twit and the offer code is TWIT100.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.720]   You know what I did with this?
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:20.240]   I paired this with my Corning Optical Thunderbolt cables.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.240]   Nice.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.240]   I know.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.240]   That's fast.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.720]   I like our sponsors.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.280]   But that way I can put this, you know, because I have a pretty silent system.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.280]   Put it next door?
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.840]   I could put it down underneath the desk.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.840]   No way, somewhere else.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.840]   Out of the way.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.840]   And I don't even know where it's there.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.840]   It's just magic.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.640]   It's like it just happens.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.640]   The future Leo.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.320]   The future's here.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.040]   And live in the future.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:49.080]   So the big story we should probably start with, and I'm really curious what you all
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.080]   think about this.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:57.920]   You know, when there's a dearth of information, conspiracy theories pour in to fill the void.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:05.760]   The DOJ told the court yesterday, "Never mind.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.240]   We found a way to unlock the iPhone.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.240]   Apple doesn't have to do anything.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:15.600]   And we are withdrawing our suit to compel Apple to assist in unlocking that 5C used
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:21.320]   by the Sam Bernadette offshooter."
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.320]   That's it.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.320]   We're all done.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.320]   Now, there are a couple of things.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.600]   First of all, we don't know what the vulnerability is or who offered it.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.240]   Could it even been Apple?
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.600]   But there is a big question.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:35.920]   If there's a vulnerability, will the government tell Apple so they can patch it?
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.920]   And I'm thinking...
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.560]   I doubt it.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.120]   I doubt it, right?
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.120]   Because they want to keep...
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.600]   It's also unclear if the government actually had it.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.240]   Because I think the recent rumors were that some consulting company offered it to them.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.320]   So sort of like the hacker group that got hacked previously.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:53.000]   There's groups around the world that collect zero days and other exploits and jailbreak
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   exploits.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.560]   And if they offered their services to the government, then that, you know, they came
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.560]   in and gave them a phone.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.320]   They broke it, gave it back to the government.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.320]   Well, okay, let me just say this is...
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.880]   I just told you what we know.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:07.920]   Now everything else we say is filling the void because there's so much we don't know.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.160]   Yeah, well, they're not going to show us, but I'd like to see the data if they think
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.160]   that they really...
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.720]   If they say they really got it off, I'd like to see what that was because...
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.720]   They said it in court.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.520]   So I don't know if they would lie about getting data off.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.520]   No, I'm sure they did.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.520]   That's something off of it.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.520]   I'm sure they did.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.520]   I'll probably just remember.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.520]   It helps remember that they have...
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.440]   Because this entire action was based on the All Ritz Act, they have to withdraw if they
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.640]   have the ability to do this without Apple's help.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:35.520]   So basically, their entire privacy became invalid as soon as they have the ability to do it.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.480]   And also, there's a lot of interesting language in there.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:44.080]   They did say definitely that was an outside company for anybody inside Apple to even...
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.120]   Hey, let's just settle this.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.680]   Let's just fix this.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.880]   For them to have had any involvement in this after they stuck their neck out that far is
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.680]   would be a ridiculous thing to even contemplate.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:33:00.640]   But realize that an outside company can also mean a government contractor in McLean, Virginia,
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.480]   who does this very much.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.440]   One client is in the United States government.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.400]   It does kind of underscore what Tim Cook's been saying all along because now we know there's
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.760]   a vulnerability and that we...
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.320]   The government has...
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:21.080]   There is a system they go through about whether they notify Apple or about this or not.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.720]   They haven't yet said whether they will and we may never know if they do.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.720]   And there's always vulnerabilities.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.720]   But they should.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.720]   But they should.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.720]   But the reason why iOS has...
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.720]   That's how they keep getting jailbreak.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.880]   I think there was Pangu that jail broke iOS 9.1 because of a vulnerability.
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.920]   And Apple patched it and they looked for another vulnerability.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.280]   And that's typically how the game works.
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:42.360]   But Apple really ought to have a chance to fix that vulnerability, right?
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.360]   Absolutely.
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:48.880]   Well, but it's not anyone, any outside parties responsibility to tell Apple how they screwed
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.280]   up and tell them how to fix it.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.280]   It might be an ethical one.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.280]   It may not be an ethical one.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.280]   It may not be an ethical one.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.280]   It may be an ethical one.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:57.680]   But then again, someone in law enforcement might say that if we feel as though we can
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.320]   keep people safe by having this door that only we...
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.320]   Excuse me.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.040]   People including us have access to perhaps it's better that we keep this door open.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.720]   In the past, they have also...
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.080]   There's at least one published in Simpson, which they have...
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.120]   They reached out to somebody who was present...
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.520]   Going to be presenting a paper at a White Hat Hacker conference.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.000]   And they approached this person before...
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.720]   All they had was the presses of the presentation.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.080]   And they said, "Oh, that's interesting.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.280]   Why don't you show us how that works?"
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.960]   And then they were so impressed by it that they made that a classified secret and forbade
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.160]   him from actually presenting.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.000]   Because they wanted this trick to be their exclusive property.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.800]   So a lot of things can happen.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.320]   Well, and I think that it's fair game for the FBI to...
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:44.960]   Compared to how Apoplectic I was about them forcing Apple to do it, it's fair game for
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.960]   them to figure out a way to crack a phone that has a vulnerability.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.520]   I think this is their job.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.240]   This is what they should be doing.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.360]   For them to figure out how to get into these to get data, I think is fair game.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.360]   I don't think that they owe Apple anything to figure it out.
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.360]   Apple's going to have to figure it out.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:02.440]   I think that the precedent that was so concerning was the idea that they could force Apple to
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.040]   write new code to spy on people.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.560]   That's the part that was scary.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:10.800]   Not that they're spying on us and not that they could hack into it or are going to hack
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.800]   into it.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:18.720]   It was that they could force a company to write novel code that wasn't already there to open
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.720]   it up.
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.960]   Was opening up a Pandora's box that I thought...
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.920]   I think that was very dangerous.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.480]   And I do think that there was some pressure put on them to find another way.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:32.040]   Because I think if they had lost the case, the precedent would have been set.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:36.720]   And all of these little openings would have been being closed up, which are still being
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.040]   closed up, but it would have been much worse, I think.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:43.200]   If I was to re-interring the movie version of this, then it seemed to me, again, if I
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.440]   was doing a cinematic version of this, that they decided that this would be the perfect
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:50.720]   case to try to get the All-Ritz Act codified or a precedent set that would allow them to
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.480]   be able to force and compel companies to write that kind of code.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.440]   But then over the progressive weeks when Apple fought back and maybe they weren't expecting
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:01.720]   that level of pushback, sentiment wasn't as completely on their side as they thought
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.720]   it was.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.440]   And legal interpretation, including the New York City case, wasn't as on their side as
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.880]   maybe they hoped it would be.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.600]   And it just became clear that this was a game of chicken that they may not win.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.000]   And the only thing worse, they getting a precedent that would let them overreach to this degree
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.160]   would get a precedent that shut them out of this.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:18.920]   So rather than risk that sort of a thing, it felt like they said, "Okay, we're going
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.000]   to take this away."
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.120]   The scary part to me is that this didn't get solved.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.400]   It's not like a court ruled and said, "You can't do this."
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.600]   They took their ball and went home.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:30.240]   So this is still hanging over us, like a sort of hacking democles where if there's another
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.720]   case like this, they might try again or they might think there's a better opportunity or
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.800]   a better judge to try it with.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:39.600]   So I think that it's sort of great that this happened, but we have to be very vigilant
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.040]   about how this service is next.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:47.200]   Well, and I do feel as though there's more mundane explanations here.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:52.320]   And again, we're as Leo so very wisely covered all of our butts.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:56.400]   You say the three sentences that are the actual facts of the case that we revealed, that had
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.960]   been revealed for the past week, and the rest is speculation and opinion and hopefully
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:00.960]   informed opinion.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:06.440]   But again, the governments can't retire the moment that they, excuse me, if they cannot
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:11.680]   apply this court action the way they've applied it so long as they feel as though they have
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.000]   the ability to do this without Apple's help.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.640]   So I feel as though the reason why they withdrew was because at some point they had information
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:22.880]   that they didn't have when they first filed this action.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.400]   And there's also, there is no one entity called the government.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:31.320]   There is all kinds of different departments and a lot of them, if they don't actively
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:35.080]   hate each other, they're not going to do anything to help each other.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:40.200]   My opinion, but if I'm going to put, if I were in Vegas and I had to lay a bet and I wanted
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:45.920]   to make my money back, I would be saying that there was always another contractor that works
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:52.000]   with the government that had a way to get through this, but they've had no impulse whatsoever
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.920]   to volunteer their services or this information to the FBI.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.040]   And then at some point somebody had lunch.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.880]   His name rhyme with Ron Smackafee.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.880]   Probably.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:08.880]   Okay, I'm guessing I'm thinking the most impressive thing that he did in that entire exchange
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:12.840]   was realize that, okay, this is the part of the, this is the part in my life where either
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:18.480]   go all in and risk, and risk being a fool for life or admit that I said things I should
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.240]   not have said and I'm embarrassed for a couple of weeks.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.920]   But yeah, I don't, I'm not, I'm certain that at a certain political level, they would like
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:25.920]   this thing settled.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:32.160]   I think citizens and corporations would like this, this topic settled.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:36.720]   I don't feel from what I've been seeing and hearing about this case, I don't feel as though
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.680]   there was any motivation.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:42.920]   I believe that the immediate motivation was to get the data on this phone.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:50.520]   I also think that they had to have known that by trying to compel Apple to do this, whether
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:55.840]   the only possible, the only two possible solutions would be Apple, Apple decides that this is
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:00.720]   not a fight that they want to fight and they comply or they fight in which case this gets,
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:04.920]   even if the FBI wins, it gets drawn out so long that any information on that phone would
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.080]   be of no value.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:11.120]   So I feel as though their gambit was, let's at least try to get to come, let's try to
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.720]   compel Apple and we don't, we don't know where we don't know if we're going to be able
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.360]   to fight them in court over this.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.920]   But if we can sort of twist their arm and get them with the, with the help of our political
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:26.320]   wings and for help of public opinion, get them to find a way that they can say that they
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:33.400]   were only helping out law enforcement without turning their back on their stated, their
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:38.040]   stated position about the defense of private security, I think that that's what they were
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.040]   trying to get at.
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.640]   Well, I think that the bigger fight is going to probably be in Europe specifically because
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.960]   Europe has more to more risk.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:49.800]   I mean, they have, they have more going on that they need to have that data.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:53.800]   But I think that there, I think that the fight there is going to be, because the problem
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.600]   is if once one country does it, it just becomes this thing.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.400]   And so you have all these countries that are looking at trying to legislate that and Europe,
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.040]   I think has pulled between two things where they're very privacy driven as well as very
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.040]   security driven.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.200]   And I don't know if they really have a solution for that yet.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.320]   I don't think it's going to happen in our Congress anytime soon.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:13.440]   I don't think there's an appetite for going down that path.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:19.760]   The EFF says, FBI breaks into iPhone.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:24.360]   We have some questions.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:28.560]   I do feel like this is just kicking the can down the road a little bit.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.520]   And if you're going to indulge in conspiracy theories, you might say the FBI realized that
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.400]   this wasn't the best case after all.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.840]   The hard thing is the panic effect.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.480]   Like a lot of people immediately when this happened, there's a lot of headlines and can
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.160]   they break into your phone, which is kind of fear among, I mean, Geo-Hot broke into the
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.400]   original iPhone in his garage with a soldering iron.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.200]   And we've had jail breaks for almost every version of the iPhone since.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.960]   So this is nothing that people have to immediately panic about either.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.920]   This is an exploit that was used or whatever.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:58.200]   Somehow this iPhone got access to just like iOS 9.1 was jailbroken a year ago.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.960]   So it's something that happens and something that hopefully gets patched, but it's nothing
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.400]   that anyone has to panic about.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:07.560]   As the EFF points out, by the way, Renee did not just mispronounce soldering.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:08.560]   He's from Canada.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.560]   It's not his fault.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:10.560]   Soldering.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.560]   Is it his soldering?
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:13.560]   Deezing you.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:19.320]   According to the EFF, there's something called the vulnerabilities equities process the government
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:24.840]   uses for determining when to disclose, of course, they had an acronym, VEP, when to disclose
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.280]   security vulnerabilities.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:31.840]   If the FBI used a vulnerability to get into the iPhone, the VEP must apply, meaning there
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:38.040]   should be a very strong bias in favor of forming Apple of the vulnerability, which would allow
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.040]   Apple to fix it.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.680]   That's why the language was probably stating that try to make it clear that it wasn't
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.680]   they themselves.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:45.680]   We did it.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.680]   Yeah, we don't know.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.680]   I just magically unlocked.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:55.280]   Also, it's like it's a little bit like a FOIA request where yes, they can be compelled to
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:59.120]   give up information, but they can do that in such a way that the information is useless.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.640]   So they can say they've complied with this law without actually doing anything that they
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.000]   felt really strongly.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.640]   They shouldn't be doing.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:10.640]   President Obama recommended that the policy favor disclosure, quote, "In almost all instances
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.480]   for widely used code," unquote.
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:18.880]   But there's a lot redacted speaking of FOIA.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.600]   I think that's how the EFF got this.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:29.760]   And I think the real mistake here for the government is that probably as much so as all
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:33.800]   the Snowden leaks is what they've done is they flipped everybody to mean worried about
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:34.800]   the government.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:35.800]   Right.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:36.800]   And into it.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.120]   So now there's all these tutorials for every person on how to add numbers to your, how
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.120]   to add new work.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.120]   That's what happens.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.640]   Don't go to four, go to six, go to nine, go to whatever.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.680]   Like how to do strong passwords, how to encrypt everything.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.800]   So there's all these articles that show average people.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:53.000]   And now anybody who Google's can easily see how they're going to do this that weren't
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.040]   thinking about it before.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.880]   And now they're going to tighten that all up because, you know, and I just think that
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.240]   they got a lot of press and it was just a huge boondoggle.
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:02.040]   Surprise, surprise, surprise.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:06.280]   And also it's going to double, Apple can now really double down on their promotion of
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.280]   security features.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:11.200]   Well, one of the, they can basically, they can make the point and they have that the 5C
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:15.920]   was a couple of generations behind in terms of the hardware security that makes the Apple,
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:19.000]   makes Apple products the hardest things to get into.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.760]   It's not just something that they can simply apply a system update.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:27.320]   It really is you have to trick hardware, which means that you need to have a scanning electron
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:32.240]   microscope to watch electrons going by and count them correctly, practically, in order
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:35.640]   to get at some, get data that someone does not want you to get.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:40.640]   So this, this really is going to, this is almost like World War one that ends, but nothing's
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.160]   resolved and then there's going to be something even worse coming.
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.880]   Well, and I think the hard part is that now that
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:51.120]   there's a race on for a lot of these governments, because now there's a lot of money being spent
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:56.920]   on all funds to get to a point where you can ship 75 or 100 million phones that Apple,
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:03.600]   that there just is almost no way to get into, and get them out the door with all this encryption.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:09.840]   I mean, there's always going to be some backdoor, but it can get very hard if these companies
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:14.160]   really get focused on it at a level that they haven't been before, because now they want
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:18.240]   to get it out before and to say that basically we can't get into it and doesn't matter whether
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.360]   you legislate it or not, it is almost impossible to get in.
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:26.280]   Well, that has a pretty strong arm here in that they are one of the world's premier
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:31.200]   luxury brands and that if your government says that I'm sorry, we're going to make
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:36.640]   the iPhone seven illegal to import into this country, you're going to have to make your
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:40.560]   case so carefully about why you're making that happen given that there are number of
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.120]   people, millions of people that we're expecting to have a brand new shiny iPhone seven.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.040]   They want this thing.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:52.840]   I often have to think about how the week before 9/11, remember one of the killers went through
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.360]   some of the killers went through Logan Airport.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:58.320]   I remember just a couple of weeks before that on local news, there was a long report about
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:02.920]   how there's a lot of pushback against security at Logan and they're thinking about loosening
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.920]   security requirements because people are really annoyed at how much time it's taking them
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.480]   to get through screenings.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:13.560]   And oftentimes so long as the, I don't want to be callous here, but so long as the, as
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:18.480]   soon as the names of the victims have been forgotten by all but the friends and families,
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.320]   that's when people start thinking of, do I really have to take off my shoes?
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.520]   Oh, God, do I really have to put my laptop in a separate thing?
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:28.240]   And when you get to a point where you're telling people you're going to have to get
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:32.600]   a Samsung Galaxy phone instead of an iPhone because we're not going to allow this to be
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:33.840]   imported in.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:39.920]   That's when unfortunately people start to ask more serious and harder questions.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:44.040]   Do you think that, you know, one of the things we, the New York Times raised, we talked a
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:48.720]   little bit, Katie Benner was on Twitch from the Times on Sunday.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:54.240]   Do you think Apple makes itself more vulnerable by not offering bug bounties as Google and
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.400]   Facebook do four vulnerabilities?
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:01.640]   They say we don't want to get in that ever escalating game.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.240]   More vulnerable or less informed.
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.920]   Yeah, I think they should do it.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:05.920]   I think they should.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:12.040]   Google actually made that as part of their, their, I think was for the last analyst call
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:16.840]   or rather the last time when it came time to hand out the latest round they were actually
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.800]   making, just like Apple makes a big deal.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.520]   Here's how many billions of dollars we've handed out to developers on the App Store.
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:25.760]   They made a big point and part of that call of here's how much money we have handed out
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:29.000]   to people who have found vulnerabilities in our hardware.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.160]   And rather than pointing it at, well, really, that's how many vulnerable they found.
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:37.240]   We've made the more cogent argument that look, there are going to be vulnerabilities that
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.320]   we are not going to be able to spot on our own.
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.360]   And here's how we're putting our money where our mouth is.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:45.080]   And here's how much or eager we are to make the most secure hand sets and software that
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.080]   we possibly can.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:51.720]   So yeah, I think they should do that.
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:53.720]   What would it cost them?
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:54.720]   Could cost them a lot.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:59.720]   The government has offered a million dollar bounty for zero day flaws.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:01.680]   People are going to shop around.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:04.480]   I think that's what Apple's worried about.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:07.800]   Google offers as much as $100,000 for flaws in Android.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.960]   And security companies that want them to because then they offer those services to
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:11.960]   governments.
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.520]   Right.
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.600]   So it's a very big business.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:20.680]   Not that Apple doesn't have the money, but happy birthday, OS X.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:23.000]   That's what the cake's really for.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.760]   15 years we've been using OS X. And Apple's been updating it yearly for how long, almost
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.880]   like eight of those half that time at least.
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:36.640]   Kodiak to El Capiton.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:42.840]   April 25th, there will be a live stream of Apple's 2016 Q2 earnings call.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:43.840]   Is that unusual?
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.440]   It's becoming more and more usual.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:48.240]   We actually do a couple of them.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.280]   So not not apples, but we broadcast them.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.280]   We broadcast for other questions.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.280]   I remember Yannell.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.760]   I remember watching video of a Merse Meir last year.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:56.760]   Did they say video?
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.120]   Yeah, because they always do the audio call.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.120]   The audio call has been happening for you.
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.440]   But you have to, can anybody call into that?
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.440]   You have to be a journalist.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:05.440]   There's a little player on the Apple.com/investors, a little audio player.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.320]   You press it and it just plays the audio.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.320]   Okay.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.840]   So is this a tail?
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:11.160]   No, it's a conference call again.
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.160]   It looks like.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:17.080]   Every time this is, the only one with that accent, but every time it tells you it's Tim.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:19.960]   Well, April 25th, I don't know why we're talking about this now.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.120]   April seems so far away.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.960]   And yet it's only a few days.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.400]   It's just a couple of days.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.400]   I know.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.400]   So fast.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.400]   This is coming.
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:30.880]   All right.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.520]   Let's talk about the five.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:33.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.720]   The iPhone SE, it's not a five.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:36.720]   It's not a six.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.160]   It's just an SE.
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.160]   You got it right there.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:41.160]   It was a goal.
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:45.520]   The heart of a six S and the exact same body of a five S.
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:46.840]   So yeah, so it's a five S.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:50.400]   The camera, the processor are the same as a six S and the Wi-Fi and the stereo are the
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.400]   same as a six.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.000]   The FaceTime camera is the same as a five S.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.600]   So it's really high-complicated.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.600]   All the different.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.600]   But they didn't have to.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.600]   The money I've this semester just took a little sabbatical.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:01.120]   You've been working on the new campus.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:03.200]   I was putting all that curved glass in.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.240]   This is not a new external design in any way.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:09.080]   This in fact the cases for the five S work.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:13.160]   So I mean the point that they tried to make and whether you believe them or not, something
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.280]   else is that people love this phone, that there are people hanging on to five and five
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:17.280]   S for a long time.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.760]   And they thought the design was iconic and they didn't like the new curve of your design.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:25.760]   They liked sort of the brawn and like sort of look of the four in the five series.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.760]   And this gives them basically the device that they want, but with all the specs.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:29.760]   For safe threat.
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.600]   For all my five S cases, not so long.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.600]   I'm so excited.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:33.600]   I have this underwater case.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:37.680]   I have this underwater case that I couldn't use anymore because it was a five S case.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.840]   And I'm very excited.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:39.840]   I do.
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.320]   I still have my, what are those lenses?
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.840]   I do have my lenses in the.
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:43.840]   Right.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.400]   So again, though, this is if you had a five or a five S, this is the exact same phone,
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:52.320]   but you get all the goodies in Apple Pay and Touch ID and everything that you might not
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:53.320]   have had otherwise.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:57.000]   They're not the slower touch ID, right?
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.200]   Touch ID first generation.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.880]   Why that seems odd.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.520]   So I mean, there's a couple of things there.
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.840]   One, like there's always a chance that they just wanted to make a certain bill of goods
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:07.680]   and there were certain things they were willing to sacrifice.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:11.920]   The other thing is that, especially early on, some of the new chips are really hard to make,
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:15.880]   which is why we only saw touch ID on the iPhone at first and it took a while to go to iPad.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:19.520]   And if touch ID two is similar, then the yield rates aren't really enough for them to roll
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.840]   it out beyond one product, especially when that product line is the iPhone and they're
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:23.840]   taking 100 million of them.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.960]   And yet, their devices.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.720]   Two gigs of RAM.
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.840]   Yeah, because it's the exact same.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.480]   On the iPhone, the chip is all built together.
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:34.840]   The RAM is not like the X, so the RAM is inside.
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:37.240]   So it's the exact same A9 chip that's in.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:42.320]   So to me, it's like the Ducati Super Ligier or like a Porsche 911 R where it's all the
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.480]   engine, but they took everything out of the body they possibly could.
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:46.480]   And there's very few pixels.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.480]   So it really flies.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:49.480]   And how's battery life?
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:50.720]   I think it must be spectacular, right?
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:54.560]   It's really good because it's not as long in battery.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:58.800]   One of the reasons why the iPhone plus, the 6 Plus is so good is because it lets them spread
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.800]   that battery over a large volume.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:04.200]   Making a battery thick is not great for a lot of reasons, but making it big by volume,
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.960]   by surface area is really good.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:11.240]   This one is smaller, but because of the relative size of it and it's the more efficient, I
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:15.160]   am sorry, Apple A9 chip, it's hours longer than the 5S was.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:19.240]   I've only had it for a few days and it's what's hard to test because when you set up a phone
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.240]   is new, you pull the fresh install.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:25.640]   Yeah, but also downloads and then it re-indexes everything which uses the processor a lot.
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:28.200]   So it's hard to tell, but it's been lasting me easily through a day.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.840]   Nice.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.400]   Is there a market for a four inch iPhone?
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.400]   I guess there is.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.200]   They said 30 million were sold the last year.
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.600]   Yeah, 10 to 20% have been waiting apparently to upgrade.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:40.040]   And they also think they'll get some people who are just, because it's hard to find small
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:44.000]   flagship phones, but if you have small pockets, if you have small purses, like a Christina
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.640]   Warren clutch sort of a thing, you want the smaller phone because it's easy to carry
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.560]   and people have been waiting for it.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:53.640]   So anyone who just doesn't want a big phone, no matter who the manufacturer is, anybody
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:57.240]   who might have a regular phone and they're looking to get into a smartphone and they
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.000]   like that little candy bar form factor.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.640]   They're used to their Nokia's and their Samsung candy bars.
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:04.400]   And one of the smartphone that that size, they think they have a good opportunity with
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.400]   all those.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.880]   Looks like I picked a pretty bad week to give up my lady clutch.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:09.880]   You can borrow one.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:13.120]   It's not just that this touches so many hotspots here.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:15.840]   It's not because not only all the stuff that Renee was talking about, but also Apple now
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:22.080]   has a really awesome $399 phone in a world in which you can get awesome $300 in great
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.240]   phones.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:29.000]   And so the I love it when the minimum buy in for an Apple product gets lower.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.080]   So that's this is a really they and this is not a and this is they did.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:36.880]   I think the same thing they did kind of that that Google did with the Nexus 6P and the
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:37.980]   next Nexus 5x.
[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:43.560]   They didn't decide to make a cut rate version a lower a lower citizen standard of iPhone.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:47.160]   They basically made anything that the 6P can do pretty much.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.320]   This can also do.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:51.520]   You don't have to say, well, I can't do Apple Pay.
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.280]   I can't do the good photography.
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.360]   I can do it with the 6P.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.360]   It really is.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:56.360]   It's so nice.
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:57.360]   Exactly.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:01.640]   I'm amazed by I'm so pleased that they put pretty much the same camera.
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:05.200]   I have I don't have hardware, but I've been talking to my people at Apple and they said
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:08.680]   that no, you can't expect that the same pictures that you could take with the iPhone 6P you
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:12.200]   will be able to take what you'll be able to 6P.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:16.400]   They should they need to have a standardized on what letters are going to put after thing.
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.240]   I will always screw that up.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.320]   But anyway, that the same pictures pictures you can take on the iPhone 6.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.960]   You can also take on the iPhone SE.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:29.160]   That's so such a pleasure.
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:33.600]   Now on the iPad, the 9.7 inch iPad.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:38.000]   It's kind of a weird mix of new and old.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.480]   Have you confirmed that it's two gigs of RAM in there?
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:41.480]   Yes.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:42.480]   It's very disappointing.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.520]   So, I mean, there's a couple of things.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:46.000]   So, in some ways, it's way better.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.760]   In other ways, like you said, it's two gigs of RAM.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.320]   So it's it's smaller.
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:52.520]   RAM does use a little bit of power, but it's not really significant.
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:54.760]   It has far fewer pixels to push around.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:57.520]   So it doesn't need as big a buffer for that kind of thing.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.480]   So, yeah, so that's a good point.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:03.080]   So it uses RAM as a frame buffer for the screen.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:08.880]   So you like you really you would like the original iPhone 6 plus you could tell that sometimes
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.680]   it was having a hard time moving all those pixels around.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:15.200]   But then they put they went to two gigs with that and they've gone to four gigs for the
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.200]   big one.
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:19.680]   But the big one has a much bigger bigger screen resolution than this one does.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:20.680]   And I'll turn it on.
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:21.680]   But in some ways, it's way better.
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:26.120]   Like so for example, the camera is the same camera as the iPhone SE and the iPhone 6 plus.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:27.520]   So the camera is way better.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:33.160]   The screen is way better because it has that 25% brighter and 40% less reflective.
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:37.000]   And it has DCP sorry DC IP three color space.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.120]   It's got the wide gamut color screen like the five came back.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.800]   So it's it's in some ways it's startlingly advanced.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:45.800]   And in other ways, it's like, ah, the RAM.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:50.040]   I'm so excited about after the when we were looking at it when they the ethernet we finally
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.040]   tested the ethernet.
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:55.960]   So we did the it took me a little while to get all the little bits and pieces I've been
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:59.280]   traveling and between between Monday in here.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.920]   And I finally got all the bits and pieces and you know, it's been around.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.120]   I mean, it works on your phone.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:05.360]   It works on the iPad Pro.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:06.360]   It works.
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.640]   It just happened to mention it.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:08.640]   There you go.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.640]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.960]   And I've had I've had this in my bag for an entire week.
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:12.960]   Like, yeah.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.400]   Oh my gosh, you know, where do you guys find ethernet?
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:20.640]   Oh, you just use the Amazon turns out it comes out on the way.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.720]   Some of the strangest places, I guess, right?
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.720]   I think I would tell they still do, but I was just in it.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:26.720]   Had it.
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:31.440]   I actually get my hotels based on whether they have ethernet in the room.
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.040]   So I'm charging over USB C Leo so fast.
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.040]   Even on the big.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.040]   Yeah, that I believe.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.040]   You have to do that.
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:42.920]   So it's that's exclusive to the to the big iPads and it also USB three data transfers,
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:43.920]   isn't it?
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:46.120]   I it USB three data transfer is exclusive to the big one.
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:48.040]   I've been charging this on the USB C cable.
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:50.320]   I don't know if I should have better not, but it's been fine.
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:51.320]   Sure.
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:52.320]   Why wouldn't you?
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.320]   I mean, it wouldn't take it wouldn't hurt.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:54.320]   No, it's a little charge.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:58.840]   I don't know what I need to check my notes because right now it's USB to.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:55:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:04.040]   It's a slow bandwidth, but it's got the USB C charging capability.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.040]   So I'm sorry.
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:13.040]   I'm just going to ask if it has a fast USB C charging or or slow charging.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:17.040]   I didn't try, but I'll test that tonight.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.120]   And, okay.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:24.000]   And so the data transfer rate isn't there, but you can use ethernet.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.480]   Yes.
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.360]   And that all that means you could use in theory.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:28.360]   You could have done that before.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.360]   They just didn't have a driver.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.560]   What it means is that the operating system is a driver built in.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.720]   I don't know whether that is that a 9-3 thing that you can suddenly use ethernet.
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:37.640]   Or was that something we just could we could always use and we just didn't know?
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:38.640]   Because it was.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.200]   No, we tried before and it didn't work.
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:41.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.200]   I've been trying with previous connectors.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:43.600]   I don't that's another set of questions.
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:47.600]   I don't have answers to yet, but I've got questions and whether there is hardware.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:52.240]   Well, there's a combination of drivers and circuitry that's inside this adapter or whether
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:56.040]   there has been some secret sauce that it needed for hardware to make that happen.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:57.640]   I don't know.
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.080]   But it is a big deal.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:02.240]   Just a quickly answer what you're asking earlier.
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:07.080]   The problem is that when you don't have Wi-Fi, you will start looking for ethernet when you
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.320]   don't have Wi-Fi.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:13.360]   And the number of times where I've been at a conference and the fact that I always travel
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:21.520]   with a Hutu, like a $15 mini Wi-Fi base station and had a loan it to another conference
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:26.400]   speaker because there's Wi-Fi throughout the hotel, but in some rooms it really stinks.
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:32.440]   And that was their ability to on their little Mac books to finally be able to connect to
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:33.440]   the internet.
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:37.880]   You really do need, and especially with the iPad, where if you don't have, being able
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:41.960]   to travel with it as an alternative to your MacBook or your Windows notebook really is
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:45.880]   required that you have access to the internet.
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:50.680]   That's why I took both the iPad Pro and my MacBook with me two Yosemite a couple of weeks
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:55.760]   ago because I knew that the internet would be terrible and things will be really, really
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.680]   horrible for me if I didn't have access to that.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:00.960]   So if you're already going to be spending 30 bucks for this thing that will give you
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:05.600]   all the crunchy goodness that USB port gives you, why not also have the ability to plug
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:06.600]   in an ethernet adapter?
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.600]   It really does.
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:13.040]   Renee, have you tried ethernet with the SE as well?
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:14.040]   I have not.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.040]   I can give that a go.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:18.440]   But the thing, like the, at Tanny's point too, sometimes Wi-Fi just gets saturated and
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.440]   there's a lot of people around.
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:22.200]   And one of the things I got must go and you always want to go try to find an ethernet
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.200]   plug.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.200]   Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.200]   No, I understand.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:27.200]   Everybody, you can't be on the show unless you have ethernet.
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:32.120]   Well, that's the whole thing is now we can theoretically use our iPad for a show like
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.120]   this.
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:34.120]   For Skype, you know, for Skype.
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:39.640]   And for us, you know, we use it for comms and controls for our switchers and our, and
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:43.000]   the number one reason we didn't use it to control our ATEM, our Blackmagic switchers
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.200]   or our mixers.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:50.560]   We can control our Yamaha and Beringer mixers with the iPad, but we won't do it on a show
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:55.400]   because we need to have a wired connection to make sure nothing goes down and, and having
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:57.880]   this is the, you know, the process.
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:00.560]   And I think that one of the things we want to test is now, you know, they have all, a
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:05.160]   lot of people have been playing around with using your iPads and your iPhones as cameras
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:06.800]   to do multi-camera shoots and everything else.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.960]   And I've always been like, well, I'm not going to do that over Wi-Fi.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:14.880]   But now the idea that I could hub all of these pieces into it, you know, is exciting.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:16.880]   So it's, you have the power connection too.
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:20.640]   So like Jason and I, and the smell and I were both clapping when they said podcasts.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:23.640]   All right.
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:24.640]   We're going to take a break.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:25.640]   I have many more questions.
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:26.640]   I want to know about the keyboard as well.
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:27.640]   Did you get the keyboard case?
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:29.640]   Okay.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:30.640]   Don't hold on.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:31.640]   We're going to get to in a minute.
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:32.880]   No spoilers.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:33.880]   No spoilers.
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:34.880]   Renee Richie is here.
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:35.880]   I'm more.com.
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:38.320]   He's got the new iPhone and the new iPad.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:41.760]   We get our iPad mini pros tomorrow, whatever.
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:43.760]   Baby bro, baby, baby, little pro.
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:45.840]   We get the semi pro.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:46.840]   Semi pro.
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:47.840]   It's good.
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:49.840]   There's no way it is.
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:51.560]   I want to talk about the screen thing too.
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:52.560]   That's interesting.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:54.560]   True tone.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:58.880]   But we, yeah, not tomorrow, Thursday, the 31st they come out.
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:02.680]   But first Renee Richie is here Andy Anaco from the Chicago Sun.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:07.240]   Alex Lindsey, did you order some mini baby pros?
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.240]   Couple.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.240]   Couple?
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.240]   Like 153?
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.240]   No.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.240]   Okay.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.240]   I'm building something and I needed some.
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.240]   That's some.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.240]   You.
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:21.880]   Alex has a unique relationship to numbers.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.000]   One to many.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.960]   What is that?
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:26.960]   There's that.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.480]   And then there's the unit of, you know, cost.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.680]   Free, cheap, irrelevant.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:31.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.240]   You just have to, it doesn't matter how much it costs.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.600]   It just matters how fast you're going to amortize it.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.600]   Exactly.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.120]   How much it will make you.
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.160]   So you just have to move, you just have to make sure that you know where the other
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.240]   end of that stick is.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.240]   So.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.040]   So today brought to you by Atlassian.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:50.000]   If you've ever worked on a team, you probably have heard of Atlassian and I hope you've used
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   Atlassian.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.240]   We have all we love Atlassian.
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.040]   We used it with the design of the website.
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.040]   That's where I first encountered it because they used Jira.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.960]   Our web design team for kitchens down in Austin used Jira.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.840]   And so we did the whole agile thing.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:06.720]   It doesn't have to be agile, but it is a really great way to manage a big project.
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:11.400]   We have many programmers, many clients and you're all kind of have input and it worked
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.000]   so beautifully.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.920]   And of course, because we were using Atlassian Jira, they used HipChat as our kind of chat
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:18.920]   client.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:23.240]   And now as we design the new studio, we just opened the new room in HipChat.
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:28.600]   We use have many HipChat channels for engineering for the website for ops and our new studio
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.600]   design.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.480]   We're using it as our idea book for the design.
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.120]   So we're putting pictures in there and ideas.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:39.000]   And we've got the point now where we're telling all of our team members who are working on
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   this new studio.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.360]   Don't email me.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.920]   Put it in HipChat.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.160]   Please, it's really great.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.480]   And you can do video chatting and you tie it in.
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:54.880]   We tie it in with a lot of our services like Redis and we use a new service I love called
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:58.880]   Panopta that lets us know when servers are down or funky.
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.920]   And it comes across as a message and I get a notification on my phone.
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.520]   I just love HipChat.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:08.720]   Then Russell uses confluence for trouble tickets to keep an eye on what's going on.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:13.480]   Using team members up to speed, share content, organize results.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.960]   The only thing I don't know if we use it, I should ask Patrick, our programmer is a
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.680]   bit bucket which is for testing, reviewing and managing code in real time.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:22.600]   Basically, I think you're getting the idea.
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:26.720]   Atlassian has the tools you need to make your life easier.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:32.440]   I was just reading a post from Joel Spolsky from like 100 years ago from like 2000 in which
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:36.720]   he says never take a job unless they're using the best tools.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:40.240]   You just don't want to work somewhere if they're not using the best tools.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.400]   We use the best tools.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.840]   You should use the best tools Atlassian.com.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.840]   ATLASSIN.
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:54.440]   To learn more about JIRA Confluence HipChat Bitbucket, Atlassian.com unleash the potential
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:58.440]   in your team and build what's next.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:03.920]   And thank you Atlassian for making great tools for us to use.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.960]   Alright, let's continue on.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:09.320]   So keyboard, let's see it.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:12.720]   It's smaller because it has to be the size of it.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:14.360]   It's smaller on the outside.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:18.480]   So did they move keys closer together or shrink the key cap size?
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.400]   So basically there's no bezel on the side anymore.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.640]   It goes completely edge to edge almost like the MacBook.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:24.720]   The keys are smaller.
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:27.160]   It took me about five minutes to get used to it.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:31.240]   I don't type as well on it as I do the full size one but auto correct really kicks in.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:35.920]   So as long as you trust it and you just keep typing, it does really, really good job.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.840]   I use it the entire plane ride back.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:40.960]   Then I use it the plane ride out here and I've been using it in the hotel here because
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.240]   the footprint is so small.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:46.280]   It takes a very little space on the table so it's super convenient to carry and use with
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.840]   you and I've been having no problem at all with it.
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:49.840]   Yeah.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:55.120]   Now that's why I bought it because I actually came to love the original Pro and its keyboard.
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:59.520]   It was really useful not for writing long screens but just having a keyboard really
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:03.280]   means I can keep the screen free of that pop up keyboard and make it better.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.920]   And I put it through supports the keyboard way better.
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:10.880]   I was going to say one of the things that was my frustration with the Pro until recently
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.560]   is that it was a little funky.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.560]   You know, you'd be typing.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.240]   You'd be typing and it would suddenly like lose stuff and everything else.
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.240]   I knew that.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.240]   I thought that was the docking.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:24.600]   I'm talking about silly things like using Spotlight the same way that I use it on the
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:29.880]   desktop which is command space to bring up a search box, launch Skype or something like
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:30.880]   that.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:34.960]   So if you're a Pro, it would highlight it for you but then you had to reach up and tap
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:38.400]   it because you couldn't select it with an arrow key and then launch with.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:44.320]   And just that simple addition that of itself, I don't care if it does brick my iPad.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.680]   That makes 9.3 a good upgrade for me.
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:48.680]   It's so fast now.
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:49.680]   I use it like I use a Mac.
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:50.680]   I don't even think about it.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:53.120]   And the nice thing is because all those things work the same.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.120]   I don't have to think.
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:56.120]   I don't have to remember that I'm on a Mac or an iOS device.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.280]   I just type and it almost always does what I expect it to do.
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.280]   And I've had a couple of times now.
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:05.360]   For some reason, the last couple of weeks I keep on losing my power supply for my computer
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:08.640]   and I end up just having to be on a flight or I was in my hotel room over the weekend
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.280]   in Vancouver without a power supply.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:16.360]   And just using my iPad Pro and I had to do spreadsheets and I had to do presentation
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.360]   stuff and I had to do it.
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.440]   And I'm just sitting there just like working away.
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:25.800]   And actually the split screen with when you're working on something like that is just pretty
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:26.800]   awesome.
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:27.800]   It's amazing.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.720]   Working on the smaller 9.7 inch.
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:30.720]   Does it still?
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.160]   I'm going to give you two answers later.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.480]   I really, really like it.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:34.480]   Not everything supports it yet.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:38.680]   Google Docs famously, they still use UI WebView, the original Web component because they want
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:39.680]   to manage their own cookies.
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.760]   So that doesn't play nice with a lot of modern stuff.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.160]   So if you're using that, you might have trouble.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:46.360]   But if you're using Microsoft or anything else, it works really, really well.
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.360]   The only thing is I'm getting to the age where my eyes are not as good as I used to
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.360]   be.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:54.040]   So I got used to that big screen because then split apps were basically the size of iPad
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:58.840]   Air apps and on the 9.7 inch iPad Pro, they're basically the size of iPad Mini apps.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:01.080]   So you have two iPad Mini apps side by side.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.320]   So I'm putting it a little bit closer than I used to and then it's fine.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:07.040]   And I find the behavior on some of the split apps are a little funky.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:13.680]   Even with Apple's apps, the numbers is a whole bunch of stuff that it doesn't want to do
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:17.040]   when it's the split app.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:22.640]   And I find that the Google Docs works just as badly on the iPad as it does on them.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:23.640]   We use Google Docs.
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.640]   I run my whole company on Google Docs.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.680]   So there's a love/hate relationship there.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:28.840]   You can't do anything.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:32.320]   You have to use it because it's the only thing that does what it does well.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:36.840]   But there's lots of weird little editing tools when you're trying to have lists and things
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:40.480]   that it wants to do something that I don't want it to do and trying to persuade it not
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:43.440]   to is just as hard on the iPad as it is on there.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:49.080]   Now the camera in there is the first time they've ever put a decent camera in an iPad,
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:52.080]   which is truly awesome.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.360]   I was like with a bump.
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.560]   They even have a bump.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:07:03.080]   I was like many skeptical about iPadography for a long time, but I've come around.
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.080]   And I'm kind of excited about that.
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.040]   It also has a flash, right?
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:10.160]   Yeah, it's got the same True Tone flash as the other one.
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.320]   And it's just a huge, beautiful viewfinder.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:15.840]   I was using both the iPad Pro and this one.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.520]   We use this as CES to do a lot of close-up shots.
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.520]   And I was using Macros.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.200]   I was doing a lot of macro photography over the weekend.
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:25.760]   And just a viewfinder this size makes it so easy to be tack sharp on anything you want
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.760]   to be.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.440]   It's really amazing, especially for shooting 4K.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:34.760]   It also has, and you've finally gotten the chance to play with, we were talking about
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:38.360]   during the launch, this new thing where it adjusts to the lighting of the room.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:41.000]   And it has four ambient lighting sensors.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.640]   Two four channel sensors.
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.640]   Two four channel sensors.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:45.840]   What do you think?
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:51.160]   So we took it to the XYZ bar at the Aloft Hotel because that's almost like a disco.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.720]   And we wanted to try it out.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:56.080]   And it's really crazy because we've all seen photographs of an iPhone where the iPhone
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:58.680]   looks white and the screen looks yellow or blue.
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:01.720]   And you put this on and they did this in the demo room for us too.
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.480]   And the screen just goes normal color.
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.560]   And it's like you're looking at a piece of paper.
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:08.200]   And I hadn't realized how yellow or blue the screens were.
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.200]   And then I picked up my iPhone.
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:13.000]   I'm like, wow, this screen is blue because I was looking at the iPad next to it.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   And it's just one little switch.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.880]   But it's to the point now where I wish my other Apple devices would detect the settings
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:22.840]   on this and then automatically replicate it because it's hard to demo.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.480]   That was afraid to be distracting.
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:27.760]   So the night shift can be distracting.
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.120]   I'm not crazy about night shift.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:33.120]   And I'm also skeptical about that blue being a problem.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.680]   And then you just flip the switch and it immediately sort of makes it white white.
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:37.880]   And it's hard to see.
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:41.320]   But in a room when you're actually looking at it in front of you, it does switch from
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.760]   looking like a yellow blue screen to looking like a white piece.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:48.680]   So and we talked about this at Alex, but just let me let's refresh my memory.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:52.560]   Is this something that would be good for photo editing or bad for photo editing?
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:56.120]   I would be tempted to say bad.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.880]   Well, you don't want the colors to shift.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.760]   Here's the issue is that when you color the truth is is that when you color correct a monitor
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:06.920]   for color correction, you are taking into account the ambient light.
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:10.560]   So scientifically it should make it should be the right thing to do because you actually
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:14.760]   that you never want to color correct a monitor somewhere else and bring it to where you're
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:18.640]   at because it will be different for your eyes.
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:24.440]   But that said, having the computer do that for me makes me very cautious, concerned.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:27.920]   Oh, also your eyes adjust to ambient light.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:28.920]   It doesn't.
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:32.720]   But the idea is that you want your eyes and the screen to be in sync so that you've seen
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:33.720]   true color.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:38.080]   I'm a little, but it still concerns me to have it doing that.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.280]   I mean, I just have to play with it some more to see.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:44.480]   The best thing I can describe it is that in before this technology, the weight of the
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:47.440]   bezel, if you had a white iPad, the weight of the bezel would look different than the
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:50.120]   white of the screen because the screen would be bluish or yellowish compared to it.
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:54.000]   When you turn this on, the whites actually look similar again, which is kind of neat.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.480]   So it looks like there's only kind of one white for you to look at.
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.480]   Yeah.
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.320]   So somebody has put a link to a Scientific American article.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:02.640]   It's got the word science in it.
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.280]   So that's a good thing.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.560]   Why blue light is not blinded by your sleep.
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.560]   I'm still skeptical.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.000]   Percy did a really good article for us on this too.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.760]   And she's like, well, she's like, it doesn't really help because most people when they have
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:17.000]   their device on are playing Candy Crush or using Facebook is the problem, not the
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   color of the light.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.240]   You're shining light in your eyes.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.760]   Your eyes are always in.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:24.120]   And I think we didn't really, I think this whole thing about blue and yellow and all
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.920]   that human eyes don't see it.
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:31.720]   You don't suddenly go outside and say, wow, it's blue out here because our eyes adjust.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:36.800]   Well, but what we know now all of a sudden because of cameras, which don't adjust, we
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.640]   know, oh, well, fluorescence are green and that daylight is blue and the insort, the
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:43.560]   indented lights yellow, but your eyes never knew that until cameras.
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:44.800]   Well, until they were trained.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:49.800]   I mean, the thing is that when you do a lot of this, when you're, you can walk into a
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:53.120]   room and I couldn't do it when I, when we started doing a lot of interviews and stuff
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.520]   like that, but now you walk into the room and you look around and you go, oh, that's
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.640]   56 or 42 or 32.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:02.400]   You're not right on, but you can very quickly, you know, if you, if the big thing is, is
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.480]   that as soon as you start measuring it, as soon as you're out there, like looking at
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:11.400]   what is that and your eye starts to calibrate, you know, to outside, inside and so on and
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:14.000]   so forth, you can start to see it pretty quickly.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.080]   You know, about what, what kind of temperature you're in.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:20.640]   The way that I understand it is that your body builds up melatonin during the day and that's
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:23.200]   what helps you fall asleep and stay asleep.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.400]   And the short wavelengths of light, the blue wavelengths actually suppress melatonin and
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:29.040]   build up histamine, which is the, which causes an opposite.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.920]   It's a keep awake sort of a chemical reaction.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.840]   And by shifting down the blue light, now it's arguable whether Apple is doing it enough
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:36.320]   to make any real difference.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.880]   But if you do shift to warmer wavelengths of light, then you're no longer suppressing
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:43.160]   the melatonin and no longer building up the histamine, whether that makes a difference
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.320]   to depends on your overall sleep hygiene and again, playing video games or using social
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:51.720]   networks can be a much more energizing thing than light shining light into your eyes in
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:55.000]   the middle of the night is probably the biggest signal to your body.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.560]   What color the light is probably secondary.
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.000]   But I think there's a scientific.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   There's adrenaline.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   You mean there's also things.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.040]   Yeah, but there's a scientific equilibrium that can be adjusted.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:07.200]   You can use the light or you can just use more whiskey, right?
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.200]   Or take some melatonin.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.200]   There you go.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.240]   Actually, or more whiskey.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:18.880]   I if I want to sleep well, I take Steve Gibson's patented supplement formula that literally
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.520]   just knocks me out.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.520]   It just knocks me out.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:22.520]   You got to take some.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.240]   I find 15 year old.
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.840]   It's about 80 pills worth.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:27.840]   Oh, really?
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:28.840]   Yeah.
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:29.840]   But it's really little black pills?
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.200]   I think you should put them in your McCallen because they're all, you know, just some off
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.560]   just little black pills.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.280]   Stuff them in your ear.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.280]   So that's quieter.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:42.200]   I'm really interested in this topic because in the past couple of months, I've been
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:45.400]   really been trying to address my sleep hygiene.
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:49.960]   My sleep habits because it's it's it's one of those things where you realize that what
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:55.520]   I could get away with at age 22 is not what I can get away with that age two times 22.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:59.040]   And so I've had to really start having the rule where look at midnight one PM doesn't
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.040]   matter what's going on.
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:03.240]   You have to stop what you're doing and go to bed and turn off all the lights.
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.240]   No sound.
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.040]   No, no, no, no screens of any kind.
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.960]   You can't fall asleep watching a movie.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.520]   You have to do this.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:14.080]   And I think that a lot of people are there there, they'll be writing and talking about
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:20.200]   this this new feature of iOS without deciding that no six hours minimum, eight hours optimal
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:24.280]   every night without using like a sleep crack or app to actually look at the numbers.
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:30.000]   Because if if it's worth experimenting with because you have no idea how much of your day
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.920]   you're losing by getting only five hours of sleep the night before or just being keyed
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:37.360]   up up until the moment that you drop off to sleep.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:42.720]   And for me, I have to admit that I won't generally when I get home and I have to get
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:44.720]   I get home from work about eight.
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:50.120]   But I don't open my laptop or my iPad almost ever after I get home.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:55.160]   I'll still respond to stuff on my phone, but it really limits how much I can I can think.
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:14:01.520]   And so I do find it more important than light is to not is to stop interacting with things
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.520]   that I have to make decisions.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.240]   I think that's for me the big thing.
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:09.440]   So Apple's putting a hold on the update to iOS 9.3.
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:11.160]   What's going on Renee?
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:16.240]   So I believe that ended early last night, but they originally iOS 9.3 there was some
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:20.000]   problems with activating some people said older devices, some people had the problem
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   on your devices too.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.680]   But basically the activation system, which is what says this is an authorized device
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:29.920]   and you can open it up and start using it again wasn't working.
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:33.880]   So people weren't able either they were asked for a password they didn't have or they put
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.240]   in their password and it didn't work.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.400]   And it just left the device unactivated after the update.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.240]   So they pushed out a couple of server side fixes.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:44.040]   Apple can do hot fixes on the servers because it's the server team that actually pushes the
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:45.040]   update.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.400]   So they tried a few things very early on and those didn't work.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.560]   So they put out an actual new build number.
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:54.400]   I think they've done two new build numbers now one last Wednesday or Thursday and one
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.000]   I think again last night.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.160]   And as far as I know that's rectified the problem for almost everybody now.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:01.080]   Did we know what the problem I mean why it was happening?
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.840]   It was crashing when you tapped a link.
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:04.160]   That was a separate issue.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:06.280]   So that I don't believe is fixed yet.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.640]   And that, yeah.
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:11.600]   So the original problem was that it just could not authent, it could not activate the device
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:14.560]   whatever the process it was saying to ping Apple's activation servers.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.960]   It wasn't responding in a correct way.
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.120]   And that I believe now is fixed.
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:20.320]   The link issue, people were trying to troubleshoot it.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.640]   So basically you tap a link and nothing would happen and you try to hold down the link in
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.160]   the app would freeze.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:28.600]   And some people traced it down to an app called bookings.com and if you installed that app
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.000]   that's when the problem would start.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.280]   A few people said there might be other apps like it.
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.800]   It sounds like that app was not managing the amount of data it was putting into it and
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:38.360]   just basically overflowing the process.
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:42.440]   But there's apparently a new version of iOS 9.3 is going to come out to address that as
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:43.440]   well.
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:44.440]   So sort of like a roll gap situation.
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.960]   Yeah, because I didn't see that problem.
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:46.960]   I haven't had it.
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:47.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.800]   No, if you didn't have one of those apps installed, it's the URL schemes got overloaded.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:53.440]   If you didn't have apps installed, then you were fine.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.440]   Of course.
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:55.440]   Is that URL scheme?
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.880]   It's a scheme for a reason, Leo.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:59.720]   That again.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:05.560]   That was the one that Samsung was there were swing Samsung over, right?
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.560]   And then they walked.
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:09.040]   Well, that's also the one that people I mean, it was a way to do interrupt communication
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.720]   before there was proper interrupt communication.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:14.680]   So you leave yourself open to a lot of things.
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:19.840]   Not worth any energy, but what do you think of the rumor that not this year, but next
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:25.880]   year, there's going to be a curved glass iPhone 8 with a 5.8 inch AMOLED display.
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:27.160]   I say sure.
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.160]   Yeah, whatever.
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.160]   Ming chi.
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:30.160]   Whoa, baby.
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:31.160]   It's Ming chi.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.160]   Whoa.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:35.640]   If you look at Intel, Intel's making the future is hard and Intel had to shift to a tick
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:39.200]   talk talk cycle this time just to get down to 10 nanometers.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:44.720]   So they're actually doing a Broadwell Skylake, Kaby Lake and Apple usually does a tick talk
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:45.720]   system.
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:48.040]   And if this is true, it means that the talk is not going to be ready.
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:52.280]   So they'll do tick talk talk as well where they get as far as they can this year and
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:54.600]   then push it a step further next year.
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:58.640]   It is the same way it's a miracle that Windows boots up on a million different computers,
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.320]   a million different SKUs every day.
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:03.760]   It's a miracle that Apple gets every single piece of technology ready for a new iPhone
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:04.880]   launch every year.
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:05.880]   So I have no problem.
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:08.840]   I don't have any specific information on this, but I have no problem believing that
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:12.120]   all the time they make more conservative prototypes and more ambitious prototypes.
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:13.120]   Right.
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:16.280]   And if the ambition one doesn't work out because the components are quite ready or they can't
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.880]   produce them at scale, then you get the more conservative one and the year after they try
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:20.880]   again.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:27.560]   But all, you know, like 20 months out, you may see prototypes of all kinds.
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:32.680]   The fact that they exist is in no way indicative of what will be released in the fall of 2017.
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:33.680]   Yeah.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.920]   And what works in a prototype does not mean it works when you make a hundred billion of
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:36.920]   them.
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:40.640]   That's a well, in particular, the AMOLED displays, which Apple has, I mean, really AMOLED
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:45.000]   display, I am of the opinion, AMOLED displays are far superior to the IPS LCD displays Apple
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.600]   uses, but there's a problem.
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:47.600]   There's a problem.
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:48.600]   There's a problem.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:51.960]   The bigger problem is that Apple has 3D touches bound to the LED backlight.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.120]   It measures the deformities.
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.360]   So if you get rid of the LED backlight, they're going to have to figure out a new way to do
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.040]   3D touch with AMOLED.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.960]   The other potential solution though is quantum dot, which some people think is as good as,
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:02.960]   if not better than AMOLED.
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:04.880]   Yeah, we're seeing those on TV now.
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:05.880]   Yeah.
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:06.880]   Yeah.
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:07.880]   No, absolutely.
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:09.960]   But they don't have some of the age out issues that AMOLED displays do.
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:13.440]   But are they ready in time and are they ready at iPhone scale in time?
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.560]   So again, it's really hard to juggle all these things.
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.680]   Like you said, 20 months out.
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:20.480]   I'm such a fan of the AMOLED screen on the Galaxy S7.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:21.960]   It's just gorgeous.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:25.040]   And I would love to see something like that on that new LG television set.
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.680]   Oh, yeah, the new OLED tele, but that's OLED, right?
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.560]   The LG television say, yeah.
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:32.880]   I mean, I've only seen it in the inside the VR.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:33.880]   The Gear VR.
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:36.280]   We have them, but we only got them for the Gear VR.
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:37.280]   Oh, that's right.
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.640]   We see these phones as just like Gear VR screens.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.080]   Apple's using OLED on the Apple watch.
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.680]   I mean, they're not religiously opposed to it.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.480]   It's just that they have certain, like again, 3D touch was dependent on LED.
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:49.640]   You have 4st touch on an Apple watch, so maybe you can do.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:50.640]   They're shooting.
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.000]   So all the stuff that we call 4st touch uses incredibly different technologies on the
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.760]   watch, on the Mac and on the iPhone.
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.240]   OK.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:00.720]   All right.
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:01.920]   Let's see.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:06.560]   It's why you don't have to touch on the iPad because it doesn't work on those super big
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:07.560]   screens yet.
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:10.760]   And the watch only shooting horizontally, and that only works on tiny screens.
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:11.760]   OK.
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:12.760]   All right.
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:13.760]   This stuff is hardly.
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:14.760]   Yeah.
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:15.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.560]   I'm going to do a TV show about app developers.
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.560]   I haven't.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:23.960]   I have seen this headline on many sites, and I've never read farther because it sounds
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:24.960]   so boring.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:25.960]   Read further, Leo.
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:28.680]   The rest of the rest is arguably worse with Will I Am.
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:31.360]   Fame, fame, Blackberry designer.
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:32.360]   Will I Am?
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.320]   Famed on case designer.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:37.600]   Who would watch a TV show about app designers?
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:38.600]   App designers.
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:39.600]   I would.
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:40.600]   I don't know if I'd watch it with Will.
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.600]   I mean, I don't want to be naked with him.
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:44.640]   It sounds like a great idea for a YouTube show.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:45.640]   Is it a reality show?
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:48.400]   What is it?
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.440]   I think it's been him interviewing people and talking to you.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:54.440]   I will say that we've done some shows with Will I Am, and he's actually, he's pretty
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:55.440]   interesting.
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:56.440]   I mean, it'll be interesting to see.
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:02.280]   I mean, the subject matter, I go, but if he gets, if he gets comfort of us, he's actually
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.280]   pretty geeky.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:07.080]   Us doing it, or you doing it, but that would be have a completely different angle that
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.560]   isn't aimed at a mass market.
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:11.360]   It would be, you know, the insides of development.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.440]   We did that all the time.
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:17.720]   But in theory, I don't think any of the snooze has mentioned where the outlet would be for
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:21.560]   the show, but this is the sort of thing that you would think that if Apple wanted to create
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:28.120]   a show and just release it on their own Apple channels, or even just through even God forbid,
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:33.160]   just through YouTube channels or any other sort of public channels, it's a great medium
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:36.480]   for that sort of thing because it's not dependent upon ratings.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:39.160]   It really is just dependent on think space.
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:40.720]   Much like I was watching.
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:46.480]   And I think that we're still seeing between the music stuff that they're working on and
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:51.160]   this is kind of a safe, you know, dipping their toe into this process of how they're
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:52.160]   going to do this and everything else.
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:55.360]   I do think this is the beginning of them doing a lot of original content.
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.360]   Why not?
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.360]   They have the money to do it.
[01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:58.360]   It's crazy.
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:20:59.360]   It drives Apple.
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:01.240]   Like if they do that, they, there was rumors that they were going to do a Dr. Dre.
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:04.400]   Maybe they're confirmed by now a Dr. Dre TV show on Apple music.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:07.680]   And if this is also an Apple music show, then it's very similar to HBO where Netflix,
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:09.720]   where you create programming to drive subscriptions.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:14.160]   And that would explain real I am, who's really best known as a musician.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.160]   Absolutely.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:17.160]   You're a good musician.
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.160]   I love his music.
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:19.160]   Absolutely.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.800]   I've started to think about what if Apple doesn't want even want to do this as an Apple
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:24.800]   specific thing?
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:29.000]   What if they just, what if they want to be producers and they're okay with having making
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.880]   it an Apple exclusive for let's say the first two or three months, but then put it on Hulu,
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:33.880]   put it on Netflix.
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:35.800]   Netflix is a huge player right now.
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:37.680]   They are buying documentaries.
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:40.960]   They are like a top tier buyer of documentaries right now.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.560]   They are the market that these people want to get into.
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.160]   I still don't know.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:49.720]   I still don't know the answer to the question of which sort of non-musician filmmaker or
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:56.000]   TV producer is thinking, I hope we become an Apple exclusive because that's where all
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000]   the audience is.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.080]   That's where all the money is because that's not where any of the money is or any of the
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:01.720]   audiences right now.
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:04.280]   But this sort of thing would certainly fit in with that.
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:06.920]   And if they were to simply say, we're going to produce shows that we think we'd like to
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:12.760]   produce, that sort of fly our flag just like the Apple store flies the Apple flag in malls
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:19.240]   and corners of the street where other people 10 years ago might not have been Apple people
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.760]   might not have been hanging out.
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:25.440]   Maybe this is a way to sort of extend the Apple brand or the Apple way of thinking to
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.280]   the screens that people have to be looking at at the time, even if it's hooked up to
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:29.280]   a Roku box.
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:33.280]   I'm going to go out on a limb here and predict there'll be a lot of shows about the Cayman
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.280]   Islands in Ireland.
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:43.800]   It's just going to be a whole renaissance of filmmaking in the Cayman Islands in Ireland.
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:46.640]   I'm just I'm going to go just predict that.
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:48.960]   How about moving to how to move to the Cayman Islands?
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:49.960]   Stop.
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:51.640]   We didn't have no obligations right now.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.080]   Apple has hundreds of billions of dollars.
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:54.080]   Right.
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:55.080]   Those two things together.
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:56.080]   Right.
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.080]   Absolutely.
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:59.720]   All right, let's take a break and get your picks ready.
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:03.280]   Gentlemen, and then we're going to cut into a pretty fine looking cake.
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.120]   Yum.
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:08.320]   I've been smelling it all during the show and we'll turn the Ozo back on.
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.320]   Yes.
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:10.320]   Maybe it's up to you.
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.320]   Yes.
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.800]   We've already got 24 hours of rendering in can.
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.440]   I got a bunch of computers.
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.440]   He owes Mac.
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:17.440]   He was free.
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:19.040]   Yeah, you can use my Mac Pro.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:21.600]   No, no, it's busy running three Minecraft instances.
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.240]   A mail server, a wiki.
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.520]   I actually spent 20, but actually maybe that okay.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:27.280]   I got a pick and a home theater.
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:28.280]   I got a pick.
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:30.200]   No, I know use it for my home theater.
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:32.840]   Next I use an Xbox one for my home theater.
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:35.920]   Our show today brought to you by magazines.
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:38.000]   Well, not your grandpa's magazines.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000]   I love magazines.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000]   I love magazines.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.320]   There's great articles.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:45.720]   The problem with magazines is, you know, there's one or two articles in every New Yorker,
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:51.760]   every Esquire, every Vanity Fair, every Rolling Stone, every time, but I don't want to subscribe
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:55.520]   to all those magazines and I certainly don't want to buy an issue, one issue on the news
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:56.520]   stand.
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:57.520]   That would be hundreds of dollars a month.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:01.960]   Well, for the cost of a couple of issues in the news stand a month, you can have every
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:02.960]   magazine.
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:06.160]   You can have all of them with texture.
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.920]   Texture is like Netflix for magazines.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:15.680]   Now you can binge read instead of binge watch the greatest magazines.
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:20.280]   They have the full magazine is in your texture app on your iPad or your iPhone.
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:24.240]   You can start the magazines you want to read every time they come out and they'll automatically
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:26.520]   appear on your device.
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:30.240]   You have current issues, but you also have back issues and you have bonus features you
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:33.280]   can't do in print like video with texture.
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:37.800]   You get the magazines you know and love plus exclusive features and video magazines like
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:40.600]   Men's Health and Wired and Interview.
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:44.600]   You really got to try the free trial because you got to see all the magazines.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:45.600]   It's so great.
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.760]   You'll find new stuff too.
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:51.320]   I mean, I'm not going to buy or subscribe to Billboard, but you know, that's actually
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:55.320]   quite fascinating to see what the music was going on in the music industry every week.
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:56.320]   I think it's great.
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:57.320]   It's just great to be able to get.
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.440]   I mean, you know that I was I think we've talked about before.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:00.440]   You're a magazine junkie.
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.480]   I love magazines.
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:04.440]   But I just got to a point where I don't want to carry around the paper.
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:05.440]   So this is the solution.
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:06.440]   This is the solution.
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:07.440]   Bulging.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:10.680]   And there's just stuff you're not going to find on Flipboard, which is look they got
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:11.680]   wood.
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:13.480]   That says wood magazine.
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:16.000]   And now we have a title.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:22.960]   So the yeah, there's so many of these good things that you just not you it's great content.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:23.960]   National technology.
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.920]   You're not going to see it on a great audio file magazine.
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.480]   I love looking at stereo equipment.
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:30.240]   I can't afford it so much fun.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:31.800]   Shutter bug.
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:33.320]   Here's the deal.

[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:15.200]   It's on.
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:19.360]   It's time to immerse you.
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:22.320]   Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week this week is that big round ball.
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:24.800]   What's that thing coming out of the back?
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:28.360]   So that is the battery and the memory.
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:31.080]   What's coming out of the back there is that a dead spot then?
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:32.080]   It's not really.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:36.040]   There is a little bit of a cavity behind it, right behind it, which is actually useful.
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:39.200]   You put mics and all kinds of stuff back there.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:42.680]   Each lens is I think 192 degrees.
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:48.080]   It actually closes in behind it pretty quickly.
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:49.760]   This is the Nokia Ozo.
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.200]   It does run on a Mac.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:52.200]   It's good for Mac break.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.400]   In case you're wondering all the controls.
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:57.240]   So you said you get SDI out of it.
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:58.840]   So it's a, yeah, it's a.
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:00.800]   It's how would you get that for a Mac?
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:06.680]   So you actually, we look, we can preview it and I think that they can show it, but the
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:13.640]   preview, but we can preview it with a regular SDI cable into a like a little mini recorder,
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.360]   like a black magic mini recorder.
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:17.240]   And so you can see it all there.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:19.760]   And so we can preview it there from the Mac.
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:21.200]   We can shade the cameras.
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:24.440]   We can make adjustments, change a lot of the things.
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:27.720]   So it's the control, you know, is all done through that.
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:30.520]   The Mac, my laptop can actually sync up.
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:35.680]   There's a Wi-Fi inside of the camera so that I can't see all the feeds, but I can control
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:40.800]   the camera, start record, stop record, do all those things from a laptop.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:43.800]   So it's, it's, it's, it's pretty cool.
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:50.480]   And anyway, so it is, in my opinion, and again, we have a lot of rigs.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.480]   We've been doing VR stuff.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:56.160]   We've been doing 360 photos for, I've been doing for 20 years.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:00.080]   Video for the last two years, streaming for the last year and a half and, or the last
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:01.080]   year.
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:05.480]   And this is the closest thing to just like a camera that you turn on and it works, you
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:08.920]   know, and so we're just testing it right now, but it's really excited about it.
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:11.440]   It is $60,000.
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:14.520]   You know, it's, it's a production camera.
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:18.280]   Like this is, you know, this is, it's, it seems like a lot.
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:22.320]   And again, what I said earlier is it's not how much something costs as much as it is,
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:23.320]   how much.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:25.320]   85.7 Alex's.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:26.320]   Right.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.320]   Yeah.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:32.800]   So, so the, anyway, yeah, so the, there, yeah, there you go.
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.320]   There's your little kit in the nice pelican case.
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.720]   That's a nice pelican case.
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:39.400]   And you know, the, the, you know, you can run and gun with it.
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:44.640]   So what it means, what I mean by that is that you can take all this tethering that we
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:47.160]   have off and it'll run for, I think about 45 minutes.
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:49.840]   And so you can just put it on a tripod, put it on a jib, put it on something.
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:55.280]   Oh, you know, so, so again, with all the other cameras that we've been playing with, it,
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:57.240]   that takes some effort.
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:58.240]   Yeah.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:02.840]   You know, you're, you're either going to either always has to be connected or you, you know,
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:05.680]   with a GoPro, you know, you know, we use a lot of GoPros.
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:06.680]   We have lots of them.
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:10.760]   We have GoPro rigs, but there's lots of little SD cards and you're pulling them all off and
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:11.760]   keeping track of them all.
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:15.960]   And you know, this is just recording and you pull it off and, and you can then, you know,
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:19.120]   deal with it and everything's synced up and I shouldn't slump while you're talking because
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.120]   people can still see me.
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:22.120]   You get away from it.
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:23.120]   Yeah.
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.520]   So I was picking my nose.
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:26.520]   So there's no privacy.
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:27.520]   Yeah.
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:31.840]   So anyway, so the, but yeah, it's not, it's an investment.
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:33.400]   This is, this is a professional camera.
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:34.400]   This is not going to be.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:38.800]   But it's an investment that I think, you know, I, first of all, it's going to come down.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:42.960]   And I really think this is kind of in many ways the future of our shows in particular,
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.600]   these kind of round table shows.
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:45.600]   Yeah.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.600]   It's a great way to watch.
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:49.360]   Well, when we're designing one of the things we're testing with this camera and with a
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:53.680]   couple of other cameras is really testing building shows around the idea of this so
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:58.120]   that you feel like you can sit at the table or around with us.
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:03.040]   You could make a rap show about Alexander Hamilton or something.
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.480]   And then, and then put it on the stay.
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:10.120]   I really would love to see a Broadway show where you're not in the audience looking through
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:14.640]   a proscenium arch at the performance, but you're sitting on the stage.
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:16.640]   Oh, this is the view.
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:17.640]   All right.
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:18.640]   This is me making fun.
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:19.640]   Oh, you loser.
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:25.640]   This is a fake view that has been created by our technical director, Jason Clyanthes.
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:30.000]   No, but that would be, I mean, even theater would be really interesting.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.400]   And I'm really excited about, and one of the things we want to start doing tests with
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:38.680]   with cameras like this is the idea of when I always think of the Birdman, you know, where
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:40.720]   they have that kitchen scene.
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:44.480]   And you know, you want to sit up there at the table and sit there and watch as if you
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:45.480]   were in.
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:49.400]   But the idea is, is how do we design the play around that?
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:51.800]   You know, like, or take a play and convert it to this.
[01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:59.560]   What can happen is now a point of view is really changing because normally a director
[01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:05.720]   and actors and everything in a movie or a TV show or even on a stage, although a stage
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:11.520]   is a little different, but they direct your attention with this theater is nice because
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:16.000]   you can watch something else while it's going on.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.360]   But I love the idea.
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:19.720]   We always thought it'd be really fun to do.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:27.120]   All of our shows have a multi-camera kind of switcher that you could switch yourself.
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:31.920]   But this would be even better because you can naturally look around and want to see Renee's
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:37.640]   reaction as Alex says something, you can look at Renee.
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:38.640]   There it is.
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:39.640]   There's the Birdman.
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:40.640]   Interesting.
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:44.960]   And what you're really choosing at this point would be where do you stand for that scene?
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:47.040]   And then we put you somewhere else where you stand on the scene.
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:48.040]   Yeah, you have to rethink it.
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:52.880]   And you might have things, you know, the Gear VR has a Cirque du Soleil performance.
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:53.880]   Trying to get this is exciting.
[01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:54.880]   Where isn't it great?
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:57.680]   And that's an example because there's stuff going on all around you.
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:59.280]   It's like a three-ring circus.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:02.720]   And so what you look at determines what performance you're seeing.
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:04.520]   And each time you do it, you can do a different performance.
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:08.840]   Well, and the other thing that we're thinking about is also how to layer this into a 360
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:12.360]   experience that you might want to, rather than making it two hours long, we might want
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:15.200]   to make it or try to just direct you with sound or whatever.
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:20.600]   What if we are thinking about you're watching this the first time this way, but you know
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:25.040]   that now maybe I should watch it looking over here, see how that affected this.
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:29.080]   Or you know, and so you're literally can do it over and over and over again.
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.800]   So, so much of the attention of VR is going towards gaming.
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:34.680]   And as the Oculus Rift comes out this week and people start getting it.
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:36.920]   And what you do with it is you play games.
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:41.880]   But I think really it's an interesting way to have immersed, be immersed in a scene and
[01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:42.880]   be part of a scene.
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:43.880]   It is.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:46.920]   And I think the reason that it's for gaming right now is because that's the easy, I mean
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:50.480]   it's easier, which is that you don't have to deal with these all these cameras and you
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:54.760]   don't have to deal with all the layering and you know, because it's still not perfect.
[01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:58.120]   Even with this camera, you're going to have little seams and someone gets too close from
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:59.120]   the back.
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:00.680]   You'll see that or here's my experience.
[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:04.920]   Yes, for instance on the Gear VR, you can see the screen door because you're close so
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:06.600]   close to that screen as good as the screen is.
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:12.680]   You can see the pixels, but you quickly lose sight of that because the experience is so
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:14.480]   engaging.
[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:19.400]   And so I think that the flaws really kind of go to the background pretty darn quickly.
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:22.600]   Well, and also the some of the tests that we've seen some other folks working on as
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:26.520]   well that are some of our partners is what if you have your in there and then you want
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:29.760]   to bring out you know, like I want more data like I'm watching.
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:35.240]   We did some tests with PGA tour and which we talked about it, South by Southwest and
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:39.520]   one of the things we looked at in the future is that I could have the rankings.
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:43.760]   I'm watching it, but I could go like this with a controller or whatever and bring in
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:48.680]   the you know, I can look at a heads up display on top of my streaming video and see where
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:51.480]   that golfer is and how many feet is going in front of them.
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:53.000]   And so there's a lot of things that I can add to it.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.680]   It's not that I can just be in this experience.
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:56.080]   I can have all kinds of other experiences.
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:00.920]   I can even have my email or my SMS popping up in front of me while I'm watching.
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:06.240]   It does have to make you rethink though things like television studios, which are movie sets
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:10.120]   which are very carefully designed to use the cameras of framing mechanism.
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:11.840]   And outs you go right outside the camera.
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:12.840]   It's garbage.
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:13.840]   Yeah.
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:18.280]   And so we really can't this set is actually a good example of something that's not that
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:19.280]   way.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:21.760]   We really wanted to make it a three or six degree set.
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:25.160]   But most TV studios are you know, and actually.
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:28.200]   I just think about what happens if I move this camera a little bit that way or a little
[01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:29.200]   bit that way.
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:30.200]   Exactly.
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:31.200]   Exactly.
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:32.200]   And I also that news.
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:35.600]   Well, and I also think that one of the things that interesting for this that we we're looking
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:38.800]   at is also the idea of an extra for movies.
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:44.560]   So you know, wouldn't it be really cool to see a Hobbit shot, you know, or or a Matrix
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:47.240]   shot or a Star Wars shot where you're able to.
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:48.240]   Well, that's going to happen.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:50.040]   It was going to happen this year soon.
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:53.680]   And so what's going to happen is that oh, when you're watching the DVD or you're watching
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:56.880]   the thing on iTunes, you're going to be able to go, Oh, I want to do something a little
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:00.600]   pops up and you click on it, you know, like the white rabbit in the old Matrix.
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:01.600]   Right.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:03.680]   And you suddenly pop into what it looked like when they were shooting it.
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:08.480]   You know, that type of thing is, you know, I would love to see the VR applied to the
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:10.840]   like the white rabbit tour in the Matrix.
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:13.920]   If no one's seen the white rabbit tour, I would suggest it.
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:17.400]   You know, it's also the cases that gamers are already used to this because when you're
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:20.840]   playing a first person shooter, you do control the camera.
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.880]   You can look or Minecraft for that matter.
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:24.640]   You can look over your back behind you.
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:25.640]   You can look all around.
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:29.320]   So we're already in an immersive 360 degree world, much like our normal world.
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:32.680]   This is an easy, I think this is easy to make this next step.
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:37.640]   Well, thank you for making this possible and bringing along the Ozo from Anokia.
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:39.880]   And it's a pick, but you can't get it yet, right?
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:40.880]   I mean, you can.
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:42.240]   They are on sale though.
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:44.040]   You can get one.
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:45.560]   They just got one on sale, I think last week.
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:48.920]   So they're they're they're they're shiny and brand new.
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:51.520]   They're selling like Teslas.
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:55.520]   A lot of people that are buying them right now are rental companies, you know, some production
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:56.520]   companies and a lot of rental companies.
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:57.600]   That's a good idea.
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:00.440]   You could go to somebody like B&H and say I'd like to rent the Ozo for a day.
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:04.440]   Maybe not B&H, but somebody like high end like high end rental companies that you know,
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:08.400]   you know, that are getting one to I mean, I was talking to somebody who bought one and
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:09.920]   then they got then they got three.
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:13.520]   Because they're already paid the first one off, you know, because right now everyone
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:18.160]   wants to try it and they'll spend the thousand dollars a day to give it a shot.
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:21.160]   The Ozo from Nokia, a great pick.
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:22.720]   You've outdone yourself, my friend.
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:23.840]   I think that's my record.
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:25.280]   I think it is the records.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.280]   85.7.
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:32.680]   Alex's Andy Enoco, your pick of the week.
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:36.160]   Maybe this is one a not go because this is free.
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:38.240]   It costs you nothing.
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:43.280]   Google's Nick collection, which is a fantastic collection of photo plugins is now free free
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:44.280]   free.
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:49.680]   This company had this amazing collection of professional photo filters that works with
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:54.000]   Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Lightroom and anything else that works with Adobe plugins.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.360]   When there was an independent company, it cost 500 bucks.
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:59.520]   When they acquired the company, they charge 150 bucks for it.
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:01.560]   And last week they decided, okay, screw it.
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:04.080]   It's now free to download half.
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:05.720]   It's a 500 megabyte download.
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:10.440]   You get the complete collection of these six, seven different plugins.
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:12.200]   And they're all really fantastic.
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:17.400]   Do not make your beautiful wedding photo look like it was shot with a Polaroid camera and
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:19.680]   then dumped on by your dog.
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:20.840]   It really is.
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:24.560]   So much of this is something I was doing with one of my Yosemite pictures.
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:27.480]   This is their Silver FX Pro.
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:32.200]   I was actually in Lightroom and then in Photoshop trying to get exactly that effect that's half
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:35.760]   dome and I wanted to get like that lighter section look really, really light.
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:38.000]   I'm on the darker sections, really, really dark.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.680]   And I couldn't just by twiddling knobs in either of these two apps get it done.
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:43.960]   Then I remember that this thing was free.
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:50.240]   I downloaded, installed it and about 10 seconds later, mostly by picking out of a lineup on
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:53.760]   the 12 samples that it generated for me and then tweaking it.
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:56.400]   It gave me exactly the results I want.
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:00.680]   And this is actually as I'm trying to get better photography, you learn that a lot of
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:05.360]   what you think is, well, the reason why that person got that effect is because they were
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:07.960]   genius using some of the best equipment.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:12.680]   And some of it is, oh, well, the reason why there's haze and noteness, your photo is
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:16.040]   a little bit hazy and there isn't a whole lot of sharpness is because you didn't know
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:20.200]   the technique for removing the haze and adding sharpness to it.
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:24.280]   And these plugins will let you sort of add that sort of thing in without having to take
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:26.200]   two years for the Photoshop lessons.
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:27.200]   So it's free, free, free.
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:30.480]   It'll just cost you half a gigabyte of storage and boys at worth it.
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:33.680]   The only downside is that these, there is now a lot of speculation.
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:37.920]   Well, if Google's giving this away for free, maybe they don't care about it anymore.
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:42.640]   And the press release, excuse me, the blog post that they released alongside this mentions
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:46.000]   things like, well, now that we're putting most of our attention into these other photo
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.280]   products, we decided to make these tools free, which indicates that if you're waiting for
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:53.160]   an update to any of these anytime soon, you'll be waiting.
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.160]   I am anyway.
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:55.160]   I am anyway.
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:56.160]   Free, free, free.
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:57.160]   Sorry.
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:58.160]   I've used all of them.
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:00.160]   There's a HDR tool.
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:01.160]   There's a silver effect.
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:05.000]   The silver effect is the single best monochrome plug-in ever.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.560]   I mean, it's the one everybody uses.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:07.560]   It's incredible.
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:10.880]   So especially, I'm using it, of course, with a really nice camera.
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:16.040]   But these, I'm getting a much better appreciation for how useful these things are on halfway
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:17.960]   decent phone cameras.
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:22.280]   Because if you're an iPhone, it takes really, really good 12 megapixel pictures.
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:25.480]   But the only complaint that you have is that, well, of course, in low lights, a little bit
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:28.440]   noisy, well, here's a filter that will remove that noise.
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:31.760]   And you're thinking, oh, but I just wish that I zoomed in a little bit, but now it looks
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:32.760]   a little bit blurry.
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:33.760]   Well, this will reduce that.
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:38.680]   And this will add the tonality that is missing from a really tiny image sensor camera.
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:44.920]   Really, I've been throwing my Nexus 5X photos at this and almost any complaint that I have
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:49.480]   about the photos I've been taking are mostly negated when I start applying these third-party
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:50.480]   filters.
[01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:52.280]   And for free package, it's just a no-brainer.
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:56.280]   I mean, the harness pressure goes on as people who sell these kind of things that there's
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:58.400]   something that this will do most of what you do for free.
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:00.600]   I'm a thriller, and I paid 300 bucks for it.
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:01.600]   I did too.
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.680]   And I'm thrilled to see it for free now.
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:06.480]   They bought when they bought Nick, they also got Snap Seat, which they've been giving
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:07.480]   away.
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:08.760]   And that's the one they've been updating.
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:12.400]   And that actually is a phenomenal iPhone and Android.
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:16.000]   My guess is what they're going to do is keep on using the technologies that were in all
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.200]   of those plugins in future product without dealing with the individual apps, which would
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:21.200]   be very googly.
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:26.720]   Can I say bravo to Google for Apple has bought a lot of apps and then because they want
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:31.400]   the people or they want the technology, and then the app itself goes away, bravo to them
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:36.840]   for after--okay, after charging 150 bucks for years, deciding that, you know what, maybe
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:39.080]   there are people who would like to use HyperCard for something.
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:42.360]   We don't know what it's useful for, but instead of just throwing it away, we're just going
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:43.360]   to start making it free.
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:44.360]   And if you want it, here it is.
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:45.360]   Download it.
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:49.080]   So it'd be nice if Apple had that kind of attitude about a lot of their other apps.
[01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:53.880]   As difficult as it is, I know, to keep these things up to date for modern iOS and Mac OS.
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:57.520]   And IK is how you spell it, NIC software, and what is it?
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:59.480]   Google.com/NIC, probably, huh?
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:02.560]   Google.com/NIC collection, N-I-K-C-L-L-E-C-T-I-O-N.
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.560]   Good pick.
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:06.760]   Really good choice.
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:09.240]   Renee Ritchie, your pick of the week.
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:10.240]   You know what it is, Leo?
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:12.160]   Apple found a way to get me to buy more.
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:13.160]   [laughter]
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:14.160]   Watch band.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:15.160]   So this is the Black--
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:16.160]   How many is this total?
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:17.960]   It must be 20, I mean, this is the Black Milanese.
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:21.600]   It's got the same diamond like coating as the Black Link bracelet, and it looks really
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:22.600]   good.
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.680]   It's a phone's chain mail.
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:27.640]   It's hard to show on this camera, but they also release these really nice--
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:30.760]   The sports bands are great, but after a while, a sports band is a sports band, which shows
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:34.200]   just how if you scratch my surface, you find more surface.
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:37.000]   But they have these great new woven nylon bands.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.520]   They come with a variety of colors.
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:42.480]   They even have colored lugs on them, and they're the same price as the sports band.
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:43.480]   They're like 50 bucks.
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:49.080]   There's white, there's black, there's yellow, and they're just really bright, really light.
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:55.640]   Do not waterproof like the floral last summer sports bands, but they're water resistant.
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:57.760]   So if you splash them, it's not a big deal.
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:41:59.280]   But they really give a nice--
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:03.040]   There's a deuterne to them, it's some texture, there's some color to them.
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:04.040]   And they work really nice.
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:05.720]   I've bought, I think, four of them.
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:07.640]   So far, I only bought two of them with me today.
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:12.640]   But it's just another nice way to change up the watch, and it's so easy to do that I
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:15.240]   was changing it almost daily for the last week.
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:17.160]   And they're not-- These are less expensive, aren't they?
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:18.400]   They're 50 bucks.
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:19.400]   Yeah.
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:21.080]   And they drop the price of the Apple Watch, too.
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:23.800]   The Apple Watch sport, at least, they drop the price.
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:26.720]   If you've been interested in an Apple Watch, it's cheaper than ever to get into it.
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:27.800]   And it comes with these bands now.
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:30.720]   You can get pairings with these bands, which is really nice.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.440]   I guess I should get one of these nylon bands.
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:35.360]   Yeah, for exercise, too.
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:36.360]   Well, that's the point--
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:39.720]   Well, I didn't want the rubber one, so I thought maybe the nylon would be a little better.
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:40.720]   We're still supposed to--
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:41.720]   And they breathe really nicely.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:43.720]   I haven't found anything else I wanted.
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:44.720]   Yeah.
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:48.280]   Next time I'm going to comic on, I'm going to hand someone a picture of you and commission
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:51.720]   like a painting of you as Sean Connergan-Zardoz.
[01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:52.720]   Only you're wearing--
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:53.720]   They're all made out of like one band.
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:54.720]   Watch band the layers.
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:56.560]   I feel as though you can actually do that.
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:58.200]   You have enough bands right now, Renee.
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:42:59.200]   Oh, I speak.
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:02.800]   I have all my watch bands, and I'm wearing them as a robe.
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:03.800]   Perfect.
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:05.920]   Perfect.
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:08.600]   My pick is actually something that--
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:09.920]   Hey, we've known about for a long time.
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:15.800]   Remember, Apple killed the server version of OS X some years ago.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:21.920]   I'm running my Mac Pro as a server with just regular OS X and it's running just fine.
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:26.960]   But I went online and I saw, oh, wait a minute, they're selling OS X server for 20 bucks on
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:28.920]   the app store.
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:30.360]   And it is--
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:35.480]   Look, it's-- Apple, the Mac comes with all the stuff you need to run a server, and it's
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:39.760]   easy enough if it doesn't to use brew or Mac ports or something to install it.
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:44.480]   But what this gives you is a very easy way to start and stop services.
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:50.080]   And of course, adds all of the Apache and PHP and all the things you need to run a website.
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:57.160]   It comes with a built-in website and wiki that's very easy to use VPN, X-San 4, and the
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:58.800]   control panel is very easy to control.
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:02.440]   And actually, this is a pretty good deal for 20 bucks.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:03.440]   I was happy I bought it.
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:08.440]   It made it a lot easier for me to maintain and run my server to the backups I need.
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:12.640]   And I'm now going to put more services on that thing because I've actually got a pretty
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:15.640]   solid server running out of my house.
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:19.040]   Now I can-- you can put a mail server-- mail server comes with it.
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:20.880]   You can do all sorts of stuff.
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:21.880]   Time machine backup.
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:24.640]   You can use it as a calendar or a contacts server.
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:25.640]   I love the wiki.
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:26.640]   I'm a big wiki fan.
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:30.560]   And having a nice wiki available that makes it very easy to do, you know, have shared
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:31.560]   notes and things.
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:33.960]   And we love running server on little minis.
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:34.960]   Right.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:35.960]   Those are great.
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:36.960]   Right.
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:41.520]   Pretty impressive deal for 20 bucks.
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:43.520]   A lot of one star reviews.
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:45.440]   I'm not sure why.
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:47.360]   I'm not sure what people don't like about it.
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:49.120]   I think it was an error in one of the first things.
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:50.480]   It was buggy maybe.
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:51.480]   That's hilarious.
[01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:52.480]   But I have not had a problem at all.
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:54.160]   It's been very reliable.
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:57.560]   So I thought I'd mention it.
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:58.880]   Maybe you didn't know about that.
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:01.280]   20 bucks on the Mac App Store.
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:03.200]   Well, this has been a great 500th episode.
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:06.200]   I want to thank all of you for being here.
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:12.680]   Alex Lindsay who's here on episode one and most of the episodes in between Andy and
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:15.280]   Oco has been with us for 10 years as well.
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:16.280]   Has it been 10?
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:19.680]   It must have been a lesson that I think probably about eight.
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:20.680]   Yeah, eight and nine.
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:21.680]   We should.
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:24.000]   I should have called Merlin and Scott and gotten them back on.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000]   Yeah.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000]   Call them.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000]   We'll get them.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000]   501.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:29.000]   501 cake for us.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:30.000]   Yes.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.000]   Take either more cake for us.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000]   I don't know.
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.400]   Actually more cake for me and Alex.
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:36.400]   Not for us Leo.
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:38.200]   I will only for all of you.
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:40.120]   I'm eating for eight now.
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:43.520]   I'm Renee Richie from iMore.com.
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:47.000]   Really the best panel of all panels.
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:52.320]   I mean just the best smartest, most interesting people talking about Apple today.
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:53.320]   So I'm really glad you're here.
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:54.960]   The most fun two hours I have every single day.
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:55.960]   I know.
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:59.160]   I don't like the "Mrs. Show" because I just enjoy talking to you guys for two hours.
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:00.160]   Same here.
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:01.160]   Thanks for joining us everybody.

[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:29.680]   One of the top shows still to this day.
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:33.400]   We've been around long enough to gain a pretty big audience.
