[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   and we're going to analyze the new iOS 9, the new OS 10 El Capitan.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   We're going to talk about WatchOS. A lot to talk about.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   The details coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Andy Inaco is here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   And it's so nice to start my day looking into your shining, smiling 8-bit graphics.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Well, God, I was considering going 6-bit, but I put an extra 2-bit in there just for you Leo.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Those are 10-bits.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   How nice.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   I never counted them, but there's just enough, not too many, not too few.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   We focus group the hell out of this.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Also with us, of course, is always Renee Richie from iMore.com.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Good to see you, Renee.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I have a turn from WWDC, Leo.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   You're back in Montreal.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I am, but I have my tasteful WC jacket to keep you from.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Let me see.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   That's pretty.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Yeah, they did a good...
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   It's in San Francisco.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   SF, not the compact version either.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   This is the full version.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Boy, I can't do stuff on camera.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And that's a gimme, right?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   You don't have to buy that.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   They give you that.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Well, if you get the developer ticket, you get it.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   To say that it's free wouldn't really be fair because the ticket's expensive.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   No, absolutely.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Also here.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Let's warm.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Go ahead.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   It's warm.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Is it toasty?
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Even Montreal warm?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I was wearing it because it's raining today and it's actually water.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   It's not like one of the cloth ones.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   This is like a water slick or something.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   They've upgraded.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   It's a little rubbery, right?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Yes.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Yeah, I have one like that.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Yeah, I like those.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Really nice.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And also back from WWDC and also from I'm or Serenity Caldwell in her Boston digs.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Hello, Serenity.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Hi, Leo.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   How are you doing?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Good to see you.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   What is that license plate in your new office?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   What is that?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   In my new office.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   What is it?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   That says R2 D2 and eight.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It was made by a friend of mine who I skate with.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Is his name Nate?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   No, no, my skater name is R2 D2 Nate.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Oh, she made me an R2 D2 plate.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Oh, she's not legal for my car because Massachusetts doesn't let you have numbers and letters interspersed like that.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Oh, but it's still pretty cool.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Does she work in a prison?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   How could she?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   She works at the R&B.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   I don't know.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I don't know.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   It seems like you probably shouldn't be able to buy license plate.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Maybe we can get that part out just in case.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Oh, Lordy, Lordy.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   We also want to mention as we begin the show that the new website is up.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   So if you're going, or are you watching us on our new website, Twitter.tv/live, that's why it looks different.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And I invite everybody watching to bang on it as hard as possible.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   I just got a message from our engineers at Four Kitchens who designed and did the under the hood stuff on the site.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   They really built a beautiful site.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   They're watching and they have their hands on the dinos ready to turn them up.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   There literally is a dial that they can turn off.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Right?
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   There's a dino dial.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Regular traffic?
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Ridiculous.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I hope it's an actual mechanical dial that they've hooked up with an Arduino or something.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   There's a point at which you need to put on rubber gloves and put your both hands on this big leaf switch and just slam it down.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   It's staying very responsive despite the fact that people are hitting it.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I'm told by our engineers that actually, MacRill said it gets faster.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   The more people visit it because we're using a Redis cache, which is apparently very, you know, aggressively caches it as you load the pages.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   And it's faster than the node.js front end, which is running at Heroku.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   So cache away.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   You're speeding us up.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   As you visit, the site actually gets faster.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Is that weird or what?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I didn't even know that was possible.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   It's an amazing thing.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   The other thing about the site that's important to us was it's very mobile responsive.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   It fits very nicely on any size screen.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   They really did a nice job of that.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   And so we invite you to visit it on your iPad and your iPhone and all your other devices and see how it looks to you.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Ah, let's see.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   We're kind of in a WWDC lull now, right?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   At the aftermath.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Hangover?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   No, it's even better the week after because, like, on Tuesday, we're all just -- we are literally listening to the Internet.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   We're all just -- we are literally in the after goal.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   I was like, "Oh, my God.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Can you imagine how cool the iPad is going to be in October?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   We get multiple apps?"
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And then a week later, we're like having thought about it a little bit more.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Now there's new concerns that come up.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   As we discover that there's a cache -- there's a cache initiative that has not been addressed, at least not in the materials that I've been privy to, which --
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Basically, you have to pay for your enthusiasm last week.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I was like, "I'm still quite objective."
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   So, let's go back.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Now that the reality distortion field, a little of the air has left out of it, let's go back and take a look at it and think about what we have learned here.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   In hindsight, Drake was amazing.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Love that, Drake.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Well, for instance, I think the biggest thing everybody's talking about is Apple TV.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   You know, they didn't mention it at all.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   They did about 30 seconds on HomeKit.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   What does that mean, Renee?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Is Apple TV still coming?
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   I mean, I always take issue with the word "delayed" if Apple hasn't announced anything.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Maybe you could say "punted."
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   The Apple TV is really curious because inside America, there seems to be this real desire to have content, to have live TV, to have sports.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And maybe there's a group of people who believes that the absolute bottom line includes the content and the box alone is not enough.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Internationally, we never get the content that you enjoy in America.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   We don't have HBO now still.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   So to us, the box is the bottom line, and it seems very frustrating that we have to wait just for American content deals.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   But if you want to make a box that can compete for input one on American televisions, then those deals are suddenly important.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Those deals, there was indications those deals hadn't been signed yet.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   So probably rather than present just a box or just a box and an SDK, that decision was made to wait and hopefully...
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Because Apple is an incredibly patient company, so wait and maybe hopefully wait to the fall when they have those deals signed.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   It's too bad though.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I mean, the iPad Air 2, I've been saying that it's suspiciously overpowered for what it could do in the fall of 2014, but you could see that they were teeing it up for what they knew was going to come at some point next year, maybe a year and six months at the very latest.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   I just think it's too bad that Apple is really setting a really clear message, "Don't buy an Apple TV.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   We're not giving you any reason whatsoever to buy an Apple TV.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   You'd be a fool to buy an Apple TV."
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Not because they're going to abandon it and knowing things that's true, but everybody knows that there's going to be new faster hardware and whatever they do next is almost certainly going to require new hardware.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   So it's just I don't have enough understanding of how the development of that is working to know what's going on.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   I wish I did because it just seems so weird to simply not say we're new.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Not to simply say we're going to put in a new... Everything's going to be faster on this.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   We have a new CPU.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   We've got some other new hardware that I fixed it.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   It's going to discover but we're not going to announce.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   I just don't know why they're just simply saying, essentially saying we don't care until we tell you that we do care.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Interesting because there's an argument we made that 4K television isn't that compelling yet because it's got single digit adoption and broadband really isn't fast enough than enough places to make iTunes 4K make sense.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   If there is an SDK, people will pay candy crush on their TV.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   But as you saw from the Xbox and PS4 announcements, maybe games alone aren't compelling enough.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   So I can understand, I have a background in marketing, how you really want to be able to say, look, this is all your TV dreams come true and by the way here's a box that makes it work.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   But for those of us who just want the box, like Annie says, super frustrating.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Is it relevant or important that Sony at E3 yesterday announced they're going to do a Ola Cart TV on the PlayStation?
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   This is PlayStation President Group CEO Andrew House, starting in July, will be offering an Ola Cart channel or Ola Cart channels nationwide and will be the first pay TV service to allow users to subscribe to individual channels without the purchase of a multi-channel bundle.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Now I imagine that the PlayStation 4 is probably not, you know, well I don't know, I mean there's millions of them.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   But this is exactly like what Apple would have announced last year.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   If they simply decided that we don't care about releasing an Ola Cart package when we think it's ready, we just want to make sure it's out right now because it's certainly good news, but you look at what's going to be available at launch and what is a soccer network and a brand new channel that has never existed before with machine remote content.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   And that's not going to get real excited about something.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Yeah, that's expensive, $70 a month for the elite version of this called Vue VUE.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And it's only available in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia and San Francisco.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   And three channels to start for $70 a month.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Video Toronto for the last 10 years has been doing, when I first got it, it was $30 for 30 channels on Ola Cart.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   And yeah, that's quirky Quebec, you know, business practices, but there are previously models for this stuff.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   They will have Showtime at $11 a month. But you know, a lot of people have Showtime app.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Of course, I guess you have to have a cable company subscription.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   So that's the point.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   So messy.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   You also got to reflect on the fact that anything that Sony offers through their network is almost certainly going to be offered to Apple TV, to Roku, to everything else.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Remember how excited that we all were when HBO now came to Apple TV.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And then of course, was it like two and a half weeks later when it was offered as an Ola Cart as a separate subscription option for pretty much everything else.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   So yeah, presumably of course, now Sony is in the business.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   So they're, you know, they're talking to their friends.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Presumably though, anything Sony could do, anybody else could do.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   So this just makes this just makes it more likely to happen sooner.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   It's just another horse in the race.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Nothing for Apple to worry about, right?
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Not that I really think about.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   I mean, honestly, this is the only thing that Apple needs to worry about.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Is getting the box out there.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Hopefully by the end of this year.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Because at a certain point, even the dot, like the only reason I have an Apple TV and not a Roku at this point is AirPlay and now home kit functionality.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   But come iOS nine, that extra home kit functionality using the Apple TV as a remote server.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   That doesn't matter.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   So they really need to figure out their deal with the box.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   But for now, I mean, it's just another shot off the bow.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Like it's nothing different than Roku.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   It's nothing different than Slingsbox.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   It's nothing different than, you know, any of the other opportunities for all of cart TV.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   It's also interesting to wonder if people have allegiance to the box they already have.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   I mean, are people really addicted to having a Roku or is it just simply the box they already have?
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   And so long as they can get the channels and the software that come along on it, will they ever be tempted to switch to an Apple TV or vice versa?
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   I mean, it's one of the opportunities that Sony and Microsoft have because so many of these families that do get most of their entertainment through the biggest screen in the house.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   They've already got the box in place.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   If they can simply push updates to it and find a way to take a percentage off of all those pay channels, that's just gravy for them.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   But is there any incentive for them to do what I imagine Apple would do, which is to enhance the box and make the box enhance every other Apple device that you have on your network.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   So.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Integration play.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Do we have a timeframe?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   I mean, I guess it's all just kind of waiting on negotiations.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   The follows are next topic.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Like they have windows.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   So WWC was a window September, October is the next window.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   So even if they had it next month, they wouldn't likely do it until the until there was a window.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Yeah, it feels like an event.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Like you have to go up there and show off any of the new bots and explain the new cable and you want the people on stage and you want the media attention.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   And that means it's an event.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   And I can't remember the last time Apple had an event in July or August.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   No, I honestly feel, I mean, the two like well timed areas would be right at the start of up front, which is sort of right around this time frame, and right at the start of the fall TV season.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Granted, we're less dependent on seasons than we used to be.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   But I can definitely see an Apple TV event taking the place of say the Apple Watch event last year, because obviously they're not going to release new Apple Watch hardware in September.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   That's not going to happen.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   But that October, that October slot that was used for the iPad and, you know, the Apple Watch or the iPhone, the Apple Watch, that could be very easily used for the iPhone and also the Apple TV.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   And hey, look at how the Apple TV helps your iPhone and interconnects with your iPhone and also television.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   So exciting.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   But they've got, you know, they've got Apple Music launching at the end of June.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   I think that's probably the bare minimum that we're going to see in the summer.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   They're too busy prepping everything that's going to launch in September, all of the iOS, OS 10, etc.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   New iPhones, all the stuff.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   And maybe that's also the reason why they didn't give the HomeKit the big magic show last week too, because if we, if we, if we, we're going to be able to do that, we're going to be able to do that.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   If we, if what we all have been presuming is true, that HomeKit and the new Apple TV will just elevate HomeKit to something way beyond what it can be right now, you want to give the whole magic show when you have the whole stage ready to go.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   As, as handy as it would have been to simply say, here's what you can do with HomeKit right now with lots of products that just launched last week.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   So interesting.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   I am, I do have been trying to figure out when would they launch a new Apple TV with HomeKit and would they do what they try to do the, the, the, the, the, the trica of Apple TV, HomeKit and a new subscription service and then make it sort of into their own sort of TV event.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Would they, would it sort of be a piggyback between they would do the iPhone event and then also do Apple TV as another iOS device and sort of sister it that way.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   And if there really is going to be an iPad pro, you probably, it's such a, it would be, I think it would be an event sort of on the same scale of launching Apple Watch because it would be the biggest iPad news since iPad 1.0.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   It's nothing like introducing the iPad mini.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   This would be a really emphatic statement saying that do not buy any of these $500 windows tablets that are kind of iPad like buy our new $649 iPad pro instead and they would want to have lots of room around that announcement so that they could really prosecute that the case they're making completely.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   It's going to be a good fall.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Going to be a really interesting fall.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   I got, I got money taped to the bottom of my desk for.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Likewise.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Maybe we can carpool.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Would you really though when you want to separate it out from the iPhone announcement? I mean, that's going to, well, I guess it says six s September and October. They did the Apple Watch with the iPhone this year. There's no more iPod really stuff to announce.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   So an iPhone and an Apple TV could be a good bundle.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   And then you do the new Mac stuff and iPad pro in October.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   iPad pro is going to be a lot to talk about too, isn't it?
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Yeah, like maybe one, maybe one event at your boyna one event at town hall.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Okay.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Okay.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Should people not buy an Apple TV today? I did. They did drop the price.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Nope.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Nope.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   No point unless you need absolutely airplay support and you don't have airplay in your house.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   You're basically buying a $69 airplay dongle.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   That's true.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   I just bought one for the bedrooms.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   I'm not going to stick.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   I needed one for the presentation I was giving at the Yosemite conference because the version I had could not do point to point point airplay without a base station in the middle.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   And as the only way I could get it to drive from the new MacBook because I didn't have a USB 3.0 video dongle yet.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   And even then I decided I would much rather spend $30 for an HDMI to VGA adapter and bring my own Wi-Fi base station to have a private network at the podium.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   And throw away $70 for a piece of hardware that might have a shelf life of about three months.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Let's take a break. We'll come back and talk about watches and privacy.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   El Capitan.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Can you say privacy or privacy?
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Privacy.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Privacy reminds me of the privy. And I don't want to say privacy. I want to say privacy.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Does most of our audience say privacy? They probably do.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   What do you say in Canadian?
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Privacy.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Thank God.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   Vitamins, privacy, dancing, not dancing.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Aluminum.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Yeah, although it breaks my heart.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Every time I don't say aluminium.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Just fun to say.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Just for use for everybody.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   You have a little more time with 4K because 4K TVs haven't really taken off.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   But they're going to this fall.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Probably.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   This would be a good time.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Fall would be a good time.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   I think whatever TV people already have have to pass to die before they were placed with a 4K.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Now it is.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.480]   I haven't spoken to anybody who has said that I'm a perfectly good TV. I'm so eager to switch
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.480]   it out.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.160]   Unless they have a crappy TV in their bedroom and they want to move like the 50 inch in
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.000]   there and have an excuse to buy a new one.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Have you Serenity and Renee downloaded iOS 9 and El Capitan?
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Possibly.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Possibly.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Okay.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   I may have possibly destroyed both of my devices.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Oh really?
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   I mean my main production devices.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   I've been doing it for the last.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Yeah you can.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   That's true.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   I could talk about El Cap my embargo yesterday.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   All right.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Details coming right after this word.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   It's snack time.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Who wants lemon tea biscuits?
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Anybody?
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Lemon tea?
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   You suggest them with those?
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   They're delicious.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   They are good aren't they?
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   We're talking nature box.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   I don't think you could try nature box.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   I get to try them.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   I know.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Nature box to me is called well stat.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   You would like these and especially because you know it's important to keep your strength
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   during long bouts of roller derby.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Our two D to nature needs to have these honeycomb sunflower kernels.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Yum.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Yum.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   We know sunflowers are really, you know, sunflower seeds are really good for a lot of things.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   These are non GMO sunflower kernels.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   You know what's in these?
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   I love them.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Nothing.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Sugar, sunflower, oil, honey and salt.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   A little maltodextrin to give it that.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.720]   This is not, there's never any HFCs, any high fructose corn syrup, never any artificial
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.440]   colors or flavors or any of that stuff.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.160]   Nature box makes great snacks.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.040]   Nutrition is to prove so much better than going to the snack machine and they'll ship
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.240]   them right to you on a monthly subscription.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.240]   You got to love that.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.920]   You know you're going to snack.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.440]   So why feel bad afterwards?
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.440]   Why not feel good?
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:43.600]   Say I had a delicious probiotic power mix for my snack today.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.480]   And these are always resealable bags too, which is nice.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.200]   You don't feel like you have to eat the whole thing.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.960]   Best of all, they taste phenomenal.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.440]   How about strawberry lemonade fruit stars?
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.600]   Or sweet and salty, not medley.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.600]   Ooh.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.600]   Mmm.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.400]   And of course you could tailor your box to dietary needs.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.800]   Sweet savory and spicy.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.480]   White truffle popcorn.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.480]   Wow.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.480]   Mmm.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.480]   These are so good.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.240]   Look, I got a special deal for you.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.280]   You can get your special free trial.

[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.320]   Look at the menu.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.480]   They've got gluten free.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.480]   They've got vegan, they got snacks for everybody.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.480]   Mmm.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.840]   Boy, that probiotic stuff's good.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.400]   I don't even know what probiotic is, but boy, is that good.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.640]   If it tastes like this, I'm in.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.640]   I'm in.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.200]   I don't need to know what that means.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:47.240]   Naturebox.com/twit for your free trial trial today.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.920]   You're watching Mac Break Weekly.
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.320]   We are snacking.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.320]   Mmm.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:58.880]   We're just a son of a member of the e-commerce and Renee Rit here here from i1.com.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:03.360]   Also, of course, Mr. Andy and not Coso.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.360]   You had El Capitem, but you were in barcode till yesterday?
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.760]   They had the, you can't call them reviews first looks yesterday.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.200]   So, I got to spend about a week going through it and noting down some feelings and some
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.760]   thoughts and sharing them with the universe.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.800]   So, your first look is now at iMore.com.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.800]   There it is.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.280]   Yes, sir.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.920]   People say our images are too big.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.920]   That feels great.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.080]   See, we're in a visual world.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.080]   I like it.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.080]   I know.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.080]   Me too.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.080]   I want to see--
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.080]   Go big or go kindle.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.080]   Pictures, baby.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.080]   And then there's text underneath that.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.040]   So, I'm sure you really want it.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.600]   So what are the, what are you, first of all, do you agree that this is the kind of
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.480]   a snow leopardy update that it's a--
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.120]   I mean, it's right in the name.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.960]   And, Kudos, because Srenity clued into that really early on.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.520]   El Capitem is part of Yosemite.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:55.440]   So, it's like a sub-- it's like what Syracuse is famous tiger-- sorry, cat modifier cat,
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.960]   but now it's landmark modifier landmark.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.560]   And that means that it's focused on not new features, but performance and reliability
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.560]   and security.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.560]   However--
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.560]   I mean, those are pretty big features.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.320]   It's just, it's easier to say that we're spending-- we're not giving you the full reign
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.320]   of new features, we're-- I think you--
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:18.680]   Well, I'd say the argument there is that all of these features are enhancements of previous
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.680]   features.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.720]   Notes is not new, notes is better.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:27.080]   Split view is not new, split-- or split view is new, but split view is building upon mission
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:32.600]   control and full screen apps, which is something that was introduced in Lion.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:37.000]   And mission control itself has gotten some improvements in how it handles spaces and things
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   like that.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.640]   The cursor is definitely not new, but the cursor shake is a nice improvement.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:48.360]   And in fact, I think something brought back from-- from Yon's-- Yon's will go--
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.640]   Was it an Apple thing or was it a third party?
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.000]   I think it was a third party--
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.080]   You know, the OS 7 preference pain, slow loader.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.080]   I don't even know what you call those anymore.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.080]   Plugins?
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.960]   I just remember them loading.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.960]   Yeah, extensions.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:06.880]   I just remember them loading on my Mac when I was like, why won't my Mac or not?
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.880]   I want to play organ cell.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.880]   Really?
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.360]   And you really need this on a 5K display.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.320]   These bigger displays we use.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.320]   I lose the cursor all the time.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.920]   Actually, I made my cursor bigger so I could see it.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.320]   But the shake is probably better than that.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:24.160]   I love those shillers comment on the talk show where he said he went to the iMac and couldn't
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.920]   find the cursor that he's shaking and realizing it wasn't on LCAP.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:27.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.920]   No!
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.920]   We have spotlight.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.880]   Spotlight's been improved.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.720]   It hasn't-- it's not new.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.720]   It's just-- it's gained some of the features that we've seen on Siri for years.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.000]   All of Search across the platform.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.040]   The mail features aren't new.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.160]   They're originally introduced in iOS.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.920]   Now they've been brought over.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:52.680]   So it's really sort of a hyper-polishing, which I think is actually really funny.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:57.760]   When they-- I was clued into the LCAP name in part because when we sat out at the keynote,
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.720]   I looked at the-- I always like to look at the backdrop picture, what they're choosing
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.680]   for that year on the iMacs.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.520]   And I'm like, that's still Yosemite.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.520]   It's LCAP, it's Han.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:17.440]   But LCAP is a very difficult mountain, really a granite wall to surmount.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:22.600]   It kills people every year from trying to climb up without adequate experience.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.600]   It's a multi-day climb.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:29.800]   I think it's actually kind of ballsy for Apple to be like, yes, for our stability release,
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:34.840]   we are going to name it after one of the scariest mountains in Yosemite, basically being like,
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.600]   yes, we know there are bugs.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.960]   We are surmounting these bugs.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:43.160]   And we are going to climb up and be victorious on the peak.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.320]   It's not even a peak.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.560]   The top of LCAP attend, the summit of LCAP attend.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.560]   Summit of the monolith.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.560]   I mean, it is.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:55.600]   Yeah, I mean, you wonder if they're going to just-- on the launch day for this new operating
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:59.840]   system, they're going to basically go to every single camp of someone who's considering
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.840]   climbing by them.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.840]   Lots of beers.
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.680]   Keep them from climbing because the last thing you want to see--
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.680]   It's a death on El Capitan.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.680]   Tretching on LCAP at 10.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.680]   That's right, Calcaine.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.360]   There are no behind the cast served at LCAP at 10.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:15.040]   Well, thankfully, I think OS 10 will be released late enough in the year that LCAP climbing
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.320]   isn't really something that you do.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:23.520]   Like I think mid to late October might be right on the edge of people trying to climb
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.520]   granite facing.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.520]   I don't know.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:30.200]   We're talking about people who are willing to say, here's a sheer wall of granite.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.120]   That's thousands of millions of miles up in the air.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.760]   There is never a safe time to do it.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.640]   You're talking about people who need to be convinced to stay on the ground.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.720]   Let's talk about metal.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.200]   That's like DirectX for the Mac.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.760]   Apple has traditionally struggled with its open GL drivers.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:53.080]   That was the technology you'd use prior to metal to make gaming happen on a Macintosh.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.440]   Metal is really-- sounds like it's a lot faster.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.440]   Metal's awesome.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.120]   They viewed on iOS 8 last year.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.720]   It's a way to quote unquote write more directly towards the metal of the graphics processing
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.160]   unit, the GPU.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.320]   Metal on the Mac is even cooler.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:09.120]   Metal this year in general is even cooler because Apple is not only addressing open GL
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.640]   or side stepping and way open GL, but they're folding in open CL, which was an Apple proposed
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.520]   standard for open compute language that let you use basically the graphics processing
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.520]   unit for general purpose computing.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.560]   They're tying all that together into a single unified API and then they put core animation
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.440]   and core graphics on top of it.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.680]   If you already followed best practices, you get a lot of this performance boosting for
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.680]   free, which is one of the best developers.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.400]   You're having a conference.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.320]   So if you use core graphics, you'll get metal.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.320]   You get all the acceleration that metal provides.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.320]   Nice.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.400]   It's not just exciting for gamers.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.160]   I mean, definitely it's going to be really, really a bonus, especially.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:50.560]   They've got a lot of major design studios committed to releasing titles using metal,
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.960]   which is fantastic, but development should be great.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:57.520]   I mean, you looked at the demos that Adobe was doing on the Dev Dev stage.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.680]   They did a much more comprehensive demo, I think, during the state of the union.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.680]   I wish they'd showed Adobe instead of this really silly game.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.400]   The game isn't, I mean, I've been trying, but it's no, it wasn't something that really
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.320]   like developers were like, wow, those graphics.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.320]   You've been able to mostly--
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.320]   Unless you think count-law calls doesn't impress you.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:25.040]   But when it comes to development, the numbers and stats that they were reeling off about
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:30.600]   how much faster Adobe's draw calls are getting as a result in the behind-the-scenes development
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.480]   and I know Brianna Wu, who's a game developer, wrote for us on IMOAR.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.480]   Oh, yeah, that was--
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:42.520]   Yeah, she's super excited about the possibilities of maybe being able to work in Unreal Engine
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:47.280]   4 and not having to go over to Windows because Windows will just render it faster.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.600]   She was saying 500% improvement in rendering.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.160]   Yeah, that's an important point because a lot of developers, they don't have to do a lot
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.800]   of things differently if they're using Unreal, if they're using one of the existing engines,
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.800]   those engines are going to fold in metal.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.720]   So you will get the ability to write two metal literally by using the engine you're already
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.080]   using and that's a huge time saver for them.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.080]   When you--
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.920]   Somebody in the chat, I'm saying, why do they keep saying writing to the metal?
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:14.200]   Metal is the term, of course, but what does that mean writing to the metal?
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:18.800]   The actual hardware, because you have hardware interfaces and you have all these years of
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.000]   interface layers.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.040]   Basically, OpenGL is the open graphics language and that's what you use to do shaders and
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:28.640]   draw calls and basically try to program the card to do what you want it to do and it was
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.240]   incredibly complicated.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.280]   And if you look at the diagrams, it's an incredibly thick layer filled with a lot of
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.360]   things because it's an open standard.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.840]   And writing to the metal means you're trying to sidestep as much as possible.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.160]   You're not using lower level languages.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.800]   So you are using lower level languages, not abstract languages, not higher level languages.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.400]   And you're trying to write as directly to that hardware as possible so you can get the
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.600]   most performance out of it as possible.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.760]   That makes sense.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.880]   Will something like Unity take advantage of this?
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.880]   Looks like.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:01.200]   So these third party game design tools that give you cross platform support you know you
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.840]   can write for Unity and run on Windows and Mac.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.120]   Which is kind of the thing because people were complaining immediately that Apple said
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.560]   this like, oh, what about Vulkan?
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.560]   What about direct?
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.560]   It doesn't matter.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.360]   It's like CarPlay and Android Auto.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.440]   You should not have to care what the platform supports.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:18.440]   The platform you shouldn't have to put up with an open standard that's okay for everybody
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.840]   but great for nobody.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:24.360]   Make great platform specific solutions and then have that layer like Unreal and like
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.960]   Unity sitting on top that handles all the heavy lifting.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.680]   Then as a gamer, I don't care what it's written in.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.840]   And as a developer, you don't care what the engine supports.
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.760]   Your job is picking great games and it makes I think everyone's lives better.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.760]   Very exciting.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:37.760]   Super exciting.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.760]   What else are we looking forward to?
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.800]   In that same section there Leo that was super exciting and developers really liked it too.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.120]   There's something called UI collection view on iOS which lets you make more complicated
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.760]   layouts more easily.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.400]   And the Mac had a version but now they've ported the iOS version, UI collection view
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.400]   to the Mac.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:57.520]   And the iOS collection view, there's also text kit support and there is stack view so they
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:02.360]   made it just much easier to make much higher quality Mac interfaces for developers.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.480]   And I think that's we're going to as a result of that, we're going to see sort of like
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.880]   the easy way that you may.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.800]   I don't want to say easy because I'm not a developer and it sounds dumb to say it but
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:14.080]   the better way of making apps now possible on the Mac as well with full tech support with
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.080]   all that new font stuff.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:20.840]   Do you feel like that might indicate a broader variety of resolutions on the Mac too?
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.960]   In other words, one of the reasons that came out on iOS first is because you wanted to
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:31.200]   be able to flow stuff, it might make it easier to format stuff on the Mac.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.320]   I mean, they basically, and I don't know this for sure but my understanding is they didn't
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.960]   want to have to load WebKit every, the entire WebKit stack just to render a bunch of text
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.520]   because that's not efficient.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:44.280]   And especially on the Apple Watch doesn't even have WebKit on it.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:48.640]   So text kit was a way to actually render that text directly in the UI and not have to load
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.280]   WebKit to work as an interface.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:54.600]   And I might be getting the details of it wrong but it just makes text rendering not only typographically
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:58.360]   more beautiful but much more efficient for lower end hardware especially.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.080]   That seems to be a common thread running through a lot of these announcements that I've been
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:09.200]   seeing WWDC where if Apple can't get control over CPU upgrades because they're beholden
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:13.440]   to Intel, they can sort of give themselves CPU upgrades by introducing all of these little
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:18.120]   tweaks, the operating system that allow you to get more battery life without a CPU upgrade
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:24.280]   to get more, get more speed or not just more actual speed but more perceived speed through
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.800]   faster rendering.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:31.240]   So it's going to be interesting to see in the next, with the next generation of CPU hardware
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:36.680]   is going to be if Apple can now downplay that they don't necessarily have CPUs that have
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:41.200]   been released two months ago but they can simply point at performance and simply say,
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.800]   here is how fast our browser runs.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:48.040]   Here is how fast our $1,000 notebook runs compared to something that costs $300 or $400
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.040]   more on another platform.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.880]   But for a first look, this is very complete.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:56.800]   I mean, an operating system review, of course John Syracuse has set the standard.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.960]   I don't know who's going to do it for our technique of this year since John's retiring.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.280]   And credit to $200 for editing that, she made it way better than it's done.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:08.640]   This is not a full review, I guess, but boy, it sure looks like it.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.440]   It's just an overview of the features, honestly.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.440]   I mean, we haven't really, you know, we dug in a little bit right after the conference
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.640]   about little features you may have missed during the keynote.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:23.240]   But there's so many little tweaks and little improvements, especially I think that it'll
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:29.600]   take us some time using the operating system to really get the feet, as opposed to something
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.480]   like Lion or Mavericks or Yosemite where the design changes are kind of right in your face
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.480]   and everything is new and everything is exciting.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:44.160]   With something like LCAP 10, I feel like it's going to take us a couple weeks, even a month
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:50.640]   of getting used to the final version, not just the betas, to really feel how much it
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:58.240]   improves older Macs and how much this, I keep on wanting to say Siri, the spotlight improvements
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.280]   help us just working day to day on our Macs.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.160]   What about my friends on the Mac?
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.160]   That's pretty cool.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.000]   Yeah, find my friends on the Mac.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.160]   Yeah, it's a notification widget now.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:12.280]   The app that nobody used on the iPhone now is available on the Macintosh.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:16.400]   They built it into messages though, so what I found, like a WWDC, it was super easy if
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.080]   you were trying to, if you were on different parts of town and you wanted to quickly meet
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.640]   up for a drink or a meal, you would just hit that share for an hour or a share for a day
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:26.400]   and you wouldn't have to worry about your location always being shared, but you could
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:30.320]   easily find each other because maps would give you precise walking directions to where
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.320]   that person was.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:36.040]   I've been lost before trying to find somebody and it was way better now.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.720]   Security, some significant changes here.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.720]   It is huge.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:43.360]   It's actually pretty controversial, especially among security people.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.840]   This was sort of leaked as the code name, rootless, and they've got a much more Microsoft
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:51.200]   name now, like System Integrity, something or other enhancement enforcement.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.000]   What it does is it's a real-time-
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.480]   System Integrity protection.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.480]   Protection.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.560]   It's a problem though because you probably know this from the radio show.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.520]   People buy a Mac, they set it up, and they're just running as administrator.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.160]   They don't modify anything.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.080]   That's the way it is.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:09.320]   Getting them to move away requires you explaining how user accounts were getting them to set
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.640]   up a new account, setting up a standard.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:18.560]   What rootless, whatever SIP does, it sort of brings the iOS model over to the Mac, not
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.560]   completely because you can still boot into a full root access mode if you really want
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.560]   to.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.080]   There's a little toggle you have to set and you can boot into it.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:31.640]   What it does is it prevents the escalation attacks that we've seen very recently the
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:36.680]   last few weeks on the Mac where someone manages to get root access and manages to escalate.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:42.120]   You actually manage to escalate that on your machine and install basically persistent malware.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:47.000]   This makes a very proactive, proactive, actually defense against that kind of stuff.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.160]   People who are used to running home brew or running in Kex or other kind of extensions,
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.640]   they're probably not as happy with it.
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.640]   I can't use brew anymore.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.760]   It's not exactly clear what happens.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.160]   Some people want both the benefits of this and the freedom to run both.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.360]   It looks like you have to turn this off to that kind of stuff and then they're upset
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.160]   that they don't get the protection anymore.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.240]   I think it's one of those things where it's built by the same team that did sandboxing
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.760]   and keeping a lot of the other stuff.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.480]   It's really meant to protect people who don't know any better about these kinds of things.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:20.280]   If you use an brew, I guess the presumption is you know what you're doing.
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:24.320]   If you jailbreak, if you break the root jail, the assumption is you're a higher level user
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.920]   who's taking that responsibility on to themselves.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.960]   A lot of us use Macs because we have Unix under the hood and we have a command line and
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:38.600]   we can do all this stuff and those people are always very nervous.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.280]   That's Apple slowly inches towards iOS.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.120]   Remember how upset I was about the App Store but that hasn't worked.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.120]   It turned out to be any problem at all.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:54.640]   In fact, a good choice in security when the protection against a third party App installs,
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.640]   side installs.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:56.640]   People love their Macs.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.240]   They are the same people who are working at Apple are just like you and they love their
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.800]   Macs and want them to be Macs.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:06.760]   Presumably they use them like we hardcore folks with a command line and all that stuff.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.280]   Can you the confirm or deny that?
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.280]   I'm so I'm hoping.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:14.440]   They're not going to don't take away my past shell.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:22.040]   We look at a, I don't know if the WSJ article is on our docket to talk about but you look
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.040]   at things like that.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:27.160]   On one hand, you have people saying, "Oh, Apple should get rid of the Mac brand and you
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.760]   know, iOS development can happen on iOS."
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:36.520]   To which I'm kind of like, "Okay, you know, we go back to the Steve's jobs analogy of
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:40.200]   cars and trucks and things like that.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.000]   Developers are going to want trucks.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Sorry.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.600]   That's just how it works.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:51.160]   I really like the iPad and I am super, super excited for the features that the iPad is
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.880]   going to get in iOS 9.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.880]   I think it'll make me, it'll make me a lot easier for me to write on it, which I think
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.880]   is really cool.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:02.800]   Maybe do basic coding, but when it comes to the hardcore stuff, when it comes to Xcode,
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:06.240]   I wouldn't want to do Xcode on a touch screen device.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.240]   I just wouldn't.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.560]   That might be just me personally.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:14.400]   There might be other developers who feel otherwise, but there's something about having
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.840]   multiple screens and being able to have multiple input devices.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.840]   I think Apple is very acutely aware of this, very much the right device for the right task
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.560]   for the right space.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:30.400]   I see that as they're improving the improvements to El Capitan, as they're putting the improvements
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:36.280]   to iOS 9, each improvement is very much designed for the, even though there are things that
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:42.800]   crossover, they're very much designed for the machine that they're being implemented
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:43.800]   upon.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.880]   Yeah, this is what I want my Mac to look like right here.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.880]   Absolutely.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:48.880]   There you go.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:54.440]   If it doesn't do that, then I ain't happy.
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.440]   Unix 3 POSIX for the right.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:01.560]   No, I think actually, but what you'll do is you'll lose people to Linux and stuff.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:06.240]   But I think the beauty of the Mac is you get a real operating system that's designed for
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.520]   normal people plus the ski-hee stuff under the hood.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:16.840]   No, nobody has, even Apple has yet to make the case that you can use a tablet to replace
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.520]   an entire desktop.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.160]   Even Microsoft has made Windows tablets, and they have not been able to successfully make
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.880]   the case that a tablet is a replacement for something that's configured like a laptop
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.120]   or a desktop.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:35.080]   And you also figure that it's silly to think of Apple chloroforming a business that is
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:40.360]   a part of their business that's not collapsing, it's growing, if anything.
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:46.560]   And also, you remember that Apple's whole success is about building a domed environment
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.040]   that is a really great place to live.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:53.680]   And you don't want to send somebody outside the dome to get a desktop or a laptop.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.320]   Even if they did not believe in laptops, even if they did not believe in desktops,
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:02.800]   even if they weren't as excited about macOS as everyone in this conversation is, I don't
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.080]   think that they would simply say, "We're making a lot of money with this, but let's
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:11.160]   let Microsoft and even Linux get the thin end of that wedge hammered underneath the
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:18.520]   experience because they can't make a desktop experience that they don't control work as
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:22.120]   well with the iPhone, with the iPad, with the watch as they can if they control the
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.120]   whole thing."
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.960]   That's the great beauty of buying Apple, everything.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.760]   It all works great together.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.800]   And there's another line to this.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.200]   And that is people like, I'm going to make books for his last name, Zzdarski, who we
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.520]   talked about previously with Backforce.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.840]   They're worried that...
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.400]   And I hope I'm not misquoting him, but he linked to some articles that I found really
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.400]   interesting.
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.440]   They're worried that by locking all this stuff down, by making a trusted boot chain
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:47.120]   where there's an iOS, that they lose the ability to carefully monitor their system and
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.120]   see what's happening.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.000]   If there is a pre-existing device, so that is absolutely something really important that
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   has to be considered.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.800]   But you'll be able to turn rootless off, right?
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:54.800]   I mean, that's the main.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.400]   Yeah, and again, it looks like you can set a flag and reboot into a single user mode
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.400]   that does that.
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:02.320]   But this is only the beta, so we're going to have to wait and see how it might be even
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.240]   that easier to do or harder to do when the final comes out.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.920]   Because otherwise I can't install links, and it's very important to me that our website
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.920]   look good.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:13.080]   As you can see, it does, by the way, on a desktop.
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:17.000]   You sent me a message about that in Elmley, oh, I appreciate it.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.160]   But Apple has a really great tracker record with this.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:23.360]   Remember how I think that people were right to be at least concerned when Apple announced
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:29.840]   that they're going to basically hardware security into software installs and app installs,
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.280]   thinking that, well, now they have the ability to simply lock out any app that doesn't come
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.720]   in through the app store.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.720]   But they implemented in the most user positive way possible.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:42.600]   They simply said that the safest way to operate this Mac is to never install any app that
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.240]   didn't come from a trusted source.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:50.080]   We will give you a couple of options, including ask first and don't even care about it.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:54.160]   And even if in a later update, that it's something that was really brilliant, which
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:59.760]   is to say they knew that the only time that people are going to butt heads with this feature
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:04.920]   is when they downloaded a brand new app of a source that's not in the app store.
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.640]   And they get their warning saying, oh, I'm sorry, I can't let you run this because it's
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.680]   not assigned app.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:13.320]   And then that's what causes people to go into system preferences, turn off the security
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.280]   feature, launch that app and then forget they've turned that feature off.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:20.280]   It has that feature that simply says, if you go into if you go into preferences, there
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:24.160]   will be a button that says, hi, you try to launch handbrake.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:28.160]   If you click this button, we will let you launch this app without changing the rest of
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.160]   the settings.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.560]   We will simply grandfather this one in.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:34.520]   So I think that Apple won't make a change like that that makes the Mac harder to use
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.520]   or less successful.
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.520]   And it's nice.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:41.680]   Like it's also that the app transport security system where they want to use TLS 1.2, but
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.280]   TLS 1.2 is not great.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:46.920]   So it's forward moving it saying or better and it's opening up for potentially better
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.400]   replacements for that going forward so that if you're not familiar with that, they want
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:54.600]   when you connect an app to a web backend, they want that connection to be secure.
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.520]   And the current standard is TLS 1.2, but it's going to keep pushing for best practices.
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.480]   Whenever that standard is updated, it's going to try and make sure that you use the most
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:05.440]   updated version of that standard, which I think is a clever way of doing it too.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.200]   I'm sorry, I'm just browsing your site and links.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.200]   It looks so good.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:13.120]   Actually, you want to play a game.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.720]   I like the command line.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:17.000]   I really do hope that they are.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.920]   How's your Archie support?
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:22.000]   I don't want to go in a single user mode just so I can use a brew.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.160]   I still have a CPM computer that I do a lot of my browsing with.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.160]   I'm disappointed.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.160]   It's got to have a links capability.
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.160]   All right, moving on.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.160]   Let me go back to a real browser.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.160]   Oh, much better.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:35.160]   Oh, you went to Chrome.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.160]   Oh, shit.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.160]   Modern.
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:38.160]   Modern browser.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.160]   Modern browser.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:42.960]   You say you prefer Safari to Chrome and you like the new Safari.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:46.280]   I like it because Chrome has a lot of Chrome for me at least.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.040]   I find the tabs on the way the whole thing is rendered has a lot of border.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.640]   I like the way that they've been making the design just very minimal.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.360]   Chrome has never worked well on the Macs either.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.680]   It's always been a big of a hog.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.400]   It's a battery drain, especially on that MacBook.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.560]   I forget what it is, but it's an enormous, I think I installed it just on the MacBook
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.200]   because the battery hit was tremendous.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.200]   It's not that bad.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.200]   It depends on whether you're running.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:12.120]   What you've got to set up to basically say any flash, any comers, by all means running.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:17.520]   I use Chrome as my default browser on my MacBook Pro 13-inch.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:21.800]   To me, it became a choice between I find it a lot more stable than Safari and I'm willing
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:27.480]   to trade off what to me is not a major amount of battery life in exchange to get what to
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.080]   me is a lot more stability.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.040]   Also glad to see that they're paying some attention to mail.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.440]   Mail's had problems in the last few editions of OS X.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.080]   It's putting it lightly.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.080]   No plans.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.480]   There are no hires to smart people into that group.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:45.160]   I'm not blaming Apple, frankly, because the world of mail is changing rapidly.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.840]   One of the big problems I had was that Gmail wasn't really a standard IMAP implementation.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.600]   Gmail has been changing the way they do.
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.440]   I've been really quickly over the last couple of years.
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.400]   I don't blame Apple at all.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.400]   Yet, I would like to use mail.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:59.240]   It's nice to see that they...
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:03.680]   It looks like a lot of this really is the iOSification of mail, which maybe is not the
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.680]   best thing.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:05.680]   Well, it's...
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:06.680]   Sorry, go ahead, Brian.
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.240]   No, I was going to probably say...
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:12.400]   The same thing what you were going to say, Renee, which is that it's not so much the
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.600]   iOSification of mail.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:19.480]   It's taking smart features from iOS and implementing them in the full screen implementation of
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.480]   mail.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.480]   Okay.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:26.880]   So, mail as is, is still just as much mail on the desktop as it was before.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:31.520]   It just now, when you're in full screen, previously, it was very, very difficult to try and write
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:35.720]   new emails while you were in full screen, which made full screen mode and mail kind
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:36.920]   of useless.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:42.320]   Now, you can do sort of the swipe down the same way that you would on an iPad where you
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.080]   like, you start to write and you're like, "Okay, I need to reference something."
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:48.960]   And you just pull that to the bottom of the screen and then you can go back to your messages.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:52.920]   You can swap bases entirely and go to a different thing.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.840]   Or you can bring it back and you can start a new compose window because mail is in tab...
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.560]   Or mail windows are in tabs now.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:02.560]   So, you can have several compose windows open at once without them floating around and
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.360]   random places on your screen.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:09.800]   And I actually think those are both two really nice features for the Mac.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:14.560]   They're very much pro features for people who want to multitask and want to access
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:17.040]   multiple things at once.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:23.560]   The also swipe gestures, you know, as a lifelong, or at least as long as the Magic
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:28.680]   Trackpad has existed, as a die-hard Magic Trackpad user, I love the fact that there
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.600]   are more gestures on OS X.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.760]   The more multi-finger gestures that I can use, the better.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.520]   And they're all, you know, they're all disableable for people who really don't want them or you
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:41.120]   just use a mouse and then you don't have to worry about them.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.760]   New APIs for the Force Touch ones now.
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.240]   So, developers can do all sorts of clever things, including all the different levels
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.520]   of sensitivity and all the levels of Force feedback.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.760]   So, we should be seeing some cool out.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:49.760]   Yeah, I'm waiting for that.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.280]   I don't see anybody really taking advantage of the Force Touch.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.560]   Maybe because it's not out in so many Macs yet.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.000]   Yeah, it's also just coming...
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.080]   The real API has just came out for El Capitan.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.640]   That might be a painful transition though because there's still...
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:06.880]   I don't think there's any real agreement about what a Force Touch actually means.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:11.600]   So, if everybody can get on board and decide that every time I force touch on a mail item,
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:15.880]   for instance, that implies that I want to sort of dig deeper into the context of this
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:19.880]   message, for instance, if there's something basic intrinsic to the idea of Force Touching
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:23.880]   that I can apply to every single thing, it should be as instinctive as holding down the
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:28.280]   Shift key or holding down the command key or double clicking instead of single clicking.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:30.080]   Now, you know what?
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:36.280]   Force Touch, I feel like we're in stage zero at this point for a multi-stage expansion,
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:43.880]   where the benefits and the potential applications of haptic feedback is very, very expansive,
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:49.600]   where we're just seeing the very basics with press hard on your watch or press hard on
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:55.440]   your trackpad and you'll speed something up or you'll dig deep into a message.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:48:00.880]   If we're talking about Force Touch that could potentially say have multiple pressure sensitivity
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:07.680]   levels where you can actually feel like the click sensation, which is already in the API's,
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:12.800]   think about pressing on a mail message and you lightly press to reply, press one level
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:18.200]   deeper than that to flag it, press three levels deeper than that to archive it immediately,
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:21.560]   press all the way down if you want to delete it.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:26.000]   And that's just, again, that's just straight pressing.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.880]   What about a couple years from now, we get into multi-touch pressing where you can actually,
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.240]   you might be able to get multiple inputs into Force Touch.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:38.040]   I feel like we're just barely scratching the surface, so I'm not surprised.
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.520]   It's something we have to learn about.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:45.400]   When I look thinking more about how you use it in mail, given how mail is good at automatically
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:50.880]   collecting messages into conversations, the thing that would feel instinctive to me is
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:55.680]   I'm not really sure that I need to open up this entire thread, but I would like to just
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:49:01.120]   sort of pop up into it and by the harder I press into it, the deeper down into the thread
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:05.440]   that I'm looking into whatever pop-up description comes up.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:12.160]   If it becomes a situation though, where it really is, hold it down a little bit to get
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:17.440]   a preview, hold it down a little bit harder to flag it a little bit more to archive it.
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:23.400]   Gosh, for me, that's a lot of things to remember and a lot of, when I'm trying to get like
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:30.120]   203 new emails out of my inbox, I can't be thinking hard about, "Okay, did I just feel
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.760]   three taps or four taps?
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:36.560]   Am I about to delete something or about to basically automatically reply, "Hi, PR person,
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:37.560]   this is great.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:38.560]   Please follow up with me.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:39.560]   I'll buy a phone button."
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.560]   Oh my God, I just did this in the guy's phone.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.560]   Oh, Force Touch Text Expander Andy, you're brilliant.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.560]   Oh my God.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:49.600]   No, it's going to be cool.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:53.680]   It's going to be a little while before not only the developers, but also the community
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:56.200]   decides what a Force Touch means.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:00.440]   Once that gets settled in, yeah, it's the most exciting thing about the new MacBook
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.440]   by far.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.960]   There were some excellent sessions at WWDC.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:06.560]   If you're interested in designing for this stuff, you can check out Mike Stern did one
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:07.560]   for the watch.
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:10.560]   I forget the name of the gentleman who did it for the trackpad, but they're both excellent.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:15.400]   I just find it so confusing that I sometimes turn it off, I sometimes turn it on because
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:19.360]   I can't really figure out, for instance, I'm taking your advice and I'm getting rid
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.120]   of Chrome and I'll use Safari on this little teeny weeny MacBook.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.120]   Yeah, definitely on that MacBook.
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:27.560]   But now I want to put the Safari icon.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:32.200]   It's in the dock right now and I want to drag it up to the top and I can't because of Force
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:35.200]   Touch, I can't really figure out what to do.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.000]   It's not just what?
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.600]   Oh, it's not obvious.
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:39.600]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.840]   You should just be able to press on it like an I don't have my Force Touch.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.440]   Yeah, I can't get it to do anything right.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.440]   It's not.
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:49.000]   It's turbulence Leo, anything new craze turbulence.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.960]   Yeah, well, I'm getting a little queasy.
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:57.800]   So I might just take my to turn it off and hope that it can operate like it used to.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:01.000]   The difficulty is that you have to make sure that whatever their first experience is with
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.360]   this, it's a really good first experience.
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:05.320]   It can be very confusing because it's not because it don't have any.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:06.800]   Well, it's not just confusing.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:11.640]   It's like there are multiple gestures on my trackpad that I've disabled because my first
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:14.680]   day or two with it, I was accidentally triggering launchers.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:19.440]   I was accidentally collecting windows and I know that this could make my workflow a lot
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.240]   simpler and it was well thought out.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:25.440]   But right now, the instant in which I accidentally triggered is a moment where I need to get
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.440]   stuff done.
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:29.520]   So that's when I go into preferences, turn that off and then forget I've turned it off
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:30.960]   and then I never use it again.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:33.960]   And that's the problem.
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:40.000]   I think that's what happened to a lot of user interface tweaks like expose and mission control.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.240]   I think people discovered them said, what the hell turned it off and never thought about
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.760]   it again.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:51.880]   As much as I like to spot off about how users should have choice, sometimes you do if Apple
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:57.440]   feels as though a certain feature is really, really important, they really should introduce
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:02.440]   the ability to turn off that experience as a point one upgrade so that everybody's at
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:06.640]   least forced to absolutely hate it for three months.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:11.280]   And only if they hate it after three months as opposed to you know, a good example is
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:16.760]   the natural scroll that Apple introduced because at first it was incredibly confusing.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.840]   They didn't force it on us.
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:18.840]   Did they Andy?
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:23.720]   But they kind of you couldn't for instance turn on a new Mac without being taught how
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:24.720]   to use it.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:26.200]   It looked at you with judging eyes, Leo.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.760]   Yeah, they were very judgmental.
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:32.000]   And you know what I'm glad they are because now I'm so used to it when I use another
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.360]   desktop, I turn it on.
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:38.400]   In fact, I just installed the latest version of Ubuntu on one of my laptops and I was like,
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:40.360]   what's with this scroll?
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:44.400]   And then I went into the settings and there's a check box that says natural scroll.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.320]   It's like an animal disabled.
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:51.920]   It's really and so that's a really good example of something that people really were upset
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.280]   about it first in your muscle memory really rebelled.
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:58.240]   But once you got used to it, it was the natural way to do it, the right way to do it.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.480]   Well not necessarily natural but different.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:05.240]   It does teach you that sometimes you're rebelling against something that is simply different.
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:10.240]   And you just and sometimes again, it's sometimes you just don't have time in the day to break
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:12.320]   from whatever your established routine is.
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:17.520]   I mean, I still don't like the vanishing scroll bars, especially on web browsers where I
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:22.740]   wish there was a way that you could actually just and disable that feature only for web
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:26.560]   browsers because there are times where, okay, thank you very much, Mac, because there's a
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:27.760]   button I need to click.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.200]   But every time I go, I go to click it, now you put a scroll bar on top of that, and now
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.200]   I can't click that.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:34.000]   No, because dang it.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:42.720]   All right, that's I think El Capitan in a nutshell and a great article by the way,
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:46.560]   highly recommended at imore.com where you can see a lot more of the new details.
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:48.120]   Let's talk about iOS 9.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.120]   iOS 9.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.120]   iOS 9.
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:53.880]   Can you talk about that yet or is there are you still under embargo?
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:55.360]   No, it's interesting.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.360]   It's so different.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.440]   It's similar to last year.
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:53:59.800]   No pictures, no videos.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:03.160]   Of course, people post pictures and videos, but you can talk about the general.
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:06.120]   You can give an opinion on it, not you can't review it, but you can give an opinion on
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.120]   it.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.120]   Okay.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.120]   Okay.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.120]   Give your opinion.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.120]   It's terrific.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.480]   It's the next five years of iPad.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:14.480]   It's like, really?
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.960]   They're tough.
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:16.960]   I'm serious.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.520]   They just bought the iPad another five years.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:20.520]   Wow.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:24.560]   It's that there are times when I'm watching the keynote as someone who's supposed to be
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:28.040]   writing about this in a journalist, but then there's the time where I'm as a consumer,
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:33.320]   as someone who owns an iPad who wants it to work better, who has maybe been at least
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:40.520]   10% tempted that G5 got another my third generation iPad is pretty long on the tooth.
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:43.720]   I need to buy a new iPad and try to make that choice.
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:48.760]   Do I give up on the now that I have a 13 inch somewhat lightweight notebook?
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:54.520]   Do I give up on the idea of needing a large screen iPad or do I even look at the
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:55:01.960]   B's again, $400, $500, $600 very well made Windows 8 soon be Windows 10 based tablets?
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.280]   What do I need to do with this?
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:09.080]   And then when you look at every single complaint that I was making about myself about using
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:12.560]   an iPad that it's too difficult to have two things going on at once.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:19.160]   The hardware keyboard support is just needlessly behind the times just the without the even
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:23.760]   the ability of just hitting, you know, command tab to simply switch between apps.
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.440]   All these little features that just seem like such simple things but would allow me to use
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:33.360]   this little tablet as my go to computer, whether I'm out of the office for three hours or
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.640]   three days.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:37.880]   That's the stuff that Apple brought in and Apple's.
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:43.320]   There's been a lot spoken about how sales of larger tablets across the industry are not
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:44.320]   doing well.
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:47.480]   Now that people are getting access to larger phones, they decided that I don't even need
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:49.040]   a tablet anymore.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:53.520]   Apple has really made the statement now or excuse me, an unannounced product.
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:59.480]   It really seems that they're saying that when all of this is released, we are going to actually
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:04.120]   really make another step forward in that post PC revolution that we've been talking about
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:06.280]   for three or four or five years.
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:07.280]   Absolutely.
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.040]   Go ahead, Ray.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:13.880]   I was going to say the cool thing is like a lot of the features, there's a little bit
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:14.880]   on pack here.
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.320]   So you get picture in picture for video, which is great.
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:19.160]   So if you just want to watch a video, you can watch that video while you use every other
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.400]   feature of your iPad, which is tremendous.
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:25.120]   But there's also slide over, which lets you bring in a sidebar containing an app.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:28.960]   And if developers used all the size class stuff that Apple introduced last year, they
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:30.240]   get a lot of that for free.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:35.080]   I think Apple said it took Twitter or somebody, just a very short amount of time to get everything
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.080]   working.
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.880]   Yeah, it was amazing.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:42.320]   Only the iPad 2 gets the side by side, the split view apps, the way Yosemite gets the
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:51.360]   air to the air to the iPad air to get that because the iPad air to is a lot more reasonably
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.360]   resources.
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:53.400]   We talked about that before.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:56.360]   And if you look at, I went to a session on this, it was really interesting.
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:00.120]   If you look at it, they want 60 frames per second of animation, which means that you
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:04.360]   have about 16 milliseconds to get all that stuff done and getting two apps to respond
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:05.360]   that way.
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:08.240]   They had a whole bunch of advice for developers on how to take an app that used to be able
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:13.080]   to consume the entirety of system resources and now has to share potentially with another
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:16.680]   app, potentially with a picture in picture of video playing at the same time and how
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:19.400]   they could reduce all that down and be a good citizen.
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:24.260]   Because if your app goes past the limits in split screen, you dump everything back to
[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:25.260]   the home screen.
[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:27.560]   It's not like one app goes away and the other app goes home screen.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:31.320]   You dump the user back right to the home screen and you want to minimize that happening as
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:32.520]   much as possible.
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:36.440]   So a side effect of all this is you get that app thinning, I think called it app thinning
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:41.880]   technology and the efficiency technology where they're also going to make apps much better
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:43.680]   citizens, so to speak, on the iPad.
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:44.840]   I think that's really exciting.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:50.400]   And the iPad features are incredible and fast.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:57.560]   Again, just talking about early betas here, but like absolutely incredible how speedy it
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.560]   runs on the air too.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:02.760]   Both slide over and full split screen or split.
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:03.760]   Is it split view?
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.280]   Is that the official name Renee?
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.560]   It's split view on the Mac.
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:07.560]   I'm not sure what's official.
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:11.360]   I'm going to assume it's split view on the iPad as well.
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:16.800]   But just that again, you're you're asking your computer to do a lot of resources here to
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:20.280]   manage a lot of animation, a lot of crazy stuff.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:24.840]   Picture in picture is something that I have been wanting since probably the first iPad
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:30.680]   because as much as I love watching things on a big screen, knowing me and just how I
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:35.360]   work, what I usually end up doing is like putting a tiny, you know, a tiny video in
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:39.280]   the corner of my Mac while I'm like browsing Twitter or something like this.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:43.920]   It might encourage actually, unfortunately, the not single screen minded view, right?
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:49.480]   Where we're constantly doing multiple things while watching TV or while listening to keynote
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:52.040]   sessions or things like that.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:55.480]   But it's really like they're smart features.
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:59:02.520]   The keyboard improvements, not only the fact that you can build custom, custom shortcuts
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:06.040]   for external keyboards, but also the internal keyboards on a per app basis.
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:10.000]   You could have custom buttons and including the copy paste.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:15.200]   Mail has a great one where it's like it's an attachments browser right on the keyboard.
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:19.120]   So instead of having to press and hold on the cursor, so and then like scroll through
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:23.760]   to get to like insert photo video, there's just a button and you can attach from iCloud
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:26.600]   Drive and iCloud Drive gets its own app.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:31.320]   If you want it to, there are so many like little tiny features.
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:37.840]   The fact that you can now use a cursor by putting two fingers on the keyboard and again, something
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:40.960]   that I would have never thought of in terms of the presentation.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:43.160]   Oh, and it's so good.
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:48.880]   You know, it's so smart and so and just such a great implementation.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:54.920]   And then I think, you know, we talk a lot about the iPad, but the iPhone got a fair amount
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.400]   of really, really awesome stuff too.
[00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:00.160]   It gets that cursor thing, which I didn't realize at first.
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:06.280]   The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus get the two finger cursor insertion, the new multitasking bar
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.120]   is cool.
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.840]   The low power mode is actually the thing that I'm most excited about where they didn't talk
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.880]   a whole lot about it at the keynote.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:19.200]   But low power mode, their goal is to save the iPhone an hour plus in battery life by
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.560]   enabling it.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:24.960]   And that's enabling it at 20% when it pops, you know, gives you that like low power mode
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:25.960]   warning.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:26.960]   You enable it earlier.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:27.960]   Yeah.
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.960]   Yeah.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:36.840]   It's so impressive because already iOS devices just absolutely kick the butt of every other
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.040]   comer in terms of battery life.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.040]   But that was not enough.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:44.840]   They found some nickels and dimes that they could still pinch some pennies and give you
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.000]   extra battery life.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.320]   That's like, it's such a prestige.
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.040]   That's what makes this into a prestige product.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.960]   Well, it's like if you put the phone face down, it knows you're not looking at it.
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.680]   So why bother letting up the lock screen for notifications?
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.280]   Some of it again is a little controversial.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.760]   Like they're doing deep links and backlinks, which I love.
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.880]   So if you're in an app and you get a message and you go to messages, there's a back to
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.880]   that app.
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:07.720]   Or if you click a, if you go from Facebook to Safari, there's a back to Facebook button.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.680]   The problem is with deep links, you have to own the website.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.000]   So the deep link for Twitter is always going to Twitter.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.240]   You can't set it to Tweetbot or Twitterific or something else because neither of those
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.920]   apps can prove they own the website.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.640]   And that's really important to the security model they've set up.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:24.240]   So people who make Tweetbot and Twitterific are not going to be happy that by default now,
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:28.200]   links before we go to Safari, which is kind of a no man's land, but now they'll specifically
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.240]   go to someone else's app.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.200]   But as a user, the ability to move around, it was always hard.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:37.080]   You could carousel into an app, but you got to find your way back and now finding your
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:42.040]   way back is a tap and it just makes everything move so much perceptibly so much faster.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:48.320]   Yeah, I was so worried over the past half a year, especially after seeing how well Apple
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:54.220]   built the new 12 inch MacBook that when I first used the iPad, I felt that I was going
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.440]   to build as though this really is the next revolution.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:02.140]   This is finally after 25 years of we have a keyboard, we have a screen, a redefinition
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:05.340]   of computing that really makes sense for modern times.
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:10.000]   And I was really anticipating that by now, I wouldn't think that notebooks and desktops
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.100]   would be obsolete.
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:16.140]   But I really thought that they would have sort of parody with tablets in terms of people
[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:20.660]   who are actually getting stuff done as opposed to just firing off a few emails and looking
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:25.400]   at how well the 12 inch MacBook works that you have a device that has roughly the same
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.400]   battery life as an iPad.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:30.000]   It's roughly the same size as an iPad on the window side.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.940]   You have tablets that are roughly the same size of an eye as an iPad, roughly the same
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:36.480]   prices and iPad, but also run desktop apps.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.800]   It got me thinking, have we lost that battle?
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:43.200]   Have people been given that option of a larger tablet and said, both developers and users,
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.720]   no, that's nice, but we don't want them.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:50.560]   And this is finally that next step forward that says, no, we can really make this a
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:54.900]   business into the next generation device so that you don't have to bring a notebook and
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:55.900]   a tablet.
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:03:00.420]   Maybe you don't even necessarily want a big phone now because you're going to have this
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:03.980]   one content device that can do so many tasks.
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:06.820]   And at worst, you'll take a mobile keyboard with you.
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:10.220]   But other than that, you'll have the perfect device for everything.
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:11.220]   Do we see drag and drop?
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:13.260]   It was one thing I was looking for, but I was busy live blogging.
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.260]   I didn't pay attention.
[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:16.980]   I forgot to go back and look because if it's not now, hopefully it'll be soon where you
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:19.380]   could just drag stuff between those two windows and that'd be lovely.
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:21.840]   Sadly, there's no drag and drop right now.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:25.600]   I think this next year, I think this is the cut copy and paste of 1.0.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.680]   It'll be there when they got it perfect.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:30.000]   Well, they need that processor for it too.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.920]   Because I mean, you think about dragging right now, the share button is the closest thing.
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:38.160]   And you can see that the notes app is kind of experimenting with this with just share
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.160]   anything.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.520]   You could pop up a share button when you highlight text now, which is pretty cool.
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:47.240]   And also, I can't wait to see what that does for workflow as a side note.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:51.980]   But yeah, the potential is huge.
[01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:54.060]   It's just about getting the hardware for it.
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:55.760]   ADA winning workflow.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:58.180]   And they looked super excited at the show as well.
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:03:59.620]   The what ADA winning?
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:00.620]   Apple design award winning.
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:03.620]   Oh, not Americans with Disability Act.
[01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:04.620]   Fantastic.
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:07.100]   There was a lot of good apps in the ADAs this year.
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:08.100]   Nice.
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:09.100]   There really was.
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:11.180]   But yeah, the workflow guys are excellent.
[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:15.500]   And anybody who hasn't tried out that app, even if you're like, oh, why do I need automation
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.200]   on iOS?
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:22.160]   They offer a really easy way to get used to it and get started with automation.
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:25.120]   And once you get started, you're hooked, you're absolutely hooked.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.240]   Where you're like, oh, it's so easy.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:31.400]   I built a I built like a ROT 13 generator of all things.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.600]   And I don't, you know, I don't.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.600]   What do you pass in notes in class?
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.800]   What do you need to rush?
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.600]   I mean, we saw some coilers on Twitter.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:41.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.100]   South said hi, and he also was super happy for the workflow guys too, because you always
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:46.780]   wonder, you know, would he have preferred to bring automation to the iPhone?
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:49.480]   But he was super happy for them as well, which was nice to see.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.400]   Workflows $2.99.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:54.680]   And I'm going to have to we've been around for a while.
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:56.220]   I mean, we've showed it before, right?
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:57.980]   I mean, but is it more capable than nine?
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:04:58.980]   Is that the point?
[01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:01.020]   Well, it looks super happy.
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:02.020]   Yeah.
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:07.020]   With all with the new access to text in the share sheet, I think that's going to be a
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:08.020]   big thing for that.
[01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:10.620]   So you could spit out text or read text, which would.
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:11.620]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:16.780]   And it works by using the share sheet because it lives in as a share sheet extension.
[01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:20.740]   You can also use it on the home screen, but in general, you use it as a share sheet and
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:27.060]   it can only scrape certain things, including it will do like get contents of entire page.
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:31.980]   But being able to highlight specific things and just like said, yeah, I think there's
[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:36.620]   a lot of potential there and a lot of excitement that I know they're they're probably busy
[01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:40.140]   dreaming up magical, magical new scenarios.
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:43.660]   And the fact that it works on the Apple Watch, it allows the Apple Watch to do some things
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:47.060]   that you wouldn't otherwise be able to do on the watch, which I think is pretty cool.
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:48.460]   I think that's really interesting.
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:49.460]   Yeah.
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:53.620]   Andy said it's just it's a remarkable enhancement of the just the ability to get worked on on
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:58.100]   a live and yet when I saw this, I thought, Oh, Apple's going to hate this.
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:05:59.100]   Guess not.
[01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:00.100]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:04.940]   I just feels like this is exactly what the iPad's not supposed to do.
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:08.140]   But this is the new that is and I think there's a there's a reason they want an Apple
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.140]   design award.
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:10.140]   It's Apple's signaling.
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:12.460]   Well, but also it's signaling.
[01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:14.100]   It's okay.
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:16.700]   You can use an iPad for serious work.
[01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:17.700]   It's okay.
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:21.500]   Well, not not only that, but I think it's a great vote towards customization and giving
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:24.940]   the user more control, which is something Apple seems like they didn't want you to do
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:25.940]   before, right?
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:30.260]   Apple has always sent very, very mixed messages on that at best mixed messages.
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:34.500]   And that doesn't just affect Apple products.
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:37.740]   It also affects developers who might have a really great idea, but they don't want to
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:42.540]   risk it if they decide that wouldn't be great to have a calculator as in the notification
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:43.900]   system.
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:45.220]   Maybe Apple will approve it.
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.220]   Yeah, right.
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:47.700]   And maybe they'll do both.
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:50.620]   Since much worth of work and it just rolled the dice.
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:55.100]   And so to see Apple approve an app that says muscular as this, that's really it's it's
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:07:01.060]   it's a very it really does feel like a very non iOS type of app.
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:06.540]   And by that I mean that you're not used to you're not used to living in a post iOS 8
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:09.980]   world in which you have a lot more control as a user over this device.
[01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:14.100]   You can't just you're not just limited to the stuff that Apple will let you and developers
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:15.100]   do.
[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:19.860]   Apple is a least you're still in the corral, but they've made it's more like a jungle theme
[01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:25.300]   park where the animals roam free and you're in cars.
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:29.340]   The boardings are in little cars that are in the victims of the other people.
[01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:33.780]   Is this how much of this is influenced by the doesn't feel like Microsoft's surface has
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:36.140]   been so successful that Apple should worry.
[01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:41.940]   And yet these are I mean let's face it the slide and all that is straight from Windows
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:42.940]   eight.
[01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:46.300]   How much of this is when it's been a long there's been a long debate inside Apple about
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:50.300]   how whether and I like and I you know you can these are all intelligent debates when
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:53.780]   you talk about when we argue about Google or Apple or Microsoft it's almost always the
[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:56.940]   same debates they have inside the company because they're all super smart people.
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:00.720]   And in Apple there was a debate about whether or not an iPad should always be that thing
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:05.340]   where someone who's felt alienated by traditional computing can feel safe can have a home button
[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:07.500]   and an icon and can always get back there.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.500]   Right.
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:11.420]   But they've shown over time that they're able to add levels of complexity like you have
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:15.740]   control center and notification center and all these things that someone who doesn't
[01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:18.580]   know about them never has to never has to worry about them.
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:22.140]   They're never an impediment to them getting to the simple functionality of the iPad.
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:25.540]   And with them it's not it's not always like should we have side by side apps or should
[01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:29.860]   we have this is how should we implement it in a way that provides a functionality to
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:33.580]   advanced users without ever getting in the way of someone who's picking up a computing
[01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:35.360]   device for their first time.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:39.620]   And this is that kind of system it's if you never know about multi window apps you'll never
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:42.940]   know about them you'll just run your apps the same way you always did if and when you
[01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:46.780]   accidentally discover it or you read about it or hear about it you can try it out and
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:50.340]   if you like it you can use it and if you don't again they'll never get in the way of your
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:51.340]   computing.
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:54.740]   So some people at Apple believe and you know we know Tim Cook uses his iPad.
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:56.980]   I don't know if most of the time but a lot of the time.
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:57.980]   Oh interesting.
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:01.700]   There's a lot of really hardcore iPad users and just like the Apple watch is built on
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:06.780]   the same foundations as the iPhone and iPad they all have backboard and frontboard and
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:10.580]   then the iPhones and iPads run springboard and the watch runs carousel and Apple TV is
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:11.580]   similar.
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:15.540]   You can maybe do something with that top layer that lets the iPad be more of a tablet that
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:21.820]   takes advantage of its silicon and its screen and lets it be more than just a large iPhone.
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:26.060]   But how do you do that without taking away what you've already provided and that's why
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:30.300]   maybe they move slowly sometimes or maybe they do things one step at a time but I think
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:35.580]   it ultimately gets to a place where the device itself can better fit the needs of more people
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:39.220]   and you never feel like oh this is half desktop half mobile I'm confused I don't know how
[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:42.860]   to do it I have one version of the software here and they don't want any of that to ever
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:47.820]   happen and it does take time but I think so far the tracker is at least pretty good.
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:52.940]   Now I think it's that's absolutely true and that tracks with stuff that I've been hearing
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:57.300]   as well but I think a lot of it is also due to the fact that you don't really know what
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:00.740]   you've built until you get millions of people using it and then those people tell you what
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:02.820]   you've built.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:08.140]   One of the takeaways from the first iPad intro was that they were very very vague about
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:12.540]   what this was I think they realized this was a device with a lot of potential but they
[01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:15.820]   really can't they don't want to tell people it's a book reader they don't want to tell
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:18.900]   people it's something that can replace your notebook because people are going to tell
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:24.140]   you how to use it and so over the years people have been using an iPad as a primary device
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:29.620]   through a lot of people that just don't have a need for the full muscle power of a notebook
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:35.420]   and they really do want something simpler there's a very very popular gift to give your
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:39.980]   if you've got a mom or dad who's 60 or 70 years old and they're just not intrigued
[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:43.260]   by computers like they like you are they just want to be able to keep up with Facebook
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:47.820]   and get pictures from the family a lot of people are they're either going out and buying iPads
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:51.420]   because they find that it works just as well for them and I think they've collected a lot
[01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:56.060]   of that information they've also looked at what Samsung has done when a very very similar
[01:10:56.060 --> 01:11:01.660]   split screen mode they've seen how the UI of Windows 8 works which is also very very
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:05.100]   similar and it's there I don't think Apple is beyond saying you know what this does
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:08.900]   actually work very very well we can do it better but with this is not a bad idea and
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:14.260]   there's no reason for us not to implement it this way so the other but the but you do
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:19.940]   have a really big point in that sometimes you know when we're when we're being pundits
[01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:24.420]   and we're saying I wish Apple would add this I wish Apple for instance would would fix
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:27.940]   springboard because oh my god it's still the exact same application launcher that they had
[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:32.340]   on the Newton message pad in the late 1990s for God's sake and what we're clamoring for
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:38.420]   is for Apple to replace springboard with something better when what Apple actually would tend
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:44.620]   to do is to put something put in new features into iOS that make springboard less important
[01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:49.460]   or even obsolete and that's what they've been doing with spotlight on iOS 9 where you can
[01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:54.660]   still complain about how the springboard is clumsy but it's hard to organize your own
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:59.500]   apps but in a year's time or two years time you will never really even touch it you will
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:03.740]   just simply swipe to the left where Apple has where the operating system has anticipated
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:09.660]   that here are the six apps you almost certainly were meaning to launch at this moment and
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:14.580]   and here's the data that you not that you were going to launch an app in order to get
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:19.460]   we dug that out of your calendar we dug that out of your other messaging app and makes
[01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:22.860]   it so that you don't have to launch apps quite so often so there's so much.
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.900]   Or maybe that's the center and springboards to the right.
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:29.900]   Yeah exactly it's it's so it's so it's that's that's why you always have to make these
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:35.620]   punditry comments with at least five pounds of humility because if Apple just gave us
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:39.340]   what we asked for and responded directly to what we were complaining about instead of
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:43.740]   thinking about the reasons why we're complaining about certain things iOS wouldn't be nearly
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:49.060]   as good or Mac OS even wouldn't be nearly as good as it is right now.
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:55.020]   Let's take a little break come back lots more to talk about also picks serenity call
[01:12:55.020 --> 01:13:01.420]   and where they call serenity can I just call you all to our two detonator please please
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:05.740]   you want our two detonators here is really called off my more.com or a Richie who has
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:12.220]   no fancy roller derby name and yet yeah I get to I get to earn one but what would it be
[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:16.940]   if you had one oh I don't know I think those things have to come I think always those things
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:22.180]   have to come out of the moment if you try to step they're given to you not not chosen.
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:25.020]   I don't know but I think if it comes out of the moment then it feels better if you try
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:29.380]   to make one up it's always going to be quasi lame serenity would you get to work on that?
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:36.060]   I will think I will think hard he needs a name he's also at imore.com and any and I
[01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:40.900]   go from the Chicago Sun times I'm Leo LaPorta our show today brought to you by brain tree

[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:42.660]   Mac break we thank them so much for this report of Mac break weekly let's see apple
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:48.020]   will I don't know you get you got to interpret this headline from recode apple will share
[01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:54.820]   71.5% of apple music revenue with music rights owners in the US is that good is that bad
[01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:59.380]   what does that mean is it is it a concession why is this a news story it's a news story
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:04.940]   because people want to know how much artists are being made oh okay and whether or not
[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:09.300]   it's a good deal or a bad deal streaming music services have in the past been derided
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:15.660]   for how little they pay artists sometimes fractions of pennies I mean this kind of a
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:19.820]   news story is still pretty early on in the game we still you know apples like we've got
[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:22.900]   a big catalog we're not really talking about what we have in the catalog but we've got a
[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:27.580]   big catalog and we're going to pay artists and it's going to be great are but they are
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:32.340]   making these they're making these negotiations right now so the number yeah the numbers known
[01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:39.660]   yeah I think that in general this is a good you know it's a good thing apple has in in
[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:45.540]   the past always been pretty good to their artists in contrast to other services but
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:51.540]   streaming is a new an entirely new venture for them we do have like iTunes radio is probably
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:55.060]   the closest comparison that we can have to what they've been paying their artists I'm
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:17:00.500]   not sure because I'm not super well versed on percentages and stuff when it comes to
[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:05.340]   streaming service revenue how this shakes out it seems close to what they they pay for
[01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:11.460]   like they pay 70 percent right if you buy it on iTunes and keep 30 so this is right in
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:16.660]   there yeah I don't know what it how it's comparable or not my guess is the fact that
[01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:20.820]   they said this means it's a good number it's a number that not only the record labels will
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:27.020]   like but artists will like by the way that 71.5% is the average the numbers will fluctuate
[01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:37.660]   outside the US actually apple pay 71.5% in the US it will average around 73% worldwide
[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:43.100]   executives at the labels apples working with said that's the number now that includes payments
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:46.700]   to the people who own the sound recordings as well as publishing rights and that's something
[01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:53.260]   that is a little different radio pays royalties to publishing rights alone and they don't
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:58.700]   pay performance rights so this is better than broadcast radio at least it might it's my
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:02.940]   understanding I'm sure the chat will correct me if I'm wrong on that and of course it doesn't
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:05.420]   mean that's money that's going to go to the artist it means that's money that goes to
[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:11.020]   the labels as we know there's somehow gets stuck there a lot of times just like doesn't
[01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:16.180]   flow through apple won't pay music owners anything for songs that are streamed during
[01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:21.460]   the three month trial sorry kids apparently that was something the music labels didn't
[01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:30.220]   like but according to apple these payments are it was Robert condor who's the guy who's
[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:34.460]   negotiating these deals these payments are a few percentage points higher than the industry
[01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:40.500]   standard in part to account for the three month trial period so that's three times longer
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:49.780]   than most other services the exception to the industry standard is Spotify apple of course
[01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:55.380]   doesn't like the fact that Spotify offers free music and neither do the record companies
[01:18:55.380 --> 01:19:00.180]   that was the bone of contention with Taylor Swift and why she pulled 1989 off of Spotify
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:03.900]   they they insisted on have if she was gonna be on Spotify she had to be available in the
[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:12.620]   free tier as well apple will offer a free tier via iTunes and beats one but I don't
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:17.140]   know that's more like radio right apple says they'll pay music owners a much lower fee
[01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:28.300]   for music streamed on radio and beats one so radio yeah well no iTunes radio so by the
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:32.780]   way that that's good news that iTunes radio is going to continue I was a little worried
[01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:40.420]   they kind of have deprecated it disappeared from the menu and then I had iTunes 11 that's
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:47.540]   a surprising guy I hope that apple does some sort of clarification event if in a few in
[01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:51.340]   a few months when they when they got 10 minutes on a stage I wish they could they could put
[01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:56.780]   their entire music strategy forward in one simple 10 minute professional presentation
[01:19:56.780 --> 01:20:02.380]   but makes me gives me a better overview of what they're what they're providing and what each
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:11.500]   corner of this service provides yeah apple will stream at 256 kilobits that is kind of typical
[01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:17.660]   Spotify gives you three choices there's an extreme streaming that will do three out of 20
[01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:26.140]   kilobits apple will not do that high level beats used to do 320 at its top level
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:34.700]   why am I getting a holy moly never mind don't look at my pay no attention to my website
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:40.180]   oh I know why the next web wanted to give me notifications and then they gave me a page
[01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:46.780]   of options I hate I'm not crazy about the web notification thing I gotta say I have never
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:53.140]   ever ever enabled any web access to notifications or location you'd have to be pretty special
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:21:00.220]   for me to do that Spotify Google play music and audio all stream at their highest 320
[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:07.660]   kilobits now most of them do mp3's apple I presume will be doing AAC's right or do we
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:14.100]   know I believe AAC's yeah and that's that's one of the things I forget who was talking
[01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:18.900]   about this which is a shame because they know their stuff about music I think it was Kirk
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:26.700]   McKellern actually was pointing out that AAC is a slightly stronger codec than your traditional
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:30.860]   mp3 so it doesn't matter that they're streaming it a slightly lower bit rate because it sounds
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:35.900]   better is from the same people who did mp3 it's their successor to mp3 and gives you better
[01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:41.380]   quality at lower bit rates apple has confirmed 256 kilobits not they have not confirmed
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:49.500]   AAC but there are I think there are those who say 256 kilobits AAC would be about the same
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:55.660]   as 320 kilobits mp3 and most people would say I don't know yeah we should I can't tell
[01:21:55.660 --> 01:22:02.300]   to it maybe I don't know you know what I think I think you made the point for most people
[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:07.580]   they're for most people better masterings of the music will be a bigger difference than
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:13.100]   the rate of the spy a better speaker than that beats pill and just an apples I think
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:16.060]   I believe they're paying a lot of attention out of mastering their music which for a lot
[01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:20.020]   of people again will be much better than just having a high quality stream of a low quality
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:26.860]   master when I was first came out we heard a lot of stories about iTunes employees taking
[01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:31.220]   CD sticking them in their machines and ripping them so that they could populate the music
[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:36.180]   library I doubt they do that still but that's the mastering you're talking about not the
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:40.540]   making of the CD and the original CD but of making of the mp3 or the AC file I'm sorry
[01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:44.620]   Andy go ahead no I was just going to point out that apple does have a master for iTunes
[01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:49.140]   program that starts right at the right right in the studio so that it's not just take whatever
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:53.340]   tape you have it's it's here's here's what we do with music and here's how you can basically
[01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:56.820]   make sure that whatever content you're making sounds great when it's downloaded from iTunes
[01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:01.140]   so that people that's interesting so in fact they're putting the burden on the label and
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:06.060]   the recording engineer is just simply they're just simply saying if we give you extra detail
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:11.220]   it's about what we're doing on our end that you use this and do with this information what
[01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:15.540]   you will and because you know there's people behind those boards who absolutely know what
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:21.620]   they're doing and they say that oh so your headphone cord is six feet and not three feet
[01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:25.100]   give me a second I'm gonna give you a brand new version of this album because I don't
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:30.500]   like the impedance value I really did mix this for a six foot chord let me do a quick
[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:37.820]   rumor rumor mill here I like this rumor the iPhone 6s that's a rumor we don't even know
[01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:44.380]   what the next phone will be called we'll feature a USB type C connector with that you think
[01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:50.860]   that's credible sure love that is that's truly credible I mean you're talking about something
[01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:57.180]   that apples are to using on one of its computers you're talking about getting I mean as cool
[01:23:57.180 --> 01:24:01.540]   as the lightning standard is you're talking about switching to a universal standard that
[01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:07.060]   could support a whole host of other things and it theoretically makes it easier to work
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:11.500]   with Macbook so I mean it's possible I don't know if it won't if it will come until the
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:19.860]   iPhone 7 but I I'm not I wouldn't be surprised to see it in the success I wouldn't be surprised
[01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:26.260]   everyone crazy yeah we don't you don't need to sink fire wires who needs wires when the
[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:31.220]   battery runs out just I and your welcome put your Apple watch charger on the back the
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:36.900]   only question mark the only question mark in the USB 3 for the iPhone or the iPad for
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:41.380]   that matter is do they have the hardware scaled down so that will fit into whatever three
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:47.700]   microns of space they have available for that controller how small the Macbook is Andy oh
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:52.620]   if it would it looks like it's about the same size right I mean it well we don't know that's
[01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:57.580]   pretty close and there's a type C connector and no I mean just the controllers and everything
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:25:02.940]   else yeah the chip set and a lot lightning has a chip on the outside if I don't remember
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:07.340]   correctly I would love to see just everybody and Google's already said yes type C is coming
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:13.540]   to Android there is issue of course with the EU which requires a micro USB connector although
[01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:18.340]   Apple solves that by just providing an adapter in the box I understand but type C because
[01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:22.820]   it's an open standard it's not lightning I'm thrilled that it they made it available
[01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:27.380]   on the Macbook I expect to see it I hope to see it everywhere but remember hardware changes
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:33.580]   on the S series is on our unusual right yes although we're already talking about force
[01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:39.780]   touch on the digitizing screen well casing changes I mean like they've got better cameras
[01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:43.580]   they've made yeah it's on but the the light and connector came in on the five it didn't
[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:48.980]   come in on the forest right how about you know I would say the case you know if we look
[01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:55.220]   at the sixes case for a second that's about the size of the C connector yeah it's just
[01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:59.700]   a different it like that you might actually not have to change the outer machining and
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:04.540]   just the chip set inside I don't know this for a fact because I don't have a USB C someone
[01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:08.740]   else with a USB C port should should check and see if you can't find right now that size
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:14.860]   but yeah again it's it's not the outside stuff I think it's the inside stuff that I've had
[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:18.940]   I've heard I've heard a couple conflicting reports about the sizes of a lightning the
[01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:25.860]   lightning chips inside inside an iPhone versus support for USB C inside an iPhone trust absolutely
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:31.820]   that's the only reason yeah yeah maybe we maybe we skip the whole next generation plug
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:39.700]   entirely and then we just go to inductive charging maybe wireless charging is great and if you've
[01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:46.180]   seen the Samsung Galaxy S6 ads what's one of the things they ding the iPhone 6 on is
[01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:50.780]   the lack of wireless charging that would eliminate the need for port but I think people like the
[01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:55.900]   idea of a high-speed port for I don't know if you pick up the port you also you also make
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:59.060]   it harder to service the thing you also make it harder to administrate the thing I don't
[01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:03.100]   think that ports going anywhere but it's certainly points out you have a port on the watch but
[01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:09.260]   you just don't it's not for you yeah but it's all I mean I would prefer to keep the port
[01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:16.260]   as is or change it to USB C but additionally wireless charging would not be would not be
[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:22.540]   a complaint wireless chart it also it's such a it's it's one of those great little transformative
[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:26.900]   features that you add to a phone like the first time that I got a wireless charging pad
[01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:31.620]   for my Android phone and realize that my god I have not I've not needed to quote charge
[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:36.020]   and quote my phone for the past nine days because I've got a charging pad on my desk
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:40.780]   I got a charging pad of my nightstand I've got a charging pad on the end table in my living
[01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:44.420]   room where I tend to sit and just the act of dropping my phone where I was going to put
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:49.340]   it anyway causes it to top off the batteries of course be nicer to have a battery that
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:54.100]   lasts more than five or six hours but one step at a time it keeps it keeps our tea hot
[01:27:54.100 --> 01:28:01.820]   it's great I guess they don't include a micro USB port in the Apple box how do they get around
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:06.660]   EU regulations then they have an adapter available you could always as long as it's available
[01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:10.620]   you can do it yeah it's in the box or not but they do it they definitely have one I've
[01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:19.180]   seen them okay and apparently again I'm trusting our European chatters on this one as long as
[01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:26.060]   it's a standard like micro USB type C it would be acceptable as well they say so you wouldn't
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:31.820]   need to do anything extra for that nice yeah and what a fantasy to leave the house with
[01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:37.820]   just one type of cable I was in New York I was in New York last week and I the only cable
[01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:43.180]   I did not bring with me was a lightning cable and so I had to go to a drain read and spend
[01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:48.220]   $14 for an old hot electric pink lightning cable just to make sure that I could still
[01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:56.700]   use my iPad before I got home smashing it's it's adorable I love it but now I've got
[01:28:56.700 --> 01:29:03.540]   our thoughts about about the Apple's content blocking plugins okay so that's an interesting
[01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:07.100]   debate we talked about it on Wednesday on this week in Google Apple has said then mobile
[01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:13.500]   Safari will allow for the first time ever add blockers that says it will include
[01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:20.100]   app blockers right but they will allow it exactly yeah I mean they've just had they've
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:25.140]   just had a new functionality so that among the things you can do is you can actually have
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:28.900]   code that interposes between the browser and the outside world so they can control what
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:33.460]   goes into the browser and so obviously the first application of that is with is naturally
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:38.620]   an ad blocking app I think that's I think it's a good idea because the thing that really
[01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:43.500]   raised my eyebrow a few weeks ago when Tim Cook made his little speech about privacy
[01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:50.460]   and about how Google unnamed outside companies that are within a short drive of us are immoral
[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:55.140]   and they're terrible and they take your your information is that he didn't address the
[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:58.980]   fact that most of the leakiness of personal information comes through web browsers and
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:02.380]   not through the operating system as far as I'm concerned at least that the most damaging
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:06.140]   stuff comes through web browsers those are ad trackers that will profile you and not
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:10.460]   and unlike Google and unlike Facebook they will sell your name and your address and all
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:14.140]   your personal information and your in the profile that they've they've done so I thought that
[01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:19.820]   it's a little bit it's not as valuable for them for him to make that screed about how
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:23.180]   Google does its business without saying that yes but you're not doing anything to help
[01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:29.020]   people on the mobile on iPhones and on iPads the largest most popular browsers in America
[01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:33.380]   to protect their personal information that way so on that basis I should be very much
[01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:37.140]   in favor of this and I am the only problem is that when you start to think about it in
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:42.380]   terms of a larger ecosystem where you say that they're not allowing ad blockers inside
[01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:48.100]   their new news app are they and they do sell ads through the news app and they will allow
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:53.100]   their partners to sell ads through their own news app and what and every time that someone
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:59.900]   uses uses a safari tab without an ad blocker that helps Google in some way because there's
[01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:05.180]   probably Google ad metrics going on there so on the one hand it this is a really big
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:08.780]   win for consumers because you really do need to take control of the flow of your personal
[01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:13.300]   information on the other hand you want to see if there's if there's like a white conference
[01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:18.460]   room that's brightly lit with plants and greenery and like colorful paintings where they talk
[01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:24.380]   about benefits to the users and then like they then and then Tim looks at goes and swatch
[01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:31.380]   and now in the next item on the agenda hey hey slow mo changed the lighting to evil
[01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:36.460]   and now here's how we're going to stick it to Google and how we're going to stick it
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:41.540]   to every publisher that doesn't want to play ball with the news in fairness I mean like
[01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:44.460]   there those content blockers won't work in chrome unless Google enables them they won't
[01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:48.100]   work in flipboard or Google news they won't work in any app including apples news outside
[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:52.700]   of so far they're very much a safari plug-in and you'll like springboard did a great job
[01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:56.140]   this year you like it did a great job this year webkit they did the content blockers
[01:31:56.140 --> 01:32:00.100]   they didn't use safari web view so that if you get a web view inside an app you can now
[01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:03.660]   bring your passwords and forms and bookmarks and stuff with you so you don't have to keep
[01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:08.220]   authenticating again just because you're inside an app and they have a whole new inspector
[01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:11.980]   and then the content blockers we have ads on our website I'm not sure how to feel about
[01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:15.500]   this yet because there are really bad ads but my guess is that people will block all
[01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:20.420]   ads it won't depend on how good or bad the ad is but they showed some demos at WWC where
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:24.260]   they were blocking all sorts of different content including some of the stuff that makes social
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:28.540]   networks almost impossible to use when you're on mobile browsers and it seems to be like
[01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:33.100]   a tool and I just don't know enough about how people are going to use it yet to be too
[01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:38.420]   judgy on it yeah that's that's the big deal we don't also we don't know that people will
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:43.460]   actually want to use it if it becomes if it becomes the number one paid app on the app
[01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:48.100]   store and gets that kind of notice even still there are people who just don't want to customize
[01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:52.500]   whatever they've got in there it's just it's just interesting things to discuss a week or
[01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:58.220]   two after WWDC and just like it was interesting to discuss is Apple going to make sure that
[01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:02.140]   you can't make a living selling apps outside the app store interesting to talk about but
[01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:05.500]   then let's wait and see how they actually implement it and how it actually affects things because
[01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:11.340]   I think I think the it's it's scary especially given that most of the people of three of
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:15.540]   three let's say three of the four people in this conversation make their living through
[01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:21.340]   ads that are on websites and if any company is able to simply turn off that source of revenue
[01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:25.880]   it might be like the days of newspapers 15 or 20 years ago when suddenly they can't sell
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:30.140]   classified ads and they can't sell car ads and they can't sell real estate ads you have
[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:33.540]   to figure out well that's where we're making our money from now how do we redefine ourselves
[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:38.500]   it's great news for Jason it's great news for Jason Stell great news for a Gruber great
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:46.220]   news for anybody else who has their own personal has a blog that is sponsors supported as opposed
[01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:50.660]   to running actual ads though yeah that was the thing was some people were sending us tweets
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:55.060]   saying aha ha is going to kill the ads but for me like it becomes successful it just
[01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:59.020]   creates a bigger market for native ads or for sponsorships or which is exactly what you
[01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:04.180]   don't want if you ask me Ben Thompson has a really interesting thing I want Ben Thompson
[01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:07.300]   has a really interesting take on the native ad stuff where he says it to pay like we've
[01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:11.500]   given native ads a bad name but all the TV shows and stuff we've watched in essence provided
[01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:16.140]   advertising in the same format as the content and even sponsorships reads in podcasts are
[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:20.220]   there the it's the host of the podcast reading it and if done right you could have an experience
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:24.620]   that's really really good and that's carefully curated like what Gruber or Jason Snell provides
[01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:28.660]   it when done wrong you get things like really weird things in the Atlantic that nobody wants
[01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:34.620]   to read right that's the problem yeah it's about thinking about the it's about thinking
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:40.180]   about the end user right it's about thinking about your readers and respecting your readers
[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:44.580]   time and making sure that your readers a know understand what they're reading that you're
[01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:48.980]   not trying to trick them that's the point yeah exactly as long as there is long as you're
[01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:54.020]   not trying to trick them and you make it very clear like we are doing this in part to bring
[01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:59.260]   you good content but also because we legitimately like these guys like we're not going to accept
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:05.260]   sponsors from creepy software company that's going to steal your data here's you know sponsors
[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:10.220]   that we believe in or sponsors that we feel like we can talk about like the the one reason
[01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:14.380]   like the twit ads and the Mac MacRuey the ads are so greatly I was that you can actually
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:19.820]   talk about you know you can talk about nature box and you can talk about Casper and you can
[01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:23.740]   talk about all of these things and it you put a personal touch to it and it's not just
[01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:32.580]   like buy this DVD software by me how to yeah exactly it has to be personal it has to be
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:37.260]   like the old time radio ads if you let's what it is isn't it's the old time it feels like
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:41.540]   a bigger problem for the for the middle class so to speak where an outlet like the New York
[01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:47.380]   Times which is its own juggernaut that they're not going to be affected outlets like a lean
[01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:52.180]   operations that have only two or three people are not going to be affected that much because
[01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:57.740]   on top of on top of what Ren said it really is part of the relationship that the creator
[01:35:57.740 --> 01:36:03.300]   has with the audience because when I see an ad on Jason's side or when I see an ad on
[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:07.420]   on on on Gruber's side I don't think that I don't see this big ad machine that's trying
[01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:12.580]   to sell coke I see that here is a way that I can I'm I'm grateful that this company is
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:18.140]   helping to create this product create this website that I visit on a regular basis and
[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:22.900]   the you know that the person who is adding this ad in is also grateful for that content
[01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:27.460]   it's the people in the middle that might have a might have a problem but even then as Renee
[01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:32.620]   said there are ways around that you could simply change your site so that you get a
[01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:37.260]   different experience with an ad blocker either by shaming people or by simply saying we have
[01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:42.620]   a 400 word version of our 1600 word feature article that is available to anybody without
[01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:47.140]   an ad blocker if you'd like to turn that off then we can show you all this great content
[01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:51.700]   so it's it's it's changed and people are going to have to just change this to go see it.
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:56.580]   Yeah be curious how that works. It's I mean it didn't work out well for newspapers but
[01:36:56.580 --> 01:37:01.700]   it also created again the ability for Jason after leaving leaving leaving a huge publisher
[01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:08.260]   to make a what I see what I believe to be an acceptable living for a for a family person
[01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:13.220]   on content that he creates with a small group of friends yeah and that's that's not a bad
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:22.820]   thing either. Nope. Anything else in the rundown you fellows and gals wish to discuss before
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:27.540]   we take a break and come to our picks of the week. One thing left on the table is watch
[01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:31.980]   OS 2 which kind of felt like half half rounding out the features that didn't get finished
[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:37.020]   in watch OS 1 and also getting compatibility with all the new stuff in iOS 9 so I was quite
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:42.180]   happy with it. Yepers. Yeah it really does it really does feel even more in retrospect
[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:46.660]   that April was a soft launch for the watch. Yes. And that won't it's not really going
[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:52.100]   to be released until September or October. Yeah. When watch 2.0 comes out and has all
[01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:58.300]   these features that are just such so that feels so important for Apple watch to make
[01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:02.420]   it that much more useful and not just more useful but more usable and the ability to
[01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:06.580]   simply walk and go into the car drive to the mall walk into an Apple store and walk out
[01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:11.180]   with an Apple watch after a demo which is only going to start in another couple of weeks
[01:38:11.180 --> 01:38:16.380]   to three weeks isn't it where you can finally start buying the Apple store. So yep maybe
[01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:27.460]   sooner. So much stuff Leo big dub dub. Big dub dub. Yeah. Fun dub dub. And I think
[01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:30.740]   the videos people can actually access the videos again this year without being like
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:33.460]   there's a whole bunch of other stuff we didn't touch on like developer accounts that having
[01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:37.820]   to pay $100 you can still run code on your own apps there's new distribution test flight
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:42.060]   got a lot better and all the sessions I believe you don't need to log in to watch them so
[01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:46.780]   if you're at all interested in how and realize and these videos were beautifully made this
[01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:50.500]   year it wasn't just the slides being shown they even the smaller presentations they were
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:56.300]   cutting and showing angles so if you have if you're interested at all in this go to developer.apple.com
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:39:01.500]   and start watching. That's good to know. Really great stuff. Yeah. I love it that they
[01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:06.300]   didn't you know in the past they've been so tight with that information and only it makes
[01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:10.580]   sense to encourage developers right. The live streaming was phenomenal there were groups
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:13.180]   of developers who just couldn't make it in or couldn't have a place to go and they sat
[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:17.980]   together and they watched it and it was rock solid it was a tremendously well done. Yeah.
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:21.860]   Yeah. That was that was one of the best streams I've ever seen I've done of course this is
[01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:25.540]   the season of which I'm doing nothing but being it saying in my office looking at three
[01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:29.820]   screens and trying to keep up with two streams at the same time and I'm not gonna say anything
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:36.100]   but I think I know who did that stream. Enough awesome people. People who know what they
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:42.540]   do. Either way. Either way. The Scarlet Pimpeney. I think that Apple got brought in the pros
[01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:49.140]   from Dover is what I'm saying. Yeah. And the pros from Dover make no mistakes and they
[01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:55.140]   certainly don't show Chinese translation and truck slides. But if you think about it this
[01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:59.860]   wasn't just one event this was I think they broadcast every section in Presidio which is
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:04.340]   three or four talks a day I think is at 650 or 60 session maybe it was just 30 but still
[01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:08.260]   tremendous amount of streaming over the span of a week it wasn't like one and done few
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:13.220]   were out of here go get a beer it was every day all day streaming and that's so error prone
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:17.620]   and to do it like that is just phenomenal. This announcement from our web dev team we
[01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:28.140]   have now turned on our fifth dino. All the dinos. All the dinos. Turn on the fifth dino.
[01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:33.020]   And I asked I asked Matt grill who is running who has actually got his hand on the slider
[01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:41.140]   I said can you make a physical dial just like a maybe a big vowel. And a sound coming out.
[01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:46.420]   Coming out. Oh Leo that that's level one level two is you want one of those like big
[01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:50.980]   old timey like bridge of the ship things we just yeah this big. You change. You change
[01:40:50.980 --> 01:40:56.580]   the whole full full. And bring back all the old. A ship's telegraph. They should say
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:41:03.460]   dinos on the side all ahead full. I know factor one I know factor two. The boilers are all
[01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:09.260]   fired up. The steve adores are shoveling coal as fast as they can and the immigrants in
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:13.340]   the third deck still dancing and singing as if they have no idea the calamity of the
[01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:22.900]   boilers damn damn that I spoke ahead full speed. If everybody would just go to that
[01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:28.820]   TV now and tried it. I would like to get to a sixth dino. Can we how many dinos are
[01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:34.300]   not there's an infinite number of dinos available apparently. It's got to be kind of
[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:40.940]   those can you water. Do you see so you see so in Valley on Sunday. It's such a funny
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:51.580]   show. They're testing their middle out compression and and they have an event. Oh there's a guy

[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:37.020]   for free when you go to L Y N D A dot com slash Mac break Linda L Y N D A dot com slash Mac
[01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:42.860]   break and we thank them so much for their support. And I'm serious by the way we have
[01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:50.260]   an API on the new website. You can email API at tuk.tv if you know how to do restful you
[01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:55.900]   know JSON programming and and it doesn't you know no not no language specific. If you
[01:44:55.900 --> 01:45:00.900]   somebody saying we need a lights out version of the live stream page you could write your
[01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:06.980]   own. I hope I expect I really would love to see people you know do their own version
[01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:13.040]   of the Twit website the API is completed every everything you see on the on the website comes
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:17.980]   from the public API that means you could do it yourself too. And more information on the
[01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:23.020]   website at twit.tv just click that orange button that says learn more and as you scroll
[01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:28.140]   down you'll see the not only the explanation of why the site is the way it is the design
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:33.660]   decisions that went into it the great Drupal and node programmers and dust and SAS programmers
[01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:39.420]   who helped make this who built this site from scratch over there at four kitchens but also
[01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:46.060]   information about how to get involved with the developer no charge. I'm really really
[01:45:46.060 --> 01:45:52.020]   excited about that idea. It's an open API public API. We're thinking I think we think
[01:45:52.020 --> 01:46:00.700]   I think of our what we do not as a web page or a podcast or an RSS feed but really is
[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:06.100]   and this is sounds a little fancy but content as a service the idea that our content is
[01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:13.100]   available to you in any form you wish. Elroy is our back end that's a Drupal back end somebody's
[01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:21.020]   asking what's Elroy.twit.tv that you you can't get into I hope. I will find out I fervently
[01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:25.900]   hope that's our own in-house back end you can't because you have to actually well I won't
[01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:34.020]   explain all the security but anyway the nice thing is though that Elroy is the entire back
[01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:38.380]   end workflow now goes through the Drupal part of the website to the so all of our editors
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:42.220]   when I post content on the site everything goes through the Drupal and then is available
[01:46:42.220 --> 01:46:47.420]   via API so the website sees it but anybody else can see it too so you can subscribe to
[01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:55.300]   post via the API new shows whatever it's pretty interesting we shall I'll start I gotta learn
[01:46:55.300 --> 01:47:04.380]   it myself we'll start posting snippets and stuff it's very cool. Let's see here Andy
[01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:10.820]   and not go you want to start off kick off our pics. Yeah Adobe just did their big annual
[01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:15.820]   update to the Adobe Creative Cloud package this is remember a couple years ago that they
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:20.940]   switched from buy Photoshop for oh my god dollars and you own it to how about a subscription
[01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:25.260]   plan where we will roll out updates and bug fixes month after month after month and we'll
[01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:30.180]   do a one wrath of god update on top of that every single year so that just dropped two
[01:47:30.180 --> 01:47:36.340]   days ago and it's a good opportunity to renew my recommendation of their special Creative
[01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:40.940]   Cloud photography plan where for ten bucks a month you get the full version of Photoshop
[01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:44.700]   you get the full version of Adobe Lightroom and you get all the cloud features that are
[01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:51.340]   very much in the same sort of vein as Apple photos where you can like import like your
[01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:58.580]   the 800 pictures that you took on your vacation to into Lightroom and then overnight will
[01:47:58.580 --> 01:48:02.180]   automatically sink into into the cloud and then while you're on your morning commute when
[01:48:02.180 --> 01:48:06.140]   you're on the commuter rail you can then be on your iPad the Lightroom for iPad and be
[01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:10.660]   triaging your photos selecting things making adjustments things like that but the amount
[01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:14.940]   the number of tools that you get for enhancing photos go far far beyond anything you can
[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:19.300]   get with pretty much anything other than Lightroom and Photoshop and once again these aren't
[01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:22.860]   demo versions these aren't junior editions these are the full professional versions of
[01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:30.420]   it and as far as new features that they added this time they haven't added a lot of really
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:37.100]   huge features that amateur and hobbyist photographers can really use but the ones that they did
[01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:43.060]   add are pretty cool this the marquee one is this new D haze feature because how many times
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:47.660]   have you taken a picture and with your human eyes you can see when you were there you saw
[01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:52.580]   what beautiful clouds and a beautiful Vista with wonderful grass and beautiful rust color
[01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:55.620]   in the mountains and then when you actually look at the picture because you took this
[01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:59.940]   picture at like one in the afternoon there's sort of this haze mid afternoon haze all over
[01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:04.700]   everything and would take you like an hour of unskilled labor in order to figure out how
[01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:08.620]   to sort of address that now there's sort of an automatic magic feature that simply removes
[01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:13.020]   the haze from a picture and those are the features that you get when you decide to pay
[01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:18.100]   ten bucks a month just things like this is not a new feature but the magical feature
[01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:25.220]   of when you need to crop and zoom something or you're suddenly a panorama or putting together
[01:49:25.220 --> 01:49:29.260]   a whole bunch of pictures in one stitching together in one thing not only can of course
[01:49:29.260 --> 01:49:33.740]   Lightroom and Photoshop do that for you but of course because you know took all these
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:37.820]   pictures at different angles you don't wind up with a beautifully square picture you wind
[01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:42.620]   up with something that's kind of bowed in this way and the first time that you don't
[01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:46.380]   believe that this feature is going to work but you say okay fine I will select these
[01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:51.380]   white areas and then I will say smart fill and you find out that oh now that is filled
[01:49:51.380 --> 01:49:54.500]   with trees and it's filled with grass and it's filled with sky and it's filled with clouds
[01:49:54.500 --> 01:50:00.020]   and it looks like there's nothing no no fixes haven't done whatsoever you realize that
[01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:05.420]   Photoshop you just earned your ten bucks for the month today so it's a it's it's not a
[01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:10.380]   ten bucks a month is it nothing but it's a lot cheaper than buying Photoshop and Lightroom
[01:50:10.380 --> 01:50:14.540]   and the fact that you get all these new features that keep coming in on a regular basis for
[01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:19.820]   free and you really don't appreciate all the problems you can solve with your pictures
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:23.220]   all the things that you're unimpressed by and all the things you're frustrated by when
[01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:26.860]   you get home and you're looking at this picture that you thought was going to be so wonderful
[01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:32.020]   but it's just nothing it's okay but it's a snapshot but I want to take a photograph
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:35.820]   ten bucks a month will give you all the tools you need to turn that into a real photograph
[01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:40.300]   and once again the cloud features are really really nice to me for me the big problem is
[01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:44.940]   coming home with hundreds of pictures and then not having the time to triage out the
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:48.900]   the 60 or 70 that are good and then doing the fixes to the 20 or 30 that I actually want
[01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:53.740]   to share but the fact of what the fact is that when you can really access all of those
[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:59.820]   pictures you just important to Lightroom on this device and get not just tools for selecting
[01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:06.260]   and organizing but also making crops making edits and making something you can actually
[01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:10.620]   share right out of that app it's just a again time after time it earns that 10 bucks a month
[01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:15.220]   and 10 bucks is not a whole lot for what you're getting there I couldn't agree more such a
[01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:22.060]   good deal so what we call the radio show is using Photoshop 7 not CS 7 7 yeah and she said
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:28.700]   it won't stall on my new computer with a two terabyte drive and said yeah that's because
[01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:34.820]   in the days of Photoshop 7 nobody had drives that big it's confused it's just incredible
[01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:42.100]   and the first and it's changed a lot since then and again the times we realized that oh
[01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:46.580]   I'm an idiot I wish I had I wish I had noticed that this person is standing in front of a
[01:51:46.580 --> 01:51:51.340]   tree because now this tree is like kind of blocking this person and the ability to simply
[01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:56.380]   in a smart way in a very very few clicks select that person drag them from where they are
[01:51:56.380 --> 01:52:00.260]   in the picture to an empty spot where you would like them to be and then it's filled
[01:52:00.260 --> 01:52:04.620]   in automatically and then you decide oh I wish the perspective on this building I was
[01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:09.220]   it's like this but I wish it were like this and again with about 20 minutes of just telling
[01:52:09.220 --> 01:52:13.340]   Photoshop here are the corners of that building and I'll please pretend there's a camera
[01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:17.700]   and I'm going to move the tripod someplace else and the entire building just moves as
[01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:21.700]   though you're rotating around it and you're like that would have taken me a lot more trouble
[01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:25.820]   and time that would have taken for just a picture I want to make fun of on Twitter.
[01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:32.540]   I pay ten bucks I told her pay don't be such a cheapskate pay ten bucks a month get the
[01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:35.500]   latest version you might like it.
[01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:44.180]   Serenity Caldwell I'm so sorry I've I've lost my manners I forgot you were a lady ladies
[01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:50.540]   first I called I called on the guy with sideburns sideburns first I mean they are very they
[01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:54.460]   are very nice sideburns they're luxuriant nice to see some love for facial here I did
[01:52:54.460 --> 01:52:59.980]   I'm not going to pretend it is sideburns first here at Twitter that's for sure yeah sorry
[01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:06.260]   what do you have yeah my pick this week is actually I was lucky enough to get a review
[01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:14.940]   unit of the modern buckle from the fine folks at Apple and I'm currently reviewing this
[01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:20.260]   the review should go up on I'm more hopefully later this week but I it is very very quickly
[01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:25.740]   become my all time favorite Apple watch band and I have tried on pretty much all of them
[01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:32.020]   now it's the also the most expensive save for the link bracelet of the Apple watch bands
[01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:37.820]   it's two hundred forty nine dollars but you know what I have never worn a leather strap
[01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:42.820]   on a watch that I did not hate is they usually sweaty yeah or they're too heavy or they just
[01:53:42.820 --> 01:53:47.180]   you know they just don't feel good on your wrist and this thing feels this thing feels
[01:53:47.180 --> 01:53:53.060]   like a sport band I forget that I'm not wearing a sport band until I put on something nice
[01:53:53.060 --> 01:54:00.540]   and then I'm like oh my my watch actually matches my my my clothing rather than you know
[01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:04.500]   it kind of pops out a little bit I mean I like wearing the white sport band and I like
[01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:08.900]   wearing the black sport band and I even like doing color combinations but there are certain
[01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:14.900]   there's times and places for certain bands and I really like the modern buckle I liked
[01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:19.820]   it when I saw it at the preview and I really like it now that I've gotten to spend some
[01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:26.420]   time wearing it and also it just it makes this nice little key sound I this is this is way
[01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:31.460]   too much fun to do it's just a magnet like that and you can just it looks like it's a
[01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:36.700]   buckle in fact they even call it a buckle but no it's a magnet it is not a buckle it looks
[01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:42.220]   like it it's very pretty but no there's there there is no buckle in this unless you count
[01:54:42.220 --> 01:54:50.100]   the magnetic unclasping I think you can resize it like a quasi buckle if it if you want to
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:57.060]   change your wrist on the on the inside here this is the medium strap these are all pretty
[01:54:57.060 --> 01:55:05.100]   small but on the inside here you've got these little individual holes and you can just pop
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:12.260]   this forward and resize accordingly if you want to lengthen it or shorten it and then
[01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:16.740]   you never have like unlike a normal buckle you don't have to choose like a same hole every
[01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:20.940]   time once that whole set all you have to do is just snap it and then it looks like it's
[01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:25.220]   perfectly sized for your wrist and you don't have to worry about like tucking and hiding
[01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:29.460]   and anything like that it just it's really comfy and it doesn't have the same kind of
[01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:34.780]   dig in that the sport does when you have to like tuck it under because it's already pre
[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:40.780]   rebuilt that way I don't know I I am really really enjoying it also the the crazy thing
[01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:46.180]   I didn't realize it when I first got the leather on this I'm like this doesn't feel like leather
[01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:51.740]   this feels kind of I was like this this feels fake because what it actually is is two thin
[01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:59.500]   layers of leather and then the inside like the the internals of this band in between like
[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:05.300]   the outer leather and the inner leather is this crazy space stuff that that Apple stole
[01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:10.100]   from NASA or they're basically like hey we have a great idea to make our band more durable
[01:56:10.100 --> 01:56:19.340]   we're going to wrap hardcore plasticine I forget what exactly the stuff is we're gonna wrap
[01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:25.260]   it in leather and so it's going to look and it's gonna look like a leather band but it's
[01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:28.340]   going to feel like something like the sport band what is it?
[01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:32.740]   Vectron weave I don't even know what vector weave is but it feels amazing on my own cutting
[01:56:32.740 --> 01:56:38.820]   to another yes all it's the same yeah it's the same material NASA used to make the landing
[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:44.020]   airbags for the mass NASA or the Mars River spacecraft so I have airbag material on my
[01:56:44.020 --> 01:56:50.740]   wrist sadly I don't think that it expands to you know save me from falling save the watch
[01:56:50.740 --> 01:56:55.580]   so if you're a fan of women's roller derby on the east coast you can look forward to see
[01:56:55.580 --> 01:57:00.260]   bruises and dings on other people's faces roughly the same size and shape as that buckle
[01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:05.500]   if they've been playing the boss teams oh no no no no you would never damage the watch
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:16.140]   that way yeah it was a good you know what all right all right sideburns I accept that
[01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:21.660]   as a compliment for which it was intended that's Mr. Burnside to you captain it's like
[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:24.860]   there must be something they're drinking over there at iMOR they're so into these watch
[01:57:24.860 --> 01:57:33.060]   bands Renee's like got a team and shiny Leo yeah it's all you can get right victims of
[01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:37.340]   our of our lust for new and shiny tech gadgets yeah not apologetic about it yeah it's the
[01:57:37.340 --> 01:57:41.940]   first one in years wait till you see what we do with the iPad Pro yeah it's gonna be
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:49.020]   glorious what is your pick Renee I have to I wanted to quickly mention the WDC app it
[01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:52.900]   was really useful during the conference because you could quickly favorite stuff and add them
[01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:56.260]   to your calendars and would show up on your watch and it was just glorious but it's still
[01:57:56.260 --> 01:57:59.940]   a really important app because a lot of the videos that are available from the sessions
[01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:04.340]   are now in this app and it goes back over the years so if you were whether you're new and
[01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:08.220]   you want to start from the beginning and see how things have evolved or you just want to
[01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:12.260]   get the latest apps and you want to know your mobile devices the WDC app makes it super
[01:58:12.260 --> 01:58:17.340]   easy to get all of those and then I wanted to give a shout out to fantastic Al they updated
[01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:21.820]   right before WWDC with their watch version and it solved this really big problem for
[01:58:21.820 --> 01:58:25.860]   me and it seems to be calling it a problem but Apple did not build in reminders dot app
[01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:29.940]   into the watch so if you had reminders you could get the alerts for them but you couldn't
[01:58:29.940 --> 01:58:35.500]   see them and if there were no alerts associated it was difficult and fantastic Al has the reminders
[01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:40.660]   built in and they're very easy to access the glance is super detailed it's sort of what
[01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:45.420]   they did on the iPhone the iPad and the Mac which is take an app that Apple maybe didn't
[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:49.620]   do everything they could have with it and made a super great version of it it's inverse
[01:58:49.620 --> 01:58:56.140]   sure locking which I think Jason Snell and I agreed is called more more yardying it's
[01:58:56.140 --> 01:59:00.260]   just a terrific experience and what's really great about it is you'll they'll be able to
[01:59:00.260 --> 01:59:05.020]   do a native version eventually anyway but for now I just get all my all my reminders
[01:59:05.020 --> 01:59:08.620]   they're just there and I don't have to worry about it anymore.
[01:59:08.620 --> 01:59:09.620]   Very nice.
[01:59:09.620 --> 01:59:12.740]   Oh and they won the Apple Design Award and in a in something I don't think I've ever
[01:59:12.740 --> 01:59:19.260]   seen before fantastic Al not the iOS version or the Mac version but fantastic Al writ large
[01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:20.260]   one Apple Design Award.
[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:21.260]   It's a family.
[01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:23.220]   Yeah which was really cool.
[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:27.700]   You know it's I've been going back and forth because I paid for busy cow and I like busy
[01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:35.140]   contacts and I've been using it for years and and I also paid for fantastic Al too but
[01:59:35.140 --> 01:59:39.220]   the watch thing might put me over the top that's nice because they use natural like
[01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:41.780]   the one of the big things we didn't really discuss during the spotlight stuff is that
[01:59:41.780 --> 01:59:46.060]   all of Apple stuff is natural language now maybe we did discuss it but it's just an easy
[01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:50.460]   very human way to interact show me documents I used last week that have Leo report in them
[01:59:50.460 --> 01:59:54.380]   and it just tells you and fantastic Al has always done that and I found it a super fast
[01:59:54.380 --> 01:59:57.700]   way to just get things in and to find things again once I put them in.
[01:59:57.700 --> 01:59:58.700]   Nice.
[01:59:58.700 --> 02:00:04.620]   All right so I have a couple of things to show first of all I've been ordering every
[02:00:04.620 --> 02:00:07.300]   type C connection and cable I can.
[02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:11.900]   Bono price has a sort of a subset not great they have like they don't have an SD card
[02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:14.820]   reader but they have a micro SD card reader.
[02:00:14.820 --> 02:00:22.980]   They everybody makes this type C to USB but I found this was actually on Amazon it's from
[02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:28.100]   Honey or Jelly comb it's kind of interesting it's a USB let me open up you can see I just
[02:00:28.100 --> 02:00:40.180]   got these it's a USB type C to type 3 standard USB type 2 type USB 3 though the throughput
[02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:47.140]   so you could just you can literally just put this in here and now you've got kind of a
[02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:52.060]   USB connector and that's pretty compact for travel stuff like that.
[02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:55.980]   So and they and these are eight dollars that's not I'm really glad that Apple has abandoned
[02:00:55.980 --> 02:01:02.100]   its proprietary connectors that's why I hope they'll do the same thing on the phone because
[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:05.700]   this is so much of a better connector than the mag safe connector given how much it can
[02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:09.500]   do the only complaint I have is they didn't do a Google did on the pixel and put one on
[02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:14.820]   each side then there'd be plenty of functionality available we were seeing lots of people making
[02:01:14.820 --> 02:01:16.980]   docs because you don't have to license it.
[02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:18.740]   Do you hear Phil Schiller's explanation Leo?
[02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:19.740]   What do you say?
[02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:22.860]   There's on the talk show and John Gruber asked him about that and he said well the goal of
[02:01:22.860 --> 02:01:26.940]   the Macbook was to see what we could do with in a completely wireless world and then because
[02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:29.780]   we can't charge that way yet we had to put one plug in and because we're putting one
[02:01:29.780 --> 02:01:33.820]   plug in we figured we'll make it as functional as possible but we really want to see what
[02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:37.580]   the engineers could do if they had no constraints how thin could you make it how light could
[02:01:37.580 --> 02:01:41.260]   you make it how radical could you make it because for them that's how they get products
[02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:43.300]   moved forward is to give people crazy challenges.
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:44.300]   Yeah that makes sense.
[02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:48.620]   Yeah and we should plug that that entire interview is now transcripted on iMore.
[02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:52.780]   Nice catch by John Gruber on that that's fabulous.
[02:01:52.780 --> 02:01:56.540]   Oh yeah yeah that was it was a fantastic interview.
[02:01:56.540 --> 02:02:00.260]   Renee and I both went and were in different areas of the theater so I didn't realize he
[02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:04.540]   was there at first and I'm texting him like do you know who John has for the talk show?
[02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:06.540]   Is this real life?
[02:02:06.540 --> 02:02:07.540]   Yeah.
[02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:08.540]   Oh wow.
[02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:10.540]   Yeah pretty good pretty impressive.
[02:02:10.540 --> 02:02:14.540]   I wonder if he's gonna get Tim next year I wonder if this was a test flight to see.
[02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:19.300]   I don't know if Tim is better because we talked about that and John and Phil Schiller have
[02:02:19.300 --> 02:02:24.180]   a really good banter going and this was almost the best setup if John Gruber is going to
[02:02:24.180 --> 02:02:28.060]   interview an Apple executive on stage because Johnny I would be great Tim Cook would be
[02:02:28.060 --> 02:02:30.820]   great but I don't know if he would have the same sort of back and forth with either of
[02:02:30.820 --> 02:02:31.820]   them.
[02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:34.380]   Well if he gets I'll be very impressed I have doesn't do interviews he's done a few.
[02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:36.980]   So Warren got to talk to Tim Cook at WWDC to me.
[02:02:36.980 --> 02:02:38.780]   Yeah but I think she ambushed him.
[02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:39.780]   Oh no.
[02:02:39.780 --> 02:02:41.580]   It wasn't planned let's put it that way.
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:42.580]   It was planned.
[02:02:42.580 --> 02:02:43.580]   It was planned.
[02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:44.580]   Oh it was.
[02:02:44.580 --> 02:02:45.580]   Yeah.
[02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:49.260]   Oh she said it was she just happened to be at the scholars event and Tim Cook showed up.
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:50.260]   Yeah.
[02:02:50.260 --> 02:02:51.260]   That's like the president dropping by.
[02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:52.260]   Yeah exactly.
[02:02:52.260 --> 02:02:53.700]   So she knew ahead of time.
[02:02:53.700 --> 02:02:59.860]   Well also also let's to be honest you don't get to have a conversation like that with Tim
[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:04.340]   Cook unless there is at some I don't know if it was pre-planned or not but I don't know
[02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:06.100]   if there has to be a permission given.
[02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:07.100]   Oh absolutely.
[02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:09.100]   Oh I'm not saying that.
[02:03:09.100 --> 02:03:13.940]   We've all been to Apple events where there are people who don't realize that oh Tim is
[02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:16.900]   just kind of mingling so you're not going to if you stick a recorder in front of his
[02:03:16.900 --> 02:03:21.220]   face and ask him a question there's going to be there's going to be an arm on your shoulder
[02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:25.780]   very quickly saying that maybe it was in the audience and John just pulled him up on stage.
[02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:27.420]   I mean what was he going to do?
[02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:30.620]   It was just like that see the dancing in the dark vid with Bruce Springsteen.
[02:03:30.620 --> 02:03:32.660]   It was the rapport was just wonderful.
[02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:36.380]   The role of the clock is now played.
[02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:41.340]   And I have one other pick that actually I got from this web development our Mac Grille
[02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:44.660]   and our web design team told me about something called LICECap.
[02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:51.260]   He had sent me he was sending me animated gifts with command line commands in it.
[02:03:51.260 --> 02:03:52.700]   He was showing how links worked.
[02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:56.180]   I just showed that earlier with a new browser and I said how did you do that?
[02:03:56.180 --> 02:03:58.500]   And he said oh this is cool it's called LICECap.
[02:03:58.500 --> 02:04:03.740]   It's for Windows and Mac it's open source freely available and what it does is in fact
[02:04:03.740 --> 02:04:11.580]   I'll launch it here it captures any part of the screen in a window and makes an animated
[02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:13.140]   gift out of it.
[02:04:13.140 --> 02:04:18.260]   Now admittedly it's an animated gift so it's not going to be super incredible.
[02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:22.900]   I'll record this right now and you can choose the name of the file you can choose how many
[02:04:22.900 --> 02:04:25.020]   frames per second so forth.
[02:04:25.020 --> 02:04:29.100]   And then once you've done that and save it out you get an animated gift.
[02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:31.180]   They use it because it's very helpful.
[02:04:31.180 --> 02:04:32.780]   This is an animated gift of the screen.
[02:04:32.780 --> 02:04:37.340]   Now admittedly that's not full frame you can see how blocked the resolution isn't all
[02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:41.860]   of that but it's very helpful for demonstrating a bug or so I'm going to tell everybody about
[02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:46.420]   this LICECap so that if you want to tell us about a bug on the website if you send us
[02:04:46.420 --> 02:04:49.740]   an animated gift illustrating it that would be great.
[02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:51.660]   Then we could really see it in action.
[02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:53.220]   Very useful.
[02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:58.700]   So that's LICECap, L-I-C-A-P.
[02:04:58.700 --> 02:05:00.580]   How does this Safari work?
[02:05:00.580 --> 02:05:02.060]   I don't understand.
[02:05:02.060 --> 02:05:05.060]   Anyway I'll figure it out one of these days.
[02:05:05.060 --> 02:05:06.060]   Such a different...
[02:05:06.060 --> 02:05:08.060]   You see the world as a series of ones and zeros.
[02:05:08.060 --> 02:05:10.100]   I call this the binomial theory.
[02:05:10.100 --> 02:05:13.860]   It is from C-O-C-O-S Incorporated.
[02:05:13.860 --> 02:05:18.820]   I'm not going to say it out loud but that's the site and serving the elite consumer since
[02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:19.820]   2004.
[02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:20.820]   Free...
[02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:21.820]   Cocos Incorporated.
[02:05:21.820 --> 02:05:22.820]   That's it.
[02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:23.820]   Cocos.
[02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:25.820]   Windows and Mac open source.
[02:05:25.820 --> 02:05:26.900]   You're going to like the Mac version.
[02:05:26.900 --> 02:05:31.100]   It's a 700 kilobyte DMG.
[02:05:31.100 --> 02:05:34.420]   The Windows version is even smaller 220 kilobytes.
[02:05:34.420 --> 02:05:37.500]   Have you ever had a program that was less than a megabyte recently?
[02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:38.820]   Unless Steve gives a minute.
[02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:39.820]   Not Steve gives a minute.
[02:05:39.820 --> 02:05:44.780]   It must be and it's got to be and I wonder if it's an assembly code that's interesting.
[02:05:44.780 --> 02:05:51.660]   Alright ladies and gentlemen that concludes this fabulous edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[02:05:51.660 --> 02:05:56.020]   Thank you so much for being here Serenity Caldwell from your beautiful office.
[02:05:56.020 --> 02:05:59.620]   What is the name of that lamp now?
[02:05:59.620 --> 02:06:02.060]   That is just a lamp that is not home kit connected.
[02:06:02.060 --> 02:06:03.060]   Aw man.
[02:06:03.060 --> 02:06:05.060]   It won't dim.
[02:06:05.060 --> 02:06:06.860]   I need a new space shuttle.
[02:06:06.860 --> 02:06:07.860]   Aw man.
[02:06:07.860 --> 02:06:08.860]   Oh yeah.
[02:06:08.860 --> 02:06:11.460]   The space shuttle is in the living room.
[02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:12.860]   Oh okay.
[02:06:12.860 --> 02:06:16.260]   Of course it is.
[02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:17.740]   That's Renee Richie over there.
[02:06:17.740 --> 02:06:19.740]   He's got a space shuttle on his shelf.
[02:06:19.740 --> 02:06:20.740]   I do.
[02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:22.620]   I'm thinking.
[02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:24.060]   Thank you for being here Renee.
[02:06:24.060 --> 02:06:27.060]   Read all about all of the new developments at imore.com.
[02:06:27.060 --> 02:06:29.820]   Both Renee and Serenity do such a great job covering.
[02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:31.140]   I plugged something quickly Leo.
[02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:32.140]   Oh please.
[02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:33.140]   We did a show on Wednesday.
[02:06:33.140 --> 02:06:37.620]   I had an episode of debug with Guy English of course but also with Don Melton who created
[02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:38.620]   Safari.
[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:41.780]   Matt Drans who was a former Apples developer evangelist.
[02:06:41.780 --> 02:06:45.620]   Ashley Nelson Hornstein from Dropbox and Marco Armont from Overcast.
[02:06:45.620 --> 02:06:46.620]   Holy cow.
[02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:51.100]   Yeah if you want to hear a wide ranging views and opinions on the event check that out.
[02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:52.900]   That is the one to listen to.
[02:06:52.900 --> 02:06:54.740]   I shall tune in.
[02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:55.740]   No dummies on that.
[02:06:55.740 --> 02:06:57.340]   Yeah sounds great.
[02:06:57.340 --> 02:07:01.140]   Andy Anako Chicago Suntimes has your Mac book review emerged.
[02:07:01.140 --> 02:07:02.140]   Oh.
[02:07:02.140 --> 02:07:03.140]   R2D2.
[02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:04.140]   R2D2 cookie jar.
[02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:08.740]   It's Renee's funny he's coming to your house right now.
[02:07:08.740 --> 02:07:09.740]   Me.
[02:07:09.740 --> 02:07:10.740]   Me.
[02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:11.740]   We'll have a play date.
[02:07:11.740 --> 02:07:15.740]   No that got postponed a little bit because I wanted to.
[02:07:15.740 --> 02:07:18.620]   I realized that there's probably 900 words that don't need to be there.
[02:07:18.620 --> 02:07:20.060]   So I decided let's fix that.
[02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:24.940]   You're such a perfectionist to my own to my own dismay sometimes but it will be up very
[02:07:24.940 --> 02:07:25.940]   very.
[02:07:25.940 --> 02:07:26.940]   I'll give you my short review.
[02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:27.940]   It's a beautiful screen.
[02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:30.180]   It's so light and thin and gorgeous.
[02:07:30.180 --> 02:07:31.980]   I love type of see.
[02:07:31.980 --> 02:07:32.980]   My review is very positive.
[02:07:32.980 --> 02:07:35.860]   I think it's a I think it's the most exciting thing that Apple's done.
[02:07:35.860 --> 02:07:37.180]   I like it more than I thought.
[02:07:37.180 --> 02:07:40.860]   I'm struggling a little bit with this keyboard the shallow throw on the keyboard is still
[02:07:40.860 --> 02:07:41.860]   tough.
[02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:48.420]   Not a great choice as your primary machine but if you can afford $1300 for a shuttlecraft
[02:07:48.420 --> 02:07:49.620]   for an away teams.
[02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:51.740]   Yeah it is your away team isn't it?
[02:07:51.740 --> 02:07:53.300]   Yeah it's about as good as it gets.
[02:07:53.300 --> 02:07:54.300]   Call number one.
[02:07:54.300 --> 02:07:58.100]   Add another 79 bucks because you're actually you're going to want this to I'm sorry to
[02:07:58.100 --> 02:07:59.100]   say.
[02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:02.540]   It's a lot nicer now that you don't have to travel with a baggy full of wireless devices
[02:08:02.540 --> 02:08:04.820]   and Apple TVs just a connective VGA.
[02:08:04.820 --> 02:08:06.300]   Yeah that's true.
[02:08:06.300 --> 02:08:11.220]   I'm looking forward to that kickstarter I bought a couple of there's some docs out already.
[02:08:11.220 --> 02:08:17.540]   You know what because it's it's a real illustration of why you want to use standard ports.
[02:08:17.540 --> 02:08:23.060]   The already the ecosystem of type seek ports is incredible and growing hugely.
[02:08:23.060 --> 02:08:24.420]   And if it have a standard.
[02:08:24.420 --> 02:08:29.240]   Yeah and it's not like the VGA connector I have for my old iPad where it's only good
[02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:32.740]   for this old iPad you will be able to get to a three year yes when you get new computers
[02:08:32.740 --> 02:08:36.740]   new devices it'll be good for everything and as somebody's pointing out the camera on it
[02:08:36.740 --> 02:08:39.660]   is terrible but I don't I wouldn't use that anyway.
[02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:44.100]   But then don't take pictures with your with your computer cameras cameras like Z index
[02:08:44.100 --> 02:08:47.340]   so do global is not in that book.
[02:08:47.340 --> 02:08:49.020]   It's also hard to balance it on a selfie stick.
[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:50.780]   I mean the world is full.
[02:08:50.780 --> 02:08:54.780]   I think trying to do it actually is probably the easiest selfie stick laptop we've ever
[02:08:54.780 --> 02:08:55.780]   made.
[02:08:55.780 --> 02:08:58.060]   Like that.
