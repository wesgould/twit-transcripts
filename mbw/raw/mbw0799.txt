[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.920]   And is Bluetooth holding back AirPods?
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.040]   Yes, there's lots of rumors too.

[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.880]   company in Cupertino, that little $3 trillion company in Cupertino, California on the
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.880]   list.

[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.840]   Hello Renee.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.280]   That's $4 trillion Canadian Leola portion.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.280]   Is it?
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.280]   That's pretty good.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.280]   I don't know.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.280]   It goes up and down so much, but I'm just going to claim it.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.280]   I'm going to claim it as a natural bond.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.280]   That's pretty good.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.960]   Also from Renee Richie from youtube.com/ReneeRitchie of course.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.600]   And also with us from WGBH of Boston.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.600]   Andy Inaco.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   Hello Andrew.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.600]   Hello.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.160]   It's hard to get used to actually being back at work, even though I'm still in my same old
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.160]   house.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.760]   It's like I did my first like real shave in like 10 days.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.040]   Like not the usual just like, oh, it's getting itchy.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.120]   So I'll just buzz off.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.800]   I'm talking about like lather, wet, razor.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.400]   It's like, wow, I remember doing this back in 2021.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.360]   The good old days.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.800]   And of course from office hours.global and onino.media.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.720]   Mr. Alex Lindsay.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.720]   Hello, Alex.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.720]   Happy new year.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.720]   All three of you.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.720]   Happy new year.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.280]   2022.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.560]   Our first Mac break weekly of the new year.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.520]   And Apple is no longer a three trillion dollar company.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.520]   Just like that.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.520]   It happens.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.360]   Only 2.945 trillion currently.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.360]   Did you guys sell off?
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.760]   Did you see the number and just sell off?
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.760]   Is this your fault?
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.760]   They hit it.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.760]   Okay.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.760]   That was my I wonder.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   I bet you there are people who say, you know, they set a limit.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.440]   It's price-turning limits and say, okay, as soon as it hits 3 trillion, I want to cash
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.760]   out.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.680]   Is it meaningful in any other way?
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.680]   I mean, really?
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.920]   No, this is stock evaluation.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.880]   This is the sum total of investor confidence in the company.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.800]   So it's meaningful in that people seem to think that their roadmap is doing very well.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.040]   But that doesn't mean that every decision they're going to make in the next five years
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.480]   is going to be a good one or that the Apple that we know today is going to be the one
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.760]   that we know two years from now.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.920]   And I mean, it is valuable to us to the company, right?
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.280]   Because the price per share helps them acquire talent.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.760]   Didn't they just say they're going to pay bonuses to come to employees that don't leave
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.760]   for Facebook?
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.200]   There's a rumor to be throwing a couple of dollars around here and there.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.160]   Don't leave for Facebook, please.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.080]   There's a lot of, well, Facebook does the same thing.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.880]   We know some people that should get those bonuses.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:17.760]   So a lot of retention where companies will give key employees, I mean, 180,000 is what
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.280]   I think we're talking about.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.280]   I've heard of much larger numbers handed to people with four-year investing.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.680]   So hanging on to your key, in many companies, there is literally a handful.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.640]   I mean, in a company as big as Apple, it's a couple hundred probably that if you pulled
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.080]   any significant number out of them, things stop working.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.640]   And so, but it's really not, everyone's important, but there are certain people that you've got
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.040]   to make sure that you don't lose to maintain continuity between all the products.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.800]   And so those are folks that oftentimes get stuff sent.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.040]   So it has some value, of course.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.360]   Yeah, I'm not sure if it's really that connected between.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.880]   I mean, it might be connected to Facebook hiring a bunch of their folks, but again, all of
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.160]   these companies have these incentive systems that they're using constantly.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.320]   So the fact that it came out right now, I mean, and a lot of them come at the end of
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.680]   the year, just how they manage it.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.760]   So it's not that uncommon.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.560]   So I'm not sure how much of this is coincidental versus causal.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.680]   And I guess you could say if you were getting stock options, you'd rather the price were
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.000]   lower now and higher later.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.440]   So this is less value to people getting new grants than the people who got grants.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.480]   And so the value of the stock options are, though.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.480]   There's a lot of room to move.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.480]   And I wonder what Amazon does.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.480]   Do you get your picture taken with Jeff Bezos?
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.480]   If you don't leave, just go Jeff Bezos.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.480]   You're great.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.480]   So many of the pictures of him on New Year's Eve, he was very different than Tim Kranz.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.480]   Tim Kranz, having a good time.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.480]   He was styling.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.480]   He drew that little Honda for a long time, but I think he gave that up.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.880]   He was like, OK, enough of this.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.880]   He's living the life.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.880]   He's living the life.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.880]   Living is big.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.200]   Now the door that he uses as an executive desk is actually off the front of the Vatican.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.840]   So Dor still has his hungry--
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.800]   His hungry is not grassroots.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.440]   Pitbull was the word that came to my mind as well, right?
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.440]   She's living the pitbull.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.680]   Well, tell us if Alice I thought was a bit outdated for our godly own pitbulls, right?
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.080]   I think that what's interesting is that Apple's stock price is not just their performance
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.480]   as a company from a technology perspective, but the financial performance of dividends,
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.480]   stock buybacks.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.680]   I mean, so a lot of the reason people are putting money into it, and there's some great
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.480]   graphs that came out along with the $3 trillion, which show Apple has been steadily buying
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.640]   back the availability of the stock.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.440]   So a lot of what the value for each-- it doesn't-- but it just makes it a good place
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.440]   for people to put their investment.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.280]   It's increased value because they reduce the number of shares out there.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.280]   So your value--
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.280]   Well, it represents the value.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.280]   The value goes up.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.280]   Right.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.920]   But it doesn't increase-- it increases more interest in doing it because each share goes
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.920]   up.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.920]   Right.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.920]   But it doesn't necessarily by itself increase value because I mean, it's just--
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.920]   The value's in value.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.920]   That hasn't changed yet.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.920]   Right.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.920]   But it means that--
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.920]   But it means that--
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.920]   But it means that--
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.920]   Exactly.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.920]   Right.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.920]   And investors are putting money in as a-- like a bank.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.920]   And part of the reason they can do that is because they're-- because of those buybacks,
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.160]   because of the dividends, there's significant returns, oftentimes better returns than they
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.440]   would get from a bank.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.760]   And so-- well, definitely better returns than they're getting from a bank.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.920]   And so it's just by doing that-- so it's a mixture of Apple doing really well and a
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:18.760]   very interesting manipulation of their stock by buying back in dividends.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.800]   There's nothing wrong with it or-- but it's that they are making sure that investors are
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.360]   getting their return on a regular basis.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:33.720]   And they call him the Wizard of Omaha Warren Buffett, who's equity portfolio is now 40%
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.120]   Apple.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.880]   He bought in a 5% Apple stake for $36 billion three years ago.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.240]   $36 billion is now worth $160 billion.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.240]   That means he made--
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.000]   Nice, as a retirement fund at long last.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.640]   He made us-- he made over $120 billion over the last three years.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.640]   Not bad.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.520]   Nice work if you can get it.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:01.040]   As my stockbroker uncle always said, "Leo, you need money to make money."
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.000]   And that doesn't include the $775 million in annual dividends.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.680]   And that's-- you're right, Alex.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.840]   That's a big part of the overall profile of Apple.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.240]   That's Super Bowl snack food at that level, Leo.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:20.480]   It was Philip Elmer to what asked me foolishly to join a slack call with his subscribers
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.680]   who were all Apple investors a few months ago.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.440]   And I felt like the worm in the cheese because I kept saying it.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.160]   Obviously, I know nothing.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.320]   Apple's not going anywhere.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.880]   Why would you buy Apple stock?
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.240]   But again, this is just investor confidence.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.760]   It's meaningful to Apple in the ways we described, but it doesn't mean necessarily that Apple's
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.920]   going to be great tomorrow.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.040]   Although, the wisdom of the crowds is probably fairly accurate here.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:57.520]   And the greatest value for Apple, for the stock, investor confidence is, as you said
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.640]   before, its employee retention, employee acquisition.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:06.800]   When we talk about, well, what does that get us when they give back dividends, when they
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.880]   move their stock price up?
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.880]   Well, it affects a lot of employees that have stock.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.400]   It's really spreading the wealth out across that group.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.960]   So when they buy that stuff back, they're actually putting money into their own employee
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.960]   stock as kind of an indirect bonus.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:29.880]   But as the aforementioned to Philip Elmer DeWitt mentions in his PED30 blog, Apple's service
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:35.320]   business alone is worth 1.5 trillion.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:41.680]   This has, he got this from an investor note to Wedbush clients that Tim Cook said in early
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.400]   2017, our goal is to double the size of the service business over the next four years.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.880]   And I think you can say that his report card is A plus on that one.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.280]   This is Wedbush's note based on our supply chain checks.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.800]   Over the last few weeks, we believe demand for the iPhone 13 is outstripping supply by
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:05.800]   Apple by roughly 12 million units in the last quarter, calendar quarter.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.640]   Supply chain issues ease, they think, by the first quarter of this year, or first half
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.960]   of this year, should make a big difference in Apple's sales.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.400]   So another reason to be bullish on Apple's future.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.720]   Being $3 trillion there will be another watershed moment for Apple as the company continues
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.720]   to prove the doubters.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.720]   Is he talking about me to prove the daughters wrong?
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.880]   No, it's the law of big numbers, people Leo.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.680]   He's going square for the law of big numbers.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:35.880]   The renaissance of growth story playing out in Cupertino.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:41.000]   Services billion, which we believe to be $1.5 trillion.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.040]   It worth to the market, not to Apple, but worth the market.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.880]   That's a great testimony to long-range planning for Apple.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:55.560]   Years ago, the question amongst everybody would be, how long can Apple continue to thrive
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.640]   based on this enormous hit they've got on their hands called the iPhone?
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.040]   Today, had they not been thinking ahead, had they not been thinking beyond their current
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.240]   hit product, they would have been dealing with investors saying, "Well, great.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.880]   Now, we've got supply chain problems.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:13.240]   Now you've got problems in investing in problems in having all of your manufacturing in one
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.200]   source on top of having supply chain problems.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.280]   That's going to choke off your ability to solve this one thing that's making this the
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.120]   biggest wedge of profit of income on your annual report.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.080]   Now what are you going to do?
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.760]   Now, that wedge of iPhone sales gets smaller and smaller and smaller, not because sales
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.600]   are necessarily taping up, taping out, but because they're making more and more and more
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.040]   money off of intangible things like services."
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.160]   Isn't that a problem though?
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.000]   Because isn't this what Wall Street loves?
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.960]   They love this idea of revenue per active user.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.880]   They love this idea of quarterly results, constant income.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.360]   They don't love the idea of putting that money towards long-term planning.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:59.000]   In a way, isn't this pushing Apple in the direction of short-term gains?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.640]   I think that Apple has kept them thinking about short-term gains by giving them dividends
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.160]   and stock buybacks.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.360]   They basically give to Caesar what a Caesar's and then they just do what they're going
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.360]   to do.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.440]   So they're spending the money the way they want to, the stock market's happy because
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.120]   they're giving money back directly and indirectly.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.120]   And you can't knock it.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:20.880]   The estimate is that by 2024, services will be $100 billion plus a year.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.240]   That's what Apple asked for, right?
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.640]   He said, "Just give the money back to the shareholders."
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.640]   They said, "Okay."
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:32.720]   And as Tim Cook once said, not similar investor query, it's like if you're having problem,
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:37.480]   if you are upset with our executive decisions, you're welcome to sell your stock.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.880]   You will find lots of buyers available for it.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.160]   We think that the performance of our stock indicates that our decisions tend to work
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.000]   out for people in the long run.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.240]   Services primarily buoyed by App Store revenue, I would think.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.880]   Well, I think the surprise is that it's not Apple TV Plus that's really rolling in the
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.880]   dough.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.120]   Well, all of them, I think it's just the aggregate.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.520]   You're between Apple TV Plus and product, actually.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.520]   Isn't it?
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.520]   I mean, $30 bucks a month.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.080]   It's getting there.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.440]   It allows you to justify services that I don't think many people would spend money for individually,
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.720]   but as a package, if your thought is basically that, "You know what?
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.400]   I would actually spend an extra dollar and a half a month on Apple Music."
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.400]   Actually, you know what?
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.320]   I don't like iCloud as a file storage system, but as a backup system for my phone and my
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.520]   iPad, I think that's good.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.720]   It's the Amazon Prime strategy, right?
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.320]   They're looking at what Amazon did with Amazon Prime and saying, "You know, that's a good
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:39.520]   way to make something that maybe is of tenuous value overnight shipping into something of,
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.760]   you know, there's so many benefits.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.760]   How can I say no?"
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.400]   And it's really about psychology more than anything else.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.400]   Well, in savings.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.560]   It does save you a little bit more.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.560]   It does save you a little bit more.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.960]   If you want it all, if you want it all, but I think the psychology is, you know, I'm
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.120]   really only going to pay for Apple Music, but since I can pay a little bit more and get
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.760]   Apple Arcade and Apple TV Plus.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.600]   It's the inverse of Prisoners Dilemma, isn't it?
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.280]   You're trying to see people take the least for the most.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.720]   Yeah, I think there's a little game theory.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.720]   I really do think there's a little game theory.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.720]   Yes.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.400]   Would you like to supersize that for just 75 cents more?
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.400]   Well, okay, sure.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.400]   Yes, super-sized.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.640]   I mean, I keep thinking I'm going to do Apple Fitness Plus any day now.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.640]   It's fine.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.640]   It's fine.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.640]   It is really good.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.640]   I find like the ramp up is hard.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.400]   Like there's a lot of like kind of simple stuff and there's a lot of really hard stuff.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.720]   I just wish there was more in the middle stuff.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.880]   And also like I'd like dedicated stretching.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.520]   I like things that aren't like high impact or yoga.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:33.440]   And I'd love to get a couple of bucks months back for the Apple News Plus I never read.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.680]   And there are better services than I had.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.680]   Obviously.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.400]   I think they don't give you money for the ads that are in News Plus.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.400]   They don't do that.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:46.600]   Apple News Plus is a big win for me just because I can't justify $30 a month for the
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.600]   Wall Street Journal.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.600]   It's the man.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.600]   It's justified.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.600]   So it makes this money back for me.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.120]   The periodicals as opposed to just the newsfeed.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.640]   I actually mean now a lot because it doesn't have the crazy algorithmic headlines.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.960]   Like if I go to any other service, it is always the worst stuff that is promoted on
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.960]   top.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.680]   And that is actually really good at giving me information that keeps me alert but not
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.680]   anxious.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.440]   And that's worth its weight in gold to me right now.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.360]   Yeah, it does seem like the same feed.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.400]   Like it, at least that's how it feels.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.400]   I don't know whether it is or not.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.160]   But it seems like, oh, it's the same collection of stuff that I should probably look at.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.840]   I mean, my biggest complaint is that if you block something, you say, I don't want to
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.760]   see something, it still puts it there.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.480]   Like we could put something here from there.
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.480]   And I'm just like, why are we doing that?
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:30.200]   Like if you're like, if I said, I didn't want to get something from there, you know,
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.800]   it means I don't want to see anything from there.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.080]   I don't quite understand that.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.000]   Does that mean you're for...
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.720]   I'm glad I have both Apple news and Google news, like both on my desktop at the same
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.720]   time.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.320]   However, this is another way where the Devil's bargain really pays off because Google's Google
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.040]   news is almost psychic at figuring out what...
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:55.360]   It knows not just broadly what topic I'm interested in, but specifically what part
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.720]   of software development I'm interested in, what part of self-driving cars am I interested
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.720]   in legislation?
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.080]   Yes, I'm interested in technology.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.360]   Yes, I'm interested in promotional stuff.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.560]   No, and it's really, really good at that.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.560]   That's one area.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.600]   But I think they balance each other really, really well for the reasons that you state.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:19.640]   The highly curated nature of Apple news means that when I'm looking at a topic that I don't
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.960]   have a laser focus on, it's nice to know that...
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.600]   Do I need to grab my go bag and steal a car and head west or do I not have to do that
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.600]   this morning?
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.600]   No, I'm not great.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.600]   Now I'll take a look at Google news.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:35.840]   I think though, if you look at all of the services in Apple services, it's hard to say
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.720]   that anyone is the best in class.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.880]   For instance, Apple Music, it's good, but there are other better services.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:44.880]   It depends what you're looking at.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.880]   If you're looking at through the lens of artist payouts, which lately I've started to think
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:54.120]   about, Amazon Unlimited and Rhapsody and Title are better.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.320]   They're best integrated, much better iOS users.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:01.320]   They're better, but Apple Music is still paying a lot more than Spotify.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.800]   Spotify is not so good.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.800]   This is the graph.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.800]   YouTube Music is absolutely terrible.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.520]   Yeah, YouTube's terrible.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.280]   YouTube Red actually is better than Apple, believe it or not.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.400]   So Apple pays half a cent, a little more than half a cent per play.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:21.280]   YouTube Red, the premium version of YouTube, pays eight tenths of a cent, nine tenths of
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.880]   a cent for Title.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.280]   It's a penny per play for Napster and a little more than a penny per play for Amazon.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:32.440]   But then if you go down from Google Play Music, which is half a cent as well, it gets a lot
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.440]   worse.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.040]   Deezer Amazon Prime, that's the one you're thinking of, which is point O.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.160]   The Indies don't have any margin to play with.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.160]   A lot of the other companies have other huge businesses and they can afford to use this
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.800]   as a loss leader or at least over the top service where those companies need to.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.800]   It's like Blackberry and Palm back in the day.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.800]   Microsoft had Windows money, Samsung had refrigerator money, Apple had Mac money, anything
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.160]   goes wrong when that's your only business and that's it for you.
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.760]   So they're much more tightly managed.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.960]   By the way, this is for 2020 and the sources SoundCharts at SoundCharts.com.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:05.840]   They combined sources from a number of different, information from a number of different sources.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:12.760]   So, but that's so my original point, regardless of that is, is in any one category is Apple,
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.080]   I mean, Apple TV Plus, not the best streaming service.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.560]   I think what they do is they give you a good composite.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:25.120]   I mean, the, you know, the, I don't think they're better than they are individually.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.120]   It's predictable.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.120]   They're boutique services.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.720]   I mean, I think that you're always going to find a better cup.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.560]   You can find a better cup of coffee than Starbucks, but can you find it all the time?
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.560]   That's a good point.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.560]   That's the issue.
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.560]   You know what?
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.560]   You nailed it.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.120]   Apple won is the Starbucks of services.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.120]   I think it is.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.120]   I mean, I think that-
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.120]   It's not every corner.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.120]   Burn the name of the bill, your name.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.120]   It's easy.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.120]   It's easy.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.560]   If you're addicted to Spatial, then there's not any other options really quickly.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.520]   Well, don't, I mean, others titles do an app most.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.520]   I mean, others are doing-
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.640]   Really expensive and it's very limited.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:04.520]   So title, I, you know, anyway, title has had it for a long time, but the lists have been
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.520]   very limited.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.720]   And the, and there was never going to go anywhere with title.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.480]   And what really turned the whole switch on was Apple.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.160]   So when Apple started pushing it down the path and now that they're updating everything,
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:19.920]   every major record company is building, like they're not thinking about making new albums.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:25.040]   The new major releases without a Spatial mix, you know, and that's a much different place
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.040]   than they were a year ago.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.400]   Alex can actually hear the recording engineer in the mix.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.760]   So you have to be very careful when you provide him the file.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.520]   That's like when you listen to, you know, piano players and you hear them grunting as
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.000]   they play the song.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.920]   It's not, it's, it's funny.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.920]   It's not all working.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.080]   So the interesting thing is that it's not all of the mixes are working in Spatial.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.680]   So there, there's things that are there experimenting a lot, a lot of experimenting.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.120]   A lot of them aren't.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.720]   And I was, you know, like there was, I'm a big fan of Appalachian Spring.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.720]   Right.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.720]   By Aaron Copeland.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:59.360]   And I went back to the old one because the new one that they put into Spatial, it was
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.120]   like everything was like too soft and too in weird places.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.040]   And I was like, oh, they didn't, they haven't figured this one out yet.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.920]   So I'm going to go back to what I was doing before.
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:11.280]   But, but a lot of them are really, you know, it's really impressive when they get it going.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:17.720]   I got to say though, for all services, including Apple, I really wish they would simplify
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:24.320]   the process of hearing music and anything other than compressed normal screaming because
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:29.480]   it will, a service will tell you that, hey, this is, this is available in lossless.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.480]   That's fine.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.960]   But what's happening at your end, do I have to flip a switch somewhere in settings to
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.720]   say, to tell this app, please don't, please, please make sure that everybody's got some
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.760]   other, some different way of listening.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.760]   Right.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.040]   I mean, it's done for the last place.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.480]   It wasn't until I have a, I had it.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.280]   You have the hip, the hip, the hip.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.920]   That will actually tell me, well, no, no, it's not just the quality.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.920]   So lights on it.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.400]   That it will tell you that here is, here is exactly what is coming out of your computer
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   right now.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.400]   It's coming through the headphones.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.760]   I'm like, wow, you know, I'm so glad I've got these new headphones.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.760]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.480]   I'm actually listening to streaming compressed.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.480]   What the hell?
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.480]   What did I not turn on?
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.480]   That happened.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.120]   It's too bad your ears can't tell the difference.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.120]   Just you have to use the lights.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.000]   I can hear my heart.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   I can hear my heart.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   And you're honest.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   I can post-hints to grab that.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   I've got that I've got the white light flashing.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   That's fine.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   That's fine.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   I think the other thing happened.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   That's right.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   That's a good thing we were talking about.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   And this is good marketing for them is the family plan.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.320]   You'll share it with five other people, which just really encourages everybody to be on
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.400]   the iPhone.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.520]   And of course, that's good for Apple.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.520]   So, yeah.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.520]   Yes.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.560]   Although, I mean, like they have made, they do know that the value of the family plan will
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.920]   be in big gadget families.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:41.160]   So there's Apple Music for Android and they've built TV Plus into like, Tizen televisions
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.000]   now have TV Plus integrated into them.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   That's a good point.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.120]   So some people, you feel like if your kid is rebelling and getting an Android phone and
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.040]   a Tizen TV, they can still be part of the family.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.360]   How dare they?
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.160]   Tizen TV.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.160]   How dare they?
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.160]   Let's take it.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.160]   Scott, your name is now Greenbubble.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.760]   Greenbubble, a deal with it.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.240]   Get in here, Greenbubble.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.240]   Let's take a little break.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.240]   We'll come back here.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.960]   There's a little bit, a tiny bit of Apple news, not a huge amount.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.960]   So we'll just go over every single case announced at CES.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.480]   They'll be here for 12 hours.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.480]   That's true.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.480]   That's true.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.520]   CES started this week.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.760]   They're going to, just because of COVID, they're going to make it one day shorter.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.760]   That'll help.
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.760]   That'll help.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:23.760]   And 95% emptier.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.560]   Let's take a whole bunch of people who already bought their flights and leave them in Vegas
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.760]   for an extra day without anything to do.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.760]   What could possible?
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.760]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:37.360]   People, companies have been doing virtual keynotes, things like that.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.920]   Apple hasn't gone to CES in years, so it doesn't really affect the Apple crowd.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.920]   It's okay.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.320]   Intel was wearing a bunch of Apple watches that made up for it for me.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.320]   Were they?
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.320]   Really?
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.320]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.320]   You know what I miss?
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.680]   And the one thing that's fun about CES is going to the TV area and those massive displays
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.400]   over the top displays they do is.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.200]   My many thousand dollar TVs for basketball players.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.720]   My favorite is always the China Village.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.720]   You know, like you go into the-
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:00.720]   That's fun too.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.200]   Usually I think it's buried in the North Hall and you get over there and you- and it's
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.200]   just all these OEMs.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.200]   They're looking for OEMs.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.200]   So it's just these products that haven't become product shit.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.160]   And then you see, you know, I always find that a fun place to explore.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.160]   Maybe next year.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.160]   Oh, maybe.
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.160]   Maybe.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.080]   Intel did put up a graph file where they're showing better performance per watt than M1s.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.080]   I'm really-
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.080]   That must be true.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.080]   That must be true.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.080]   Uh-huh.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.080]   It's interesting.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.080]   They even mentioned the M1.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.080]   Well, you know, we understand now.
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.080]   We're getting on the graph.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.080]   It's on the graph.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.560]   I think the real challenge for a lot of these, for CES and everyone else is that the companies
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.120]   are starting to figure out a way that they're starting to be-
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.120]   They don't even-
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.200]   The emperor who has no clothes starting to become very clear like we don't work.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.480]   Oh, were we really getting ROI out of this?
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.160]   And I think that a lot of them are starting to move to other solutions.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:58.840]   Well, one small thing that tying also into like my favorite things of CES is that absolute
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:05.160]   BS one-off thing that I may factual make that they have no intention of ever selling,
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:10.360]   but they just made this up so that the news crews would home in or in modern times, the
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:16.800]   top like YouTube, YouTube text channels would get your- that their exclusive, like, sweet
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.200]   time with this exclusive prototype of something that is not going to be released for yet,
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.280]   but we got our hands on it for the first time.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.760]   And now you see a couple different channels that like they're getting this week, last
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.080]   week, they got their- they got to do videos about things that are like came right out
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.240]   of a flight case and as soon as they're done with it, it has to go right back into the
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:40.560]   flight case and ship right back because that's to go right back to the next person in line.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:44.960]   This is the one big opportunity that they can't really match by doing things virtually.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.840]   We have this- we only have three copies of this thing.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:52.800]   Only two of them are barely working and for the other one, we desperately want an engineer
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.480]   to be standing right by to get it working again once it's stopped, once it freezes up
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:01.120]   on you, and you can't get that kind of attention by just simply saying, "Hey, we've got to-
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:05.560]   we're going to give you like a virtual meeting conference which someone will show you a pre-roll."
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.920]   The thing is that when people are- I mean, this is what I do, of course, is virtual
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.320]   conference, like virtual events.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:15.680]   And the thing is that the companies that are doing really well in this are, you know,
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.880]   if you take a- if you look at an Intel, like when Intel or someone else puts a big booth
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:25.280]   up in- in CES, that's like $10 million, like for a week, you know, of stuff.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.880]   You know, you give me $10 million, I'll build you a $5 million studio that can do- that
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.080]   I can show you every little bit of this with lots of cameras and we can do interviews
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:37.400]   and I can still have money for staff and that's over one conference as opposed to all of
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.400]   them.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.040]   You know, and so the thing is that these- then you could be just broadcasting every day and
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.000]   will you have the hit that you had before?
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   No.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.920]   Will you develop a relationship with your customers, possibly, you know, over a constant interaction
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:55.160]   rather than these kind of specialist, you know, the problem with all these physical events
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:00.200]   is that they cut out 99.99999% of your addressable market.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:04.800]   So, so the, you know, so that it's- I think that's what we're seeing a lot of manufacturers.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.480]   I mean, we have some partners that they've- they looked over last year and they realized
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:14.680]   that they had 20 times, not 20- not 20% more, but 20 times as many participants than they
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.680]   had before.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.680]   And that makes sense if you don't have to flow on the Las Vegas get a hotel.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:24.560]   So even if it's half as effective or quarter over effective, if you multiply it by 20x,
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.160]   it's still going to be a higher ROI.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.480]   And so that's the issue that's really happening that we're seeing with these and probably why,
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:35.880]   you know, CES and most of these conferences will go the same way that ones in the past
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.880]   have gone.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.240]   I mean, this idea of these Uber- Uber conventions is probably going to be gone in five to ten
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.240]   years.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:47.200]   It is a chance, though, to get to kind of ramp up the excitement, the attention.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:52.200]   There is- Scott Wilkinson tells me there's going to be a TV technology announced perhaps
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.400]   tonight at the Samsung event.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.120]   I'm not sure who's going to announce it.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.280]   That is going to be a breakthrough.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.920]   That's something we haven't heard about before.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.920]   So-
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.920]   Sure, but you could do that online.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.920]   I mean, you could do it online.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:04.120]   Samsung is streaming it online, but they are at the Venetia Ballroom.
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:09.280]   So I think there's something about everybody knows, okay, this is CES week.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:15.800]   There's some excitement and kind of buzz generated just by the nature of that.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.120]   It might be announced in NFC TV yesterday, Leo.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.640]   So there's nowhere to go for Samsung, but up.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.320]   What do they announce?
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.320]   An NFT.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.320]   An NFT television.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.320]   I don't understand.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.500]   Do you get a TV or do you just get the idea of a TV?
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.480]   I think it's a TV that lets you spend an order on some money on NFT.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.680]   Oh, great.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.360]   Just what I need.
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.520]   Just what I need.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.520]   This is what I'm going to order.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.520]   This is what I want from-
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.520]   So you could-
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.520]   So you could-
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.520]   So you could-
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.520]   So you could explain NFTs.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.300]   Apple commemorates a year of M1 Max with a special M1 t-shirt.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.480]   How do I get that?
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.960]   That's what I'd like to know.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.760]   You got to work for Apple last year.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.440]   It's only for the engineers, huh?
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.440]   For the M1 TV.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.880]   Or look at eBay.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.480]   I don't know if these will be sold.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:02.640]   Actually, I'm going to hold out for the M2 t-shirt.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:08.800]   I can't usually fit into an M1, especially during winter, spring or summer.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.960]   Maybe I usually get an M2 and then kind of an unshrink.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.600]   Oh, the M2 has got a smaller footprint.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.100]   So you might actually want to go for an M1 Max t-shirt.
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.100]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.100]   That's what I'm doing.
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.100]   That's a nice looking t-shirt.
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.100]   That would be a good thing to have in your collection.
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.460]   All right, let's take a little time out.
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.500]   Come back with more with the gang.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.820]   Skadis see you all again in 2022.
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.340]   Andy Enoco Renee Ritchie.
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.340]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:32.340]   So hopeful.
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.380]   Yes, a brand new year.
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:40.180]   We cleaned up all the Santa vomit from the studios floors.
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:45.840]   Nick came in and fixed it after his amazing decorage.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:51.280]   30 second fire hose of Santa Claus.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.280]   Looks nice.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.840]   Although they tried to trick me.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.840]   Was that on purpose?
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:59.280]   There was one left, one little Christmas ornament hanging under Andy Enoco.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:00.280]   Just a little more.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.280]   Well, because I saw the real Christmas Christmas.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.280]   That's right.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.280]   Maybe that's what it is.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.960]   When is Earth and Christmas is coming, right?
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.160]   Late this week or we get a little extra.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.740]   We have to check a little something extra.
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.940]   Yeah, and you're stocking.
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.380]   Peruges and sausages for everyone.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.180]   I showed it a brought to you by Wealthfront.
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.420]   Love these guys.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.420]   Really do.
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.620]   You're going to see a lot of ads.
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:31.960]   I mean, it's already happened for diamond hands, ride the stonk, ride up and all of that
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.960]   stuff.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.960]   And that's fun.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.300]   Day trading can be fun, but it is no way to build your wealth.
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.700]   Honestly, it really isn't.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.100]   Do it for fun.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.880]   Like going to Vegas expecting, you know, I'm going to make my fortune here on the roulette
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:43.880]   wheel.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.380]   No, no, if you want to build your savings, you want to build wealth, wealth from makes
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:52.560]   it easy to invest, easy to grow your savings with a diversified, that's an important word
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:58.440]   underlying that diversified portfolio that balances your other riskier bets.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.440]   Easy to do.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.080]   You can start investing in no time with Wealthfront's classic portfolio.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:06.780]   They handle it all for you or you can make it your own with things you care about, socially
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:08.740]   responsible funds.
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:12.440]   If you're a big believer in technology or crypto, they've got technology funds, crypto
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.440]   trusts.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.000]   There actually are hundreds of investments.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.800]   And you can see when you go to the Wealthfront page, how you can select, you know, you can
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.200]   design your own portfolio.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.160]   But Wealthfront was designed by financial experts to take those ideas and turn them
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.940]   into great investments without the hassle of doing everything yourself, of watching the
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.120]   stock market every day go up and down.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.240]   That's terrible on your, on your digestion.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.820]   And they do things you really wouldn't want to do.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:43.660]   Do you want to spend hundreds of hours trying to lower your tax bill with tax loss harvesting?
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.400]   Do you even know how Wealthfront does?
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.100]   Are you aware that you need to rebalance your portfolio when you make gains in one sector?
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.620]   You've got to balance it out in the other sector.
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:51.620]   Do you know that?
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:53.740]   Well, you don't have to even worry about rebalancing.
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.060]   They do it for you automatically.
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.620]   Wealthfront's the right way to go.
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.540]   Twenty eight billion dollars in assets now.
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:02.700]   They're helping half a million people build their wealth.
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.380]   It takes $500 to get started.
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.780]   People grow your wealth the easy way.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.100]   Let Wealthfront do the work for you.
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.540]   It's one of those, set it and forget it things.
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:16.860]   The best part of this, their product is so simple, so powerful, but beloved, 4.9 out
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.620]   of 5 stars in the Apple App Store.
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.580]   I don't want to talk about returns.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.580]   I don't want to talk about fees and all that stuff.
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:28.180]   I want you to go to the website and find out for yourself.

[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.860]   All right.
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:03.860]   Is there any Apple news?
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.420]   There are lots of Apple rumors.
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.420]   Should we go to the German?
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:10.620]   Can we go to the German?
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.180]   Let's go to the German.
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.180]   The holiday German.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:14.180]   The holiday German.
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.180]   The holiday German.
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.180]   No, it's not going to be a noise for it.
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.180]   We're over to the German.
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.180]   Go up to the German.
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:21.220]   Unfortunately, before before before before before before before before before before before.
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.220]   Yes.
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:26.060]   Can I just, so he puts out these reports and we've talked about before how you need to
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:28.700]   read like sources familiar with the matter.
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:32.140]   So this time you put out this report and he's like, I expect we'll see all the Macs by
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:36.940]   WWDC, meaning like least to my read like Apple news usually with Mac pros and that is
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:37.940]   show them off.
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:38.940]   Yeah.
[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.820]   But everyone immediately Apple's going to finish the rollout by like there's like 15 articles
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:42.820]   before I got blank.
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:43.820]   Yeah.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.220]   We're completely wrong and he clarified it later.
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:47.260]   But like, wow, do they fire fast.
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.260]   Yeah.
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.260]   Yeah.
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:53.580]   Because they like that link bait headline which is Apple will complete the transition by June.
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:54.740]   That's a real link bait headline.
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.940]   There is no evidence that that's going to happen is what you're saying.
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:57.940]   There's no way.
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:02.540]   But I mean, they could, they could announce a Mac pro probably would at WWDC.
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.260]   They've done that twice before.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.260]   Yeah.
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.260]   Yeah.
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:07.260]   Yeah.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:08.260]   This number 31st right when Alex wants it.
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:09.260]   Yeah.
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:10.260]   Exactly.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.740]   So what, what does Mark Gurman say?
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:19.700]   He expects a smaller Mac pro with up to, this is making my mouth water.
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:26.260]   I want this t-shirt 40 CPU cores and 128 graphics cores.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:34.380]   A new Mac mini, we, you know, we've been wanting that a new large screen iMac pro.
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.300]   The biggest MacBook Air redesign and product history.
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.340]   This is what I've been holding up for a little bit.
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:47.340]   This is going to be perhaps an M2 an updated entry level MacBook pro new iPad pro with wireless
[00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:48.340]   charging.
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:51.380]   There's not much you could do with the iPad pro at this point given that you put the M1
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.380]   in it last year.
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.940]   And to and magnetic inductive charging.
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:00.980]   I think other big ones for them to this year you think for the iPad pro.
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:01.980]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:02.980]   I mean, like it depends on timing.
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.940]   Anything that comes the first half of the year, I think has to be on M2 because the process
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:10.300]   ramp up is going to be likely four or three nanometers for M3 and a 16.
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.060]   And I don't think that'll be ready to ship before the end of the year.
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.980]   So anything we see in the beginning of the year will be M1 M2 based because the M2 the
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:20.340]   N5P process that they've used for a 15 is already good and done.
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.340]   Yeah.
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:22.340]   They can ship that.
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:27.780]   And the 15, a 15 as the M1 was basically a 14.
[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:31.100]   But you put more cores in, you put more GPUs, you do other things with it.
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.100]   Yeah.
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.100]   You put.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.460]   Yeah, it's more efficient, which is perfect for a MacBook Air.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.940]   Like everything runs cooler.
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:39.580]   It has good performance, but cooler performance, which is exactly what you want.
[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:47.080]   So how fast in other words, I spent I bought an M1 pro and a MacBook 14 inch MacBook pro.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.580]   Is this new MacBook Air going to be faster than that?
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:50.580]   Because that would be depressing.
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:55.860]   So it's the same thing because when Apple shipped the A12Z iPad Pro, it was six months
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:58.220]   after the A13 iPhone.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:02.420]   And so the A13 iPhone had faster single core performance than the iPad Pro, but that's
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.660]   not what people buy an iPad Pro for.
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:08.700]   That's things that control web rendering and app responsiveness.
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:14.940]   And so we know from A15 that it'll be 10% faster for performance cores, 30% faster for
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:16.460]   efficiency cores.
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:20.100]   The graphics cores are way better, but they also throttle more because they made them, I
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.020]   think too good this time.
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:25.540]   But it should net out to you like single core will be better, but multi core will still
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.580]   be obliterated by any of the program.
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:30.940]   I apologize because I am obsessed with Mac.
[00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:34.980]   And obviously the vast majority of the world cares about iPhone.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.020]   So I should mention they're also be.
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:45.180]   They'll also by the way, they'll be an iPhone SE in the first half, according to german 5G
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:51.580]   and a revamped iPhone 14 for with a whole punch in the fall.
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:56.540]   Yeah, he's going to be interesting because the battery life on the current SE is not terrific.
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:59.420]   And that's just with an A13 and an LTE modem.
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:04.740]   So you put an A15 in there and Qualcomm's 5G modems are notoriously thirsty.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.780]   And if it really is the exact same design, nothing else changed, I'm going to be really
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:11.820]   curious how they they know the battery is a problem with this just because of the size
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.340]   they just can't put in a big battery.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:18.140]   Yeah, the bigger the bigger processors need bigger batteries just because of the draw.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:24.620]   Also in the works according to german the german 3 new apple watches a new SE series
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:28.980]   eight and a rugged version aimed at extreme sports enthusiasts who have been seeing that
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.980]   rumor for a while.
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.500]   And the flotches have a I have a I have a rugged version.
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.500]   You see the rugged version.
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.500]   Yeah, you ruggedized it.
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.500]   Good.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.700]   It's a good and plastic tip.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:44.580]   It turns out for $26 I can get a rugged version of the app.
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.420]   Also, if you hit Alex's watch, it turns into Captain America shield.
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:48.420]   That's a seldom known.
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.420]   That is still the vulnerability.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.460]   Don't talk about that on the show.
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:54.540]   That is still the vulnerability both of the phones and the watches is this, you know,
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:59.500]   bit of glass here or sapphire or whatever it is that is just going to if it in the
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.620]   knock it it cracks.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:07.380]   So yeah, that's a missing missing link in the in the lineup because they're they're
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:10.820]   asking people to be more active, they're actually encouraging people to be more active.
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:15.620]   If they if they just basically said, Hey, Casio, make us a G shock enclosure for this
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:16.780]   for the Apple watch.
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.180]   Oh my God, would that be a wonderful product?
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.620]   Well, that's kind of what you got there, Alex.
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:22.620]   That's what I have.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:23.620]   It's a shock.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.620]   It's a basic watch.
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:29.340]   I mean, it reminds me when I look at it, it looks exactly like a G shock that I used
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:31.380]   to own except that it's there.
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.540]   And and I did it because I just was like, I bought a new one.
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:39.820]   And I also learned that constant app update means your your watch will not work.
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:45.220]   Like this little setting there that I finally had to search through like I got the new one.
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.140]   It was like I went from the four to the seven or whatever.
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.140]   And I wanted to protect it.
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:50.260]   I was like, I'm spending new money on it.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:53.940]   The four looks like it went through a war because it did.
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.780]   And and so the so the new one I was like, I'm going to protect it.
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.020]   I'm going to put a thing on it.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.460]   And it lasts like 12 hours a day or 10 hours a day.
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:04.020]   It's like it's and that includes the night when it's just not doing anything.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:08.620]   And then I realized that once I turn the it's the app update that's in the new it's in the
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.700]   eye watch just annihilates it.
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:18.620]   You know, and so Kerman's Kerman's through thread was even though 2021 was the most successful
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:26.160]   year in Apple's history, their product lineup while good was not a smash hit of introductions.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.540]   And that next year or this year, I guess now will be.
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.900]   Is that a is that a Gruber bag does premise very quickly on that?
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:33.900]   Yeah, I don't know if I can.
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:34.900]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.940]   I can agree with that.
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.300]   I think that Apple has a lot of growth in front of them.
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.580]   I mean, I think that that's the case.
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:44.100]   I mean, I think that it's I don't know whether they're going to release it, but there's,
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.780]   you know, and the thing is, it's really about a matter of how many apples at a point now
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.380]   where it's really just how many products can they focus on.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:54.260]   You know, and that's focuses the real problem for them is to figure out how many things
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:57.980]   can they do because there's a lot of things that people would buy if they made them.
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:02.420]   You know, the home kit is not been super successful in the sense that most of us just
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:03.420]   wish Apple would build those things.
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:07.660]   Most of us would just be like, I just, you know, none of them really work and they would
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:11.940]   and we were all pretty clear that they would really work if Apple just built it as opposed
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:16.300]   to trying to get manufacturers who want to do many, many different platforms and many,
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.260]   you know, they want to support a whole bunch of things, a whole bunch of Apple users that
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.420]   don't care about all Zigbee or any of the other stuff.
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.900]   We're just like, we just want to do the thing with our thing really well.
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:30.700]   And when you do that, we would just buy it, you know, but no one wants that the menu manufacturers
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:31.700]   don't want to do that.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.620]   They want to make it available to everyone.
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:37.580]   And I think that there's some point where Apple will turn on those manufacturers.
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:42.420]   I mean, I'm just saying, I think that there's a point where Apple will give up and just
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.620]   start making locks and other things like that.
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.340]   And it'll just toast them all because it's not because at some point, just because there's
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.540]   a lot of people that would just buy what Apple made.
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.340]   It's still kind of this home type of thing.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.860]   It's such a painful branding.
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:54.860]   Apple.
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:55.860]   Right.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:56.860]   It's just a painful.
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:57.860]   It's a whole painful.
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:58.860]   But Apple's not all the home home automation is.
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:39:59.860]   Apple's not perfect.
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:00.860]   They're pretty crappy too.
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:03.300]   Well, they also have a very small focus.
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.300]   Like they don't, they just don't have the ability.
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:08.500]   They don't have the way the company is structured is to maintain startup emotions inside a big
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:09.500]   company.
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.500]   And there's not enough bandwidth.
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.500]   Like they can barely push out three max.
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:17.780]   I'd be very happy if they continue to focus on the iPhone and these M1s, M2s, those.
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:22.180]   And by the way, that's what German, I mean, not German, Groobers, whole point is, is
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.180]   modest.
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:27.020]   What's modest about releasing, you know, look at the products they put out last year.
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:30.620]   I mean, it was it was a far from modest year.
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:34.940]   Again, and the thing that he does lean towards and we don't know whether it'll be this year
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:37.220]   or next year or the year after.
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:42.140]   But you know, Apple is building, you know, a massive head of steam for AR.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.140]   The Holy Grail.
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.460]   I'll give you his paragraph for that.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:50.100]   The Holy Grail for 2022, of course, will be if Apple announces its first virtual reality
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:57.180]   headset with some AR featured codename N301 rolls off the tongue.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:03.100]   And it's accompanying ROS code named Oak.
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:04.700]   Real time operating system.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:09.100]   Did they steal away from reality operating system?
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.100]   Yeah.
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.460]   Oh, that sounds good.
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:16.100]   But the timeline for that product has been has slipped before Apple originally targeted
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:17.100]   2020.
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.740]   And then WWC 2021 then WWC.
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:25.740]   Do you remember when Joanna asked asked Craig about that during your interview and she's
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.380]   like, how's the software going for the mixed reality headset?
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:30.460]   He's like, I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.460]   Yeah.
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:34.220]   Well, and I don't it's a 20, they don't pre announce.
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:37.420]   So all of this buzz is caused by people like german.
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:41.180]   Well, but I think that the other thing is that they when you look at the trajectory of
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:45.180]   the rollout, they haven't been ready to roll it out and has nothing to do with hardware.
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:48.820]   They don't they haven't put all the pieces in place to build the ecosystem around the
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:49.820]   hardware.
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:53.740]   So I don't know if they're really behind like I know he says that.
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:54.900]   I'm not clear that they are.
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:42:00.140]   I think that if you look at what they're doing as far as the rollout goes with object capture
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:05.540]   with what we think will be eventually, you know, moving us DZ across the entire platform.
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:09.460]   Those things all want to happen before the hardware comes out because it's going to create
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.540]   the ecosystem that makes the hardware work better.
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:12.540]   This is the problem that Google had.
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:16.020]   Google was five years ahead, six years ahead, something like that, but they didn't have
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:19.340]   an ecosystem to support the platform itself.
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:24.420]   An apple has been slowly putting all the pieces together, but those pieces haven't been and
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:30.020]   they feel like they've been going in a very, you know, measured pace, not like they're
[00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:33.660]   behind or ahead, but just like this is the next thing I would give you.
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:36.380]   Once you know how to do this, once we give you light are, the next thing I'm going to
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:37.380]   give you is object capture.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:40.220]   The next thing I'm going to do is let you take that object capture and put it into keynote
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.300]   and pages.
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.500]   The next thing I'm going to do, you know, those things have to happen before you put out a
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.860]   piece of hardware.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.140]   If you're not in a rush, if you're not trying to make money or you're not trying to beat
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:53.580]   anybody, you're just trying to win, like with brutal, with brutal efficiency, you would
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:58.860]   just just slowly plot all these pieces out because keynote and pages will create a massive
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:02.060]   demand for 3D models, which will then set up for the AR.
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:03.060]   Yeah.
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:06.700]   But I feel like there's a possibility that we're all being a little bit myopic here,
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:10.780]   that we're thinking that the big thing that we hopefully will see next is going to be
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:17.940]   some sort of a mixed reality headset or mixed reality goggles that will deliver on the promise
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:24.420]   of object capture of, again, interactive 3D models, things that really, really manipulate
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.860]   our environment around us.
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:30.460]   I'm starting to, I'm starting to become closer to the more, more affectionate with the idea
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:33.780]   that the first thing that they roll out will be something that's more similar to the Apple
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:39.940]   Watch, where it's just, it's not there to overlay things into your field of vision.
[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:43.300]   It's not there to show you crack a toe exploding on your desktop.
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:46.700]   It's there so that while you're taking your walk, while you're working out, while you're
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:51.460]   doing whatever, you see a notification appear in the upper left corner of your vision, similar
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.300]   to what an Apple Watch would deliver.
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:56.500]   Just simply saying, by the way, if you want to, if you want to notice this, there's something
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:57.940]   here for you to take a look at.
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:01.740]   If you don't, if you want to ignore it completely, by all means, ignore it completely, or asking
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:07.580]   it a question and getting a quick answer, something like, imagine Google Glass, but with 2021 technology
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:11.180]   and also designed by Apple, that I think that would be more of that.
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:19.460]   Let me, let me read you a little blog comment on Philip Elmer DeWitt's PED30.com from Thomas
[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:23.740]   Williams, who I think encapsulates our dreams and hopes.
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:26.100]   We'll see if it's true.
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:28.380]   He says, what are the hoes?
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:29.380]   Our hopes and dreams.
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:30.380]   I have to have those in 2019.
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:34.980]   The real secret sauce he writes and driver, literally and figuratively for Apple moving
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:40.420]   forward, is their silicon paired with 5G networks.
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:44.700]   Investors need not fully comprehend 10 teraflops of performance, a 16-core neural engine, a
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:49.340]   secure enclave, multiple media engines supporting pro-res media encoding, decoding and unified
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:50.420]   memory architecture.
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:56.140]   All they need to know now is the competition may never really catch up.
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:00.620]   The system on a chip features translate to incredible, amateur pro video performance,
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:04.820]   but also workable voice control over devices that formally required a keyboard.
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:09.220]   Augmented reality glass, in my spectacles, is one thing.
[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:14.980]   Smart AR glass in my windshield is game changing.
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:21.820]   He imagines a vision of a future with AR glass paired with high-res cameras, IR and LiDAR
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.420]   sensors, which can change night driving.
[00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.820]   AR assisted manufacturing and repair.
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:34.740]   I think that's way simpler than that.
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:38.820]   Tim Cook is willing to talk about AR, VR, AI and automation because again, they're not
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:43.140]   products to him, they're technologies like talking about LCD or OLED, our technologies.
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:48.820]   I think it's going to be a very simple rollout, the way we used to see, the original iMac had
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:52.180]   a CRT display, but then it went to LCD.
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:55.060]   You couldn't make an iPhone unless you had an LCD.
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:56.820]   There was no CRT iPhone.
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:01.060]   So that technology enabled new products and these technologies will enable new products,
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:03.660]   but at first they're going to be extensions of existing products.
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:07.300]   So the one that's going to ship first, my best understanding is something like an Apple
[00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.660]   TV for your head because the AR stuff is harder.
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:12.380]   So it's going to be it's going to have its own processor in it.
[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:15.540]   It's going to go all around your head and it's going to focus on immersive experiences
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:20.060]   like the Apple TV does, the fitness, the television, the gaming, the education.
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:22.820]   And then a couple of years later is going to be what Andy was talking about, the Apple
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:27.100]   Watch, original Apple Watch style device that has to fit into glasses, so it's going
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:28.100]   to be way more restricted.
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.500]   It's going to lean on the phone a lot in the beginning.
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:35.860]   And all its job is going to be is to show you notifications and glanceable information
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:37.500]   without you even having to turn your wrist.
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:43.260]   So it's a level of convenience increase and then over time those technologies will get
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:48.100]   built into all sorts of products the way that LCDs did and eventually OLEDs did and then
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.340]   Apple just rolls out the next decade.
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.860]   I think if Apple wasn't going to put objects in front of us, they wouldn't be doing these
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:58.060]   little things around their events that are showing objects that they're putting in their
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:59.060]   image.
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:00.900]   They tend to be pretty methodical about those things.
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:04.780]   And so I think that there's, so I think that they're definitely planning and I do think
[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:07.740]   that immersive is a lot easier than AR in a lot of ways.
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.300]   AR is easier to do on the phone.
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:15.660]   Immersive is easier to do as a headset because you have more room to put electronics and
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:16.660]   so on and so forth.
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:20.580]   I agree with Renee that I think that we'll see something probably immersive as we go through
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:21.580]   it.
[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:26.260]   But I do think it's going to be a pretty big game changer when it happens.
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:30.620]   And of course, like everything else, it'll start small like the watch and like everything.
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:36.220]   But I think that the integration of all the, because Apple has a different setup where
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:40.780]   they have motion and final cut are great video apps, but they're really obviously,
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.780]   there's 3D engines and all kinds of stuff being put into them.
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:47.940]   It's for the AR and VR, not for a straight video distribution.
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:49.100]   And so they have those tools.
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:53.900]   Yeah, I absolutely agree with you that the fact that Apple is putting so much investment
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:57.900]   in creation of 3D objects, it's obvious that that's where they're going.
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:02.100]   But my stumbling block has always been when you're talking about mixed reality headsets
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:06.580]   or mixed reality goggles, I keep thinking of all the electric cars that they tried to
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.900]   build before lithium batteries came along.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.900]   It's fine.
[00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:13.260]   You can have these lead-acid batteries in the trunk.
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:17.540]   It will power the car for a certain amount of time, but it's simply not going to be the
[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:18.540]   sort of thing.
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:23.140]   It's not going to be the technology that will enable this thing that we're kind of dreaming
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:27.740]   about and took these high-density batteries to give us cars that are actually functioned
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:31.860]   like cars, have the range of cars, have those styling of cars.
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:36.020]   And I think that we're running into the same sort of technological limitation with mixed
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:40.620]   reality goggles where how do we get a display technology that will give you a field of vision
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:45.900]   that most people will deliver the effect that you want while also being compact enough
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:53.940]   and power non-hungry enough to give you a wearable piece of kit that you would actually
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:57.620]   want to wear when you're not being given a virtual walkthrough of what your new kitchen
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:58.620]   remodel is looking like.
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:04.340]   But maybe we're focusing on the glasses or a red heron.
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:08.340]   Maybe we're maybe I mean this idea of a windshield sounds very intriguing.
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:11.980]   A heads up windshield, not that I mean I think you wouldn't invest in a future where people
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.340]   are still driving their own cars.
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:14.340]   Right, that's the thing.
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:16.660]   I think that if you're throwing the ball to where the receiver is going to be as opposed
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:18.820]   to where it is right now, you're not going to build.
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:22.060]   I mean I think that there's a moment for the next three to five years where we're still
[00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:25.420]   building like a high-tech thinking forward.
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:28.820]   The long-term future is that cars aren't going to have any windshield.
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:31.180]   So what else would you put heads up in?
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:32.660]   Instead of wearing these things.
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:39.420]   Well the thing is that we're already seeing a lot of these with the stuff that we're
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:43.900]   already doing in building with USZ is stuff that I can just send you a USDZ and I talked
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:46.220]   about it earlier if you go to something like clarity.io.
[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:49.100]   You can download a USDZ that we built.
[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:53.580]   I feel like this is gimmicky.
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:57.620]   Every demo I've seen is like you go to a restaurant and the menu shows you the three.
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:01.740]   It's just not to me it doesn't speak to me is that something I need.
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:07.820]   The thing is is that what's happening right now and what we're figuring out right now
[00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:13.260]   is how to use the LiDAR that we have and we don't have this working yet but using the
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:17.300]   LiDAR we have to attach it so like I have an object and I want to see what that looks
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:20.380]   like and that's what a lot of people are working on is I have an object that I want
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:28.100]   to figure out does this fit here and I can just pop it out and look at it and does it
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.100]   fit here?
[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:31.580]   What does it look like when I rotate it around?
[00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:35.260]   Those are things that are pretty utilitarian and I will say that we've worked with some
[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:40.300]   folks that as soon as the sales folks opened it up on their iPad they wanted every object
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:44.620]   that their company owns that makes in this format because now they can sit there and
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:49.420]   talk to their clients with it and those are not whiz bang things.
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:54.420]   This is just it's a lot easier than carrying a case full of objects around and they can
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:57.340]   show it and talk about it and highlight it and so on and so forth and so I think that
[00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:04.260]   those are going to be really interesting pieces of that puzzle and so I and again you can
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:10.500]   make things, make little things very very big and walk around them and study them and
[00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:15.100]   I think from an education and sales perspective that kind of stuff is just getting started
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:22.220]   and a lot of it has been creating the geometry that go into that even now is pretty hard.
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:25.700]   So the object capture is getting better but that's what killed us when we were doing
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:33.660]   stuff for Google was not for Google but for the Google for the fun.
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:38.220]   The tango the problem we had with tango was getting the geometry in we had to use unity
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:43.500]   at the time to do that and so there was like a huge lift what we're getting to now is you
[00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:47.780]   can kind of wave your wave your phone at something and have a 3D model.
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:51.540]   You know and that's a that's a big that's a big deal and it's not done yet but as that
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:57.380]   matures and that anybody can grab on to anything and throw it into their into their keynote
[00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:01.460]   document or their or send it to somebody like this is what it's going to look like.
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:05.460]   You know I'm doing a kind of specialized world where that's valuable.
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:09.380]   I don't think that the normal people are saying gosh I wish I could put a 3D object in my
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:11.340]   keynote document.
[00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:14.780]   I think that this is a specialty thing I don't know they wouldn't see it though that's like
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:15.780]   infrastructure.
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:18.340]   All they'll see is they'll have their heads at their glasses on they'll go to a virtual
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:21.740]   thing they'll press it and then they'll have like a model of the dress they want or the
[00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:23.140]   lamp they want or something.
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:27.980]   I'm getting a little fancy to Warraki in my old age but I don't buy it.
[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:32.740]   What happens though is that when it comes to sales you know like what happens for sales
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:37.260]   guys that are you know sales folks that are doing this is they get their their clock cleaned
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:41.660]   by somebody who has the superior technology and then they want to know how to do that.
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:45.980]   And so it's great for sales it doesn't still again that doesn't really sell me particularly
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.540]   that's that's the press.
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:50.860]   Great a car salesman is gonna.
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:56.380]   Yeah well that's what I'm saying these are not things that your average person who's using
[00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:58.340]   Memoji Leo Niesel Lamborghini.
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:52:59.340]   Yeah.
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:00.340]   Memoji Leo Niesel Lamborghini.
[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:03.740]   Well but it's it's it's where things start and then they become normalized you know and
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:08.820]   so so the thing is is that I do think that you know the tools are still a little rudimentary
[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:14.220]   but when you I mean it's it's a real problem when you go number one when you go and decide
[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:19.860]   what what shelving you want in a Kia knowing where it actually is what where the world
[00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:23.100]   fit where you think you're gonna put it or how you're gonna do it as a thing you know
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.140]   and and everyone's measuring all this stuff and you can get to a point where you just kind
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:29.180]   of go like this and now I know and then the second thing is really how to build it is
[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:30.180]   what you need.
[00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:31.180]   Okay.
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:32.580]   This is how to do that you know like that's the.
[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:36.580]   I don't see a change in the world but you know what I'm willing to be wrong what's your
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:39.380]   time frame five years ten years.
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:42.020]   For the for what for any of this.
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:43.820]   Well though I'm talking about this.
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:47.300]   I mean I Kia's had an app on my phone five years for the long time.
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.300]   Class of the glasses.
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:49.300]   The glasses.
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:52.900]   I think that I think the immersive is probably less than 18 months.
[00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:53.900]   Yeah.
[00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:56.940]   So I think the immersive I think that the AR is probably three to five.
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:57.940]   Yeah.
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:02.300]   You know it's probably but but the but again there's a I think the keynote pages thing
[00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:05.900]   is probably this this year is probably this year or next spring.
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:10.340]   Yeah Microsoft tried this about three years ago and nobody wanted it and they dropped
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.140]   it they had a 3D paint they had.
[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.540]   You are clippy do you imagine.
[00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:18.340]   I just I just I'm not a lens has been hollow and it's been very successful for my side
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:23.380]   about that is going to change the world hollow lens has been yeah but a really successful
[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:27.900]   again in a narrow niche not you know that's how you start.
[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:29.540]   That's how you start.
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:30.540]   Okay.
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:31.540]   All right.
[00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:34.020]   So they're they're making a lot of money with that with that headset you know like it's
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:35.700]   not you know they're and they're doing it.
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:38.060]   I mean that stuff is minecraft going to do my craft.
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:42.100]   I mean it is stunning like the stuff when you when you put on a hollow lens at a.
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:45.420]   Work site and you can see where everything's supposed to be.
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:48.420]   You know you realize that there's some future there you're going to get this is going to
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:52.380]   become normal like and there's a lot of things when people got cars they were really expensive
[00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:55.020]   and quirky and didn't work like in in the 1890.
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:58.260]   You know they were like that's weird like no one's going to use that.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:01.780]   Like you know my horse goes a lot faster and a lot of other places.
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:05.820]   I think it's appropriate for Apple to say well we're going to predict what's going to
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:09.780]   happen in 10 years and we're going to aim for that doesn't mean it's going to happen.
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:11.780]   I'm not going to suggest that way.
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:12.780]   It's going to happen to be honest.
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:15.500]   Georgia Dow is normal by any stretch of the imagination but when I asked you what you
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:18.900]   were doing on New Year's Eve they had four VR helmets on the entire family and they were
[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:20.220]   hunting zombies.
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:21.620]   So they make of that what you like.
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:22.620]   My kids.
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:23.620]   I will say.
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:25.900]   We'll probably just say the same thing.
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:28.620]   My kids my kids casually use Quest all the time.
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:31.340]   But they're just kind of like they play for half an hour here and there.
[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:32.340]   Yeah.
[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:36.900]   That's why whenever my skepticism is all about mixed reality there's like there are things
[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:41.420]   that Apple I think could already have done something like an Oculus because and it is
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:42.420]   a wonderful thing.
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:45.580]   Even when I was just but I was first playing with Google cardboard the the standard where
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:51.260]   you just drop a phone inside a hole inside a holder and just the ability to watch movies
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.020]   and inside a virtual theater.
[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:58.300]   The first time I had I had like two two three three to one like super wide screen like
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:03.600]   Vista vision movies and being in a virtual theater where as the director intended I can't
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:06.300]   see the entire thing on one like 16 screen.
[00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:10.940]   I have to keep turning my head to watch the the to see things going going on there that
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:14.700]   am that was an amazing thing and now that you've got the 3D immersive games that's also
[00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:15.980]   an amazing thing.
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:21.460]   Apple could have I the technology for that obviously existed for a while.
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:23.500]   Apple could have gotten in on it very very early.
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:27.620]   I think that that's easily could be the very next thing they do.
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:33.700]   That's the question is what spin are they going to put on it that will make it as enticing
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:39.260]   as a three hundred and fifty dollar headset that for God's sake the company owned by Facebook
[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:40.580]   is making success out of.
[00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:44.260]   Yeah, I think that I think that resolution is a big piece of it and that requires a lot
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:45.260]   of processing power.
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:50.180]   So 6 to 8K per eye is going to be a big deal if they if they're able to actually do that.
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:51.180]   That's a good question.
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:54.420]   Did you see the rumors today that Apple's going to have three displays in it to micro
[00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:59.940]   L E O lead and one amoled and I can't for the life me figure out why you'd want three
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:01.940]   displays especially that mix of this place.
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:09.100]   Yeah, the micro O lead will be I guess for the eyes and then I don't know the amoled
[00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:10.100]   palatable.
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:12.140]   The amoled, maybe is on the outside maybe it's not on the inside.
[00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:13.140]   Is it a touch partly?
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:14.140]   I don't know.
[00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:15.420]   Yeah, we need a touch bar.
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:16.740]   This is this comes from a.
[00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:20.260]   This comes from a research report from Ross young.
[00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:25.140]   It's been pretty accurate over the last while.
[00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:26.820]   Yeah, I'm not yeah.
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:30.060]   I don't I don't get what that third one would be but you know.
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:32.380]   See that that's that's one of many questions.
[00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:39.340]   They're still on my mind at least that the you can absolutely point out all of the technological
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:42.500]   imitations of the latest documents.
[00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:46.980]   However, just just as George was saying, it's inexpensive enough that the whole family can
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:48.500]   have them and play them together.
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:52.860]   Will Apple say that no, no, no, we're giving you a $2,000 headset that is so much better
[00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:54.260]   than this in every way.
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:58.500]   Now of course, instead of having four of them, you might know someone who will let you borrow
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:02.460]   it for 15 minutes while you throw it at their house, but my man during those 15 minutes
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:06.100]   that you're at their person's house and borrowing their their Apple display.
[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:07.860]   Oh my God, are you going to be enjoying it?
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:08.860]   It's the first.
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:11.500]   I was the one they're going to use to pay it down with and then the second one hopefully
[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:12.500]   will be way cheaper.
[00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:17.140]   I mean, the the if they all have to do is call the developer edition and that that I'm not
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:18.140]   even getting here.
[00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:22.060]   All they have to do is say this is that this is this is this $2,000 is $3,000.
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:25.540]   It's much, much better components we will ever put in a consumer version of the device,
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:29.220]   but we realize that we're going to need a lead time for people to understand and develop
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:30.740]   the apps and the games they want.
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:33.860]   And that will get people that will get people say, you know, I'm not a developer, but I will
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:34.860]   buy one anyway.
[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:35.860]   Yeah.
[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:40.500]   And that's all as many as they can make like at $2,000 or $3,000, I'll sell as many as
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:45.300]   they can make like that's what I'm going to Google $1,500 each for Google Glass or whatever.
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:49.100]   And they were and those are not what this is when you had to apply.
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:50.100]   Yeah.
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:51.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:52.100]   Yeah.
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:53.100]   That's because it was the very first.
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:55.020]   I don't think of Google released something like that again.
[00:58:55.020 --> 00:59:01.820]   And today anybody buy it, but that's just that's like to the extreme.
[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:03.580]   Honestly, you know, it's always hard.
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:07.100]   You know, when the mask came out, people said, Oh, that's remember, Dvorak said, Oh,
[00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:08.100]   you're a member of the universe.
[00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:09.260]   Remember, it's never want that.
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:13.140]   So it's always hard to know what a technology down the road is going to transform things.
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:14.140]   Yeah.
[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:16.340]   And it's hard for Apple just as much as it's hard for us.
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:18.460]   I'll grant you this could this is something that's coming.
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:20.460]   I've been a very big proponent of AR.
[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:22.700]   I'm starting to doubt a little bit more now.
[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:26.700]   VR, I think had a lot of promise and it's pretty clearly limited to people like George
[00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:27.700]   Dow.
[00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:31.060]   Well, I mean, I think people think it's on Apple's plate.
[00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:36.140]   We have things on behind her when Apple's when Apple was going to release a phone, people
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:37.500]   were like, well, that's not going to work.
[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:38.500]   Yeah.
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:40.500]   When they're so watched, they were like, that's not going to work.
[00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:41.500]   It's hard to know.
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:43.020]   So you know, it's very often.
[00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:44.020]   Yeah.
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:45.020]   And they've never missed what they've missed.
[00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:46.020]   Oh, they've missed.
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:47.020]   I mean, this is, Oh, wait a minute now.
[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:48.020]   Come on.
[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:49.020]   Apple's released quite a few products.
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:51.020]   iPod high five have failed.
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:54.940]   It doesn't mean it doesn't mean it automatically because Apple thought it up.
[00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:59.220]   No, but but I think that most of those have been what I would consider side projects.
[00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:02.420]   You know, the this is a this is a pretty big.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:05.900]   Again, throwing money at it doesn't mean people want it.
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:06.900]   You got it.
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:09.260]   It's not throwing that they want throwing money at it.
[01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:14.660]   It's it's setting up the it's setting up the ecosystem around it because it's and again,
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:19.020]   I've had the opportunity to be in some version of VR AR for 20 years.
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.900]   So for me, a lot of this isn't is really.
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:25.820]   That's telling Alex and no, but I but I can say that there are things that we haven't
[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:29.620]   been able to technologically do because of processing power that when you put it on when
[01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:34.700]   I've got a huge, my figure experiences in SIGGRAPH in 1992.
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:39.620]   Remember flying the Terradactyl with a giant thing that had a giant electrical connection
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:43.980]   to a million dollar computer and it was very cool.
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:45.020]   It has not somehow.
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:51.020]   Somehow the technology is improved, but the usefulness has not.
[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:54.700]   It's big, but I think that one of the big things that stopped it though is has been mostly
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:58.100]   miniaturizing the technology so that you have enough RAM, you have enough CPU power, you
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:00:59.700]   have enough optics.
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:05.260]   Those have been huge issues in those areas where when you see it at its native state,
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:08.340]   you know, at what it's capable of, you're like, Oh, I would do this all the time.
[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:13.660]   When you see the one that goes out as a consumer, you're like, like, it's great.
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:17.580]   You know, and so the, so the, there are different versions of these that if when you see them,
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:22.660]   you're like, Oh, if we can do that for the public, it would be, you know, people would
[01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:23.780]   use it all the time.
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:27.980]   And I think that, I think it'll be interesting to see how it goes, but I think that there
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:35.380]   isn't again, and I think Apple's building an enormous push for it in a way that again,
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:37.220]   I've been working in this industry for 20 years.
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:41.820]   I've never seen any, but any company have so much energy and so much effort.
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:44.740]   So if they screw it up, if you're right and they don't get this right, wow, that's going
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:46.180]   to be a big whiff.
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:51.660]   But I've never seen anybody put, I've never seen any company put this much money and this
[01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:57.780]   much effort into a, into a rollout and this much time into a rollout publicly ever.
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:00.300]   Like it's just, it is an incredible innovation.
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.380]   Genuine does not lie with the big incumbents.
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:08.020]   It lies with the little guys who come up with something that does, that can disintegrate
[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:09.020]   too hard.
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:10.020]   This is too hard to do that.
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:11.020]   Maybe this is too much technology to do that.
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.020]   It's too hard.
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:18.980]   Let's go on to other rumors, AirPod Pro 2, according to say his name, Guoming G, right?
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:19.980]   Something like that?
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:20.980]   Yes.
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:21.980]   Okay.
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:23.980]   But you have a better, you have a better idea than I do.
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:29.980]   Well, Ming Chi Kuo, as he's known in the US, he, his analyst note says the second generation
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:33.940]   AirPods Pro will feed your support for lossless audio.
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:39.420]   In my mind, Bluetooth and lossless audio, it's a meaningless, but in a charging case
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:42.980]   that can emit a sound for location tracking purposes.
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:48.620]   When we do need that, this is in his investor note.
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:53.620]   You know, I think Bluetooth is so crappy that you'd have to come up with something better
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:55.460]   than Bluetooth if you wanted to care about watch.
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:57.300]   Which will make me lay Patel's head explode, right?
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:58.300]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:00.260]   And I don't know if that's a bug or a feature to Apple at this point.
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:01.260]   Right.
[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:03.780]   I mean, I think that the question is whether Apple's going to continue to, I mean, that
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.580]   probably continue to support Bluetooth if you want a Bluetooth headset, but I think this
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:10.780]   is probably going to be a headphone that steps away from super set of Bluetooth solutions.
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:15.340]   Yeah, or something maybe that's if you could improve AC compression at the point where you
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.420]   could transmit it over Bluetooth.
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:20.500]   I think they're going to move past Bluetooth.
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:21.500]   I think they have to.
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:24.540]   I just, I think the compression is what their VP said, right?
[01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:29.500]   Completely destroys, you know, any lossless is meaningless when you have to then compress
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:30.500]   it.
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.500]   That becomes lossy.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.420]   So I don't understand what the plan is.
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:34.420]   Yeah.
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:35.420]   What was that?
[01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:36.420]   I'm just very fine.
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:37.420]   Yeah.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:39.300]   What he just said, like they're trying to get them into Canada Bluetooth and there's ways
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:40.660]   of getting more out of Bluetooth.
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:43.420]   There's ways to coax it to cheat it, but eventually that's all they can get.
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.500]   So then Apple's from what?
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:45.500]   High five dot.
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.100]   Eventually you need more bandwidth.
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:48.100]   I'm going to stop there.
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:49.900]   Is Bluetooth holding back Apple's ear pods?
[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:53.140]   We asked the man who made them Gary Gives.
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:54.140]   Yeah.
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:04:01.580]   He is the, according to this article, fabulously enthusiastic VP of acoustics at Apple.
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:02.580]   He's terrific.
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:03.580]   He's legit terrific.
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:04.580]   Yeah.
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:06.220]   I love the enthusiasm.
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:08.260]   I think that's great.
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:13.260]   But yeah, he also says Bluetooth is part of the problem.
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:14.260]   Yeah.
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:17.580]   And maybe you don't need to do lossless in Bluetooth.
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:20.020]   I mean, maybe lossless isn't the end game there.
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:21.020]   Maybe you don't need Bluetooth.
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:23.220]   I really think that what they're going to do is they're going to have something other
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:24.220]   than Bluetooth.
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:25.220]   Yeah.
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:27.860]   You would need something to take the place of Bluetooth.
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:32.260]   You need something that is ubiquitous that produces quality audio with Wi-Fi.
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:33.260]   Maybe Wi-Fi.
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:35.940]   Well, no, but you could superset it.
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:36.940]   Sorry.
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:38.660]   I think you're right.
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:44.980]   All I'm saying is that it's, the story of the, if there's one thing that I've constantly
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:51.300]   been disappointed about in Apple is that they consistently show how good they are at producing
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:56.940]   software, hardware, stacks, whatever, when they, when they control every single element
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:58.780]   of the process.
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:02.260]   When they have to create something that has to work with, what if someone wants to buy
[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:05.780]   a piece of hardware that isn't manufactured by Apple?
[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:08.020]   Will it work successfully with that?
[01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:10.420]   Apple is like, well, why would you when we have our own standard?
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:11.420]   I have products.
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:13.540]   Why would you when we have our own messaging system?
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:16.580]   And that's, I'm not suggesting that makes them a failure as a company.
[01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:21.700]   I'm saying that that's a, that's a, it's, it's like a picture who has great control,
[01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:24.620]   great speed, but can't do a break in ball, can't do a curve ball.
[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:25.620]   I know.
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:26.620]   I'm looking at this one.
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:30.700]   That's why, that's why I would not, that's why I would not want them to do something that
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:33.300]   make phones that do not work with any wireless headphones.
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:37.140]   But I know Apple doesn't like aptX, but aptX is lossless.
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:38.140]   It's out there.
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:39.140]   It's Qualcomm.
[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:40.140]   That's the reason Apple doesn't like it.
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:43.220]   What I think that they have licensed that.
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:46.820]   But the thing that was, so I'll just, I'll just go this like quickly, but my guess is
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:48.460]   that it's going to work very similar to Thunderbolt.
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:53.660]   And that is if you have the appropriate Apple headphones, it will work at twice the bandwidth.
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:54.660]   Yeah.
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:57.220]   But then if you don't, it'll work at like USB-C version.
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.900]   Here's the, here's the, here's the money quote from Geebs.
[01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:05.060]   "The wireless technology is critical for content delivery that you talk about, but also things
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:08.100]   like the amount of latency you get when you move your head.
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:11.460]   And if that's too long between moving your head and the sound changing or remaining
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:14.060]   statical, it'll make you feel quite ill.
[01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:19.180]   So we have to concentrate very hard on squeezing the most we can out of the Bluetooth technology.
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:22.300]   There's a number of tricks we can play to maximize or get around some of the limits of
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:28.900]   Bluetooth, but it's fair to say we would like more bandwidth and I'll stop right there.
[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:29.900]   We would like more bandwidths.
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:34.020]   You know, obviously he can't say what's, what he's doing, but obviously he's thinking
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:35.020]   about it.
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:36.580]   I think you could build it.
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:39.980]   AirPods that will work with lots of things via Bluetooth if you have them, phones that
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:43.300]   will work with Bluetooth headsets if you, if that's what you're using.
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:47.540]   But another pipeline that Apple is now going, I think Apple's going to put another wireless
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:48.540]   technology.
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:52.020]   It's not that they're going to be incompatible, but when the two of them are together, it's
[01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:54.460]   going to be high bandwidth between them and a higher quality.
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:57.780]   And it's just, it's going to just, you know, so, so I don't think it's going to turn, get
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:00.980]   rid of Bluetooth, but I think that they're going to go, well, that's the best we can
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:01.980]   do there.
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:05.140]   You'll get, but if you want lossless, you're going to, this headset connected with that
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:06.900]   phone is going to give you a lossless experience.
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:10.740]   I may be wrong, but that seems like something doable since it's already been done.
[01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:14.060]   It'll be like the new version of Apple talk or something, whatever they branded it.
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:15.060]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:20.620]   And if we're going to do AirPod 2, AirPod Pro 2 this year, maybe that's, maybe we are.
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:24.460]   Maybe that's the next thing we're going to see and requires iPhone, right?
[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:25.860]   Maybe requires a newer iPhone.
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:26.860]   I don't know.
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:29.100]   And they could make that standard.
[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:32.140]   They could make that standard a something that other people could build headphones for.
[01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:35.980]   It doesn't mean that they have to, but the point is, is that there'll be a different
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:38.180]   standard other than Bluetooth and that you'll have to.
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:42.340]   Meanwhile, I'm with Andy and I'm plugging in my wired headphones.
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:44.660]   Do they have vacuum tubes, the Leo?
[01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.460]   I think about it.
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:49.100]   Because I can tell you're a real enthusiast if you have vacuum tubes.
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:53.260]   I think the move to Bluetooth headphones and the loss of the headphone jack, I still, I
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:55.460]   get some sounding like an old guy, aren't I?
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:57.460]   I have a, I have wired headphones.
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:58.460]   I have wired headphones anymore.
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:07:59.460]   Yeah.
[01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:02.380]   I have wired headphones in my bag all the time if I leave the house and I have wired headphones
[01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:06.460]   laying around and I still listen to them occasionally, but on a day to day basis.
[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:07.460]   Yeah.
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:10.820]   The same reason people use those white AirPods because they don't care.
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:11.820]   Why won't use those?
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:12.820]   I will say that.
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:15.540]   They don't care that much about audio.
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:18.260]   After you have the pros, you go back, you, I put the old ones in.
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.260]   I'm like, how did I ever do this?
[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:22.020]   Like, how was this ever okay?
[01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:24.460]   Like it was, yeah, it's not, not the same.
[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:25.420]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:33.940]   Oh, well, you know, never underestimate the appetite of the buying public for crappy solutions.
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:37.660]   I mean, well, no, but there's also like, we have to move forward in some ways and a lot
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:40.700]   of the standards bodies are really good for making sure things are consistent, but they're
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:44.420]   really bad for like, just what, what USPC has done recently.
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.500]   Yeah, I don't mind Apple going its own way.
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.420]   I have no problem with that.
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:49.420]   That's fine.
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:51.740]   They can invent an Apple high-fi wireless.
[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.260]   Well, just push everybody forward.
[01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:55.220]   Like Bluetooth, like how long has it been?
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:57.620]   We've still got people to do for a decade.
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:00.260]   I think it's the solution.
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:04.620]   This problem was solved many, many years ago with wired headphones.
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:10.620]   So yes, I don't care what Apple does with wireless if it's proprietary because I, we
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.900]   already solved this with wired headphones.
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:14.460]   And I'm not, I don't know.
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:19.700]   I don't, I guess you guys think that this, the convenience of not having a wire makes
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.300]   up for the lousy sound quality.
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:23.300]   Well, it was the AR, I'm actually like.
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:31.020]   Yeah, I think the thing is that, I'll quickly, my thing is not, is not the sound quality.
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:36.100]   It's just the fact that a copper wire that electrons move, move, move propagate towards
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:37.820]   that always works.
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:41.220]   I know even, it doesn't matter what kind of wireless headphones I've ever used, even
[01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:45.780]   Apple once, there are times where, okay, so I guess I don't get to hear out of my left
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:49.780]   earbud because I've got the, I've got my phone in the wrong pocket for that.
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:51.980]   So I've got to move my phone to a better pocket for that.
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:54.180]   But I love, I love wireless devices.
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:55.180]   I've watches.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.180]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:57.180]   Yeah.
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:58.180]   Who cares?
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:01.340]   I admit, I bring out my phone, my phone doesn't, my phone doesn't wear with the watches either.
[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:02.340]   So there you go.
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:05.900]   I admit, what I want to do is zoom call or conference call, I bring out my AirProed Pro
[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:06.900]   Maxis.
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:09.180]   I have to justify the ridiculous 550 bucks.
[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:11.140]   And you can walk around, you can pace.
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:16.420]   And I look stupid because I, I don't know why I was so, I think I was self, self loathing.
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:17.940]   I bought pink ones.
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:23.020]   But I have to admit, that's the best experience for a zoom call, but I'm not looking for
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:25.380]   audio fidelity on a zoom call.
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:30.740]   So, yeah, I mean, I think that I, I don't, I just, I don't listen to, I don't listen
[01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:32.900]   enough music constantly on my, on my phone.
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:37.940]   I mean, 90%, I mean, I do listen to a lot of music on it, but I, I mostly am on calls.
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:40.340]   You know, so for me, the wireless and the convenience.
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:44.300]   Apple has created the music as wallpaper generation.
[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:47.460]   And they don't care about music or fidelity.
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:49.460]   And that's the norm at this point.
[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:54.180]   And so it's ironic that Apple's pushing lossless and spatial in that audience.
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:56.660]   I think the spatial is way more important than lossless.
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:11:00.620]   Like to me, like I, I can hear the spatial a lot more than I can hear lossless.
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:01.620]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:02.620]   Yeah.
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:03.620]   I'm too old.
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:04.620]   And even that's controversial.
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:07.420]   There's, there's so many people, so many audio files that will say, oh, but this was
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:09.620]   not the intention of the post on the mixing board.
[01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:10.820]   It's like great, great.
[01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:14.020]   You've just added, you've just basically added more fat and salt to this to make that
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:17.420]   sound a little bit different, but has nothing to do with the separation of the instruments.
[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:20.660]   That's like, well, it'll always be, but I do see those words.
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:21.660]   I love it.
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:24.500]   But people, people like, people like what they like.
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:25.500]   And that's fine.
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:26.580]   Yeah, they like fat and salt.
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:27.580]   We know that.
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:28.580]   All right.
[01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:29.580]   Let's take a little break.
[01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:30.580]   Let's take a little break.
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:35.540]   And then we're going to observe a moment of silence for the end of the line for a product.
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:39.580]   But, but let's talk first about, oh, it's a sad moment coming up.
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:41.140]   Let's talk happy stuff.
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:47.140]   People are going back to work and zip recruiters there to help you find exactly the right
[01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:49.380]   person for your job openings.
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:52.420]   This is going to be a big year for a lot of businesses.
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:55.700]   Some industries are projected to grow even more this year.
[01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:57.220]   Sustainability, you bet.
[01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:59.780]   New eco-friendly products and services.
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:01.940]   Some of our advertisers are cropping up.
[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:06.740]   Pet services are big this year, more training, walking and feeding services for all those
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:07.740]   pets.
[01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.580]   We all adopted during COVID, right?
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:16.900]   Fitness, health and wellness apps, non-traditional workout studios, kickboxing and crossfit.
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:21.740]   Digital events and conferences, services for planning and hosting online events.
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:23.580]   Who do we know that does that?
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:26.780]   Home improvement, renovation and decoration businesses.
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:30.340]   If you're going to be stuck at home, but it's one of a nice home.
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:36.580]   Look, if you work for our own a business in a growing industry like these or any industry,
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:40.820]   really, you probably need to hire as soon as possible.
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:45.180]   There's only one place to go to get the right employee and that's a zip recruiter.
[01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:46.340]   Right now you can try it for free.
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:50.900]   Go to zipprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:54.340]   Zipprecruiter is very cool for so many reasons.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:57.860]   One posting there gets it to the widest possible audience.
[01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:01.140]   More than a hundred other job boards, social media everywhere.
[01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:02.540]   And then I really love this.
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:06.780]   Zipprecruiter uses its very powerful technology to look through resumes.
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:10.980]   It already has to find the right candidates and send them to you so you can invite them
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:11.980]   to apply.
[01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:18.340]   When candidates get an invite to apply, they are much more likely to actually apply.
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:21.020]   You can invite your top choices to apply to your job.
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:28.060]   They will respond and often in most cases you will get a perfect individual in less than
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:29.300]   a day.
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:33.420]   Those great resumes start pouring in and they don't pour into your inbox or your phone.
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:38.980]   No, they go to the zipprecruiter interface where it's easy to rank them, check the boxes,
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:40.780]   find the right person and hire them fast.
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:45.500]   No wonder Zipprecruiter is the number one rated hiring site in the US according to G2 ratings.
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:48.940]   You can try it for free, zipprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:56.340]   Z-I-P-R-E-C-R-U-I-T-E-R.com/macbracak.
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:57.900]   I spell that out.
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:00.140]   zipprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:03.980]   We thank you so much for helping us hire.
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:07.860]   We use them ourselves and for supporting Mac Break Weekly.
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:12.180]   Thank you for supporting Mac Break Weekly as always by using this URL that we give out
[01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:13.540]   so they know you saw it here.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:16.820]   zipprecruiter.com/macbreak.
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:20.220]   I'd like to ask for a moment of silence.
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:26.340]   Today it's the end of the line for Blackberry.
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:29.900]   Canada loves you back.
[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:33.660]   Key services including network provisioning if you're using a Blackberry with Blackberry's
[01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:38.460]   own OS will shut down today.
[01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:43.140]   The phones will just no longer work.
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:46.260]   Blackberry says its devices will no longer be expected.
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:48.580]   They say this in a nice Canadian way.
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:57.180]   Will no longer be expected to reliably function including for data phone calls SMSN911.
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:58.180]   Little things.
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:14:59.180]   Little things.
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:00.940]   You probably don't care.
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:02.580]   I love those Blackberries.
[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:07.460]   I tell you it wasn't just the Blackberry phones, Blackberry playbook, they're tablet which never
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:08.460]   took off.
[01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:11.860]   All of them and if it's running Blackberry OS today's the day.
[01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:12.860]   So a moment of silence.
[01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:15.700]   My boss for 10 years was Crackberry Kevin.
[01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:16.700]   That's right.
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:17.700]   You worked.
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:19.500]   Or did you write for Crackberry?
[01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:20.500]   I did.
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:24.060]   I wrote pieces to refute their eventual dominance of the smartphone.
[01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:25.060]   You were right.
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:28.100]   I'm not going to be smug about it today because we lost no hotel.
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:29.100]   We lost media.
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:31.100]   We just keep losing these Canadian companies.
[01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:33.380]   Well, the truth is you haven't lost Blackberry.
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:35.940]   They pivoted in I think a very successful way.
[01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:38.180]   They bought Q and X a real-time operating system.
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:40.260]   They're doing very well in automotive.
[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:43.060]   So Blackberry the company survives.
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:44.060]   But not your phone.
[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:47.380]   It was the last phone I ever used before the iPhone in 2007.
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:51.740]   It was a little bit of good news today in that Kevin Mitchell acquired Crackberry.com
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:54.820]   from Future and is relaunching it for a post-Blackberry world.
[01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:56.260]   So I'm excited to see what happens with that.
[01:15:56.260 --> 01:16:00.300]   I wonder what's he going to cover?
[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:02.300]   Maybe we're going to put the crack in everything.
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:04.300]   The old crack apples.
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:05.300]   Crack droids.
[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:06.300]   It'll just be everywhere.
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:07.500]   Or maybe just apple cider donuts.
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:08.980]   Maybe it's just like an apple cider donuts.
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:09.980]   Yes.
[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:10.980]   Could be.
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:11.980]   Yeah, that'd be great.
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:12.980]   Could be.
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:14.700]   Blackberry cider vinegar.
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:18.220]   The FAQ is at blackberry.com.
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:21.580]   Blackberry 10 and Blackberry OS services FAQ.
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:22.580]   Yeah.
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:23.580]   Great.
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:25.900]   Credit were credit stew.
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:27.020]   Credit were what it's do.
[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:28.980]   They did absolutely create a revolution.
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:29.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:35.260]   There was a time when phones were really just, they played very simple games.
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:36.260]   You did texting.
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:39.660]   It was very, very exciting when you had a method of texting that involved having to
[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:43.380]   just tap two digits instead of going through three at a time.
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:47.380]   They created a messaging platform that suddenly made everybody want to have a high-performance
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:51.700]   smartphone and made the networks want to be able to support high-performance business.
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:52.940]   I go back even farther.
[01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:57.620]   I remember at the original Xbox launch, which would have been about 2001 because it's 20
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:04.500]   years old, sitting with one of the first, it was a pager, but it had the Blackberry
[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:09.420]   keyboard on a pager and messaging like crazy.
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.220]   I thought, "This is exciting.
[01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:14.340]   This is going to transform how people communicate."
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:19.260]   I remember roughly the same time frame, maybe a couple of years later interviewing the then
[01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:22.020]   chairman of the FCC, Michael Powell.
[01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:23.380]   He was like on his Blackberry.
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:24.380]   I said, "What are you doing?"
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:28.740]   He says, "Well, I triage my email before I don't respond to it, but I can delete it
[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:33.980]   and delegate it from here before I get back to the office."
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:35.700]   It was a revolution.
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:39.860]   I remember it really was a crackberry for me when I first got a Blackberry.
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:41.940]   It wasn't until you do the same messaging.
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:42.940]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:43.940]   CEOs would trade their pin.
[01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:48.820]   The thing that, one of the signs to me that this was inevitable was at some point, they
[01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:51.940]   came out with a statement saying that they were going to have to add a layer of Microsoft
[01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:55.580]   ActiveSync to their infrastructure because they never imagined a world where someone
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.340]   would have more than one device.
[01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:02.020]   So that a Black all BBM infrastructure was locked to one, the idea of one person, one
[01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:03.020]   pin.
[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:05.580]   It's still a problem with Internet and technical messages.
[01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:06.580]   A lot of messages.
[01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:07.580]   Yeah.
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:08.580]   Solution signal and WhatsApp, all these are falling out.
[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:09.580]   WhatsApp, yeah.
[01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:10.580]   Yeah.
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:12.060]   So, I mean, that lives with us.
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:17.020]   Somebody in the chat room remembers that I have mentioned this years ago that when my
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:20.220]   kids were little, they said, "Dad, get off your Blackberry."
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:21.220]   This is before.
[01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:24.220]   You have a favorite Blackberry Leo?
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:28.500]   I really love that first one, but my pearl, the Blackberry pearl is the last one I had.
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:29.500]   That one's still in my museum.
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:30.500]   I love the bold.
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:33.060]   The bold was like a Cadillac of Blackberries with like a leatherback.
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:34.060]   It was just, it was great.
[01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:35.060]   Oh, wow.
[01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:36.060]   I never got that fancy one.
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:37.380]   You worked at Crackberry, so.
[01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:40.860]   I think it was a real, it was a real, showing the limitation of like when you're already in
[01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:43.820]   something, not being able to think of something new because I got, you know, of course they
[01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:48.020]   sent me one of the ones, a test that's the, was their own touchscreen version.
[01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:49.300]   Like we're moving, I think it's a storm.
[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:50.900]   Oh, the storm was awful.
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:51.900]   Oh my gosh.
[01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:54.820]   And it was just one Blackberry device of the year.
[01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:58.180]   Well, Blackberry device of Blackberry.
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:03.140]   No, my wife, Lisa had a storm when we first, when she first started working for us.
[01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:06.740]   So that would have been 2008 or nine.
[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:10.100]   I phone had already come out and I said, "What are you doing with that?"
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:13.460]   Because that, in order to tap the screen, you actually had to click, it was like a mouse
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:15.060]   screen was a black hole sputting.
[01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:16.060]   Yeah, click, click, click.
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:17.060]   Click, click.
[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:18.060]   It was awful.
[01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:22.140]   I used it for a trip, I mean, I actually was asked to, you know, use it and test it and
[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:24.940]   everything else and I use it for a trip and I was like, I can't do this again.
[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:27.100]   It was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:31.540]   one of Blackberry too because she left it on top of a cab, drove off.
[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:32.540]   It broke.
[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:33.980]   I said, time for an iPhone.
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:34.980]   You're welcome.
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:35.980]   Yeah, you're welcome.
[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:37.980]   You're so conscious with sending you a message.
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:39.700]   Just do it very clearly.
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:41.500]   But I'll tell you, you couldn't break that thing.
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:43.500]   It took her many, many tries.
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:50.700]   It was amazingly flame resistant.
[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:51.700]   All right.
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:52.700]   Let's see here.
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:53.700]   What else?
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:20:02.700]   Rumor, one more rumor Apple might launch according to the economist in audio book service to
[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:06.140]   join the Apple one bundle.
[01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:09.420]   They've gotten pretty, I mean, they are doing a lot of audio work right now.
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:12.140]   I mean, I don't know what they're going to do with the service, but I can tell you there's
[01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:17.740]   a lot of articles that are for the Apple news that are in audio form.
[01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:19.380]   You can just play, set up a playlist.
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:22.380]   It's like a radio show and I think that's smart.
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:23.380]   I think that's smart.
[01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:26.860]   There have been a number of programs apps out that did that, but I think that's really
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:27.860]   smart.
[01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:30.780]   I think there are a lot of people who want to, and they're commute listening to news and
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:31.780]   reading article.
[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:35.860]   I have to say that I, now that I'm used to listening to it, I, I, I think that's part
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:40.500]   of why I stopped really reading as many magazines is because I have the economist and foreign
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:44.180]   affairs are both, you know, with foreign affairs, you have to wait.
[01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:46.860]   Economists, you get every week and it's all, it's all of it's done in audio.
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:48.340]   Is it human readers?
[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:49.580]   It's not, it's not machine.
[01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:50.580]   It's human readers.
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:56.260]   I use an app called AUDM, Autumn, that, that works with the Atlantic, the New Yorker, Wired,
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:21:02.300]   Vanity Fair, you know, all of the elite New York review of books, the New York.
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:04.380]   It's all very good human readers.
[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:05.380]   Yeah.
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:07.220]   I mean, so the economist is, is, is really good.
[01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:09.020]   Foreign affairs, a lot of them are actually done by Apple.
[01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:12.540]   They're like in partnership, you know, voice over, provided in partnership by Apple and
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:16.300]   then Apple hired a bunch of people that we know to do that.
[01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:17.300]   Interesting.
[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:23.260]   The interesting thing is, is that, that when I hack through, if you use, you know, the,
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:31.740]   the Alexa app or whatever, on, you can ask your iPhone to play a Kindle book, right?
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:35.700]   That's the way to get around the Kindle book doesn't have audio.
[01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:38.820]   So it'll play it in the, in the iPhone, but you have to kind of work with this weird
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:40.700]   workaround.
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:46.060]   I will admit that I can listen to, if it's pure information, I can actually listen to the
[01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:49.100]   computer version faster than a human.
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:51.260]   Like I can, it's easier.
[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:56.060]   It's actually the diction means that I can play it back faster and I can, you know, so,
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:59.780]   so it's an interesting, I, I didn't think that I'd ever say that I'd rather have a computer
[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:05.980]   read a book to me, but the, the Kindle version, I can actually, if I'm just trying to store
[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:06.980]   information.
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:07.980]   And that's going to get better.
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:10.500]   I mean, voice synthesis is, I don't want to absorb information.
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.100]   You got to remember I'm listening at two X.
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:13.100]   Right.
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:14.580]   So I'm, I don't understand that.
[01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:15.980]   I can't, I can't, I'm sort of anything.
[01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:20.980]   I, I, I, with a human, it's between 1.25 and two, depending on how they talk, but the
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:24.340]   computer, it's like just two X and just plow through it.
[01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:28.660]   So I'm wondering what Apple has in its mind, because remember they did do, of course, they
[01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:33.500]   sell books, I books, uh, and they sell them from the publisher.
[01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:38.500]   They have been using audible for the audio books in the book store.
[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:41.980]   Audible has deals with, I think almost all, if not all the publishers.
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:42.980]   There are others.
[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:46.380]   It's a disaster, by the way, to use to buy audible books through iTunes.
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:48.020]   No, I, I just use audible.
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:49.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:50.020]   I did that.
[01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:51.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:52.020]   That was a good introduction to audible.
[01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:53.900]   I think the only ones I ever bought were the Harry Potter books.
[01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:56.460]   And then I realized I'd get them, you know, that audible instead.
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:58.500]   It's way better to get them through audible from that area.
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:00.940]   I think that Apple's only way to really break in.
[01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:03.460]   I don't know if they're going to or not is to really change the way we think.
[01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:04.460]   What do you think about books?
[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:06.260]   You know, and I think they had the opportunity to do that.
[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:11.020]   I don't know if they're going to, you know, when you add video and AR and hyper, you know,
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:15.500]   like, like make it a media platform as opposed to just words and pictures.
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:19.020]   Um, you know, I think people listen to books because they can't look.
[01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:22.660]   They're driving or they're, well, but I think they listen to books because there's no pictures.
[01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:26.740]   Like, like, I'm sorry, but like I don't, like, I don't, like, I'm not going to, I don't
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:28.340]   buy books that are just words.
[01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:31.340]   Like if I open a book and it's all words, I'm like, I'm going to listen to that.
[01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:34.740]   Like if I'm going to, if I, you know, and so for me to look at a book, for me to have
[01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:38.380]   a book that I'm going to look at, I better have a lot of pictures, you know, and, and,
[01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:43.460]   and when I open up, like, I have this, this crazy book called the modernist, I think
[01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:47.820]   it's modernist cookbook or modernist cuisine that, well, an audio cookbook is nonsense.
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:51.900]   No, no, no, but what I'm saying is, is, but what I say, when I open it up and I have,
[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:54.940]   they have these gorgeous, but this is the former CTO of Microsoft or whatever, they put
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:55.940]   this together.
[01:23:55.940 --> 01:23:56.940]   Oh God, he's crazy.
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:57.940]   Yeah.
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:58.940]   So it's incredible photos.
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:02.980]   And I'm like, oh my gosh, if this was video, that's what I think.
[01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:06.220]   If he had went through all this work to light it and to set it all up and he just, and I
[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:11.500]   could have a something on my iPad that was video of this thing, I would be, you know,
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:12.500]   over the moon.
[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:17.860]   But the, and the problem is is you keep on, they keep on handing the content to magazine
[01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:21.860]   publishers and they keep on making things that are kind of like a magazine with, with
[01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:22.860]   video.
[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:23.860]   I don't want that.
[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:28.620]   I want something new that is, that's going to let me explore an idea that includes more
[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:32.260]   possibly AR and video and hyperlinks and,
[01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:36.580]   Did you get the stainless steel slip case version of modernist cuisine?
[01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:37.580]   Of course.
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:38.580]   Yeah.
[01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:39.580]   Nathan Merville.
[01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:40.580]   And they want to thread too.
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:41.580]   I want to thread too.
[01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:42.580]   Yeah.
[01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:44.660]   And the one that just came out is on pizza.
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:45.660]   I haven't bought them to.
[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:46.660]   Ah, interesting.
[01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:47.660]   Yeah.
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:48.660]   Yeah.
[01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:49.660]   Yeah.
[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:50.660]   Yeah.
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:51.660]   So it's, it's a, they're incredible.
[01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:53.660]   It's a computer scientist's approach to cooking.
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:54.660]   I think it's interesting.
[01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:57.820]   Well, it's not just a computer scientist.
[01:24:57.820 --> 01:24:58.820]   It's 30 chefs.
[01:24:58.820 --> 01:24:59.820]   Yeah.
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:00.820]   Yeah.
[01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:02.260]   It was the cookbook of the year in 2012.
[01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:06.180]   So it's, it's obviously done better than, I give it credit.
[01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:09.940]   Again, I, but some of it is, it's really written for chefs though.
[01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:11.940]   So the problem is you open it and you go, I don't know what that means.
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:12.940]   Yeah.
[01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:15.580]   And it would be great if I had a video that showed me what, when you say that, what,
[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:16.580]   what do you mean by that?
[01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:21.020]   You know, and so, so that's the thing that, you know, like that's what Heston again does
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:25.100]   really, really well is they show you what they mean for every, every recipe is a, there's
[01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:26.100]   a video.
[01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:28.100]   And then, you know, it took the pictures in this.
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:29.100]   So they're great picture.
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:31.620]   I mean, it's an unbelievable collection.
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:40.860]   Well, someday maybe I can own the $500 stainless steel version of modernist cooking, modernist
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:41.860]   cuisine.
[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:43.700]   It's really nice.
[01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:44.700]   Yeah.
[01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:48.500]   Now, and now they've got bread, as you said, bread, a friend of mine got me bread because
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:51.540]   I was like, I can't afford the bread one, but I always give it to me.
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:52.540]   I have a box.
[01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:53.940]   And then, and then they have one on pizza.
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:56.540]   You have a, you have a good friend, let me tell you.
[01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:58.540]   I was a good friend.
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:25:59.540]   Yeah.
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:00.540]   Let's see.
[01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:03.620]   What, uh, so I don't know, it'd be interesting to see what Apple does.
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:06.620]   I don't think creating another audible makes much sense.
[01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:08.460]   There are other audibles.
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:09.900]   There's Libro.fm.
[01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:12.620]   There's downpour.com.
[01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:16.740]   But they all basically the same books because the publishers, from the most part, the publishers
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:18.020]   record them.
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:21.940]   And then, you know, just like a bookstore, they're sold through other outlets.
[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:27.540]   Apple has its own studios and they do record a lot of stuff that's, there are audible exclusives.
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:30.380]   But, uh, I guess that's what Apple could do.
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:34.300]   And, and in addition to if you would add it to Apple one, it becomes interesting where
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:35.300]   you're subscribing.
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:36.300]   Yeah, yeah, I would do it.
[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:37.300]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:38.300]   That's all of them.
[01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:39.300]   By the way, we're doing that.
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:43.060]   Amazon and Audible both are doing subscriptions where you get a certain, you know, thousands
[01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:48.100]   of titles for, I was about to say Amazon will sell you a package where you will get access
[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:53.460]   to a big collection of Amazon Kindle books, a good selection of Audible books, a selection
[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:55.420]   of comics,ology comics.
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:57.300]   That's, it makes sense for Apple to make a play for this.
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:59.020]   I just don't know where they're going to get the content from.
[01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:00.380]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:04.700]   Is there stuff that's not being, I guess there is not being recorded, but usually it's pretty
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:08.460]   obscure things that I don't know if anyone wants a lot of money.
[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:09.460]   What is the public domain?
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:11.700]   What you want is the best sellers.
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:12.700]   That's what you're going to sell.
[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:15.940]   And that's, those are being already being recorded by Random House and Penguin.
[01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:21.820]   But again, if it's, if it's another couple dollars on top of your Apple one to have that,
[01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:27.140]   then it becomes a, you know, again, it's, it's not a, it's adding to the overall experience.
[01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:30.540]   Right now there's a handful of things that I'm doing outside of the Apple ecosystem, which
[01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:34.940]   is like the Kindle and, and the, for books with pictures.
[01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:41.620]   That's the only reason I get Kindle books or the, or the, or the Audible, which is where
[01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:43.260]   I put all the other books.
[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:47.020]   And so that's something that as an Apple user for me to be outside the ecosystem, Apple's
[01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:49.900]   got to look at that and go well, it'd be really nice to give them something that they
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:50.900]   wanted to.
[01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:54.700]   So, and then of course it's just trying to get the USDC file for you.
[01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:55.700]   Sorry.
[01:27:55.700 --> 01:28:03.260]   Article in the, the Washington article in the Washington Post about Apple's disappointment
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:05.260]   with exposure notification.
[01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:11.140]   They, Apple and Google remember, remember back in the early days of the pandemic 22 years
[01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:12.140]   ago.
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:13.140]   Yeah.
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:18.100]   That, that both companies released for their Android and iOS operating systems notification
[01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:19.100]   system.
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:20.100]   It's on both.
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:21.100]   I'm not sure.
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:22.100]   On both.
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:23.100]   I've never, ever gotten a notification.
[01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:26.500]   Um, I, you've been very careful.
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:32.340]   Well, no, I mean, but I've been in public and occasionally and with, you know, on Thursday,
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:36.060]   we, I mean, we stay outside, but we went down to San Francisco, went to the Exploratorium
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:41.820]   and went to, um, actually peer 39 was kind of scary, even though it was outdoors.
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:43.020]   It was very, very crowded.
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:48.380]   I would think among all those thousands of people that I ran across, I would have gotten
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:53.820]   one notification, nothing, not a, um, more than 20 states don't even use it, including
[01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:58.260]   Florida and Texas, of course, because there is no code in those states.
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:05.220]   Uh, according to, uh, the Washington Post, even in states where millions have activated
[01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:09.500]   notifications, only a fraction of people who test positive for the virus, report it to
[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:11.260]   the system.
[01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:15.300]   California's system, for example, has been activated on more than 15 million devices.
[01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:20.820]   That's a good proportion of the population, but only 3% of the nearly 3.9 million cases
[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:24.380]   reported since launch were logged out of the system.
[01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:25.380]   So how useful is it?
[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:27.980]   It's like you needed a federal response to a federal pandemic.
[01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:28.980]   Oh, really?
[01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:29.980]   Yeah.
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:30.980]   Yeah.
[01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:31.980]   Yeah.
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:35.220]   Like they can, like just like the military deliver the mail and like quite pandemics.
[01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:38.500]   There's like many things on your list.
[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:42.100]   Um, so anyway, uh, what do we think?
[01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:46.740]   I mean, it was a, I think it was a, it was great that Silicon Valley responded to the
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:47.740]   crisis.
[01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:49.820]   They responded in a very Silicon Valley way.
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:51.700]   You know, we could figure this out.
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:55.220]   We know how to, we do see the engineer was tweeting or the former head of apples.
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:56.220]   Um, what did he say?
[01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:57.220]   Medical crisis team.
[01:29:57.220 --> 01:29:58.220]   He had a whole tweet, I'll have to find it.
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:02.220]   He had a whole tweet thread up on what happened with it and his disappointment over the, over
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:04.020]   the eventual reception.
[01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:08.460]   You know, my take on it was it was a good idea, but it was done in a vacuum.
[01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:13.220]   It was done without considering health, health, the needs of health officials, states and
[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:14.740]   most importantly of individuals.
[01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:16.220]   And so it just didn't play.
[01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:20.020]   I mean, I think you can look at the NFL and you can see why people don't don't do those.
[01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:22.780]   It's like someone was around somebody who had COVID and now they can't go to work.
[01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:24.740]   You know, that's what I mean.
[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:28.020]   That's like, that's why nobody wants to know is what you're saying.
[01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:32.500]   Well, no one wants to, you know, if we didn't test for it, then no one would know and then
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:33.860]   we would have any COVID.
[01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:37.980]   No, no, but I'm just saying that that's, I think that that is a, a contributing factor
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:42.900]   is people see like, well, if I have a, if I'm in a contact system and now it says that,
[01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:46.620]   you know, maybe I don't have it, but I don't want to, I don't want to have to not go to
[01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:47.620]   work on it.
[01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:49.420]   No, I understand because people lie about getting sick.
[01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:50.420]   Yeah.
[01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:53.700]   No, but I'm saying even if they don't, even if, even if it's true and they were near you
[01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:57.540]   and you, but if you don't have it, but the problem is not, you've had to isolate.
[01:30:57.540 --> 01:30:58.540]   We just don't know.
[01:30:58.540 --> 01:30:59.540]   Right.
[01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:07.380]   And the guy's name is miyungcha.
[01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:09.180]   Here is his Twitter thread at cha_myo-ung.
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:10.180]   I haven't read it yet.
[01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:12.180]   So I'll just go through it.
[01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:16.820]   He said it was one of the most exciting projects I've ever worked on with an unbelievable amount
[01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:20.820]   of technical talent, including the guy in the Post-it note costume.
[01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:24.540]   I don't know what that's what's going on there.
[01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:27.580]   I want that story.
[01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:32.580]   It was always a challenge to convince someone that it was as good as context tracing, which
[01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:34.300]   I think you didn't convince me.
[01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:37.940]   I don't think it is, which is like asking whether an email is as good as a nice holiday
[01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:38.940]   card.
[01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:39.940]   Of course, they're not the same, he says.
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:44.580]   But I could send a nice e-card instantly to 100 people and get mostly the same result.
[01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:49.660]   The biggest pushback we got was why wouldn't, why wouldn't we allow governments around
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:54.260]   the world to use the API to collect a ton of data about users?
[01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:56.220]   Well, of course.
[01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:57.220]   Yeah.
[01:31:57.220 --> 01:31:58.740]   So we're not going to do that.
[01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:03.300]   User privacy is important, but that does in fact often limit the abilities of context
[01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:04.300]   tracing.
[01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:11.900]   As someone who gets, I mean, I've been tested about on average once a week for the last,
[01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:13.900]   I don't know, three or four months because of production.
[01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:16.900]   Every time you're in a production, you have to test 72 hours a day.
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:19.780]   When you get there and everything else, and the thing is, is that like, for instance,
[01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:25.060]   if I'm going to LA, I will not leave my house until I have the test back.
[01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:26.260]   So I'll be late if I have to.
[01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:30.140]   If I don't get on my PCR back because delayed or something like that, I won't leave the
[01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:37.380]   house because if it turns out that I'm positive, it means that I'll invalidate the entire production.
[01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:38.380]   Right.
[01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:41.820]   You know, like if I show up and find out later that they don't require you to have a vaccine,
[01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:42.820]   I'm surprised.
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:43.820]   No, no, no.
[01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:44.820]   They just say testing is all they need.
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:45.820]   Yeah.
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:46.820]   Yeah.
[01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:47.820]   That's always the time.
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:50.620]   Although having a vaccine as we now know with Omicron doesn't prevent you from getting
[01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:53.620]   and spreading it, it just means you won't get sick, go to the hospital.
[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:54.620]   Then negative consequences.
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:55.620]   Yeah.
[01:32:55.620 --> 01:33:00.260]   Anyway, he does go on and on.
[01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:07.980]   It's probably worth a read at Cha_MYoung.
[01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:10.260]   All right.
[01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:14.060]   Let's see what else is going on in the world.
[01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:21.740]   The Apple is working on a Formula One racing film with Top Gun Mavericks Joseph Kuzinski,
[01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:26.300]   Gary Bruckheimer, Aaron Kruger, starring Brad Pitt.
[01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:29.860]   You're going to say an F1 race car for a second.
[01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:30.860]   I thought we're going to have to.
[01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:31.860]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:34.380]   You know, Brad Pitt will play a race.
[01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:38.940]   A racer comes out of retirement to mentor a younger driver and take his final stab at
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:42.020]   glory on the track as the younger driver's teammate.
[01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:44.540]   This is obviously fiction.
[01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:49.060]   I would normally think that this is not a good, like I would be like, okay, whatever.
[01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:50.860]   But Ford versus Ferrari was so bad.
[01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:51.860]   That was a great movie.
[01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:52.860]   Yeah.
[01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:53.860]   But you're really great with that.
[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:54.860]   And I was like, did not expect that at all.
[01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:58.060]   I literally only watched it because so many people told me it was so good.
[01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:00.700]   And then when I watched it, it was, you know, it's really good.
[01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:02.220]   I'm not a car person.
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:03.220]   It's not Brad.
[01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:04.220]   Yeah.
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:05.220]   It's not Brad.
[01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:07.580]   I actually love Formula One and still don't think they make great movies.
[01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:10.340]   There've been a lot of racing movies only a handful have been really worth.
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:11.340]   Good.
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:12.340]   That's just the background.
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:13.340]   It's the pit.
[01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:17.100]   I like the Iron Man version because there was like a pit.
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:18.100]   He's flying.
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:19.100]   Missiles.
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:24.540]   And Kuzinski once tried to make a racing movie together called Go Like Hell where he would
[01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:26.860]   have played Carol Shelby.
[01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:29.260]   They wanted to be the right stuff of the racetrack.
[01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:31.700]   Not a bad idea.
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:36.020]   Matt Damon played Shelby of course in Ford versus Ferrari.
[01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:37.020]   Yeah.
[01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:44.860]   Anyway, look for that on your Apple TV plus or any boy, you know, foundation, I think kind
[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:45.860]   of flopped.
[01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:46.860]   Inversion.
[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:47.860]   Didn't finish it.
[01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:51.100]   Didn't start it.
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:52.100]   Ted Lasso.
[01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:53.100]   Ted Lasso.
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:54.100]   That's about it.
[01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:57.460]   I got in this really weird place where like during the whole last three years, I have
[01:34:57.460 --> 01:35:00.860]   not been able to just physically take the anxiety of stressful TV shows.
[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:04.100]   So I've only watched stuff that I know was emotionally inert or I've seen a hundred times
[01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:05.620]   before and wouldn't affect me.
[01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:07.420]   Anyway, I had nothing left.
[01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:11.020]   So like a lot of these shows are great like on Netflix on Disney on Apple.
[01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:12.020]   They look fantastic.
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:13.020]   People say they're amazing.
[01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:14.940]   I just can't bear to watch.
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:15.940]   It can be great.
[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:16.940]   It can be great.
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:21.700]   I'll tell you that I'm laughing because you're talking about Ted Lasso.
[01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:26.380]   I still have I still have yet to see the rest of like season two because I got like without
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:29.820]   revealing it without spoiling anything of any kind.
[01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:35.540]   It's like, Oh, it looks like Ted is about to become very, very sad and about something.
[01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:36.540]   I'm not ready.
[01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:39.180]   I'm not ready to see Ted Lasso to be sad.
[01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:41.620]   I think I'll switch to I'll switch to some three stujos.
[01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:43.220]   I'll switch to some thin man movies.
[01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:44.780]   I'll get back to it definitely.
[01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:47.820]   I got my own problems at this moment.
[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:48.980]   You're here to make me feel happy.
[01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:49.980]   Not feel.
[01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:50.980]   Oh, if Ted.
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:51.980]   I don't.
[01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:53.940]   If even Ted Lasso can like be feeling like everyone's against him.
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:55.740]   Oh, no, no.
[01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:57.820]   And he's people.
[01:35:57.820 --> 01:35:58.820]   It's hard.
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:03.460]   You know, the production is what it's about a year before you get something to ready to
[01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:09.420]   go and I just wonder, you know, where people were a year ago.
[01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:11.380]   It took it took it took everybody along.
[01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:13.780]   I mean, Amazon was not particularly good.
[01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:16.780]   It's still, I mean, I don't think anyone's going to really pick up on Amazon until the
[01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:18.100]   Lord of the Ring stuff comes out.
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:20.900]   And then, I mean, there's a couple things that people seem to like.
[01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:21.900]   That's taking forever though.
[01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:26.260]   No, I'm a wheel of time fan and I was extremely disappointed by the wheel of time.
[01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:27.900]   That just didn't do it.
[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:28.900]   Yeah.
[01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:30.380]   I even watched a book of Boba Fett and there was no REMSLEG in it.
[01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:31.380]   So I turned it off immediately.
[01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:33.540]   Like, what kind of star wars are without REMSLEG?
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:35.100]   There is no Boba Fett.
[01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:36.940]   I think we know that, right?
[01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:37.940]   Yeah.
[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:39.940]   It's like Tatowain should be there.
[01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:40.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:44.380]   I did think it would be fun if REMSLEG was in it.
[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:49.780]   And if those who don't know why we're mentioning REMSLEG, well, you just have to go back in
[01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:51.340]   time and listen to some old Macbree.
[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:56.700]   I know Alex, you have a policy about not accepting unsolicited ideas, but I've got
[01:36:56.700 --> 01:37:02.100]   a spec script for REMSLEG that's nothing like the slash fake for Babylon 5 that it started
[01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:03.100]   off as.
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:04.900]   I really think we've got somebody who agreed it all.
[01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:07.060]   I think it's a force going to be a place.
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:11.260]   Yes, as a partner for me, but that's completely incidental.
[01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:13.660]   If I were not perfect for the role, I would be wrong.
[01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:16.100]   And a baby, Bantha are on an adventure.
[01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:18.180]   That's very what's best for the project.
[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:19.940]   It's what's best for the project.
[01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:22.060]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:26.460]   If you guys don't have anything else you want to talk about, I think maybe the time has
[01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:31.780]   come to take our final break and get you ready for your picks of the week agreed.
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:32.780]   Indeed.
[01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:33.780]   Okay.
[01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:35.820]   You know, hey, we're doing all right.
[01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:36.820]   It's the beginning of the year.
[01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:38.100]   There isn't a lot to talk about.
[01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:40.220]   Apple's quarter did end on Christmas day.
[01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:43.020]   So when are when do those quarterly results come out now?
[01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:45.340]   It'll be end of this month, probably end of the month.
[01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:46.340]   Yeah.
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:49.340]   So we will have something to talk about in a couple of weeks.
[01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:53.340]   Eventually, eventually, I'm sorry.
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:56.460]   How much more wealthy Apple people are than we are.
[01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:58.540]   You know, I look forward to talk about that.
[01:37:58.540 --> 01:37:59.540]   Oh, God.
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:04.800]   I look forward to every week to Thursday now because Thursday was when our imperfect
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:09.740]   foods box comes and I am loving imperfect foods.
[01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:14.620]   I've done a variety of farm boxes and as you know, different food delivery things.
[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:16.980]   This is the best one I've ever done.
[01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:18.580]   And I love the idea.
[01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:22.420]   That's why we signed up at first for imperfect foods because imperfect foods is designed to
[01:38:22.420 --> 01:38:25.420]   reduce food waste.
[01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:27.800]   Here's a cringe worthy stat to start the new year.
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:36.580]   Every year, 35% of the food supply goes unsold or uneaten in the US because it's not perfect.
[01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:37.860]   It's not just right.
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:42.020]   Imperfect foods is working to turn this around by sourcing foods that would otherwise fall
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:45.220]   through the cracks of our food system.
[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:49.460]   And I have to point out at first, I thought, well, I'm going to get radishes that look
[01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:50.780]   like Richard Nixon.
[01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:53.380]   I'm going to have weird oranges.
[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:54.820]   No.
[01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:56.260]   Everything I get is great.
[01:38:56.260 --> 01:38:58.760]   It's amazing what the grocers won't accept.
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:02.720]   For instance, pomegranates are just a little bit smaller than your head so that the grocers
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:04.780]   say, no, no, we want the giant ones.
[01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:06.920]   But these taste better.
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:10.000]   Some of the best produce I've ever had.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.600]   Combating climate change, I know, is something we all want to do, but it feels overwhelming.
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:20.800]   What if you could just use some more of that food that's already been produced and reduce
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:22.440]   food waste in perfect foods?
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:24.440]   It's a grocery delivery service.
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:28.060]   By the way, it goes well beyond their original roots.
[01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:33.740]   Now you can get just not just groceries, but all sorts of things.
[01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:35.460]   Check imperfectfoods.com.
[01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:38.420]   Before I go on, I should say it's not available in every area.
[01:39:38.420 --> 01:39:42.020]   So check imperfectfoods.com and see if they deliver in your area.
[01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:44.300]   I was very happy to see that they did.
[01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:46.040]   You personalize your weekly grocery order.
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:47.040]   We do that every week.
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:50.140]   It was easy during the holidays to put it on hold because we didn't need it because we
[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:54.080]   were making a lot of, you know, a lot of Christmas stuff to do and cookies and things.
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:55.080]   But we've restarted again.
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:58.200]   Thursday, I guess our first box for the new year.
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:01.760]   Fresh seasonal produce, pantry staples, yummy snacks.
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:05.440]   They have a heritage chicken that we get every week because it's the best chicken I've ever
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:06.440]   had.
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:07.440]   I roasted up.
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:08.680]   It's amazing.
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:10.000]   We look forward to it.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.680]   On average, just give you some stats.
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:17.400]   Imperfect foods customers save 6 to 8 pounds of food with every order.
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:21.280]   6 to 8 pounds of food that be fed to animals thrown away, discarded.
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:26.200]   Unlike on-demand delivery companies, imperfect delivers weekly by neighborhood.
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:31.520]   That produces 25 to 75 percent fewer emissions than individual tips of the grocery store.
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:34.920]   Oh, I love, by the way, highly recommend.
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:39.640]   They're salami and they have a charcuterie package that is fantastic.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:42.800]   I had to tell Lisa, stop getting that.
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:45.040]   Plus, because I would eat it every time.
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:46.760]   Plus goodbye to packaging guilt.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:50.480]   I love it that I don't get 100 plastic bags.
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:55.160]   It's the only national grocery delivery company that makes it easy to return your packaging
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:56.720]   after every order.
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:59.160]   They're nice cardboard boxes, a cardboard inset.
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:04.240]   There's not a lot of packaging that always made me feel guilty, not with imperfect foods.
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:05.800]   I am such a huge fan.
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:07.080]   I just really want you to try this.
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:09.080]   In fact, we've got a great deal for you.
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:14.920]   Right now, imperfect foods is offering you 20 percent off your first four orders when you

[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.480]   Just love it.

[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.680]   Promo code MAC break.
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:52.360]   This would be good for your New Year's resolution.
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:57.000]   Some nice fresh, delicious produce that's good for the world.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.960]   Pick of the week time, Andy and I co the writing of the gods.
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:03.520]   The writing of the gods.
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:05.760]   My favorite book.
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:09.440]   I bought this on Audible, but obviously it's anywhere you can experience this.
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:11.560]   My favorite science books of all time.
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:12.800]   I'm buying it right now.
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:13.800]   I've got a credit.
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:14.800]   I've got to use it.
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:15.800]   There you go.
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:22.560]   This is all about how the Rosetta Stone was decoded and how Gipton higher grips were first
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:23.560]   deciphered.
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:31.000]   It's told like a gorgeous novel with freak characters that were just, had the same kind
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.640]   of warped lateral thinking minds that could possibly handle this job.
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:38.960]   If you know about the Rosetta Stone, obviously you think, "Oh, well, geez."
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:44.920]   Finally, this lost language of hieroglyphus was cracked because they found in 1799, they
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:49.640]   found a stone that had Greek and Coptic and this mysterious hieroglyphus.
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.000]   Finally, because they knew what the Greek was, they knew what the Coptic was, they were
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.960]   able to know it wasn't that at all.
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:56.880]   If anything, it made things even.
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:02.240]   It gave them what they needed to unlock finally how to decipher this language, but it led them
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:09.080]   down so many false ends because imagine having like, say, "Oh, wait, I know what this is
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:10.080]   an Italian.
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:13.720]   That must make it so easy for me to translate to Spanish, but no, there's so many words
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.400]   that are very, very similar.
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:19.920]   And plus you have no idea what was going through this culture's heads when they were
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:22.360]   putting this language together."
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:26.600]   And so like starting with, "Okay, do you start from left to right or right to left?
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:28.400]   You go from top to bottom."
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:32.960]   This mark right here, is it an intentional mark?
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:36.960]   Was it something that was damaged, that was done while this thing was unearthed?
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:42.240]   Is this a missing piece of text or was that a gap that was actually made in when they realized
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:48.080]   things like after struggling with some section of it for ages, they realized that, "You know
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:49.320]   what this mark means?
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:51.200]   This mark, no joke.
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:55.800]   This mark means that the person who was engraving this said disregard this mark because I just
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:59.600]   put it in here because I thought they would look prettier if I did it this way."
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:00.600]   Oh, wow, funny.
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:05.720]   So it's basically about this small French group and this small English group who are
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:11.240]   kind of almost like in a Russia versus United States base race for the national prestige
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:15.160]   of being the first to actually break this language.
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:23.000]   And again, it's told in this beautifully elaborate, novelistic sort of way that lays
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.800]   down the groundwork for, "Well, here's how people were trying to guess what hieroglyphics
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:34.640]   were for the centuries before that because in the third or fourth century, there was
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:37.680]   an active movement to destroy anything Egyptian.
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:40.040]   So the culture was gone, the writing was gone.
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:42.240]   They would not understand the context of anything."
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:47.040]   So basically it was a team of a guy in England who was like an expert linguist and a guy
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:53.560]   in France who was an expert in Egyptology and both of them basically needed all of those
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:55.440]   skills to solve it.
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:58.440]   And again, I'm only halfway through it, so I don't know if they actually cracked it or
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:44:59.440]   not.
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:00.440]   So I don't want to...
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:01.440]   I believe they might have.
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:02.440]   But I...
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:03.440]   They did work it out.
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:06.960]   But again, it takes something that's so simple.
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:07.960]   I love that kind of look.
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:12.840]   Like the Rosetta Stone, oh, it's one line of the history books.
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:18.600]   But then like, no, no, no, it took them 20 years and it drove people insane because it
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:22.480]   makes you think about how the English language is so weird too.
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:26.680]   If you just look at this as a bunch of markings, what does the apostrophe mean?
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:28.160]   Does the apostrophe mean...
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:29.160]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:32.960]   You mean that the apostrophe doesn't mean anything in and of itself.
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:37.080]   It means that, oh, we decided to delete some letters that you need in order to figure out
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:38.480]   what this word means.
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:40.000]   Gosh, dang it.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.760]   The writing of the gods, the race to decode the Rosetta Stone, Edward Dolnick is the author.
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:47.160]   You know why I bought it immediately?
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:52.200]   Because one of my other favorite books, in fact Simon Winchester wrote a whole bunch
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:55.800]   of books like this is about the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary.
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:56.800]   Yes, yes, yes.
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:57.800]   And I know you've read this.
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:03.480]   I just love this kind of stuff, kind of the story of something we all kind of know about.
[01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:05.480]   But the story behind it is great.
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:07.800]   Winchester writes some wonderful books in that vein.
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:09.920]   I can't wait to read it.
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:13.840]   Unfortunately, I'm reading The Wheel of Time right now.
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:17.600]   It's going to be about eight years before I can get to any other book.
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:19.680]   So anyway, good choice.
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:20.680]   I like it.
[01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:21.680]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:22.680]   How about you, Alex Lindsey?
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:23.680]   Your pick of the week.
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:25.360]   Yeah, real quick.
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:28.440]   One thing that's not really Mac Break, but definitely something to track if you're looking
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:32.880]   at virtual events and so on and so forth is that Zoom over the break while between when
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:36.520]   we did this acquired a partner of ours, a liminal.
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:37.520]   Yes.
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:40.320]   We do a lot of work with liminal and it's going to be a big deal.
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:46.800]   And we had the folks from liminal and the CTO from Zoom on office hours last week.
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:50.960]   And you can check that out on YouTube, but talking, kind of answering our questions related
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:52.240]   to what that looks like.
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:58.120]   It's a pretty exciting for us doing virtual events.
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:46:59.120]   What is liminal?
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:00.120]   What is liminal's business?
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:01.440]   What do they do?
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:07.040]   Liminal basically took full advantage of or still takes full advantage of Zoom's API.
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:12.880]   So their API and their SDK into basically allow you to customize everything about how
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:13.880]   Zoom works.
[01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:15.760]   So it's a front end to Zoom?
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:16.760]   It's a front end.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:21.440]   Well, it's a front end, but you can basically what it does is it Zoom ISO, which is something
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:27.320]   that Luminal makes, lets us take all of the ISO feeds out of a Zoom meeting.
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:32.760]   So I can say I want 20 people and like ours are office hours 2.0 that we're working on.
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:38.760]   Zoom ISO will let us actually take the isolated outputs of 20 people and put them into our
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:41.680]   switcher automatically for per computer.
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:43.760]   Just just pump these all out.
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:50.600]   Zoom OSC lets us have a see all everything that's happening.
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:51.600]   Who's joining?
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.000]   Who has their hand up?
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.080]   And then we can say grab this stuff and move it over there.
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:02.000]   And we're building very complex systems for the next office hours where basically because
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:06.280]   we know because Zoom ISO is sending all those things out and we know who is going out into
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:12.160]   the switcher and then we can say in the back of our Q&A system I'm going to go to these
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:14.080]   four people out of 20.
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:18.160]   It will build the super source, put the lower thirds in, all that stuff gets done automatically
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:19.760]   without us having to do anything.
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:21.840]   So when I hit answer it just builds that for us.
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:25.600]   And it's all doing it because we have all that data from Zoom and because we can control
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:26.600]   it.
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:31.160]   But we can, you know, and there's just tons of ways to automate the events.
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:37.960]   And so with that team inside of Zoom we're really excited about the ability to create
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:45.200]   very complex events inside of it as that team kind of takes full advantage of what could
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:46.200]   be possible.
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:47.560]   Go to office hours.global.
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:54.560]   And then we'll go to the Wednesday show 645 a Zoom special and you can see all of the information
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:55.560]   about it.
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:56.560]   And that's Brendan Edelson who's the CTO.
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:57.560]   Nice.
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:59.000]   I'm going to go to the K1 and talk to us.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:06.000]   So along with Andy and Jonathan from Liminal and Sam who runs the events for Zoom as well.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.360]   So it was a pretty good mix.
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:14.400]   My pick for the week is the Lin-Saul KZ, their horrible names.
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:17.040]   The KZZS10 Pro.
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:20.080]   This is actually what I'm wearing right now.
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:23.160]   For the price it's just an incredible 50 bucks.
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:24.160]   50 bucks.
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:25.480]   Sounds really good.
[01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:27.480]   They're very comfortable.
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:32.640]   And I've started to use them for, you know, just my day to day when I'm on a Zoom meeting.
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:35.520]   They're not quite as transparent as the sidekicks.
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:38.240]   These are the little sidekicks that I've been using.
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:39.840]   But the base response is a lot better.
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:43.440]   And the thicker cable actually makes it easier for me to throw on and take off.
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:48.000]   And it's much like what we would have as an in-ear monitor.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.480]   It's just that it's a lot less expensive.
[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:50.480]   Yeah, that's still perfect.
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:51.480]   And I got a...
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:53.880]   The in-ear monitors I'm wearing are $1,500.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:54.880]   Exactly.
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:57.560]   And you know, I'm not going to say that they're from better.
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:58.960]   Well, and it was great.
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:01.320]   You know, my daughter needed some in-ears for her band.
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:03.680]   And I just, you know, for 50 bucks, I was able to get them.
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:04.880]   And I've been using them a lot.
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:09.400]   And at first it was actually because I'm so used to just regular IFVs, you know, whether
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:13.400]   they're the audio implements or your heroes.
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:16.440]   And they're not famous for audio fidelity on those IFVs.
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:17.440]   So I put these in.
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:18.440]   It was overwhelming.
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:21.640]   Like it was so much data and so much base and everything else.
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:23.120]   And now I'm used to them.
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:25.080]   But it's a really...
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:26.880]   For $50, it's an incredible value.
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:30.680]   And there's some ones that in that string that that company makes, I think that they
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:31.680]   OEM them.
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:33.080]   So there's a bunch of different ways to buy them.
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:37.440]   But they're really interesting, like high quality.
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:39.960]   And again, for your day to day, I just want to...
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:41.680]   I don't want to spend a ton of money, but I need an...
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:44.240]   I want an in-ear that's going to...
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:47.480]   That I'm going to hear a lot and I can be in meetings and it's comfortable and I don't
[01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:48.480]   have to...
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:49.480]   Or even if you just...
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:50.480]   Oh, and they even come with a mic.
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:51.480]   Oh, that's kind of cool.
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:52.480]   Do you use a mic?
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:53.480]   I don't get them with the mic.
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:54.480]   No.
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:55.480]   I didn't get them with the mic.
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:56.480]   Because I put it over the back.
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:50:57.480]   You know, I'm doing typical like it's over the back of...
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:58.480]   You can go behind you.
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:50:59.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:00.480]   So I don't...
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:01.480]   I don't use a mic.
[01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:02.480]   Those mics never are very good.
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:03.480]   Yeah.
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:04.480]   So I...
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:08.120]   I think $50 is probably the best set of headphones that I've ever seen for $50.
[01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:09.120]   Nice.
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:12.760]   Well, at Un-E-Scores what I've always thought, which is that headphones are vastly overpriced.
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:15.120]   The actual components are not expensive.
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:16.120]   Right.
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:19.440]   We spend a lot of money on headphones that we probably are throwing at.
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:22.240]   Yeah, I mean, there's another version of this that I ordered that I'm waiting for to come
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:26.240]   in is like $130, but it's got like eight elements per year.
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:27.240]   Yeah.
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:28.240]   And you know, it's...
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:29.240]   That's a...
[01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:30.240]   You know, like it's...
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:33.120]   I can't believe that I'm buying something with that much potential.
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:35.080]   I have talked to a couple of people that said it just sounds amazing.
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:39.280]   Well, when you don't put all the money in Bluetooth radios and all these other, you
[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:43.920]   know, you know, accelerometers and you just put it into the drivers, you can actually
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:45.080]   get some pretty good headphones.
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:46.080]   Copper wire.
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:47.080]   It's a copper wire.
[01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:48.080]   Simple.
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:49.080]   You want the drivers.
[01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:50.080]   It works.
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:51.080]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:56.400]   Lin L-I-N-S-O-U-L, they're on Amazon for $50.
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:58.800]   Visit the Lin Soul store.
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:01.800]   Renee Ritchie, pick of the week.
[01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:02.800]   So...
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:03.800]   I apologize.
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:04.800]   Sorry.
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:06.840]   This is a big controversy.
[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:10.360]   I don't want to get too deep into the controversy, but I want to give you some background as
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:15.040]   to why I'm recommending this and not recommending it at the same time.
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:20.760]   So earlier late last year, YouTube removed the dislike counter on videos, not the dislike
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:21.760]   button.
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:22.760]   You can still tap that.
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:26.520]   And every time you tap dislike on a video, YouTube is less likely to show you a similar
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:28.000]   video in the future.
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.520]   So that functionality is still there, but they got rid of the public dislike count.
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:36.520]   And they did it because after talking to a lot of much smaller, less privileged, less
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:41.400]   mainstream creators, they found out that they were often being brigaded with dislikes to
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:45.040]   try to silence them or to deplatform them.
[01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:50.160]   And because public dislike counts are just not common on social media, like they're not
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:53.840]   on Twitter, they're not on Instagram, they're not on TikTok, YouTube felt that the value
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:57.520]   they added were not sufficient for the harm that they caused.
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:59.920]   So they removed that public counter.
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:02.320]   These can still see it inside Creator Studio.
[01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:04.000]   But this upset a lot of people.
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.280]   And I know some people will say it upset the privileged people, they will have millions
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:12.200]   of subscribers or the typical white tech bro dude that you'd imagine would get upset
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:13.440]   by things like this.
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:19.960]   But there are people who use the dislike counter as a way to sort of prejudge the value of a
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:25.000]   tutorial, a how to video, whether it was outdated, whether it no longer applied, whether it was
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.200]   spammy or scammy or something.
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:33.240]   And it was a very glanceable way of doing that, because unlike comments, you can either turn
[01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:38.360]   dislike counts on and off, you can't editorialize them, you can't prune them.
[01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:43.120]   So of course, people being people, the API was still around for a while.
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:46.520]   So a Chrome extension was made that would let you install it.
[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:51.400]   And that would resurface the dislike count for your experience on YouTube, which is something
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:54.320]   I think YouTube should probably do on their own, but they haven't yet.
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:56.240]   So this plugin is doing it.
[01:53:56.240 --> 01:53:59.960]   YouTube has since removed the API, but they've been able to crowdsource through a bunch of
[01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:04.680]   different archives and different resources, historical data, and they're also allowing
[01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:09.240]   users to contribute their own data towards keeping this going in the future.
[01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:11.160]   So it's an imperfect solution.
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:17.040]   But if a lot of your YouTube experience was tied into tutorials and you use that as your
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:21.840]   quick barometer for the value of the tutorial, this plugin will at least give you that quick,
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:23.680]   glanceable dislike count back.
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:24.680]   Yeah.
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:25.680]   That was incredible.
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:31.360]   I saw, I was on, I think I was on Reddit and spotted that somebody had on data hoarder had
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:38.400]   actually scraped or downloaded the entire, the entire bolus of likes dislikes data for
[01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:41.280]   basically snapshot of the entire entirety of YouTube.
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:42.280]   Was that correct?
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:43.760]   I was like, how do you do that?
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:46.040]   And that's how they're extrapolating.
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:48.040]   Amazing.
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:50.320]   That's a lot of dislike for taking that feature off.
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:55.320]   Well, there's actually a lot of data mining that goes on related to that.
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:55:02.720]   So like, if you apply to a lot of different things, a variety of different organizations,
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:09.320]   they will search your social history, even your deleted tweets, back to the time that
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:10.320]   you signed up for Twitter.
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:12.320]   Like, you know, everything.
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:16.360]   You know, and what you say on Twitter is the bottom line.
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:17.360]   Everywhere.
[01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:18.360]   I mean, it's just, but that's just an example.
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:22.120]   So, you know, they, they've really, that's a big machine that is constant.
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:25.680]   I mean, you know, and obviously for, for good, it's being used by something, you know, stuff
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:27.720]   like the Internet Archive.
[01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:31.880]   But, but there's a lot of data management systems that keep track of all of it all the
[01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:35.840]   time so that people can figure stuff out about other people.
[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:37.480]   That's the, that's the thing that people do.
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:43.240]   Andy and I go, a little bird tells me you're going to be doing something for our club this
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:44.840]   week.
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:45.840]   That's right.
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:48.800]   I'm doing an AMA for Club Twit next week.
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:53.640]   So I think the, that part's being done, of course, on this, the Discord channel.
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:59.520]   So if there's anything you've ever wanted to ask me, of, I don't know what people would
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:01.120]   want to ask me.
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:05.360]   I, I, I could make up a good answer for pretty much anything you want to ask.
[01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:12.400]   So geopolitics, find the James Webb telescope versus, you know, is it, is it, is it, should
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:15.720]   they put it on the garage point A instead of what garage point B?
[01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:19.600]   I'll let you know what I think about that just firing those questions off.
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:21.200]   So I'm looking forward to it.
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:24.120]   What day, what day and time do we know Friday?
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:26.040]   Friday, usually around.
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:31.080]   Next, it's next week, I think I am reminded me today to make sure next week.
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:34.840]   Yes, it is next week, but you're going to want to get those questions in.
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:38.080]   I think you're going to want to join Club Twit because that's the only way you can hear
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:39.080]   it.
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:43.960]   We also posted after the fact on the Twit Plus feed club, Twit is a ad free version of
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:48.680]   all of our shows that you can get for $7 a month.
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:49.760]   So you get ad free versions.
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:56.080]   You get access to the Discord channel, including Friday, January 14th at 10 a.m.
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:58.440]   Andy and Akos, A.m.A.
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:01.680]   And then if you can't be there at 10 a.m. on the 14th, that's 10 a.m.
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:04.000]   Pacific, by the way, 1 p.m. Eastern.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.000]   If you can't get there at 10 a.m. Pacific, you can always listen to it on the special
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:13.160]   Twit Plus feed, which includes not just those things, but all sorts of other stuff that doesn't
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:15.880]   make it to the podcasts before and after shows.
[01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:22.840]   Chatter, our untitled Linux show, the Gizfiz with Dick D. Bartolo, Stacey's book club, Stacey
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:23.840]   Higginbotham's book club.
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:24.840]   There's a lot of stuff.
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:28.680]   I think this is the best $7 you'll ever spend, but I'm biased.
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:29.680]   $7 a month.
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:33.840]   Go to twit.tv/clubtwit to find out more.
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:36.720]   We also have corporate memberships, and I think we just got another corporate member.
[01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:37.720]   Thank you.
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:38.720]   I appreciate it.
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:41.640]   So the club goes on.
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:46.760]   It's really helped us kind of smooth out the ups and downs through COVID.
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:49.360]   It's also been a great community.
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:52.360]   We really enjoy it.
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:54.800]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:55.800]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:58.720]   What are you going to be on GBH in Boston next?
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:04.840]   Around the usual time, Friday at 1230, go to wgphnews.org live or later to listen.
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:06.160]   Very good.
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:10.120]   Res Wittson, our Discord says, "Thank you, Renee Ritchie for the Nebula videos over
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:11.120]   the Christmas break."
[01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:14.360]   They got him through a couple of tough days.
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:16.680]   Nice that you were working on the holidays.
[01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:18.640]   YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:20.440]   Or you can go through Nebula, right?
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:21.440]   Yeah.
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:23.560]   And I just started a new exclusive series on Nebula.
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:27.680]   Like a lot of people asked me for a studio tour, but the way that YouTube works, if you
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:30.640]   put off topic videos up, it's not good.
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:33.160]   It's like a restaurant that sure is saying, "Hi, dumpling."
[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:34.160]   Suddenly giving you haggis.
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:37.120]   It's just not what anybody expects and is going to be happy about.
[01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:39.440]   So I ended up putting that series up on Netflix.
[01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:40.440]   Oh, I like haggis.
[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:44.600]   There's always 5% of anyone who would be happy.
[01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:49.840]   But I'm putting up the series of the studio tour on Nebula so people can watch it there.
[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:51.480]   It doesn't affect my own.
[01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:54.840]   How do people subscribe to Nebula?
[01:58:54.840 --> 01:58:55.920]   There's a lot of ways to do it.
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:58.480]   You can just go to nebula.app and subscribe there.
[01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:01.480]   I usually tell people to go to CuriosityStream because they'll give you Nebula for free when
[01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:04.840]   you sign up for CuriosityStream and I figure that's a better deal.
[01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:08.600]   So yeah, you can go there and just check it out.
[01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:09.600]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:16.440]   And of course, Alex Lindsey is the major domo at officehours.global.
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:19.040]   I say you're the major domo because nobody knows what that means.
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:21.600]   So it really doesn't put you in the box of any kind.
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:22.600]   Exactly.
[01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:26.800]   But you'll find him there many hours and of course, he's a 24-hour operation.
[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:34.560]   Officehours.global and he's at 090.media and the liminal zoom acquisition, the topic
[01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:38.400]   of the week last Wednesday.
[01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:41.920]   So when the Senate subcommittee tries to have hearings on this, they try to pull in whoever's
[01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:42.920]   in charge.
[01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:44.400]   Don't talk to me.
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:47.080]   I'm just the major domo.
[01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:48.560]   No one knows what he does.
[01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:52.560]   I hope you find that guy because I have a word to pick with him too, believe you need.
[01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:54.600]   I've been trying to find the right title for Alex.
[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:56.760]   I think I finally found it.
[01:59:56.760 --> 01:59:57.760]   Major Domo.
[01:59:57.760 --> 01:59:58.760]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:59:58.760 --> 01:59:59.760]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:00.760]   Thank you, Andy.
[02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:05.280]   Most of all, thanks to you for listening and watching Mac Break Weekly.
[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:10.720]   But if you want to do it while we do it live, it's back on at Tuesdays, thanks to the holidays.
[02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:14.600]   I hope you enjoyed our best of episode last week.
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:19.240]   Tuesdays at 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern, 1900 UTC.
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:22.120]   The livestream is at live.twit.tv.
[02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:28.080]   If you're watching live chat live at IRC.twit.tv, that's of course open to all or club members
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:31.160]   in our Discord channel to go devoted to Mac Break Weekly.
[02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:35.400]   After the fact, you can of course get everything we do, we're podcast, right?
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:36.760]   That means you can listen.
[02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:39.880]   After the fact, go to twit.tv for any of our shows.
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:44.280]   For this one is twit.tv/mbw.
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:47.000]   Are we going to turn on transcripts for Mac Break Weekly?
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.760]   We've turned on for the tech guy.
[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:50.920]   I think we're going to turn on for a couple of shows.
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:51.920]   Steve already does those.
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:57.640]   Maybe we'll have those transcripts available as well at the website a little bit after
[02:00:57.640 --> 02:00:59.240]   we're getting a robot to do it.
[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:03.880]   So they'll be interesting at least.
[02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:06.120]   Twit.tv/mbw.
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:07.640]   You can also watch the YouTube channel.
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:10.000]   There's a dedicated YouTube channel.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:13.440]   Click the like button, if you will.
[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:16.360]   Don't click the dislike button.

[02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:39.560]   Let the world know about what is now, I think, one of the longest running Apple Podcasts
[02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:43.520]   Technology Podcasts, 15 years in the making Mac Break.
[02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:44.840]   Episode 800 next week.
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:45.600]   We should have a cake.
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:46.600]   We should have a cake.
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:47.840]   Let me put it that way.
[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:50.120]   I intend to buy a cake for myself.
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:53.280]   You can have a little Debbie Snack cake, if you wish.
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:54.280]   Oh, no, no.
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:57.920]   I'm going to the bakery apartment at that good restaurant.
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:00.520]   Oh, a real hundred episodes.
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:02.160]   I had 800.
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:05.680]   Although, when we started doing this, people were saying, "Oh, we should celebrate every
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:06.680]   time it was 100."
[02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:09.520]   I said, "Dude, we'll celebrate when we get to 1,000."
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:11.360]   And that's not so far off either, actually.
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:13.280]   It's just a few years away.
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:14.280]   And we will be there.
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:19.760]   I don't know if we'll be around to validate Alex's prediction for AR in 15 years.
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:21.760]   But oh, we will.
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:22.760]   Maybe.
[02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:23.760]   Why not?
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:24.760]   You know?
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:25.760]   I'll maybe be okay.
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:27.520]   I'll be fine for me to fly to California.
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:28.520]   By then.
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:29.520]   Possible.
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:30.520]   No, it will be around an AR table.
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:32.800]   Andy, we'll all be sitting around an AR table.
[02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:33.800]   Exactly.
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:34.800]   Yeah.
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:35.800]   Or you talked about that.
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:38.800]   I just want to point out that we talked about that a Twit, like on a Twit at some point.
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:40.840]   Like, what if we had just the heads that were...
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:42.480]   So that was the plan.
[02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:43.480]   That was the plan.
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:48.560]   And day one, when we started doing video, I wanted to have the same technology that they
[02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:51.280]   used on the site to make me dev know.
[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:52.280]   Right.
[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:54.640]   Andy had been shrunken down to PC size.
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:56.440]   It could easily be done.
[02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:59.720]   And unfortunately, you guys would all have to wear rubber suits with ping pong balls on
[02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:00.720]   it.
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:01.720]   But other than that...
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:04.680]   Not a real breaker.
[02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:07.960]   My charisma cannot be quantized or packitized, sir.
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:12.360]   I'm just saying, there's a Memoji version of the show somewhere in the future.
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:13.360]   Yes.
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:14.360]   We could do Memoji.
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:15.360]   Probably.
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:16.360]   We could do Memoji tomorrow.
[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:17.360]   You want to do it next week?
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:18.360]   Sure.
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:19.360]   I think we have...
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:22.200]   Didn't O doctor do a Memoji on a Twit?
[02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:23.840]   When I was gone.
[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:25.320]   He didn't do it when I was here, notice.
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:26.320]   He waited till I...
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:27.320]   Sounds likely.
[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:31.720]   The teacher wasn't in the room before he did that one.
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:34.800]   And yes, and you can all wear your rubber suits at home too, which would be...
[02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:36.800]   No, that's completely...
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:37.800]   Way ahead of you.
[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:38.800]   Way ahead of you, boss.
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:39.800]   Andy and I are in PJs.
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:41.800]   That's the truth.
[02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:44.040]   Thanks for joining us, everybody.
[02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:45.040]   Happy new year.
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:49.040]   We're glad to be back in 2022 year.
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:52.920]   Right now, I'm sorry to say you got to get back to work because break time is over.
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:53.920]   Bye bye.
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:59.200]   Do you have an iPhone, an Apple watch, an iPad or any number of Apple devices?
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:04.360]   Well, you have got to check out iOS today with me, Michael Sargent and Rosemary Orchard.
