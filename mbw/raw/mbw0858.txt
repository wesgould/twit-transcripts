[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.500]   We want to protect Section 230, Apple's secret AI event.

[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.500]   Mr. Snell has the week off, but new proud Papa is here.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.500]   Dan Morin filling in his six colors cohort.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.000]   Hello, Dan.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Hello, good to be here.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.500]   I'm glad I can take Jason's place, but only temporarily.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.000]   No one will replace him permanently.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Believe me, I've tried.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Jason will also be out next week.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   But next week, Dan, we're not going to make you fill in.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   We've actually got an interesting person for next week whose name escapes me.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Who is it, John Ashley?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Let's leave it a surprise.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   A surprise?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Okay.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Well worth tuning in for.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Leo, suppose it's not knowing for sure.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Hello, it's Liza.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It's Liza Manelli.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   No, it's not.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Hello, Mr. Andy and I go, how are you?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Hanging in, hanging on.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Good.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Pretty much all it is.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Welcome.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Good to see you from WGBH in Boston and that points east.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Also from the Bay Area, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Hello, I'm Eenia and office hours.global.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Hello.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Good morning.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   How are things?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   They're doing well.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   This is back from Pennsylvania.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Ah, nice.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Yeah, Mr. Snell is in New Zealand, right, Dan?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   He's all the way on the other side of the world.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   That's how far he had to go.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Wow.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Just to get away from all the way.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Just to get away.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Well, we'll be glad to get back in three weeks.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   But for now, I think we have an excellent substitution.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I was going to ask you, Dan, your latest book, The By-ear and Agenda.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Excellent read.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   You have a very good reader for these.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Oh, thank you.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And Victor Bovine.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Do you pay Victor to do that?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Or is it doing it out of the goodness of his heart?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   No, I mean, he is paid by the publisher of the audiobook.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Ah, nice.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And he has done all three of my books from the real lot.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Yeah, yeah, he's great.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Angry Robot is a publisher.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   So, okay, then I was going to ask you if you'd listened to the Apple AI voices and whether
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   you would consider those instead of Victor.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   But since you don't pay them, obviously not.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Well, and I have listened to the samples that they had on their website.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   And I mean, good as they are.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   That's a complex thing.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I don't think I would do it for me because I like supporting audiobook narrators.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   I think they are great at what they do.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Thank you.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Good man.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Can't just replace people who talk on the internet with robot voices.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   No.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   People talking on the internet.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Let me tell you, is unduplicatable.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   The robot voices are pretty dang good though.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I got it.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   They are good.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   But not as good as me.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I've been watching more and more YouTube videos and realizing they're using a digital voice for it.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It's like a style now.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   There's a style of English for the second language for the person who's making it and they throw
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   it in.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   But all the little five minute crafts or whatever, those are all digital women.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Yeah, that's because of TikTok.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   It might even be the TikTok lady.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   I wouldn't be surprised if they reused your voice on YouTube.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   I don't like that one.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And also because this is almost bot generated content where they will flag, oh, here's
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   a web article we found that we could transform without paying the original author into YouTube
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   short content or TikTok content.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Let's just do a bunch of screen grabs from the video, make that into a slideshow, and
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   then just have an AI recite what was written underneath it.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   It's going to get a lot more difficult to reject those things when the AI voices become
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   really, really, really good because oftentimes I will be thinking, oh, damn, how do I make
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   tofu in a microwave or whatever?
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   And I'll see a video and it looks like, okay, well, here's how to make exactly what I was
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   looking for, how to make tofu in a microwave.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And I'll say tofu, tofu is very easy to make in a microwave oven, saving, okay, click next
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   one because this is, I have no idea what's going to happen to me, my microwave, or my
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   microwave, if I actually fall these in space.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Here from Netflix is the woman who's voice.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   But you can't buy a lot of nice...
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   That's the woman who's the TikTok voice.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   And I feel kind of bad because in the Netflix, you can keep going with it.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Oh, you missed it.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   In the, in the...
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   My childhood was difficult.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I wasn't like the other little girls.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I want to be where the people are.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I hate this voice in the TikTok, in the Netflix synopsis of this.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   "Meet Amelia, the woman behind the famous text-to-speech feature speaks out about her catapulting rise to fame after years of failed voiceover work."
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   The very first common is, "Not many voices make me literally go into a rage and this is one of them."
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And I'm kind of, kind of wither.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Do you want to see them dancing?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   I don't, it's that "ing" at the end.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   I don't like it.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   I think the interesting thing that was...
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   I can never go down a job.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   9-1-1, what's your emergency?
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   You don't have to...
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Actually, you know what? Maybe this is parody.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   I am a real person.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I think it's parody.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   I think it's parody.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Okay, never mind then.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   The poor...
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   What was I gonna say?
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Oh, oh.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   That's funny.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   First of all, Happy Mardi Gras.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   It's Fat Tuesday.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   And Gate Tuesday, yes.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   We're going to a little Mardi Gras festivity in Petaluma tonight at the...
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   They call it the block, but it's where a bunch of food trucks gather.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   [laughter]
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   So I guess I'll be having John Belire and Les El Bolton Roule at the food truck in downtown Petaluma tonight.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   So happy Fat Tuesday to all of you.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Also, this morning I was up early because this was the morning where the Internet was on trial at the Supreme Court of the United States of America.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   And it's unclear whether...
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   We won't know until April if the Internet has one or not, but this is the face...
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   The face Gonzalez, the case...
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Gonzalez versus Google.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I mean, it's a sad story.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   The family of a woman who was killed in an ISIS attack in Paris in, I think, 2015.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Sooing Google because they say, "Well, you recommended ISIS videos and you radicalizing people."
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I don't think they even had evidence that the people who killed their daughter had anything to do with those radicalizing videos on Google.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Nevertheless, the case has wound its way up to the Supreme Court.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   And I spent a fun morning listening to the Supreme Court justices try to figure out how the Internet works.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Actually, my...
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   The series of tubes.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Yeah, my favorite quote was Eleanor Kagan.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Justice Kagan said something like, "What did she say?"
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   These are not the nine greatest experts on the Internet sitting here in front of you.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   No kidding!
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   But they asked some pretty good questions because they're really trying to figure out...
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   For instance, Google has...
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Action 230 protects them from the ISIS uploaded the ISIS videos, right?
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   They take them down, but they don't have to.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   They're protected there.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   But here's the question.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   If Google puts a thumbnail of an ISIS video on a page, any page, are they now publishing the video?
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   They're actually asking this question because they made the thumbnail, which of course they didn't.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   They're also investigating the idea of does the fact that they are specifically recommending videos to specific people?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Does that make them not a distributor but now a editorial publisher in that they are picking and choosing what people should see?
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   It's one of those horrible situations in which that's a really good point and the Supreme Court should be considering that
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   while I'm thinking, "Oh my God, please don't touch Section 230, please, please don't touch."
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   I was encouraged.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Because you know how bad this is going to come.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   I was encouraged, despite Justice Kagan's comment, I was encouraged that they seem to actually understand, in fact, one of them even said,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   "Wouldn't there be a huge consequence to the economy if we in some way dismantle Section 230?"
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Any change to 230 could...
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   It's one of those things when you have no idea.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   We have a term in production a lot of times.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Something's not quite right and someone will say, "What should we do with it?"
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   We're just like, "Leave the knife in."
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   "Leave the knife in."
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   "Leave the knife in."
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Always bad.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   "Leave the arrow out. Always bad. Never wear it."
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   It may look bad right now, but it could get so much worse so quickly.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   I think that the unintended...we kind of know what we have right now and we even have the tinkering that's already happened with the laws
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   that I think that pulling it this one is really complicated and so much of the foundational work of everything that's on the Internet
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   is so tied to it that I think that changing it in almost any way could cause a lot of trouble.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   I do think that it's really interesting.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   I think that when it did open up Google and Facebook and when they started in Twitter, they avoided it for a long time of taking anything off.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   They could downgrade it. They could do other things, but they didn't want it to block anything because they were afraid that it was going to come up of now their publishers.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   As soon as they start taking things off the Internet, their publisher...
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   It's really pretty sweet.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   It protects them for.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   It allows them to moderate. It allows me to moderate.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   There's two things that 230 does.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   It protects you against liability for somebody, somebody publishes in our IRC, and it protects me for liability from me taking it down.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   They can't sue me for blocking their speech.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   It has both directions.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   I think it is very important. We wouldn't have a chat room. We wouldn't have a discord.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   We wouldn't have comments. I wouldn't have a forum if there were no Section 230 because we just get sued all the time.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   I think that it's been astutely pointed out that the smaller organizations or anyone wanted to do something new are the ones that hit the hardest with this.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   GDPR is a huge problem.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Fortunately, it hasn't been used very much. It hasn't been prosecuted that much.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   When you build a new website and you're a small company, you really have to think through all those things now because you could theoretically get put under really fast with the level of fines that are really aimed at the Googles and the Facebooks.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   The collateral damage is potentially very high.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   So far, they haven't enforced it, which has allowed a lot of companies to find their way to it.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Even if you don't get fined, the cost of basically...
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Defending is prohibited.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Well, not even defending.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Exactly. You have to have a compliance officer basically to head off these problems before they exist.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   A lot of these startups are on a shoestring anyway.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   You have CEOs who are sleeping in the parking lot overnight.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   They can't afford to take on that extra expense.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   So this is why it's like so many of the proposals to reform the internet and give them more responsibility and more control back to the users like the idea of making sure that small publishers get paid by Google, get paid by Facebook.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   A lot of these things only wind up benefiting the people, the organizations that already have an immense amount of control because oftentimes these are the only people who can afford to play in this brand new swimming pool that the courts are creating.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Even these lawsuits about, again, let's have Facebook and Google pay small newspapers and small magazines for reusing their content.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   The people who are creating, who are instigating these lawsuits are a news corpus, these huge, huge international communications concomers that have basically bought up every single newspaper, every single TV show, every single publication.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   And they're the ones who are going to benefit from this. It's not going to mean that your local newspaper is now going to be able to survive again.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   It means that the people who put them on a business will be able to get a little bit more money.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Now it's a real goldbird machine almost, right? Like you start, you change one thing and it's the ball starts rolling.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   That knife comes out the whole, your silverware is all knocked over, I don't know, whatever you set up your goldbird machine to do, but it's good.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Like the consequences are just unforeseen, right? Like so much of the internet is built on kind of just this all, this agreement, this tacit agreement that everyone's had, like, this is the way it's going to work.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   And it's amazing that it works as well as it does, not to say it works perfectly, but as well as it does.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   It's wishing on a monkey's pile. It'll give you what you asked for, but not what you wanted.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Well, anyway, we'll pay attention. There'll be another argument tomorrow. There's another case that is against not only Google, but Twitter and Facebook, but does not, according to experts, attack section 230.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   We're trying to get Kathy Gellis on tomorrow for this week in Google. She wrote an amicus brief for a tech dirt on this case, Gonzalez versus Google today.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   So we'll be very interested to see what happens, obviously, it'll affect all of us.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   And I do, you know, I have to say, listening to the justices, you know, you never, if you've listened to Supreme Court arguments before, you can't really tell how they're going to rule because they'll play devil's advocate.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   They're really trying to tease out all of the issues. So you can't assume, but it sounded like they kind of understood the issues and the consequences of it.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   And the attorney for the plaintiff at one point said, you don't have to worry about all these lawsuits. They're not going to happen.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   And one of the justices said, we can't really, that's not how we work exactly here.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   You know, change the law. We'd have to, people aren't going to pursue it. It's not a big deal.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   So my tangential claim to fame was, I used to as a teenager in an early 20s, something I worked at Harvard Law Library. And one of my jobs was fairing around books to the faculty office.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   So I delivered books to Elena Kagan, as well as a lot of other people who are like professors at Harvard at the time.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Elizabeth Warren Lawrence tribe, I just brought the books on a little card around and ended him over.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Oh, Mr. Tribe, here's a book for you.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Little did he help me out later in the work.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Actually, Kagan was quite, I thought, in her questioning.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   But we'll just wait and see.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Both of the administration, President Biden and Senator Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley are encouraging the Supreme Court to strike down 230.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   So we got a lot of arrows coming our way, but let's hope cross your fingers.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Yesterday, I did something kind of fun. Actually, I did it on Saturday.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   I put windows on my Mac book. How exciting. It's now official.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   You can use windows on arm in parallels, at least right now, although I imagine fusion will be a more fusion will catch up quick.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   But parallels right now, and Microsoft is officially acknowledged it is an authorized solution for windows on arm on an M1 or M2 Macintosh.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   And I'm here to tell you, it runs pretty sweet. It's pretty nice.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   I've run windows on arm in the past. And, you know, for a long time, it was in beta. In fact, it's just now, I guess, official.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   And it really wasn't very good experience because so many, even if the Microsoft programs didn't run, that has changed a lot.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   There are a lot. There are a number of windows machines that are running arm and Microsoft's put more attention into it.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   And it works pretty well. I'm happy to say.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   So the exceptions don't really affect your data operation.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Because I was reading through it and I know that the transition to arm is still ongoing.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Yes, not like it. Sure. Yeah. So, so is the compatibility list pretty good? Like a few, the reason why you, the reason why you decided to install windows on on on an M1 or M2 Macbook must be because you needed to get certain solutions, certain apps that you couldn't get on the Mac.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Have they made sure that you can get those apps running on arm windows?
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   You know, I didn't look at a compatibility list. I probably should. Everything I, but I'm using generic stuff like Microsoft Office. That all works all Microsoft apps work edge works quite well.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   I'm sure Chrome works quite well. But yeah, you should obviously check to see if that one thing you want runs. What's nice is it runs pretty snappily. It does not feel like it's slow. It's not virtualized.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   It's something a little smarter. Well, it seems like I mean, this is probably, you know, the sort of growing pains of windows on arm is probably one of the reasons why we haven't seen a replacement for bootcamp.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   I don't know if we ever will. Yeah, we may not. Apple may not have it. It may not be in their interest or they may just not have enough of an audience for it. I mean, if most people can get what they need done via parallels.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   I mean, the biggest, the biggest problem with things like parallels and fusion has always been running games. If you want to run games on the Mac and that's never been a great solution for that in the first place.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   And Apple would very much like you to believe that they care a lot about gaming and that you can just run those games natively on your Mac as soon as the game developers get around to actually making them.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Yeah, and if you want to run a game in this, don't because it doesn't support DirectX 12 or OpenGL. So games are right out. But what I think it's primarily for and one of the things parallels does very nicely is something called coherence mode, which is if you had that one windows app, you just have to run.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   You can run it in coherence mode where it's just a window next to your Mac windows and it's just running. And that's not too bad. I had to unfortunately had to buy a license to windows to.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Which had 200 bucks hurts my heart, but I had to see if it would run and how well it run. I'll keep it on my I'm running on them to MacBook Pro with 24 gigs of ram. It took six gigs.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   That was the automatic setting for Windows and it runs fine in six gigs. So, yeah, just not something you necessarily want to run on your eight gig.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   I mean, this is one argument. If you're going to run Windows, this would be one argument to get more RAM in your Mac or any virtual environment. It'll be, you know, that's a good reason to get more RAM because.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   But it runs pretty, I was surprised how snappy it was. I was able to play solitaire just, you know, like that was great.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   No problem. Let's not lose our mind. It's free sell. I think that most of the Windows apps I have either wouldn't work at all because they're really heavy or exactly.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   But a lot of them are glue. They're little things that we're using and we have to have like oftentimes like a little B link or some kind of nook or something that's running it.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   And I think those kinds of things will be great. You know, just be able to have it on the Mac and have it running running on those things. And, you know, the, again, educational price for 99 regular price, 599 entry level.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   If you're going to turn it into something isn't that bad if you're just going to use it as a PC, like even if you're just going to flip it over.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   And if you're going to run both of those things at 16 gigs, it's probably for smaller apps. It could work really well.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Eboo. So I had a good shot. A suggestion in the chat. He said, if we turn the lights down 20%, we'd be able to recoup that $199 that I paid for Windows.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   So if you can, John Ashley, just turn the thermostat down, turn the lights down a little bit. We got to make that money back.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Some amount of money records.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   The mood music. Windows subsystem for Andrews and right does not work. Windows subsystem for Linux does not work.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   The sandbox does not work. And virtualization based security does not work. DirectX 12 is not supported.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   32-bit ARM apps are not supported.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   So the list is probably pretty long of things that won't work. And I bet you most of the pro apps that you use, Alex, would definitely not work.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   None of them will work.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Yeah. But again, we have a lot of little things that we use as glue to as little controllers.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   And right now we're using very inexpensive little PCs that aren't that much less than just having a Mac Mini.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   And to be honest with you, I'd rather have a Mac Mini that I knew I could repurpose later at some point, even if it was $100 more expensive.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Most of the people that I know that, most of the people I know that are running Bootcamp or running Windows on Mac hardware are administrators.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   People who they want, they just prefer the Mac hardware to do all their work on.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   And even if they're almost solely administrating Windows and Linux workstations.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   And so a lot of the tools they need to maintain that network and to serve their users really is Windows only.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   They have to speak the language of the people that they're serving.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   So it's not necessary. I mean, I think for most people, if you already spent $1500 on a Mac laptop, probably the app that you want is either a direct analog or the direct app available on the Mac.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   It's not 1989 anymore.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Yeah. That's another reason not to bring back Bootcamp.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   I was thinking like, you know, it's very, I mean, this is sort of like a Deja vu in almost, I mean, when I started writing about Apple in the first place professionally, it was during the intro transition.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   And when you could first run Windows on your Mac, right? Because of the processors.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   And I think the environments changed a lot since then.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   And those days it was like, oh, see, now you can run, you can get real stuff done.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   You can run all these things that you know, you otherwise couldn't run.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   And nowadays, like Andy said, there's either an analog or the things available, if not on the Mac, then on iOS, oftentimes, like there are iOS clients, a lot of cases, the things that don't even exist on the Mac or web services, right?
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   So much stuff has moved to things like web services or cross-platform services that it's not as critical.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   It's nice for taking care of those little like last little like little linking pieces of software or whatever, but it's not, I think in general, it's more of a niche product than it was maybe 15 years ago.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Microsoft does get credit in its press release for including the registered logo and the TM logo four times in one headline.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   It's very impressive. They clearly didn't want Apple to get upset in any way about the use of the word Mac, Apple M1 or M2.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Why is M1 a R and an M2 a TM? That's kind of interesting. I'm sure there's a legal name.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Did they finish getting it registered yet?
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Yeah, it seems unlike them.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   You get the R once it's registered and the TM just means, yeah, that's probably what it is. It hasn't yet been approved.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   This has been around. I mean, I put parallels on an early M1 and ran the beta version of Windows on ARM.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   So people are saying, "Wait a minute. This isn't anything new. That's been around forever. It's now official. That's the difference."
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   Microsoft is no longer a beta version of Windows on ARM.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   I asked Daniel Robino, who was the editor-in-chief of Windows Central yesterday or Sunday, why it took so long because there was some speculation that Microsoft was not a bad thing.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Microsoft had some sort of exclusive deal with Qualcomm because of course all the Windows on ARM computers are Qualcomm based processors.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   He said it's really not that it's the drivers. The drivers are all Qualcomm and they had to get drivers for Apple Silicon.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Apparently that was non-trivial.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   But there's even still a very vibrant Hackintosh community. So if they can figure out how to get Wi-Fi and Bluetooth going on an old Dell, I think that this is within the realm of Microsoft and Perilals.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   They did it just in time for the cheap skates who have paid for TurboTax on the PC.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   They want to put it on their Windows machine just in the nick of time for tax day 2023.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Anyway, I mean, I should have brought my laptop in and showed you.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   I showed a deal with a demo on S2Tek guys on Sunday so you can see that on Sunday.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   But it works, I guess is the point and it'll work for those of you who, you know, I'm a realtor and I need the MLS app to run on my M2 or something like that.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   It's that kind of line of business. It's always fascinating, especially like when you look at the market for certain vintage computers, like there's an old, when the classic first laptop, so the epsom 820 something like that, you see all kinds of laptops are just like it.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   They're going for 20 bucks, 30 bucks, 40 bucks, just get rid of it for me.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   But these model specific models of epsens are going for easy $200 to $300 when you can find them.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   It's easily with the money you can spend for it.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   And the reason why is because these devices are used as hardware controllers for like really, really old pump stations and really, really old alarm stations.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   And so you can either totally, you can either totally like rip out your entire pump controller station or you can basically find a new version, find a new working version of this laptop when this old 1983, 1984,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   laptop dies, Lamborghinis are the same way. The software to tune it and control it is basically runs on a version of.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   I think it's like actually locked hardware lock for security purposes to this one model of laptop.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   And that's why, again, like if you were if you're at the MIT flea market and you see just this hopper full of like old 1990s windows laptops and you find like this one, like take the entire box for 10 bucks.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   This is all like eways. You will find this one. You can get $20,000 for because it is a key piece of diagnostic equipment for a half a million dollar supercar.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Let's take a little break. When we come back, Apple had an event, an event that invited people to maybe Jason Snell is it really in New Zealand.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   He's just an Apple event land. I don't know.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   We will talk about the Apple event, which I think mostly was YouTuber who went to and just a little bit.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   But first a word from our sponsor, Melissa. Melissa, you've heard me talk about Melissa.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   You've heard me call them the address experts. Really, it's a whole lot more. In fact, I think over the next few weeks when we talk about Melissa in their ads, we're going to talk a little bit about some of the other things Melissa has done.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   They've actually released a solutions catalog. I was amazed at the variety of things.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   It all revolves around customer data, customer information.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   When a customer comes to you and you get their data in their system, you want to make sure it's accurate.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   You want to keep it up to date. You want to make those address changes. The email changes. The name changes as they happen.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Unfortunately, most businesses don't have any process in place to do that, which means that data is going to be going bad over time and costing you money.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   With Melissa, high quality data can be achieved at the start. You can keep bad data from entering in your systems.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   You can streamline onboarding. You can combat fraud, gain a complete customer view for more informed business decisions, and you can keep that data up to date for as long as you use Melissa.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   It's a really great solution that many businesses have found that saves the money, keeps them on track.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Of course, you want to verify customers and business data to make sure your records remain accurate, current, and complete.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   You can do that with Melissa's personator.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   I love it. They have consumer and personator identity services available in the US and Canada.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Personator consumer service matches names, addresses, phones, and emails and returns a list of the closest matches according to the specified inputs.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   That's very handy if you've got the spelling just a little bit off or a street name a little bit off.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   You can fix it. It's all in one contact checking. It also does verification.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   It uses the US Postal Services System to identify moves, so it'll update and moves.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   It also will enrich its web service that can check, verify, move, and append to your customer information.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   You pass in names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   You simultaneously parse them, check them for correctness, making conservative or aggressive corrections.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   You get to choose. You get the latest address. You can even append data.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   There's also a personator identity, and this is really important.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   A real-time solution that can handle international customer data in a compliant way,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   verifying customer details such as contact information, addresses, other useful properties.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Personator identity is a high-value service can validate and cross-tech personal data across multiple international data sources.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   It doesn't in real time. It's kind of amazing. You'll be impressed by how quickly it does this.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Verify individuals in real time using a variety of matching options.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   You can match against two sources using EIDV configurations for both sources.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   You can screen individuals against national watch lists. That's very helpful in preventing fraud.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   You can also identify potential fraud by matching a name to an address to validate identity.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   If it's a fraudulent name, it probably doesn't match the address.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Since 1985, Melissa is specialized in global intelligence solutions.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   I thought they were just the address experts. No, global intelligence solutions to help organizations unlock accurate data for a more compelling view.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   And don't worry. Your data is always safe, always compliant.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Melissa undergoes continuous, independent security audits to reinforce their commitment to data security, data privacy, and compliance requirements.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   There's SOC 2 HIPAA and GDPR compliant. Your data is in the absolute best hands.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   Make sure your customer contact data is up to date. Get started today with 1000 records cleaned for free at Melissa.com/twit.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   That's Melissa. M-E-L-I-S-S-A.com/twit.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   We thank them so much for the support. Macbreak Weekly, you support us when you use that address though.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   Make sure you use that. All our sponsors, they pay attention to that. That's how they know it's working.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   Melissa.com/twit.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   Thursday, anybody get invited to the Big Apple event? Anybody?
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   You can get me an employee to get to go to that one.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Invitees included CNN.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   CNN, I'm sorry, I should have applied two events. This is the gaming event.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   CNN, Tom's Guide, well-known YouTube personalities like Jacqueline Dallas.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   Jacqueline is how we know about it because she put it on her Insta.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Jacqueline, there she is. Insta. She's standing right there.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   She said Apple event that truly left me so inspired and excited.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   It was a bunch of developers that are making apps for Apple's arcade and Mac.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   She has a big YouTube channel. She could afford pants without holes in it, but I don't know.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Games are so special to me because they can transcend cultural differences and are so based in storytelling and having fun.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   The developers were also affectionately passionate about their new launches.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Made my whole day. Would you like to know the games that she saw that transcended cultural differences
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   based in storytelling and having fun? Call of Duty, Warzone Mobile.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Cultural differences as long as you're not a Nazi.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   Honkai Star Rail, Lego Star Wars Castaways, and Run Legends in the Medium.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   By the way, very first comment. You know this reads more like a PR piece than a hands-on experience.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   Well, do anybody check their clock and see that it's once again time for Apple to talk about how much it cares about gaming?
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   We love gaming. Pretty regularly every six or seven years Apple is like, "Oh, games, right, a big market that we really haven't addressed in a super long time.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   Let's get on that." And GDC is in two weeks. In two or three weeks.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   So game developers' conference is coming up in San Francisco.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   So the timing is usually late February, early March. It's a good time to talk about games.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   It's when everyone's thinking about them.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Yeah, I wrote a piece a couple weeks ago to do a column over at Macworld.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   It was about the cultural problems that Apple has with making the Mac gaming platform and why.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Yeah, there are technological hurdles, but I think the fundamental issue for Apple in gaming is that nobody who is in a high enough position to make decisions cares about games really.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   When Steve Jobs used to talk about music, when you had the iPod and talked about, "Oh, I love music and the digital music experience," you got the sense that Steve, he was a music fan.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   That was something he was interested in and that interest lined up nicely was something Apple was going to do.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   But then he would talk about movies or TV shows.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   And he'd be like, "Yeah, we also got movies. We got TV shows, whatever."
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   I don't think he particularly cared because I don't think that he treated that in the same way that to him music was kind of like this sacred thing.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   And I don't think anybody at a high enough level in Apple really cares about gaming.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   And that shows because they're just as hard as they have tried to make this argument.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   It's not really backed up with anything.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   So, yeah.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   I think one of the biggest mistakes on many platforms is that people try to do what everybody else is doing.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   And I think Apple is doing a little bit of that, or maybe a lot of that.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Okay, we've got a bunch of games, but they're not taking full advantage of what they could be doing.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   They have hardware, starts at a phone and eventually will end with a Mac Pro.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   They have a streaming system to do content around that.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   They have a lot of things that most game developers don't have, and they could take better advantage of that.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   And that might give them something that was a lot more interesting.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   The problem right now is that they're just doing more games the way that they have always been done
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   and they're at a huge disadvantage because no one wants to play them there.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   And so they're playing into their weaknesses, not into their strengths.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   I think that there's a lot from a broadcast perspective.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   When you think about Apple TV+, there's a lot that could be done if you started to transcend.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   A lot of these first person shooters are not really watchable.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   I mean, they're watchable for gamers, but they're not watchable for average people
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   in the same way that large sports go.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   And they go, "Well, we filled up a stadium."
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   I'm like, "Yeah, but can you fill out up 22 of those every weekend?"
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   No, probably not.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   And so there's big numbers, and the problem is the games are too complicated to watch.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   And you could build simpler games that did a lot of things that were viewable,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   and that also scaled in technology from the very basic phone all the way up
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   and seamlessly take full advantage of that hardware.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   But they'd have to build that from the ground up, and they'd have to stop building
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   the cut-the-rope style games that they're building now, which is fine on a phone.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   But there's just not that many people.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Nobody wants to watch you play cut-the-rope.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   I understand the game, but I don't want to watch it.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   I don't like to watch.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   I mean, I try to watch like Call of Duty and a lot of those.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Fortnite or Call of Duty, Quake Arena, which has been around forever.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Those are pretty nice.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   They're not complicated.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   I understand when you're looking at a mobile league of legends,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   it's like, I don't know.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   You really have to know what's going on.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Even start, even start, whatever it is.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Like a football field is really simple.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   You understand.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   You can see everything that's going on.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   No, no, you say that because you've been, you teased on the Pittsburgh Steelers.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   A football game is not that simple.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   It's complicated.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   Well, it's a lot simpler than Call of Duty or Fortnite.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   No, it depends on what you're coming from.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   I mean, there's lots of people from a camera perspective.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Oh, sure.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   From a camera perspective and understanding where you are and how it's working.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   The beauty of Call of Duty and Fortnite is you don't need a camera.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   The game doesn't for you.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   That's part of the problem.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   I mean, I think that the issue is that the game, the way that camera works,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   if you're not, the player is not.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Actually, one of the most interesting things that's happened in esports
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   is games have started to build in the ability for a director to switch cameras.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   So you are now, Fortnite's a perfect example.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   I've watched Fortnite games in esports and somebody, some director somewhere saying,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   "Well, let's go over and see how Ninja's doing."
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   And look at it for the third person, let's see what Ninja's seeing.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   I think that that is possible.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   That's certainly due to the experience in the games.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Yeah, I've talked to some developers about that,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   and evidently, I mean, basically, those are basically unrendered non-player characters
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   and that are being able to be placed around within that system.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   And the issue that they really get into is that once they're doing the development,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   they're getting ready to release the game, putting those in is not.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   And then those in last night, it's the last thing they want to do.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   And it's really hard to, and I've talked to people who do the video,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   and I'm like, "We just want to have some more camera angles."
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   And they're like, "Yeah, we don't time to do that. We have to, we have to release schedule."
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   And so that's been the problem that they've had.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   That's happening.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   And Fortnite's been out for a while.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   They have a lot of developers.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   They have a lot of money.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Billions.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   I don't think you're going to see Apple doing anything with Fortnite any time soon.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   No, I don't think Apple could build literally just contract someone to do something like that.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   And you say, "Well, they wouldn't get off the ground."
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   You put a $10 million prize for the winner of the tournament.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   You get a lot of people playing.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   And then it's just a matter of whether it's a good game to make up.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   So is the issue, I mean, it's kind of a chicken and egg, right?
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   Not enough gamers are using Macs for me to,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   "I'm going to develop my game for Windows, PS5, and Xbox, because that's where the gamers are."
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   Right.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   Well, so this has always been the chicken and egg problem with Apple, right?
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   Like they don't have the games, therefore they don't get the gamers, therefore they don't get the games.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   This has been a problem for 20 years or more.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   I mean, somebody who's been playing Mac games since like 90s,
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   they didn't really, they had a brief moment there.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   And I think, Conne, you can pinpoint the moment it all went downhill back when Steve Jobs got on stage
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   and Mac World Expo and showed off this great new game coming to the Mac called Halo.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   And then Microsoft, BUB, and G, and it didn't show up on the Mac for several years.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   And I think Apple always felt a little burned by that and really struggled with trying to come back from it.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   And I think what's fundamentally happened is that a lot of the people who play, you know,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   own Macs maybe and do everything else on a Mac got frustrated with the lack of games
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   and went to building a PC that they could play games on or buying a console.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   And it's really hard to come back from that.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   Apple had this weird, honestly fluke with like iOS, right, where mobile gaming
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   ended up they built an awesome platform that was really advantageous for mobile games
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   and had a lot of great technology in it.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   But they didn't, it wasn't, they didn't set out to build that for games.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   They got lucky.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   People, developers on that platform are like,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   "Could be a really great opportunity for games."
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   But the scale is not the same.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   The building the stuff on mobile is not the same as building the top tier games on the Mac.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   And I don't, it's not that the hardware or horsepower isn't necessarily there.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   It's that the investment in time and energy from game developers
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   to build their game for yet another platform that doesn't use tooling that's the same
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   necessarily as what they're doing on the PC or consoles.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   It's just expensive and there's no, there's no market.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   Yeah, I think Apple's, I think Google fell into the same trap that Apple did that,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   or is trying to recover from, which is that, you know,
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   I think Dan had a good point about music where,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   at some point, Apple said, "You know what?
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   We're going to hire in Jimmy Iaving.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   We're going to bring in Dre.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   That's how, that's how invest we are in making something that can compete with Spotify.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   They have not ever made that kind of investment.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   We're going to get the Jimmy Iaving of gaming, working for us to basically,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   who has both the plan, the understanding of the market
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   and the deep, deep, deep context and respects of that market too, basically,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   really emphatically say, "Come on here.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   We will take care of you for several years.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   This is just a passing fancy."
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   Whereas, of course, Google made the same mistake of like,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   "Hey, we got this great cloud game streaming platform.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   You can actually develop for this, this cloud platform instead of having to do X, Y, and Z.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   They just didn't have a level of interest in it."
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   Everyone very, very wisely basically stayed out of it.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   I don't know if Apple can ever get that kind of mojo back
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   because the game industry has just moved so far past them at this point
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   where you really have to explain, "Okay, the people that we're building games for
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   explain to me why, if they're really interested in AAA games,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   they don't already have a $500 game console.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   They haven't completely solved this problem by even buying a $300 previous generation
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   game console.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Explain to me why we should invest several years and millions and millions of dollars
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   hoping to basically get people to put down a game controller
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   that's probably already connected to a PlayStation or an Xbox
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   and pick up a game controller that's hooked up to a MacBook instead.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   They can't make that argument.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Is there enough money in it to make it worthwhile?
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   For gaming there is.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   I mean, gaming is huge, right?
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   I think the issue is to Andy Point.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   Some of it is they need people in there, they hire people at Apple TV Plus
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   who knew Hollywood and knew the industry and knew how to make TV shows.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   They need to do something similar to that for gaming.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   There's a sincerity problem.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   If you watch Tim Cook or Craig Fehurega get up on stage and talk about
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   how great a game is, nobody believes that because Tim Cook is out there playing video games.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   No, he's clearly not.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   So you need somebody out there who really knows that market well enough
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   and can convey that to the audience.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Not just, "Oh, there's this other cool thing gaming."
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   Yeah, I guess that's big.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   Do I think Carm X on the street?
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   Maybe?
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   Yeah, maybe good.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   I think that the thing that they also need to do is the advantage of them paying for these kinds of things
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   is they have to build, most of the games that they're building or that they're promoting
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   don't only take advantage of the platform.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   I mean, they are, you know, they're fine games.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   They'll run on an Apple TV just as well as they'll run on a MacBook studio or a Mac studio
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   or whatever.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   And I think that the thing is that they need to have games because the reality is
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   is that the hardware that Apple is now producing with the M2s and the coming M3s
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   is far faster than a console.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   Like, you know, and it has way more horsepower and they need to build games,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   even if they're relatively simple games, that just kind of are eye-popping,
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   that kind of so the gamers can see, "Wow, if you write to the metal," literally,
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   that you are going to get some incredible performance.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   And that starts to get people thinking about it because, you know,
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   when you can outrun these, you know, they're updating these all the time to console's update
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   every once in a while, and Apple can easily, you know, especially with a Mac Pro,
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   start showing some incredible performance that would be hard and even with the Mac Mini's.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   I mean, even the Mac Mini's will do better than probably most consoles.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   So the thing is, is that it's, but there's nothing that they're putting out
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   that has you go, "Wow, that's a great piece of hardware."
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   It's all like goofy little games that aren't in the processor.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   They're targeting it from like an ecosystem perspective, right?
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   Like they're going for like almost like a trickle up, like, "Oh, run on your iPhone as well as it runs on your Mac."
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   So, like, "Well, we don't want the base level of this necessarily be, not that the iPhone is super low power."
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   And you can be like, "Going for something that runs across all these devices is a hard sell
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   because making a game that runs just as well on the iPhone from an experience as on the Mac,
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   in terms of things like interface, is hard and it's difficult.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   And I think you want to target the top tier stuff that trickles downward or, you know, that shows up,
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   like you said, the flagship technology rather than working on stuff that necessarily works as well on every device they have.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   But that's a level. I mean, oftentimes at the level of detail issues.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   So you're dealing with how many polygons am I throwing at it?
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   You might put, you know, on an iPhone, I might throw 2 million polygons at a scene on a Mac studio.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   I might put 40 million at a scene.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   Am I going to have short depth of the field?
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   Am I going to add motion blur, anti-aliasing, all of these other things that are there?
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   And those are, those are for a long time in games have been little switches that turn on.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   And that could be automatically on the, you know, "Oh, I know I'm on an iPhone.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   I'm going to turn all this stuff off so it plays well."
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   It's not a matter of changing the game or the interface.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   It's a matter of just deciding which models, which rendering engine, which part of those things are being used based on what you have in that performance.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   And you can scale that up to some pretty, pretty insane looking things that are available right now in real time and have been for a little while,
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   but definitely with the M processors, the M series processors that they're not taking advantage of.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   And Apple's the only one that can really do this where they can say,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   "I know that you're on an Apple TV or an iPhone and I can scale to your point.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   I can scale all the way up to something that is taking, like that with Thump, a Mac Pro, the new Mac Pro that comes out of the Mac studio that's out there.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   I can do something that's going to keep that running at about 90% capacity, you know, and it'll look amazing.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   And when you open on your iPhone, it'll look the same, but it's going to be, you know, lower resolution, you know, simpler rendering, those types of things.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   It's no accident that when Mike Andronico of CNN went to this Apple event on Thursday, his article focused on the mobile games.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   That was, you know, that's, and I think because Apple sells so many iPhones, I think developers be foolish to not consider, you know, mobile.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   This is Call of Duty Warzone mobile from an Activision, maybe someday Microsoft Activision.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   But do you think that there's any chance of getting the desktop to be?
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   I mean, I think in some ways, be honest with you, and boy, I'm going to get hate mail for this.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   PC gaming is kind of legacy.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   That's a small group of people that go out and soup up a PC and buy a PC just to play video games.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   I don't think that's a big audience.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   I don't think it's necessarily the big audience, but it's kind of the...
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   It's the driving side. It's flagship, but it's like, it's the one that's, it's the visible audience, right?
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   And like, yeah, not everybody's going to be buying a PC to play games on, but like when you talk about stuff, like e-sports and whatever, you know, there's a lot of visibility for those people.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   And it kind of trickles downwards, but I think, yeah, consoles are the big competition here, like Andy said.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   And you buy a $500 console, like, that puts your Mac gaming to shame.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   It's tough to make the argument on the desktop.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   Is Apple correct in saying, you know, we got this mobile gaming? We got it. We do it. We're succeeding.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   Well, they don't have to win to make money. So they don't, it doesn't like, you know, they have, you know, the casual game market's about a $25 billion.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   But the audience here, though, let's say, is probably not gamers, it's probably developers. Right?
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   It's a big...
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   I mean, or consumers, right? The game market is interesting.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   Are they trying to get consumers to... I mean, a consumer either has an iPhone or not.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   People don't buy iPhones to play games.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   No, but everybody who has a smartphone plays probably some games is my guess, right?
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   Like, so it's a big address.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   Mostly what I think they...
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   Yeah, that's what I mean is that Apple wants developers to recognize that and...
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   Sure.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   ...develop for it.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   Yeah, I mean, it's a partnership of developers first.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   Yeah, I think they've struggled.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   Yeah, but I think you're right. They don't have the Jimmy Iovine.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   They need the guy who's got credibility.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   I still think that gaming... I still think that...
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   I mean, my first... one of my first jobs as an art director for real-time gaming, like, so it wasn't even 30 years ago.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   So I've kind of grown up inside of a lot of this stuff and I've worked with a lot of those folks
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   and I still think gaming is constrained by its own success.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   You know, it does really well, but it's in its own little box.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   It's going to stay there until someone starts building something that's outside of that box.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   I think Apple could do that and they do well.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   Same thing with books. Apple played to try and just compete with Amazon rather than building a new market
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   for more aggressive books 10 years ago and they haven't really moved the needle that much because of that.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   And I think they... you know, they're... I think we're going to probably see another...
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   Do you think that this event was originally planned to be the debut of Apple VR?
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   The rumor, the latest rumor from Mark Herman is Apple VR is not coming out in the spring,
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   but coming out in June, WWDC.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   Do you think maybe that this was planned?
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   I think the only thing that anybody thought was going to come out before June.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   June is the time you released the headset.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   I mean, it's WWDC.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   I had some sources on this one suggesting that was always the intention to be a WWDC.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   And I think that's true.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   I mean, if you see the rumors of people talking about this as a $3,000 device that, you know,
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Apple doesn't really have a great selling point and it's kind of like the prototype for what's coming down the road.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   And this is not something that I think is targeted to consumers as much as it's targeted at developers to build software for this device so that later on it can be sold to consumers with,
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   "Hey, look at all these great apps that we have.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   It's not going to be the first party experiences that sell this to consumers.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   It's going to be the ecosystem and the breadth of things.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   And I don't think going direct to consumer with the first model of this, this is not the Apple Watch.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   Right.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   But it is.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   And the least VR in the rest of the world is really primarily for gaming.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   For now.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   So there's got to be, I mean, GDC is coming up.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   You would want to have some maybe at least some room somewhere where you can invite some developers over to show them this and say, "Well, you really need to be more interested."
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   I mean, it's also the good.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   See, the thing is we keep talking about AAA gaming because that is the most impressive thing to show off your hardware to show off how well your hardware construct is less than the most impressive thing to show off your hardware.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   You know, your hardware construct is legs, but Apple, I think last year or the year before, they're consistently when you list the top five companies by revenue off gaming, Apple is always in the top five.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   They often beat Microsoft even.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   And that's not because they have their own gaming platforms because they have a huge app store and they make a lot of money off of in game revenue.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   So really, they can have something if Roblox continues to be a huge success, Apple can continue to be a huge success like that.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   They don't necessarily need to show we have the highest performance.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   Here's the amount of polygons we can render.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   Here's the amount of lighting fix we can do live.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   Here's the rate raising that we can bounce off.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   Here's access to our version of metal.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   They can just simply keep taking that 30% even adjusting it down to 15 to 18% off of very, very simple games that are designed to show off your hardware.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   And then you can see that there's a lot of different types of games that are designed to run on anything that will run on two AA batteries and can support four tri color LEDs.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   That's how that's that's that's really what the with all the money off of gaming is being made by not super high performance.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   They're also a very simple addictive slot machine type games that keep people coming back, keep people making purchases that will run on as many different platforms as possible.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   They don't care about this wonderful opportunity that you have to make a unique game for the Mac or even a unique game for the iPhone.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   They want to make sure that can I simply can I they only care about what audience can you deliver to me and given how lucrative the iOS the iPhone audience is, how proven they are as they're not just there in numbers.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   But they're also people who like to spend money. That's why Apple has success with gaming.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   It might be a fool's errand to try to figure out how to get them to get the next get the next cuphead get the next red dead red dead redemption to because it might be pretty much meaningless for them except for just having that.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   So let's talk about that VR headset Dan. Why did we think it was going to come out sooner?
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   I mean in large because there are there are stories that keep coming out about it getting laid and I think there's a narrative built up around this that certainly I think Apple wanted to get this thing out you know as soon as possible when it was ready.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   But this is Apple they try not to ship stuff. But when it's in a beta phase they try to you know want to come out and make a big splash and have it be fully functional.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   And so I think I think you know the pandemic and the supply chain stuff that everybody's experienced over the last couple years has certainly slowed down development, but I don't think that it's necessarily, you know, something that was ever had a date.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   So to say it's delayed is like well maybe internally it's slowed down but it's not like we were going to have an AR VR headset in next year they never said that right so.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   So,
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   make sense WWDC that's in June. This is the $3,000 version of the Apple VR headset that would be primarily aimed at developers so that we'll have some great games.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   What in Christmas timeframe.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   When do you think what I don't I don't even know I'm open to the idea that Apple will actually make sure that this is however many they're able to manufacture and they may not be able to manufacture as many as they want.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   They make sure that people it goes to people who are already registered developers that you or I can't just simply say hey that sounds like fun to me I'll buy a $3,000 headset to be one of the people who gets to play the first version of Apple VR pong or whatever.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   It's possible if they really want to have that ground swell of active actual creative and engaged developers so that when they do really something that is more consumer friendly both in terms of having the user interface dialed in correctly,
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   getting the weight down getting the battery life down getting heat problems mitigated all the stuff that makes a developer thing into a consumer device here is a library of actual things that we've figured out,
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   because one of the biggest problems with a are in VR continues to be nobody manufacturing these things are designing these things has any idea what consumers want out of this.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   So they're really going to have to lean on developers to help to find the cool to find the usefulness to find the awesomeness in this and then just like with the Apple Watch.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   It turns out that it turns out that people wanted to fitness watch we promoted this as a wearable computing device it's actually a huge fitness great device great so now we will sell this we know that we need to market this and sell this as a fitness device.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   Apple's not going to know how to sell their VR heads that until developers come out and figure that stuff out and see what people relate to so it might be if they can only if they can only sell 10,000 of these, which is minuscule by Apple standards or 10 in the tens of thousands even a million is small for
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   the computer. Yeah, exactly. I mean it might behoove them to say we want to make sure that this is not something that people play with for a few hours show off at the bar show off on their on their zooms show off on their on their Twitch and their YouTube channels and then put it put in a box until it's time to make fun of them six months later.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   They want to make sure that this is being this is there these are seeds that being put into the ground to grow something that they can actually profit from in 2024.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   Well, you know what is coming this spring very exciting US Department of Justice antitrust probe.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   Oh, what do you get some prejudice report.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   This is from the Wall Street Journal the US is escalating the Apple probe adding litigators seeking more data and all of this could make it possible that as soon as this spring the department could file a lawsuit of course it would be.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   Over the app store and apples policies in the app store something apples not relishing the antitrust chief of the United States.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   The Justice Department's top antitrust official Jonathan Cantor who had recused himself from similar cases because he's worked for some companies like Spotify.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   They have sued big tech companies in the past.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   So but but apparently the DOJ is saying now we think Cantor is is okay for pursuing this.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   And I'm sure that apples not thrilled to hear that Google tried to get him off their case for the same reason saying he represented clients making antitrust complaints against Google and couldn't be impartial.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   The department rejected that argument and is presumably going to reject any argument against Mr. Cantor for the Apple case.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   I will say it's kind of amazing that they're rejecting that because in almost any other case as a family lawyer in a normal case.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   Yeah, a judge with any other world for sure judge or another or another lawyer.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   I mean, judge, judge.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   But he's not acting as a judge.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   He's acting as an advocate. He's acting as a as a attorney.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   So, it's doing.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   It's doing.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   It's a little sticky.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   He's worked for spotter.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   His firm has worked not him directly, but his firms were for Spotify and tile.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   The messaging service blicks the coalition for app fairness.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   Okay.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   So, yeah, I mean, he's definitely very impartial.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   But Lena Khan has also written papers saying, you know, Google's too big and so forth. They are acting as advocates. They're not acting as a judicators.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   So, you know, they're not expected to be, you know, completely non partisan.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   Justice Department investigators asking companies for internal sales and market data, information on an expedited timeframe indicates they might be looking at filing a case soon.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   It's the San Francisco office of the US Department of Justice is handling most of the investigation. They're closest to Apple.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   And of course, Spotify and tile two of the companies who are very angry at Apple.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   And that does show that this is a broad investigation.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   The App Store, Apple is really in trouble with the App Store.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   There are a lot of...
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   Yeah, because it's not just here. It's the CEU as well, right?
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   I mean, this is where any government can really put Apple into a very, very itchy situation.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   But it goes beyond that. They are talking about things like tile complaining that, hey, how come you have a competing product, but you don't warn people that the air tag could compromise your phone security.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   You only, only when we try to connect to our tile, that you warn it's about our device.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   Spotify's old beef was that you have how easy is it for us to compete with Apple when they have their own competing service.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   They allow Apple Music app to have rights and abilities and access to the OS that Spotify doesn't have.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   It comes pre-installed on the device where Spotify doesn't now granted Spotify is still twice the business that Apple Music has.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   But these are all very, very relevant things to talk about when you have Apple that maintains such a tight control over who accesses pieces of hardware, who gets to access NFC, who gets to access Apple Pay, all these things that you and I will talk about why it's a very, very important security thing to make sure that Apple
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   trusts itself and Apple completes itself. However, they can't necessarily trust an outside device maker like Pyle to always be acting above board, but they're going to have to explain that to a judge as well.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   And I think that the issue with tile was they want to sell your data.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   And the app and the air and the air tag doesn't.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   So I think that was the difference of warning.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   And that is tiles complaint was that Apple uses privacy as a shield to protect its market.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   And that was a user. I don't want to crack her selling your data.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   It's two benefits in one.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   We make more money and your privacy is protected.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   So I don't know if that argument is going to be persuasive.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   You know, these things take a lot of time, even if the justice files in the spring.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   I'm 100% behind it going to court.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   Yeah. I think that the court loves it.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   Having lawmakers make decisions because their digital children should not, it scares me a lot because they just don't know what they're talking about.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   Having to go through, wind its way through the court system, I think totally makes sense.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   Usually what happens.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   It sounds like the EU is going to be that because the EU is going to be making laws about this already and Apple is going to have to comply with whatever comes down the pike there.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   Just like we talked about.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   I think Apple is already preparing to do that, right?
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   The word on the street is, yeah, they're already knowing that's going to happen and they're going to try to get ahead of it and do basically the bare minimum to keep above board.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   Right.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   It's fine.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   It does just bind time at this point.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   The first thing they're going to do apparently is let third party browsers live on iOS and not use WebKit.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   Firefox is reportedly preparing a version of Firefox that uses its own engine.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   Would you guys rush to the store and get a non-WebKit based browser on your iPhone?
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   No way.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   No way.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   If it will take, it'll be it'll be it'll be it'll be it'll be it'll be it most likely be have security issues and be a power hog.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   And so the thing is, is that I think that it would be I mean it'll be we'll see.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   But I can probably.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   They will also promote everything they go away.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   I might.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   I use I used to use Firefox focus, which is a privacy first browser on top and it runs on top of WebKit.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   It's basically Safari with stuff.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   I use one called Neva right now.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   That's the search engine I prefer.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   If Neva offered a Chromium based or Firefox based engine, I yeah, I'd probably look at it.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   Why not protect yourself against Apple as well as every other privacy invader.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   It would also be interesting to see exactly what the strictures are from Apple on this because I don't think it will necessarily be you can run your browser engine unfettered with no, you know, no security checks.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   Yeah, we'll see.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   They're going to lock it down in some way and prevent them from doing some stuff.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   They'll do the minimum, whatever they think will get them off the hook with the EU they're going to do.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   Or if they can or though if they don't think it'll infect them, they'll give you enough rope to hang yourself like they'll just let you run with it and when you when you screw up, they'll make sure it gets into the press.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   And so that's the other direction they could take.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   Yeah, but on the other hand, we're just coming off of a massive massive WebKit zero day that Apple had a release emergency patches across everything for us.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   But as though like Apple is a holy among holy's for they're just another browser browser manufacturer.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   And if you find that you have better faith in Chromium, if you have a better faith in Firefox based browsers, at least that's an option.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   If you if you have better faith in the rendering capabilities of a Chromium based engine, I think that Chromium for all of its foibles, including power of hungriness, including memory hungriness.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   I think that if you want to make if you want to have the greatest chance that what you see on your devices, what was intended at the other end, Chromium is still the way to go.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   I'm very much in favor of the user being able to make those choices.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   I mean, if Dr. Go were to come up with their own the wrong blessed engine, being able to make their own enhancements to whatever engine.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   Oh my goodness, that could dislodge everything for me on every iOS device I own.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   That by the way, that bug we mentioned last week, but we should reiterate is a serious zero click privilege escalation on Mac OS and iOS.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   That's why you should absolutely be running iOS 16, 3 or Mac OS 13, 2.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   And if you aren't, you should update.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   Good article today from Trellix, which was the company that discovered this zero day.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   And you can read about it. Apple themselves said that the zero day was already being seen in the wild, so that the bug was being seen in the wild.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   So significant. That's the kind of thing that nation states love is a zero click remote code execution exploit.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   That's what Pegasus did.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   And I'm sure there are the folks who I guess the company that makes Pegasus now has a new name or they closed and then they brought Rio.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   I don't know. Anyway, you see it all. It all turned out to be fine. You're worried about nothing.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   I'm sure they're looking for new stuff.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   This will be a good one.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   So this article in Trellix is blog, Trellix.com about how this works. A malicious NS predicate can execute code within the privileges of the process in Safari or messages.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   That means it can run as root.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   And that's not good. That's not a good thing.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   So yeah, I mean, Apple's not perfect in this regard either. Nobody is.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   Software was a bad idea. We should probably just take it back to start work.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   So here's the other event.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   A WWDC for AI for Apple employees only.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   Because Apple, like every other company, is now a great pain to say, "We can do it. We can do it too."
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   Facebook, Google, Google had that rushed event last week.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   Of course, Microsoft has already backed down a little bit on Bing, AI, putting restrictions on it.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   My question is, how did they take Chatch EPT?
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   We did some goofy stuff, but didn't do it. It seems like Bing, what it felt like is they added a couple of things to it to make it safeguard it or something.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   They added some kind of control and it just kind of lost.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   I don't know.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   It wasn't Chatch EPT-3. It was a newer version of Chatch EPT.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   Maybe it was newer, smarter, more likely to fall in love with you.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   More conversely, hate your guts.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   Try to kill you.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   What happened to you?
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   It was a lot of people got into long interactive conversations and pushed it long enough so that it just came apart.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   Just like AutoCorrect does. If you go long enough with AutoCorrect, eventually you're going to get some weird stuff.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   It's reinforcing bad behavior. It works with people too. It just takes a lot longer.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   I was in Chatch EPT this morning because we decided to see if it would summarize the plots of my own books for you.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   It went interestingly. Some of them were close but had things that were glaringly wrong.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   As it went on, it invented a main character that was not a good main character.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   No! I'm going to say no on that one. I thought it was kind of the most recent one.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   It was just like the plot had nothing to do whatsoever.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   I asked about my book and it's like, "Oh, that book doesn't exist."
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   I'm like, "You're sure this book from the publisher in this date?"
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   And it said, "Oh yeah, totally. I know about that book."
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   And then it invented it in a spot like a college freshman who's been put on the spot.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000]   That's great.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   That's really Chatch EPT in a nutshell, actually.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   It's like being able to go on a message board and discuss your own work with people.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   I've read Dan Moran's books from the very, very beginning.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   I think I know what the... I think I know which book tastes place in the Old West.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   Okay? As a matter of fact, he called me to ask about stagecoach roots in the Old West.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   I don't try to pretend that you know more than I...
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   Yeah. So what do we know about this earlier this month,
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   Apple van? It was at Steve Jobs Theatre.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   This came from Bloomberg. Mark Gurman got somebody to tell them all about it.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   It doesn't look like this was really a special event.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   This is a yearly event that just stopped during COVID.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   So it's team back up in today's...
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   In fact, and this week's subject happened to be the AI stuff,
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   which I think is... I think it makes sense for an internal meeting going.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   And part of this is probably keeping employees at the company that are interested in this going,
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   "Hey, there's a lot of public stuff going on at Google and Microsoft and all these other ones.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   We're doing a lot of great stuff too. You know, you want to see what we're doing."
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   I think that might have been part of that retention process.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   I saw a headline or a story that framed this very much as Apple failed to talk about a Tatchit GPT being competitor.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   It's like, "Of course, why would they even be doing this?"
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   Yeah, that's not their venue.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   So it's not something new.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   Apple does have a lot of very good researchers in AI.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   You wouldn't know it talking to Siri, but there's other things Apple does with AI.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   And maybe the app...
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   It's a lot. I mean, machine learning in AI is a huge underpinning of all the stuff in the camera,
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   you know, photos, all of that search proactive stuff.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   I don't know. I think Apple has gone for a much less flashy approach to how it uses machine learning in AI.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   And I think that's probably for the back.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   Smart looking at Google and Microsoft have experienced by rushing their products to the public.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   Well, I think that Google has done an okay job in that every time they've even played before Chat BGP became a thing,
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   they've been highlighting that, "Hey, look, we've got this new model called Lambda.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   We are developing it. We're still experimenting with this.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   Here are some examples of what it could potentially do.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   They released it on a limited basis inside an app.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   It's not as part of any sort of, "Hey, open...
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   Anybody with the web browser can check this out."
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   It's like, "No, if you're allowed into this beta, you can download this app and test out and help strengthen Lambda
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   by having conversations on these limited areas that we've programmed this app to be able to handle."
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   And even as they've been trying to deal with all the bad press, they've been getting about Chat GPT and what's Google doing.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   They've said, "It's not that we can't do that. It's just that the arc is the source of unspeakable power and it has to be researched."
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   And so now you see the wisdom of them saying, "Yes, we have this new thing called BARD.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   The only people like Bing, we too have thousands of people testing it.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   However, they are all Google employees that aren't allowed to share their chats with other people
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   because we know that bad and weird and wonderful things are going to happen.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   And we want people to know about none of it.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   But Apple is exactly right there.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   We see the effects of AI research not necessarily in the, "Oh goodness, you've got this monkey at the other end of it."
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   Or, "Oh, the monkey at the other end of an invisible window that can have conversations with you."
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   But the idea that when you are typing on a keyboard on your iPhone, the fact that it knows that, "Oh, okay, he hit the T a little bit off center when he was writing this word.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   I'm going to learn that actually that's going to influence how I interpret how he tries to type a T in the future."
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   Basically, the fact that you can miss-hit on this virtual keyboard by a really wide margin and it will still figure out,
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   based on how you type certain words, it will be able to sort of predict, "Here's what I think you meant to do."
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   That is where the real meat of artificial intelligence is today and right now.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   We don't have to argue about whether it's stealing content from other people.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   We don't have to think about how this keyboard is going to put other people's industries out of business.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   But it enhances our life each and every day, even though there's no big patriotic flag to wave,
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   "But hey, look, we are the AI leaders right now."
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.000]   Let's see. What else is going on in the wonderful world of Apple?
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   We have a departure from a veteran Apple product marketing exec,
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   a guy who calls himself the co-creator of GarageBand.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   I don't know if that's fair.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   I know people thought he was. This is the examiner.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   The examiner is sorry.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   He was the creator of GarageBand.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000]   I think he was co-creator. Part of that.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   He was integral to, I mean, for the last, I've run into him at most conferences at some point,
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   but really integral to the logic development, garage band development.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   The pro audio apps has really been his-
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   He came from Sonic Foundry.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000]   That was his specialty. It was that kind of stuff.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:26.000]   He was a 21 years at Apple, Director of Product Marketing for the Pro Apps.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   This is actually not something new. He departed in November of last year,
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   but people are just now learning about it. I guess from a LinkedIn profile.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000]   I like that it says this because he's launching a wine business.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   Yeah.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   That's good. You know what? That's great.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   The thing is, if you've been getting stock from Apple for 20 years,
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   those golden handcuffs eventually become golden wings.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000]   You don't really need to be here anymore.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.000]   I think that a lot of times, you do see it after 15 or 20 years.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   If you don't see, you're in that groove.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   I think he's done a really good job. I think logic has come a long way since Apple bought it.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000]   But I think it is a little concerning.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000]   We've seen over the last six months or so,
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   we've seen quite a few people leave the Pro Apps.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:17.000]   It's a little...the number of people leaving is for those of us who use logic
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000]   and Final Cut and motion and other things, little concerning,
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000]   that so many have left. Some of them have been the remote work.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   I know that some of them have been kind of like,
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000]   "I moved out during COVID and I don't want to come back."
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   And so there have been a couple of them that have been...
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   We don't know how many of those, but a lot of them didn't want to keep on going to Cupertino.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   That seemed to be a fair number of folks that have left.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   But also, it's unclear what's going on with the apps.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   Where are they going? How fast are they growing? What's the investment?
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   So I think a lot of people are wondering, "We haven't seen updates for a while."
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   So I think that's also a concern.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   Some people think that it might be that they're getting ready for the...
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000]   As a development tool for the AR/VR initiatives,
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000]   because there's a lot of tools that those things will need for content creation.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000]   And there's a lot of those tools have already been added to motion in Final Cut
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   and to some degree to logic.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000]   And so the question is, if you're in a more traditional round,
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   a more traditional flow, you may not be interested in the next thing.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   And so if that's what they're doing, no one really knows.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   So those are the things that's on the line.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   Well, we'll welcome him to the wine country up here in the Sonoma County.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   There is an old saying up here in Sonoma and Napa
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000]   that the fastest way to become a millionaire is to buy a vineyard and be a billionaire.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000]   And I think he may take that 21 years of Apple stock
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   and be sinking into a fine, fine business.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000]   I actually know quite a few winemakers up here and a lot of them.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   I would say more than half didn't come from a background in winemaking,
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000]   where doctors and lawyers and startup executives,
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000]   and it's always been their dream.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   I hope you have a lot of money to spend.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   That's like the old saying in publishing,
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   and how do you make a small fortune in publishing?
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   Start with a large fortune.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   Yeah, that's the better way to say.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   That's the better.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   As you may know, we've reported on it,
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   the International Trade Commission in ITC in December
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   said that Apple had infringed on a live-course patent.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   A live-course is that electrocardiogram device.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]   It actually works with your iPhone.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   You put your thumbs on it, and it'll tell you if you're an AFib.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   Go to the doctor.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   A live-course sued Apple saying,
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000]   "Hey, we invented that."
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   The ITC agreed the commission's ruling could result in an import ban
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.000]   on Apple Watch unless the Biden administration steps in.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   And that's where Shahra Aranoff steps in.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   Former ITC chair in the Obama administration,
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   she's a lobbyist and now works for Apple
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000]   and has been lobbying hard to keep the Apple Watch shipping.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   According to this story from The Hill,
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.000]   she's been going over to the White House trying to get President Biden
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000]   and his staff to say,
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000]   "No, that Apple Watch is pretty important American economy."
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000]   A live-course CEO said Apple has unlimited resources.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   They're going to go after everyone they can get,
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   and that's what they're doing.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   Now, did he rule?
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   Because this was supposed to happen yesterday.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   Did he rule one way or the other?
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   Do we know?
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   He could veto the ITC ruling
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000]   or let the dispute move forward in court.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   Let me see if there's any new on this.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000]   Yeah, it's supposed to be.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   Actually, it's going to happen sometime this week.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000]   I don't believe it's happened yet today.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000]   According to Reuters,
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:54.000]   Biden will not veto the Watch import ban.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000]   So, all that money.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   Although, as I think John Gruber pointed out,
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000]   the Hill quotes, "9.4 million dollars,"
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   which Gruber worked out to about an hour of its annual profit.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   Yeah, one hour of Apple profit.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   It could throw a lot more money at that.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   You're really wanting to.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000]   Well, I mean, but at some point,
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000]   if you've spent $9.4 million and it didn't work,
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000]   would it work better if you spent $900 million?
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   $100 million? I don't know.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   Probably not.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   Probably not.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000]   A live court said the office,
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000]   the Toyota Reuters, the office of the U.S. Trade Representative
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000]   said that it will not veto the decision.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000]   The ban is on hold, of course,
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000]   while Apple and the live court continue to fight it out in court.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000]   You may remember-
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000]   Yeah, I think it's going to get solved by money.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.000]   Yeah.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000]   Yeah, maybe give some of that money to the live court.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000]   That might solve the problem.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000]   U.S. PTO found a live course patent is invalid, by the way,
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000]   but a live course appealing that as well.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   Apple said today,
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000]   it will appeal the ITC's import ban decision.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   So everybody's appealing.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   Which Apple said, this is going to have a negative effect on public health.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000]   Okay, that's where you're going to go with that, huh?
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000]   All right.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   Interesting.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000]   You're going to kill people.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000]   We talked about this in the-
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.000]   like how every single event they start off with, you know, people who would have been dead
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000]   if it weren't for their iPhone or for their Apple watch,
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   were the implicit message being, you know, nice kid you got there.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000]   Be ashamed if they went off a ditch
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   and they were using an Android watch.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   It wouldn't be.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   So right there.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   There are competing lawsuits being filed in both directions.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   Another patent infringement lawsuit has been filed in the-
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   against Apple and Texas federal court, which is where you file those.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000]   And we'll just watch with interest is this wins.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000]   It's wins its way through the courts, as we say.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.000]   Fortunately, we have some nice new emojis coming that might help us
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   write about stories like this.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   iOS 16, for public beta is out.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000]   Here's from emojipedia.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   A look at some of the new emojis.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000]   That is shaking face.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000]   It is a-
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000]   literally a shaking face.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000]   What does that mean?
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   I'm falling over.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000]   So we talked about this on Sunday and-
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000]   Makes good eye check.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000]   I think I'm thinking of my eyes blurry.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   And far said, it's not for us to decide what it means.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000]   It's for the users to decide what it means.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000]   There's now a blue heart, a gray heart,
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.000]   and a- is that pink, plain pink heart?
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000]   Apparently there was no pink heart before.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.000]   There are hands left and right facing each other.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000]   One suggestion for those hands is they make a really good high five
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000]   if you put the dynamite emoji in between them.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000]   Also a really good talk to the hand.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000]   That's what I thought it was when I first saw it.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000]   It's like talk to the hand.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000]   It's for the clown emoji.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000]   It's for the people.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000]   It's for the people to decide.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000]   I love the proposal if you scroll down a little bit there to the gaps
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   in the colored hearts.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000]   It shows like the like color wheels.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000]   This is like- Oh my God.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000]   This is the issue where we don't have enough hearts in the right colors.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000]   They're grouped in the wrong place.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   This is like- I mean the stuff that comes into basically proposing new emoji
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   is great because the proposals have to be incredibly thorough in detail
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000]   to justify why should we add this?
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   Why does the Unicode Consortium need to add this to the list of emoji?
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.000]   And it's just- it's a delight whenever you watch people argue so seriously about we need
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000]   an emoji that represents the ginger root.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000]   This is killing us all and not have that.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   It really is great because it illustrates two things that I love.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   Number one, how absolutely like RPG rules nitpicky engineers can be.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:58.000]   Where like- remember last year like a conservative press like Fox News is all like,
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   "Oh this is where- oh my goodness.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000]   There's going to be a pregnant man emoji.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   This is where it's gone too far."
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:09.000]   And I was asked to go on like WGN in Chicago to talk about this.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   And I had to explain to them that they're expecting like a discussion about how well-wised
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000]   the acknowledgement of gender being different, the acknowledgement of-
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000]   and I said, "You don't understand.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000]   This is because of a very bureaucratic rule.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000]   Somebody raised their hand a few years ago and said, "Wait a minute.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:33.000]   We created a new rule that says that every emoji representing a person
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000]   has to be genderless.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.000]   The gender is something you add with a modifier after that.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:45.000]   So are we not breaking our own rule by not having a gendered pregnant person emoji?"
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000]   And you can see all the files that were created about this.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000]   The arguments that were made about this tour through and through before it came down to,
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000]   "Okay, we feel as though just simply to maintain- not necessarily because it's progressive,
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000]   but simply to maintain our bureaucracy because we take out one of these little bricks.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000]   The entire thing is going to collapse around us for bureaucratic reasons.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   We will have this going."
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:12.000]   On the flip side of this, there is nothing that makes such- I really think that 500 years now,
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.000]   if sociologists want to understand the evolution of the world human culture,
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:23.000]   a big data bank is going to be the way that emojis have been transformed over the years.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:34.000]   Why is it that the syringe emoji used to be filled with red because it used to indicate
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000]   like drawing blood?
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.000]   Now it's clear because now it's about immunology and immunizing yourself.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   And you can see all these things where there was discussions about how,
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000]   "Well, we need this emoji because in this part of the world,
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:54.000]   there is a culture in which this ginger root is actually very, very important
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000]   and actually part of world culture.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000]   And here are reasons why the gun became a squirt gun.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:06.000]   Here's the reason why exactly- it really is us leaving breadcrumbs in the most unique way
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:14.000]   and subtle way of here is how we are talking about ourselves because emojis are really one of the very,
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:20.000]   very few, maybe even the only successful international language where if I send you a sequence of four emojis,
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000]   it doesn't matter where you're from supposedly, it doesn't matter what your cultural background is,
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.000]   but languages speak natively, you should be able to understand what I said at the other side.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000]   And it's guaranteed that it will be represented accurately on the other end of it.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.000]   So every time there's an update to emojis, I'm all in, all the way up to me elbows.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.000]   I like that that sounds like the plot of a remake of the Manchurian candidate.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000]   And he sent a sequence of four emoji.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000]   And now must kill this senator.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000]   Trigger is a yes.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.000]   So here's some of the new emojis you'll see in 16, four later this spring.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:59.000]   There's a moose, there's a donkey, there's angels wings, there's a crow, there's a duck, there's a jellyfish.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000]   A goose, please. A goose.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000]   A goose. A come now.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000]   Terrible goose. A goose.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000]   It's a goose.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.000]   A hyacinth, ginger, snap peas, a fan, a hair comb.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000]   It's really an Afropic, I think.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000]   Maracas and a wooden flute.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000]   Although just as you say, these things can change.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000]   These are the images from 16, four.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000]   But that's a beta and they change.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:33.000]   In fact, this article from Mojopedia shows how in 2012, the changes between beta 12.1, beta 2,
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:39.000]   and the final 12.1 release of the bagel before no schmir after schmir.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.000]   People were so angry about that bagel and I can't disagree with them.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000]   It really looks dry.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000]   It looks dry, doesn't look good.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:54.000]   I can also understand the anger about the peach emoji in the original beta 2.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000]   It was very, how should we describe that?
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000]   Almost and then it's...
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000]   Botoxical.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000]   Botoxical.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000]   Didn't take long for apple to replace it with something that doesn't look like a peach,
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000]   but at least doesn't look like a butt.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000]   So that's what happens.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.000]   Do you honestly think that with the next stage of our positive evolution being,
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000]   you know what, enough of the A-plant emoji, we're going to give you the real thing in an emoji.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000]   We're also going to give you an actual butt.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000]   Yeah, why not use it?
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000]   That's totally up to you.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000]   Why not put you human anatomy?
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000]   They put a hand.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000]   Why not?
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000]   We just go all the way.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000]   Why are we discriminating?
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000]   We know you're going to pick one anyway.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000]   Why not we just...
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000]   It's a little more whimsical to have an A-plant.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000]   I'll be honest.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:46.000]   I think you're going to run a foul of that thing, the apple system that scans for the C-Sam.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000]   The C-Sam.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000]   They have officially abandoned that C-Sam scanning.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000]   Well, no, but for texting for parental controls.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000]   There is parental control.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000]   There is parental control.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000]   So you might run countries' presentations.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000]   So you might run countries' presentations.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000]   I always...
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000]   It's funny because of all the things we talk about, many of which have great import.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000]   Emojis always get the most attention, people.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000]   Yeah.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000]   That's really...
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]   That's a meat and potatoes issue.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000]   That's what I'm...
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000]   Damn it.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000]   The cheese goes below the patty in the burger.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000]   Not above the patty in the burger.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000]   Really below?
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000]   I demand restitution.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000]   Are you crazy?
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:26.000]   Carkeys is an apple technology that's been around for a while, but nobody...
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000]   No car...
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000]   One BMW model was the only one.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000]   Apple this week launched the new car key test.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000]   The car key test app for iPhone.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.000]   As 9 to 5 Mac says, as adoption lags.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000]   You can get the app.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000]   Good luck getting a car that supports it.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000]   It's really...
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000]   It's for the developers.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000]   It's for the people making...
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000]   Trying to make car keys.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000]   Test your car keys.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000]   I don't...
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000]   Yes.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000]   I don't know that this is gonna change...
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000]   Sure.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000]   ...anything it looks like.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000]   It was probably something that was already being...
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000]   It was.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000]   I'm sure it was just on the app store.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.000]   Makes it easier.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:10.000]   So many people, Apple says, we're asking that we decided just to make it available to
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000]   all of you.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000]   I don't know.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:21.400]   I have a Ford Mustang Mach-E that has, you know, unlock via a Ford app, and it only works
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:22.400]   about half the time.
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.000]   And I gotta tell you, in fact, I was stuck outside...
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000]   Alex's studio.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000]   I didn't tell you this, Alex.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000]   Because my car wouldn't let me in.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.000]   Because I had the app and I was pressing the button and all that stuff.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000]   I got the horn to go off about 12 times a year.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000]   Car alarm going off.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000]   That was me.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000]   I did.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000]   A bunch of times.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000]   I called Lisa.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.000]   I said, I might be stuck in Alex's studio for the next day or so until I can get...
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000]   Finally.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000]   Because I didn't bring the keys.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000]   I had the phone unlock.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000]   Now I bring my keys with me at all times because I don't trust the darn thing.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000]   I'm sure Apple's would work better.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:04.000]   In fact, last time I brought my car into the dealer to get a software update, without bidding,
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000]   they gave me a second key fob.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000]   They only give you one key fob because they said, "Well, you don't need a key fob.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000]   All your phones work as keys."
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000]   No, they don't.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.000]   So I noticed that they're now giving all the owners extra key fobs because they should
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000]   have it in the first place.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000]   That's nice.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000]   I accidentally took my car keys with me when I left the house over the weekend.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000]   And my wife had to go somewhere with the car and say, "Oh, I do have an extra one, but
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000]   it's kind of broken."
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000]   But it turned out to work well enough that she could take the car.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000]   It's called pack.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000]   Phone as a key.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000]   That's what Ford calls it.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.000]   Do not recommend zero out of five stars.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000]   All right.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000]   I think that's everything.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.000]   Was there anything else I missed?
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000]   There's a lot of non-Apple news.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:54.000]   We'll cover that on Twitter on Sunday and Tech News Weekly on Thursday and tomorrow on Twig.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.500]   In fact, tomorrow on Twig, I'm trying to get Kathy Gellis.
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:31:01.000]   She wrote Tech Dirt's Amicus brief for Gonzales versus Google.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.000]   And she's this nice business.
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:06.000]   I'd be very curious what she thinks about the oral arguments today.
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.000]   So I will update you on that, but I'm hoping we can get her on for tomorrow.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:16.000]   I do think it's fun that the sealed Apple One's auction for $64,000.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000]   I forgot that one.
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.400]   Holy cow.
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:23.800]   This makes me, this boy Scott Burns just got to be burned because he bought how many
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:24.800]   original iPhones.
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.400]   He bought a bunch of them.
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:29.800]   If he just put one aside, one aside, it would have.
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:30.800]   Is it brand new?
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:31.800]   Was it in a really good?
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:34.400]   It's like a sealed, sealed in the cellophane like that.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:35.400]   Do they still use something?
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:36.400]   I don't know.
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:37.400]   In the plastic.
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:38.400]   Yeah.
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.800]   It sold for record breaking.
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:43.200]   $63,356.
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:45.200]   Holy cow.
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:50.800]   Close to double what an August auction for another sealed iPhone.
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:54.600]   Which with inflation was about 20 bucks more expensive than what it used to cost when you
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:55.600]   got a new.
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.600]   There you go.
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:03.920]   Karen, Karen Green, she was on the Treasure Hunt Tuesday segment of a TV show called Doctor
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:06.200]   and the Diva a few years ago.
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:11.360]   She brought it with her and they estimated at the time that it was worth about $5,000,
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:15.280]   which is still, you know, 10 times the retail price.
[01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:21.240]   But she ended up getting 100 times retail price, which is pretty good.
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:22.240]   It's amazing.
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:27.440]   Especially for people like in our businesses, because oftentimes, like we get sent something
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:32.200]   for review or something and we move or something or gets lost in the office.
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:34.920]   And then like eight years later, it's like, Oh, geez, here's a hot damn it.
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:36.680]   Here's a useless iPhone one.
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.800]   Like, Hey, I think there are Apple stickers there.
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:40.960]   You tear it apart just to get the stickers and you don't care.
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:43.520]   Then, Oh, I just took $60,000.
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:48.000]   I just took the down payment off a house off of this off of this phone.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:53.320]   It is it does beg her the imagination on how like, especially an iPhone one, which were
[01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:57.240]   kind of rare and they were kind of expensive, particularly at the original like retail at
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:01.920]   that point, that someone bought it and it just stayed in shrink wrap.
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.960]   Whether it's must have been like unsold stock or was it?
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:06.560]   Yeah, you really wonder where it's from.
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:07.960]   For someone you broke up with.
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:08.960]   Yeah.
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:10.920]   The earning bid was $2,500.
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:12.640]   There were 27 total bids.
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:16.680]   The last bid, as you say, $63,000.
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:22.480]   I wonder what the person has spent that much money for it is going to do with it.
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:23.840]   There are people out there.
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:29.600]   When once you have that kind of money where money is no object anymore, like maybe I bet
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:33.600]   that this is someone who has one of every Apple products still in short.
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:39.120]   If they have one of any they completed their Apple collection in mint a long time ago,
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:43.040]   and now the either they stop collecting or every time they have an opportunity to buy
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:48.320]   something that is new in package like old new old stock, they have to have it.
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:54.800]   And all you need is two people as the as the as that so called Leonardo da Vinci.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:01.320]   The portrait of Jesus pointed out, I need are two people who will not be stopped.
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:02.520]   And these things go insane.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:06.560]   I still I still have a copy of through the looking glass like the member of the first
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:13.400]   like Matt game still in shrink wrap in my office somewhere only because I went to some sort
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:18.320]   of clearance sale of going out of business sale computer store in like 1988.
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:21.480]   And they had like a whole box of them, a whole case of them for like a dollar each.
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:23.160]   I just bought five of them.
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:26.680]   And now I'm like, it's just I've never cracked the seal because I already have another one
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:27.680]   that's open.
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:31.960]   And now I'm like, Oh, jeez, can I maybe I wasn't so foolish to like not say for my
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:32.960]   future anyway?
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:36.240]   Maybe I all I need to do was hold on to this one copy of through the looking class.
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:38.080]   I love the $5 now.
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.080]   I love that.
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:44.080]   I'll get that dollar back and then some catalog pros accompanying the iPhone.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:50.120]   We are pleased to present an iconic factory sealed first release iPhone in outstanding
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:51.120]   condition.
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:58.400]   Almost 16 years old, the phone presents magnificently showcasing sharp corners front and back rich
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:01.920]   color and case fresh features.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:08.040]   The labels on the reverse are pristine beneath the seal and shelf where is minimal.
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:13.520]   This is the first original iPhone in acceptable condition to hit the auction block since the
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:20.000]   record breaking sale in October, a truly remarkable piece with great appeal to both
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.800]   collectors and investors alike.
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:26.240]   That's a little hint, by the way, to the other kind of person who might have bought this,
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:31.400]   which is somebody saw it was $39,000 last year, $63,000 this year.
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:33.000]   What it'll be next year.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000]   Let's try.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.600]   That's what that's what auctions do.
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:40.400]   You've the $30,000 auction price hits the hits the press and then you realize that don't
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:45.280]   I have one of those back in somewhere or it's some other guy who opened it up and said it's
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:47.680]   only got eight gigs of a story.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:48.680]   Yeah, aww.
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:53.280]   Good wheel industries, $8.
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:58.160]   And someone bought it just because they know that there's an old timey dock cable attached
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.880]   to it as the cheapest dock, original Apple and dock cable.
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:02.920]   $63,000, but I got the cable, man.
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:04.320]   I got the cable.
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:07.040]   Did it come with a 30 pin cable?
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.520]   Give it a dock.
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:09.520]   In a dock.
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:10.520]   Yeah.
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:15.280]   I got mine around somewhere, but I have mine around, but I don't know if I'm a drinker.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:16.280]   No, it's not.
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:20.480]   Like an idiot, I actually used it as a phone because I couldn't afford to.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:27.080]   But likely used Leo's iPhone original is only slightly scratched in a slight between
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:32.640]   the sleeve that is his own ear wax in the ear cup of noise.
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:39.360]   Provenance from the collection.
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:40.600]   Let's take a little break when we come back.
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:43.680]   I would like to get some pics of the week from all three.
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:52.560]   Dan Morris, great to have you filling in for Jason Snell.
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:55.400]   Perfect, perfect replacement.
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:58.200]   Seven months old, your little guy or gal is.
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:00.000]   Are you having fun?
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000]   Yes.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000]   Tremendous amounts of fun.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.000]   It's a good age.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000]   It's a good age.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000]   Lots of laughs.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000]   Lots of smiles.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.600]   So he's smiling and sitting up.
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:09.000]   He's not walking though.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000]   No, not probably.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000]   He's not even crawling.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000]   He's not even crawling.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.280]   He wants to crawl badly, swims in place on the floor.
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:17.280]   Yeah, that'll happen soon.
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:21.280]   As soon as he figures that last part out, it's going to be batting down the hat to the
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:22.280]   situation over here.
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:26.040]   We used to do, and this is 30 years ago, so times have changed, but we used to do something
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:30.320]   called tummy time, where you put the kid on their tummy and let them do that because
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:31.320]   that's how they get to crawling.
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:33.320]   I brought the guy, I built the muscles.
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:34.320]   It felt cruel.
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:39.360]   It was like, if you put a turtle on its back, it just seemed mean.
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.600]   But Jennifer said, no, no, no.
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:42.600]   And you know what?
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:46.240]   Abby's 30 years old now, and she can still walk, so it's good.
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:47.720]   And crawl too, either, probably.
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:49.760]   So you got to like that at all.
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:56.240]   Actually, after crawling comes scooting, after scooting, it comes pulling things off the
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:57.240]   wall.
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:59.680]   So you're going to really make sure you've got to secure everything.
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:01.760]   Yeah, childproofing now.
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:03.760]   Our show today brought to you by eight sleep.
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:08.280]   Now I have to say, if I had had had an eight sleep when Henry and Abby were little, I
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:10.880]   would have definitely put them in the bed.
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:12.680]   And it'd be all cozy and comfy.
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:14.640]   Would have been a great way to get them to sleep.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:15.640]   But you know what?
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:17.520]   It's a great way to get yourself to sleep.
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:19.240]   Good sleep is everything.
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:22.200]   It's like, it's the ultimate game changer.
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:24.960]   Nature's gentle nurse.
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:29.720]   And if I told you there was a thing you could get that would improve the quality of your
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:34.160]   sleep that would give you a great feeling in the morning when you got up that would
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:38.000]   help you fall asleep faster, that would keep you from waking up in the middle of the night.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.480]   I think you'd pay almost anything for that.
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.880]   Almost $63,000 for that.
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:45.360]   But this is not nearly so expensive.
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:46.760]   It's the eight sleep pod cover.
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:48.640]   They make mattresses or covers.
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:49.640]   We liked our mattress.
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:50.640]   So we got the cover.
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:52.240]   We've had it for about a year now.
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:55.480]   And I tell you what, it is, it is awesome.
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:57.720]   And I sleep so much better.
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:01.560]   If you struggle to fall asleep, if you wake it up in the middle of the night, you know,
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:06.600]   the worst thing waking up all sweaty, just sweating in the middle of night sweats are
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.320]   horrible.
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:10.280]   Eight sleep is the solution.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:12.360]   The cover fits on any mattress.
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:15.000]   You can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:22.080]   It actually senses the room temperature, your temperature, how much you're tossing and turning,
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:27.080]   whether you're wakefulness, your sleep state, whether you're deep sleep or REM sleep or
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:28.680]   light sleep.
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:32.560]   And it features a dual zone temperature control, one for each of you.
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:36.800]   So you and your partner consent, both sides of the bed and it goes down to as low as 55
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:37.800]   degrees.
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:41.800]   That's pretty chilly or as hot as 110 degrees.
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:44.640]   Now in this, you know, in the winter time, it's great to get nice and warm.
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:46.880]   In fact, that's how I said it's nice and cozy.
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:54.960]   But what happens is over time, the auto pilot in the eight sleep observes your movements
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:40:01.000]   and stuff and kind of eases you into a deeper and deeper sleep by slowly cooling down.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000]   That's how the body works.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.400]   It turns out you never wake up with nights.
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:07.560]   What's your always comfortable, but you get more deep sleep.
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:12.000]   I'm I added a half an hour of deep sleep every night when I started using the eight sleep.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:18.240]   That is huge, you know, that is a 50% for me, 50% increase in deep sleep.
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:24.040]   That means reduce risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure, reduced risk of Alzheimer's
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:28.240]   and just waking up in the morning feeling really great.
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:33.520]   In the summer time when it got hot this past summer, turning it down to 55 degrees is you
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:35.920]   get in bed and you go, well, this is like a spa.
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:37.080]   I'm feeling great.
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:41.880]   This is so comfy and it's it automatically adjust as the room temperature changes.
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:45.920]   One of the benefits we don't have to turn on the heat at a heat at night in the winter
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:47.680]   or the air conditioning in the summer.
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:50.560]   I know it's a very hot summer right now in Australia.
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:55.720]   You will love this to cool you off and it improves your sleep.
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:00.080]   Next in class temperature regulation, those sensors also track your health and sleep metrics.
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:03.120]   You don't have to wear any rings or watches or anything like that.
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:06.560]   It just does it automatically better sleep.
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:07.560]   It's a health habit.
[01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:10.520]   You will love sticking to night after night.
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:15.760]   Wake up fully energized with the pod cover so you can tackle whatever life throws at you.
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:21.560]   We love our pod cover and everybody I talk to it gets one says the same thing.
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:24.040]   Mike has got one now and has one now.
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:27.400]   Kevin Rose is the first guy to introduce me to this actually.
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:33.080]   8sleep.com/twit 8sleep.com/twit save $150 a check out on the pod cover.
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:39.640]   8sleep currently ships within the US, Canada, the UK select countries in the EU and yeah,
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:41.280]   you can get in Australia.
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:45.080]   If you're suffering with hot nights get it.
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:51.520]   8sleep.com/twit we thank him so much for supporting the show.
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:55.560]   We bought it before they were a sponsor and we just love it.
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:56.560]   We just love it.
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:58.400]   We've had it for more than a year.
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:41:59.920]   8sleep.com/twit.
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:04.560]   I think it's a good time for your picks of the week.
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:09.560]   I'm just going to mention in passing I don't necessarily recommend this brand or anything.
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:13.200]   But boy, hard drives have gotten cheap.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:17.000]   If you need a hard drive for your time machine or your backup, I wouldn't recommend it as
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000]   running the operating system on it.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:26.520]   But just for backups or time machines, look at this Western digital 4 terabyte for 77 bucks.
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:29.120]   Can you believe me?
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:31.280]   That's great for offsite backups.
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:33.120]   Make up backup and then give it to work.
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:34.120]   I'm in bed.
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:35.120]   Yeah.
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:36.120]   Give it to a friend.
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:39.400]   So if God forbid if you get burgled or if there's a fire, you still have an offsite,
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.000]   a complete offsite backup.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.560]   That's what those little pop those pocket drives they tend to get destroyed really easily.
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.000]   But for I'm going to make this backup that I'm going to just.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000]   Yeah, I don't travel with it.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.440]   Yeah, this one has password protection.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.640]   So I guess if you did, you'd be you would have to worry about it.
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:56.800]   But I just think the idea of having time machine running.
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:01.760]   I actually do have in fact a Seagate with a 4 terabyte Seagate running time machine
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:03.280]   on my studio at home.
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:05.800]   And that's I did mine died.
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:07.600]   Oh, there it is.
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:09.440]   That's what I have backup.
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:13.600]   Yeah, it I've been trying to crack it open to see if I can actually get the drive out
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:15.800]   because it's just not I think it's just totally there.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:17.800]   You're not meant for long heavy duty.
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:20.200]   That's a laptop drive obviously in there.
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:21.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:22.200]   It's good.
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:23.200]   It's good.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:25.200]   There's 77 bucks, I guess.
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:26.200]   Right.
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:28.400]   There's always like the price per gig.
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:30.880]   We get a lot of internal drives that we use to backup things.
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:34.000]   So we just have like a little what we call toasters and we just drop the drive.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000]   Right.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000]   Right.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.160]   And right now the I think that the corner of the hockey stick right now, I think it's
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:42.480]   about 12 terabytes where the cost per gig is really low.
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:46.640]   And then it sky rocks up but like 12 terabytes like 150 bucks or 170 bucks or something like
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:47.640]   that.
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:48.640]   It's amazing.
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:49.640]   Incredible.
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:52.240]   And so you have two of those and then you back them up and that you know, but you can
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:53.480]   put put a lot on them.
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:54.480]   Always the exact.
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:58.120]   It's my Mac LC's 40 megabyte hard drive in 1991.
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:43:59.120]   Can you imagine?
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:01.080]   I mean, look how far we've come.
[01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:02.080]   It's really incredible.
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:03.080]   Yeah.
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:04.080]   This is USB 11.
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:08.320]   It's you would you know, it's slow, but still the price.
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:12.920]   I mean, 77 bucks for four terabytes, get it for your time machine.
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:16.200]   Alex Lindsay, I'm sure has something a little more high tech for us.
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:17.200]   What's your pick of the week?
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.880]   It's high tech, but it's free.
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:19.880]   It's free.
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:22.120]   I got a free free one here for you today.
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:26.360]   We had a great morning here on office hours where we had the guys from Ross come in and
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:27.720]   showed dashboard.
[01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:33.360]   So Ross makes this thing called dash, but Ross makes switchers and and AR tracking and
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:34.520]   lots of other things.
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:36.720]   And they have this this control surface.
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:41.800]   It's kind of like a Crestron except that it's a lot more flexible and a lot less expensive.
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:45.840]   So you can run it on Mac PC, I think Linux or yeah.
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:48.520]   So the but but it isn't there is a Mac version.
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:49.520]   It's cross platform.
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:50.600]   It's free.
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:53.320]   And basically what you can do is build entire interfaces.
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:57.560]   So those interfaces can be you can just decide I want buttons here and I just want to tap
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:01.720]   those those things there and and it will you can have video coming into it.
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:02.720]   You can have.
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:06.800]   So you could say, oh, I want an NDI window right here and it just going to have that window
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:09.800]   there and then you have little buttons below it to cut or to do whatever else you want
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:10.800]   to do.
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:12.440]   And they made it free a long time ago.
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:13.920]   And so they they develop these things.
[01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:14.920]   And so a lot of folks.
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:21.000]   There's a bunch of folks in our group that use the Ross and that's a pretty high level
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.480]   events.
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:25.560]   And so we asked them to come on and there's so that we had a whole hour this morning where
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.040]   they kind of walked us through it.
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:33.000]   So basically it's it's it's you know, it's it basically you can customize it.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000]   You can build it.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.280]   It's TCP, but you can build a parser.
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:41.160]   So you can go to OSC or the specific cameras or to other things there that are that are
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:42.160]   put together there.
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:45.880]   And so it's it's really fascinating.
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:48.160]   You can see the JavaScript.
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:49.160]   It is.
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:50.160]   It's all based on that.
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:52.960]   So if you know how to write that, you can build your own little nodes and other things
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:54.600]   that you want to do.
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:57.200]   And so it's it's very, very flexible.
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:59.000]   It already has a lot of stuff kind of built into it.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.920]   Of course, if you have Ross hardware, it'll just drag and drop, but you can but it can
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:04.920]   be used with many different pieces of.
[01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:09.920]   I think they give that away because you know, I mean, they could they could try to keep
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:11.280]   it lit on it.
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:15.960]   I mean, yeah, but I think it just it makes it it's the interrupt.
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:20.560]   Operability makes it really easy for them that other people might use it and put it together.
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:23.120]   So so it's anyway, it's a really cool.
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:28.200]   We hadn't I hadn't really seen it in detail until this morning and I was super impressed.
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:30.120]   So anyway, but it's available.
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:32.160]   It's cross platform and it's pretty cool.
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:35.600]   And it's pretty and if you go to office hours.global.
[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:37.280]   You can see an hour of a fucking doing.
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:42.000]   See an hour of it from today's show office hours is a great way to learn about all kinds
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:47.200]   of things, a lot of production stuff, but but even I don't know everything else cooking
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:50.080]   and all kinds of crazy stuff.
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:53.520]   It's cooking but with but but with lots of cameras.
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:54.520]   Burnout recovery.
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:56.680]   Yeah, cooking with lots of cameras.
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:47:01.000]   They did a couple of great days on the on the Super Bowl ads and graphics.
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.280]   That was really, really cool.
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:07.680]   And I can't wait to watch this focus on live sports behind the scenes.
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:11.280]   I guess somebody somebody at office runs a truck.
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:12.280]   Yeah, it does.
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:13.280]   Yeah.
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:15.920]   And so we got to see kind of behind the scenes of them actually put it together.
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:19.440]   So yeah, that's really that was right before the Super Bowl.
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:25.480]   Well, office hours.global has the place to go.
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:30.480]   And of course, if you want to hire Mr. Lindsey zero nine zero media, because he'd be the
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:35.760]   best guy to run your next on on internet event.
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:39.000]   Mr Andy and I code W G B H in Boston.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.760]   What do you got for us?
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:45.120]   My pick is an app that I didn't think I needed, but turns out that I did it's duet display,
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:46.520]   which a lot of you have probably heard of.
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:51.800]   It's these this app that's brown for a number of years that lets you use your iPad or even
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:55.560]   your whole Mac as an external display for an existing Mac.
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:59.600]   And so a lot of you are probably thinking, look who's hasn't heard of side cars, a free
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.160]   feature built into the OS.
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:02.160]   Yeah, I know.
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:04.400]   And that's why I didn't think I needed to at display.
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.640]   The problem with me is that side car.
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:10.360]   Oh my goodness, it just it's not reliable enough for me.
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:13.620]   The number of times where I've been like in the middle of a podcast and I've got side
[01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:19.660]   car on my iPad Pro basically to be here is the recording controller for audio hijack,
[01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:20.660]   whatever.
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:23.000]   And I'm talking, talking, talking and suddenly screens go blank.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:28.980]   The iPad goes bounces back into iOS and all those all my windows now rearrange themselves.
[01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:30.980]   And I can't figure out exactly why that happens.
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:36.020]   It doesn't always happen, but it happens enough that I just don't trust it anymore.
[01:48:36.020 --> 01:48:39.500]   So then so I decided to give duet display a try.
[01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:42.740]   And that thing is apps has been absolutely rock solid for me.
[01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:48.020]   It has never once disconnected from the iPad except for when I actually told it to, which
[01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:50.020]   is pretty much the name of the game here.
[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:53.420]   It's also way more flexible in the things that it can do.
[01:48:53.420 --> 01:48:55.620]   It really is attacking.
[01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:56.620]   It's not a feature.
[01:48:56.620 --> 01:49:02.940]   It is an entire solution to I've got this other device with an awesome display on it.
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:07.700]   I want to use that display as a screen rather than having it be in a drawer or someplace.
[01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:09.700]   Can you can you help me do it display?
[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:16.140]   So not only will it not only will it work with my iPad pros display, but it will also work
[01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:21.460]   with my phone display, my Android phone display, Windows machines.
[01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:26.420]   I've gotten old 2012 22 inch iMac.
[01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:29.980]   I can use that, which is basically not good for anything from me at this point, but I can
[01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:32.020]   use that as an external display.
[01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:39.140]   Obviously, if you have a machine that's limited like an M1 MacBook or an M1 Mac mini that can
[01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:44.660]   only use like two displays at once, that will give you a third display for free.
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:49.220]   It works on Macs that where a side card doesn't work.
[01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:51.340]   Duet display works really, really well.
[01:49:51.340 --> 01:49:54.580]   I think optimally on Apple Silicon Macs.
[01:49:54.580 --> 01:50:00.980]   It does work on my ancient 10 year olds Intel Mac mini, but that's slow enough that when
[01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:06.540]   I move the mouse from my main real display port display into the Duet display, there's
[01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:11.540]   enough of a lag that I basically have to take it on faith that I've moved it into the Duet
[01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:15.700]   display and then just sort of be patient for 10 seconds while the mouse pointer sort of
[01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:18.140]   catches up with it and then it's live.
[01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:21.940]   So I wouldn't use it for for a super super old Macs like that.
[01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:26.540]   But the fact is that with this one fee, I can use it on up to three different Macs that
[01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:27.780]   I own.
[01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:32.100]   And we've discussed this a couple of times where the odd thing is that for a lot of
[01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:38.380]   people like me who have an iPad Pro and a bunch of Macs, the iPad Pro has by far the
[01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:43.700]   highest quality display of any computer, active, any screen inside my house.
[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:49.700]   So what I find I've been using because the cheapest annual fee for this doesn't, it doesn't
[01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:52.780]   support Apple Pencil as an input device.
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:56.380]   Only supports it for gestures, you know, like touch, tap, that sort of stuff.
[01:50:56.380 --> 01:51:01.020]   But if you buy it for 35 bucks a year, it will work like a real stylist.
[01:51:01.020 --> 01:51:07.460]   And so when I'm editing photos, I will have on my on my M1 MacBook, I will use the internal
[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:12.340]   display of the M1 MacBook just for palettes and controls.
[01:51:12.340 --> 01:51:16.340]   And I will have the photo like actually in my hands with my Apple Pencil and be able to
[01:51:16.340 --> 01:51:20.620]   edit directly on it with doing dodging and burning and masking.
[01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:23.460]   It really it really delivers value for money, 35 bucks a year.
[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:25.180]   So you can't own it outright.
[01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:30.340]   But I do find that the fact that it is a generalized solution that will give you ideas
[01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:32.100]   for other ways you can use it.
[01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:35.660]   Like I don't know the next time I'm going to be traveling, I will have to do like a live
[01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:38.700]   stream or video chat, like in a hotel room.
[01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:43.180]   But I'm already looking forward to the idea of wouldn't it be interesting to, I've always
[01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:48.100]   had this idea of instead of having the chat window as a window that sort of pinned to
[01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:53.100]   the top of my screen and set to always be on top.
[01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:58.460]   What if I had like my tiny little phone screen and then I had the, I basically had like the
[01:51:58.460 --> 01:52:00.300]   my webcam on top of that.
[01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:04.300]   And so basically I have this as a full screen window just for the chat.
[01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:07.340]   So there's only the only thing that's inside here is the people that I'm talking to.
[01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:10.580]   And I have the full real estate of my MacBook for other things.
[01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:11.860]   I can easily play with that.
[01:52:11.860 --> 01:52:12.860]   I can easily do that.
[01:52:12.860 --> 01:52:14.060]   It's a generalized solution.
[01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:15.740]   So it delivers a lot of value for money.
[01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:16.820]   I'm very happy with it.
[01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:19.580]   I've been using it for a few weeks now.
[01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:25.660]   And that means that the one thing that is kind of holding me back with my M1 powered MacBook
[01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:28.660]   here is that I really do like to have multiple displays.
[01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:32.060]   It's how like I really am in a day long focus mode.
[01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:37.020]   And with this plus with the external display, I've got plugged into it.
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:43.380]   So that's two displays, then technically a third display because I've got, what's the
[01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:46.940]   it's not sidecar, but the other feature that they have where you can basically use the
[01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:50.020]   keyboard and mouse on your Mac on your console.
[01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:51.020]   Thank you very much.
[01:52:51.020 --> 01:52:53.220]   That's that's that's display number three.
[01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:57.620]   And then I can have my iMac as display number four, if I do go at display, this one thing
[01:52:57.620 --> 01:53:00.580]   that can basically only handle one external display.
[01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:07.120]   It could give me my wall of sound, my NORAD at the end of the War Games movie sort of
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:09.780]   workspace, which is making me very, very happy.
[01:53:09.780 --> 01:53:10.940]   35 bucks a year.
[01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:12.460]   I recommend it pretty highly.
[01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:14.180]   Very nice.
[01:53:14.180 --> 01:53:15.180]   Very nice.
[01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:16.180]   Mr. Dan.
[01:53:16.180 --> 01:53:20.580]   Oh, by the way, Andy, when are you going to be in WGBH next?
[01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:24.060]   I'm going to be on actually tomorrow Thursday at 1230.
[01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:29.220]   I'm going to be in studio, not at tomorrow or Thursday, which I'm sorry, Thursday, Thursday.
[01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:30.220]   I'm sorry.
[01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:33.620]   My, my, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in independent worker mode.
[01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:40.940]   I guess Thursday, Thursday at 1230, go to WGBH news.org to listen to it live or later.
[01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:42.660]   It was confused.
[01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:44.860]   Dan Moran, thank you so much for being here.
[01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:46.300]   We really appreciate it.
[01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:48.340]   You have a pick of the week.
[01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:49.340]   I do.
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:52.820]   You mentioned sleeping and things that help you sleep earlier and I have a seven month
[01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:53.820]   old.
[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:57.020]   So let me talk about a thing that helps multiple people in my house sleep.
[01:53:57.020 --> 01:53:59.780]   It's called the Hatch Rest.
[01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:02.940]   It is a sound machine, but it's a smart sound machine.
[01:54:02.940 --> 01:54:05.860]   Of course, this is what our sound machines need.
[01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:07.620]   This, we have this in my kids room.
[01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:14.180]   It is a combination night light and white noise machine, but it has a bunch of extra
[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:18.940]   light cool features so you can use a variety of different sounds that are built in and
[01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:21.580]   it's a total light changing night lights.
[01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:24.100]   You can set it to any color basically.
[01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:25.980]   There's an app that you use for control.
[01:54:25.980 --> 01:54:27.180]   The version I have is Bluetooth.
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:32.420]   I gather there is a second generation model that now is over Wi-Fi, but you can preset
[01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:37.700]   different things to like a certain color light or a certain setting of our volume of
[01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:38.700]   sound.
[01:54:38.700 --> 01:54:42.220]   So for example, when our kids go in to sleep, we have like a very low red light that has
[01:54:42.220 --> 01:54:46.620]   white noise on, so if we need to go in, we can do it without losing our dark vision.
[01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:50.820]   And then we get them up in the morning and place like some birds chirping has nice
[01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:52.380]   try like yellow light.
[01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:54.220]   There's a light for naps, all this stuff.
[01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:58.340]   And we haven't quite gotten to this point yet, but it also lets you program a schedule
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:03.300]   in so that it automatically shifts to certain presets at certain times of day.
[01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:06.580]   So you can have that great feature that I know a lot of my friends with older kids
[01:55:06.580 --> 01:55:11.540]   have where it's like, it's red when you can't get up yet and it turns green when it's like,
[01:55:11.540 --> 01:55:14.940]   okay, you can leave your room now, red light green light.
[01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:18.500]   You really need that because I'm looking forward to that as an opportunity to be like,
[01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:20.060]   please let us sleep.
[01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:21.060]   So it's helped.
[01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:23.540]   I think is really genuinely helped our kids sleep better.
[01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:27.860]   And when our kids sleep better, we sleep better, which is the best part of all because
[01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:32.060]   then less burned out when it comes to do the fun things.
[01:55:32.060 --> 01:55:34.300]   So I really dig this thing.
[01:55:34.300 --> 01:55:37.460]   You got such great technology now.
[01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:38.460]   I tell you.
[01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:39.460]   I tell you.
[01:55:39.460 --> 01:55:40.660]   It used to be in your day.
[01:55:40.660 --> 01:55:45.700]   You just had to stand over the crib going, I did for like eight hours and as that's rough.
[01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:47.700]   I got my baby.
[01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:48.860]   Oh my God.
[01:55:48.860 --> 01:55:50.860]   Oh my God.
[01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:52.620]   Yeah, this looks cool.
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:56.260]   70 bucks for rest or the new rest to.
[01:55:56.260 --> 01:55:59.380]   And there's adult versions as well from hatch dot.
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:00.380]   Yeah.
[01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:02.300]   So I like sleeping with a little white noise myself.
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:05.300]   I don't want these to just run a fan, but you know, now I'm envious.
[01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:08.740]   My kids got better tech than me, which is, I think just getting me ready.
[01:56:08.740 --> 01:56:10.780]   It's always going to be the case, right?
[01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:17.700]   There's a building in town that is a big building filled with two kinds of tenants,
[01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:22.660]   half of them are psychotherapists and half of them are massage therapists.
[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:27.220]   Every single one of them has a white noise machine outside the door.
[01:56:27.220 --> 01:56:33.100]   So the whole building is so weird as to walk in, you fall right asleep.
[01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:35.220]   It is so strange.
[01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:37.940]   I sometimes go in there just to soothe myself.
[01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:38.940]   Yeah.
[01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:39.940]   Very, very.
[01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:42.340]   Dan, I really appreciate you taking the time with us.
[01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:50.700]   Dan's books are out, as he said, published by Angry Robot, the Galactic Cold War series.
[01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:53.620]   Is it concludes with the bear and agenda or you got more?
[01:56:53.620 --> 01:56:55.180]   Well, that's the first one actually.
[01:56:55.180 --> 01:56:58.260]   I've got this is the nov incidence, the most recent.
[01:56:58.260 --> 01:56:59.260]   Yes.
[01:56:59.260 --> 01:57:01.300]   I was tipped to told to bring my copy.
[01:57:01.300 --> 01:57:02.460]   Yeah, that's the most recent.
[01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:03.620]   Not concluded.
[01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:05.660]   Not concluded yet.
[01:57:05.660 --> 01:57:06.660]   There may be more to come.
[01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:07.660]   I don't have anything.
[01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:10.020]   I can't confirm anything, but it might be more to come.
[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:12.580]   So keep reading behind the books.
[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:13.580]   Yeah.
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:16.300]   The more people buy them, the easier it is for you to sell the publisher and more.
[01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:17.660]   So that's the best part.
[01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:18.660]   Start with the bear and agenda.
[01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:19.660]   I'm with the first two.
[01:57:19.660 --> 01:57:20.660]   I haven't read the third one yet.
[01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:22.660]   And read the Allen and Save your President.
[01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:23.660]   You just haven't got to run.
[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:24.660]   Yep.
[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:25.660]   And then the nova incident.
[01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:27.500]   If you had thought ahead, you would have put these in alphabetical order.
[01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:28.700]   But okay, no problem.
[01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:31.300]   I know people get so critical about this.
[01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:32.740]   That's fine.
[01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:33.740]   Whatever.
[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:36.420]   Thanks, Dan.
[01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:37.420]   So great to have you on.
[01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:38.420]   I appreciate it.
[01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:40.620]   Sixcolors.com and Macworld Magazine.
[01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:42.420]   Of course, the incomparable.
[01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:45.380]   You saw that Zeppelin floating behind him.
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:51.100]   His Mastodon instance is Zeppelin.flights at Demorren Zeppelin.flights.
[01:57:51.100 --> 01:57:54.420]   I am so jealous that Jason got Zeppelin.
[01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:55.420]   Flights.
[01:57:55.420 --> 01:57:59.380]   There was not weirdly a lot of clamoring for it, but he was on top of it.
[01:57:59.380 --> 01:58:00.380]   No, he got it.
[01:58:00.380 --> 01:58:01.380]   He was in there.
[01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:05.860]   In fact, I think it stimulated a fairly long conversation on Mac break or maybe it was
[01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:11.660]   on Twit about Zeppelins and dirigibles and fixed rigid thing balloons.
[01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:12.660]   Which is airships.
[01:58:12.660 --> 01:58:13.660]   Airships.
[01:58:13.660 --> 01:58:19.740]   And I got somebody joined our forums who is the pilot of the Goodyear blimp.
[01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:22.580]   And I said, because he said, he was talking about what we said.
[01:58:22.580 --> 01:58:24.860]   And he said, yeah, I know a little bit about this because I fly him.
[01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:26.420]   I said, you do that for a day job.
[01:58:26.420 --> 01:58:28.380]   He said, yeah, for a little company go, good year.
[01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:29.740]   You might have heard it.
[01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:35.100]   And I said, if you're ever in town, raising my hand.
[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:36.100]   And you know what?
[01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:42.140]   Since since the Jason's in the same area, if I get to go, we'll bring Jason and then Zeppelin.flights
[01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:43.140]   will take flight.
[01:58:43.140 --> 01:58:46.420]   Oh, Andy and I need to find the hood blimp guys.
[01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:48.580]   There's still a hood blimp still around here.
[01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:49.580]   H.P.
[01:58:49.580 --> 01:58:50.580]   Hood.
[01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:51.580]   The dairy company.
[01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:52.580]   The dairy company.
[01:58:52.580 --> 01:58:53.580]   Yeah.
[01:58:53.580 --> 01:58:56.260]   Every time every time I'm in town, I know that there's a Red Sox game.
[01:58:56.260 --> 01:59:01.020]   If I see the hood blimp like over camera square, you know, it turns out there's quite a few
[01:59:01.020 --> 01:59:03.020]   jobs out there piloting blimps.
[01:59:03.020 --> 01:59:04.020]   There it is.
[01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:06.100]   We knew the hood blimp.
[01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:08.100]   It's in slash, slash, slash, bastin.
[01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:10.940]   Just be careful of any aircraft fire.
[01:59:10.940 --> 01:59:11.940]   Things are tense right now.
[01:59:11.940 --> 01:59:12.940]   Yeah, right.
[01:59:12.940 --> 01:59:13.940]   It's weird.
[01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:14.940]   I'm not.
[01:59:14.940 --> 01:59:18.980]   Oh, whoa, do not drive a blimp these days.
[01:59:18.980 --> 01:59:26.220]   Hey, everybody, it's Leo LaPorte, the founder and host of many of the Twitch podcasts.
[01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:31.060]   I don't normally talk to you about advertising, but I want to take a moment to do that right
[01:59:31.060 --> 01:59:32.760]   now.
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:37.760]   Our mission statement at Twitch, we're dedicated to building a highly engaged community of tech
[01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:39.560]   enthusiasts.
[01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:44.380]   That's our audience and you, I guess, since you're listening by offering them the knowledge
[01:59:44.380 --> 01:59:48.720]   they need to understand and use technology in today's world.
[01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:54.300]   To do that, we also create partnerships with trusted brands and make important introductions
[01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:55.740]   between them and our audience.
[01:59:55.740 --> 02:00:00.600]   That's how we finance our podcasts, but it's also and our audience tells us this all the
[02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:01.600]   time.
[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:07.140]   Part of the service we offer, it's a valued bit of information for our audience members.
[02:00:07.140 --> 02:00:11.220]   They want to know about great brands like yours.
[02:00:11.220 --> 02:00:17.100]   So can we help you by introducing you to our highly qualified audience?
[02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:22.100]   And why do you get a lot with advertising on the Twitch podcasts?
[02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:25.700]   Partnering with Twitch means you're going to get, if I may say so, humbly the gold standard
[02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:27.740]   and podcast advertising.
[02:00:27.740 --> 02:00:32.960]   And we throw in a lot of valuable services, you get a full service continuity team supporting
[02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:35.240]   everything from copywriting to graphic design.
[02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:39.800]   I don't think anybody else does this or does this as well as we do.
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:43.320]   You get ads that are embedded in our content that are unique every time.
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:45.400]   I read them, our hosts read them.
[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:47.920]   We always over deliver on impressions.
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:51.920]   And frankly, we're here to talk about your product.
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:57.280]   So we really give our listeners a great introduction to what you offer.
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:02.540]   We've got onboarding services, ad tech with pod sites that's free for direct clients.
[02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:06.400]   We give you a lot of reporting so you know who saw your advertisement.
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:09.840]   You'll even know how many responded by going to your website.
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:14.680]   We'll also give you courtesy commercials that you can share across social media and landing
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:15.680]   pages.
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:17.320]   We think these are really valuable.
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:23.120]   People like me and our other hosts talking about your products sincerely and informationally.
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:24.880]   Those are incredibly valuable.
[02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:28.720]   We also get other free goodies, mentions in our weekly newsletter that's sent out to thousands
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:29.760]   of fans.
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:34.680]   We give bonus ads to people who buy a significant amount of advertising.
[02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:37.000]   You'll get social media promotion too.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:40.840]   But let me tell you, we are looking for an advertising partner that's going to be with
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:42.360]   this long term.
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:44.480]   Visit twitter.tv/advertise.
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:46.240]   Check out our partner testimonials.
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:48.880]   Tim Broome, founder of ITProTV.
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:57.400]   They started ITProTV in 2013, immediately started advertising with us and grew that company
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:00.040]   to a really amazing success.
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:03.320]   Hundreds of thousands of ongoing customers.
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:07.600]   They've been on our network for more than 10 years and they say, and I'll quote Tim,
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:09.960]   we would not be where we are today without the Twit Network.
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:11.400]   That's just one example.
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:14.240]   Mark McCurry, who's the CEO of Authentic.
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:18.240]   He was actually one of the first people to buy ads on our network.
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:20.560]   He's been with us for 16 years.
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:25.600]   He said, and I'm quoting, "The feedback from many advertisers over those 16 years across
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:31.840]   a range of product categories is that if ads and podcasts are going to work for a brand,
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:33.200]   they're going to work on Twit shows.
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:40.120]   I'm proud to say that the ads we do overdeliver, they work really well because they're honest,
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:41.360]   they have integrity.
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:44.960]   Our audience trusts us and we say, this is a great product.
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:45.960]   They believe it.
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:47.080]   They listen.
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:48.880]   Their listeners are highly intelligent.
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:50.120]   They're heavily engaged.
[02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:51.520]   They're tech savvy.
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:53.400]   They're dedicated to our network.
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:58.560]   That's partly because we only work with high integrity partners that we have thoroughly
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:00.800]   and personally vetted.
[02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:04.720]   I approve every single advertiser on the network.
[02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:08.240]   If you're ready to elevate your brand and you've got a great product, I want you to
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:10.160]   reach out to us.
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:12.720]   Advertise@twit.tv.
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:20.080]   I want you to break out of the advertising norm, grow your brand with host red authentic ads
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:21.080]   on Twit.tv.
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:27.840]   Visit Twit.tv/Advertise for more details or email us, advertise@twit.tv if you're ready
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:29.840]   to launch your campaign now.
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:31.000]   All right.
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:32.000]   Thank you, Andy and Akka.
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.000]   We'll look for you on Thursday on WG, B.H.
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:36.000]   at Boston.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.760]   Mr. Alex Lindsey will see you at officehours.global.
[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:42.160]   We'll see all of you right back here.
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:47.600]   Tuesdays, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern, 1900 UTC for Mac Break Weekly.
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:49.640]   If you can't make the live show, don't worry.
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:55.080]   You can always download a copy from our website, Twit.tv/MBW.
[02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:56.440]   You can also watch on YouTube.
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:59.560]   There's a Mac Break Weekly channel there or just, you know, I think the best thing to
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:03.960]   do is subscribe using a podcast client, you know, pocket casts overcast.
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:08.600]   Oh, speaking overcast, I just remembered who's going to be on next week.
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:11.600]   Oh, never mind.
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:15.080]   Yeah, Marco Hormat joins us next week.
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:17.920]   That'll be a lot of fun.
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:21.600]   So get Marco's app, download overcast and then subscribe.
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:24.120]   And that way you'll get it the minute it's available.
[02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:28.160]   In my defense, he's very much the lyser of Mac development.
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:29.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:30.160]   Lyser.
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:32.080]   Anybody's ever said that before?
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:34.120]   I don't know what that means.
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:36.280]   Oh, if Blyser Manelli.
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:38.280]   Oh, oh, okay.
[02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:44.000]   Nowadays with all the AI, if you say ELISA, that's different, right?
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.000]   We don't mean that.
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000]   All right.
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.480]   What do you mean when you say Lyser with the Z?
[02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:53.840]   Oh, there's the Goodyear blimp flying somewhere on Twitter, apparently.
[02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:58.680]   Actually, the Goodyear blimp's tweet says, "Don't shoot."
[02:04:58.680 --> 02:04:59.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:00.880]   Okay.
[02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:02.880]   What else?
[02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:08.160]   Oh, I was going to mention if you are a member of Club Twit, you get a very special
[02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:11.160]   edition of this show, ad-free.
[02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:14.440]   You also get ad-free versions of all of our shows.
[02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:17.560]   You also get Michael Sargent's Hands-On Macintosh.
[02:05:17.560 --> 02:05:20.640]   That's a club only exclusive right now.
[02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:21.920]   That's where we launch new shows.
[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:27.400]   We also have Hands-On Windows with Paul Therat and the untitled Linux show and SACY's book
[02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:30.600]   club and a lot more special events in there.
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:32.240]   That Discord is really fun too.
[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:37.440]   You'll get access to the Club Twit Discord plus the Twit Plus feed with content.
[02:05:37.440 --> 02:05:42.520]   You don't get anywhere else, including conversations before and after shows, things like that.
[02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:43.800]   We invite you to join the club.
[02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:47.040]   It's merely seven bucks a month, $84 a year.
[02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:48.040]   There's also a corporate membership.
[02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:53.440]   In fact, we just got a new corporate member and I want to welcome them to the club.
[02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:54.440]   It's great to have you.
[02:05:54.440 --> 02:06:00.520]   Twit.tv/clubtwit if you want to join in the fun.
[02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:04.880]   I know a lot of people join just to get the ad-free versions of the shows or just to support
[02:06:04.880 --> 02:06:06.440]   us.
[02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:09.520]   But I have to say, if you haven't tried the Discord, get on in there because there's a
[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:10.920]   lot of great stuff.
[02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:15.760]   A lot of great animated gifts going on.
[02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:17.120]   Thanks everybody for joining us.
[02:06:17.120 --> 02:06:20.600]   Get back to work though because break time is over.
[02:06:20.600 --> 02:06:22.600]   We'll see you next time with Marco Armin.
[02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:23.600]   Bye bye.
[02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:27.720]   Hey, I know you're super busy, so I won't keep you long, but I wanted to tell you about
[02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:32.200]   a show here on the Twit Network called Tech News Weekly.
[02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:33.880]   You are a busy person.
[02:06:33.880 --> 02:06:39.160]   And during your week, you may want to learn about all the tech news that's fit to, well,
[02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:41.640]   say, not print here on Twit.
[02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:45.960]   It's Tech News Weekly, me, my cusargent, my co-host Jason Howell.
[02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:51.720]   We talk to and about the people making and breaking the tech news and we love the opportunity
[02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:56.920]   to get to share those stories with you and let the people who wrote them or broke them
[02:06:56.920 --> 02:06:58.320]   share them as well.
[02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:01.400]   So I hope you check it out every Thursday right here on Twit.
[02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:11.400]   [MUSIC]
