[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.960]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover all your Apple stuff.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.000]   And kind of a dearth of stories this week, so it's going to be rumor central.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.240]   And you'll apol, I'll warn you up upfront. There might be a little bit of mention of something
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.080]   of other products from other companies. I hope you can handle that. Andy Inaco is here. He might
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.240]   talk about comic books. I can't promise he won't. I said to Chicago Sun times, back from Boulder.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.760]   Back from Boulder where I was, I don't want to say I was disappointed that I didn't see
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.480]   quite so many people quite as high as I expected them to be. But if this is the difference between
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.040]   like a state in which marijuana could be simply bought by anybody who's an adult and not,
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.080]   is it just that everybody in Massachusetts is high all the time and I haven't noticed it?
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.880]   I really was looking forward to like you're walking down the street and saying,
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.680]   walking into a store and saying, okay, I can buy tic-tacs, people magazine, last week's
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.040]   Cosmo, a zag nut bar and some pot. Purple Kush, please. I don't partake, but I was looking for
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.280]   to that sort of dissonance. Like, wait a minute, this is supposed to be very, very illegal and
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.360]   I'm supposed to be putting myself in danger somehow, but legally by buying this. Did you
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.800]   worry? Were there were they selling because it is legal in Boulder? So were they selling it in the
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.920]   stores? No, not that I was able to see, but then again, I wasn't off campus all that much. But
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.520]   like driving around, I was expecting I didn't I guess I didn't know what I was expecting to see.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.400]   Henry told me it hasn't changed my head. My son is a student, of course, at Colorado,
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.480]   University of Colorado, Boulder, where Andy just was for the Council of World Affairs.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.600]   And he told me, oh, no, you can't it's not yet. It's not like to the point where you still have
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.720]   to go to the dispensaries and stuff. Yeah, and I was told by a couple of locals that
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.400]   not a whole lot has changed because everybody still knows somebody who has a
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.800]   grow in the basement and it's a lot cheaper to buy from your usual source. So why not buy
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.240]   from the usual source? This is an unexpected consequence of legalization in marijuana.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.360]   Anyway, how did before we talk more about Council of World Affairs, let's say welcome
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.120]   Renee Richie also from imore.com. Hello, Renee. Good to see you.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.400]   Goodly. Oh, I don't want to get in the way of Andy's pot talks. I'll just say.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:04.320]   Is pot is pot legal in Montreal? It feels like it should be. I know sex is legal there.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.320]   Everything is legal. You're starting at the age of 18, Liam. Yeah, as long as you're of age,
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.960]   you could do anything you damn well, please. It's just a very French outlook on life.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.080]   Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. And you know, I don't, Henry said it's nothing's changed.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:28.000]   People still mostly get down. Alcohol is still the preferred. It'll get to the finish line
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.240]   only without quite so much of a stink. Yeah. So you had fun at the Council on World Affairs.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.960]   What is the Council on World Affairs? You go every year, I know. And you've talked about it.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.000]   Yeah, basically it's for every year for the past like 40 years, the University of Colorado gets
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.640]   together about 100 people from all kinds of disciplines and to talk about panels about
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.280]   something like 20 a day that are open to the public on every issue you can imagine. So I'm
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.920]   part of the science of technology track. So they usually put me on things like, you know,
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.720]   on things like, you know, web web 3.0 and things about what Snowden was up to, the maker movement.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.040]   Although it's a really diverse group. I was on a panel about comics with G.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.680]   Willa Wilson, who created that really great Ms. Marvel comic and a couple other guys.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:25.520]   I was on a panel on lying with John Roderick and a couple others I shared.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.200]   But what I love about this conference is that it really is like the X Games,
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.200]   Half Pipes, Norberting competition only intellectually speaking, where I just,
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.560]   you just have to, you can't really prepare a 12 minute talk about each of these topics.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.760]   What you do is you create them, you know that I'm going to start at this point.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.960]   I'm going to end at this point. I'm going to try to do these three things in there.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.000]   And at any point I could land on my head and basically,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.040]   basically humiliate myself in a really terrible way. But the people that you meet there,
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.960]   like I have some of my best friends. I've met at this conference over the past 10 or 15 years.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.240]   And I mean, even on the, even on the ride back to the airport being driven in a mini van by a
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.760]   student, sharing a van with somebody who was a assistant director of science,
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.160]   communications at NASA Goddard. And she's telling me things about pulsars that kind of
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.560]   freaked me out a little bit because I didn't know that, oh, there, but how can they be generating
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.960]   more mass within themselves if they're doing this? And so I wound up having to furiously
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.720]   like download stuff onto my iPad so I could read it on the plane. So there, a week doesn't go by
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.760]   where I don't feel like I've learned something really, really cool, met some cool people and
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.720]   realized exactly how inadequate my own Kirkland V-TIE is.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.400]   But what fun, huh? It's a lot of fun. It's cool.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.520]   The fact that you pay your own way to go there and so many of these speakers keep coming back
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.840]   year after year just shows you what a cool event it is.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:54.560]   Yeah. Well, we're glad to have you back. And glad you had a good time. Thank goodness,
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.600]   Sir Johnny Ive is kept busy because if it weren't for him, I don't know if we'd have any Apple news
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.080]   at all. We're kind of, what is it going on Renee? We're waiting for the other shoot a drop, I guess,
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.120]   with WWDC. Yeah, I mean, we'll be the first chance we see the new song.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.320]   Forget, did you launch Chrome again? No, I did nothing.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.920]   Wow. But it only happened when you start talking. It wasn't like in the middle. Yeah,
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.600]   maybe if you, it's Skype is saying something. It's like Renee usually has so much intelligent
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.120]   things to say. The best thing is for him to simply keep saying those intelligent things.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.840]   It will enhance the show and we'll also keep the static off the channel.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.040]   Begin each statement with.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:37.040]   Is it really broken again? No, it's fine. Oh, down. That's fine.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.080]   It just it's it's like what I it's something about like, this is my guess.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.720]   And I'm not going to edit this out so everybody heard what happened.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.080]   My theory is that if we don't talk to you and nothing happens with you,
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.000]   Skype does something and like goes to sleep and then it wakes up again.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.280]   And then in that wake up period, there's some junk. Anyway, why is it?
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:06.000]   Apple Apple, it seemed to me that in years past, and this is our eighth year of doing this show.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.920]   We've never had this period of just there's nothing really to talk about.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.640]   It's a combination of things. One is they've gone on these yearly cycles. So it takes a year
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.320]   roughly, sometimes a little bit quicker, sometimes a little bit longer, but roughly a year to get to
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:24.560]   a new version of OS 10 and iOS. And because they do that every June at WWDC, we have to
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.840]   wait again, again, every June for another WWDC to see new software. And because they really are
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.200]   pushing hardware as fast as they can go, it takes them a while to get those devices to market.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.760]   Like they were trying to get the iPads out on time. The iPad mini shipped, you know,
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.760]   the last possible second it should have shipped to still be out. And they're just they're just
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.760]   running out of time on making these products because a yearly cycle again. And I think we're
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.600]   going to keep seeing that it's going to take them until they absolutely have to get the product out
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:58.240]   before we see it. I'm still hoping that they'll do a Mac mini at some point soon. But that's not
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.280]   the kind of thing you'd announce at a WWDC. Maybe I mean, because it's for a lot of developers
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.280]   use them. Yeah, they just slot them into their existing developments. Wasn't that the pitch?
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.960]   That was the pitch on the Mac mini. You're a piece. Remember that? You're a PC developer.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.000]   You've already got everything you need. Just put a Mac mini on top of your tower,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.080]   switch the cables and now you're good. I remember that. And I know so many developers who've done
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.040]   just that they were PC developers. Maybe they were palm OS developers and they just bought a Mac mini
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.200]   plug to bring your own keyboard monitor and mouse and they're good to go. Yeah. And every
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.840]   time I open the door to someone's a network closet, and almost any kind of office, I will see like
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.880]   these really expensive, really complicated like blade servers like the size of phone booths. But
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:44.720]   somewhere there's always a Mac mini that's that's in there somewhere not necessarily running services
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.600]   but running all the admin stuff. So that because none of these people none of these admins would
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.640]   like to administrate all this stuff with the tools that that a non Mac will give them.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.840]   We have them. How many Mac minis do we have in our exactly in our server closet downstairs?
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.920]   Tons of them. If you you know, chat omatic or our chat room is running on a Mac mini constantly.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.880]   Our router is running on a Mac mini constantly for the video switch video hub.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:16.240]   They're great little devices. So, minutes are killer. I mean, I've been looking at
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.640]   NAS devices with the night towards finding one that's easy enough to set up and use
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:27.040]   and and and and administrate to actually recommend it to people. And I I'm not quite at the point
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.440]   where I'm willing to say, okay, forget about it just buy a Mac mini. But man, when I compare the
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.400]   steps that I have to go through to keep a NAS running and also to make sure that I understand
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.920]   exactly everything that it's supposed to be doing on the network versus the same tools that are
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:46.240]   probably that are usually free on a Mac mini and the cost of an as versus versus a Mac mini. I keep
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.760]   thinking, Yikes, should this really just be talking about? I don't care if you're a Windows
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.000]   person. I don't care if you're a Mac person or or or any other operating system. This is some of
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.040]   the cheapest money you can buy in terms of having just one box on your network that doesn't never
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:04.080]   has a monitor connected to it, but can deliver so many services to all your devices. And you don't
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.400]   even need to run Apple's OS 10 server, although you can get it with server. Right. But even if
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:13.600]   like for for people who have just like an iPad mini, once you have like one device on the network
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.320]   that you can connect to and share screens with, suddenly you have an iPad that's Mac
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.240]   compatible that runs all your Mac software, because now you have a like you have screens
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.680]   connector, some other like really good screens sharing software for iOS. And now really, who needs
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:33.280]   to get office for iOS, who needs to get wait for a scrivener for for iOS, because you can run it
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.840]   very, very well from this thing. There's so it doesn't it doesn't it might seem counterintuitive
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.560]   to buy a computer for the sole purpose of never never actually sitting in front of it and doing
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.120]   anything with it. But once I think after like six, seven or eight months of incrementally keeping
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.640]   adding more services like a Plex server, more file servers and print servers and application
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.360]   servers, by the time you get this thing finished with these single click installations,
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.240]   wow, you've got you've just so totally crushed everything that you'd like to do and made a really
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.560]   modern worldwide domination sort of global computing grid for yourself.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:12.160]   It's been a long time. I love Mac rumors buying guide, because what they do is they keep track of
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:18.880]   not only rumors, but how long since an update 539 days since an update. That's almost two years.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:25.440]   Although it is not, I know the longest time since update, the March 2009 Mac mini release
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:33.120]   ended at 574 day drought. But it's coming close. The average is 381 days between releases.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:40.960]   Rumors abound, but none of them have come true. One of them from January said end of February.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:47.280]   Well, we're past that. It is certainly overdue. And Mac rumors are saying don't buy updates soon,
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:56.720]   but when? But when? Sometime. Sometime. The Haswell chips would make a lot of sense in a Mac
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.760]   mini, not because of battery life, but just because of lower power, lower heat and faster.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:07.600]   And not only the internals, but Apple is really becoming a much more design focused
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:12.000]   company than it ever was. And for Apple, that's really saying something. They love to have products
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.440]   that just really look great. And I think that right now the Mac mini is the only really boring
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.760]   product that they have. Now that they've totally reinvented the Mac Pro, this is the only thing
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.320]   that's essentially a rounded rectangle, you know, quick draw 1.0 sort of CAD design tool,
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:31.760]   has nothing really cool or interesting about it. It's just designed to be efficient and interesting.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:37.760]   And so I really think of this is this design is just green and glowing as a target for Johnny
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:43.280]   Ivan, his team to say, let's do something that is a radical redesign. Let's not even assume that
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.440]   people who buy this even want necessarily an internal mechanical hard drive. What if we were
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.400]   to make this as slim and compact as possible, while still be having as many ports as someone
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:57.360]   want on a basic PC. I really think that that's going to be the highlight of whatever they come
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.280]   out with this year. And I do think that the current come out with something.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.120]   Look at what Amazon's done with the fire TV, even though that these are arm chips,
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:09.120]   but it really is an Apple TV sized full blown computer quad core. GVU, no very little storage.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:14.880]   Have you heard anything maybe Renee about the idea of a storage list, Mac Mini, one that you
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.840]   would just plug stuff into? I have not. I was going to say the one thing that's nice about
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.000]   Haswell also is the iris graphics that come with it. Yes, because just like the motherboard graphics.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.240]   Yeah. Yeah, the Red and the member who was underpowered, the original one in Haswell and Iris fixed all
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.640]   that. And the Mac Mini's graphics, you know, not the best thing in the world either in Iris would
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.720]   really boost that. But the only thing I've heard is that a new Mac Mini is coming and it's just,
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.680]   you know, it's currently missing in action, but I don't think they would do storage lists or
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:45.200]   headlets. That's the Apple TVs wheelhouse. It's a little chromish for a Mac. Yes.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.800]   And yet, boy, that would be an interesting product. Yeah, I don't know.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:59.360]   So according to a Ryan Shrout at a PC perspective, host of this weekend computer hardware on
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:08.000]   this network, new Haswell processors are coming next month for desktop and mobile 27 new desktop
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:16.400]   processors and 17 new mobile CPUs. They will replace the existing Haswell processors.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:24.400]   I'm not sure what's new and different in them. It's the Haswell refresh platform.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:30.560]   It's new motherboards and so forth. But the thing is, while I know Apple works ahead with Intel
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.760]   and Apple has very close relationships with Intel, would it, if they come out with these next month,
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:40.800]   would we see a Mac Mini next month? No. June would be good. That's WWDC timeframe.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.360]   Maybe. And they're a really patient company. They'll just wait until they have exactly the parts
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:49.520]   they want. It was the same thing with the Mac Pro. They just waited for Intel to ship new
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:54.000]   to hailing processors and then whatever the successor to that was they wait until they have
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.320]   the components they need. Apple really is kind of a Willy Wonka style company now where they're
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.560]   they've got they're so confident in what they're doing and they're so successful in all their
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:09.680]   product lines. And they got so much money that they're sitting on that I can't imagine a single
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:15.280]   product track with the maybe the exception of the iPad Mini where they feel a lot of pressure
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.600]   from outside forces to make sure they keep rotating it and they keep refreshing it and keep improving
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.360]   things. They don't really care to do that. They just oh no, I wouldn't say they don't care. I think
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:29.200]   I think it's like a company like Samsung, all they got is the ability to produce interesting and new
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:34.640]   products on a regular schedule. Other companies, they are almost living hand to mouth as hardware
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.320]   manufacturers. And if their next notebook is not a hit, they got a big problem for the next two
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.720]   years. Apple has the ability to say that we like the Mac Mini. We think the Mac Mini is a great
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.520]   product. It's an important part of our lineup. We don't see a need to make people buy more of
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:53.440]   them in 2014. We are quite a bit there. They're going to be quite aware of what Intel's roadmap
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.800]   is. They're going to be quite aware of what their own internal roadmap is. And so if they feel as
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.680]   though they can let it kind of sit as it is for two years to make a really absolute killer update
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.960]   in 2016, there's no external force that's saying that no, no, no, you have to spike new sales of
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.040]   Mac Mini's this year. So that's that's that's a that's a enviable place for any tech company to be
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.640]   to only be able to be free to make only the products they really, really want to make.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:20.320]   The next the next processor family will be the successor to Haswell will be Broadwell.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:26.000]   And that has been delayed until the first quarter of next year. Do you tell me they're not waiting
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.680]   for Broadwell? Not for the Mac Mini. Broadwell makes a lot of sense for the ultra low end laptop,
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.400]   not the ultra low power laptop market. But I don't think the Mac Mini is constrained by that.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:43.520]   You plug it in. So, you know, you don't need gosh, I just I so it sounds like maybe you think they're
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:49.360]   waiting Andy for Johnny Ive to come forward and say here, I give you the best Mac Mini you've ever
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:54.400]   made. I think that's a possibility, particularly even if you compare to the other so called boring
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:00.080]   computer that Apple makes the the iMac, they read they did something that was a little bit shocking
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:06.400]   design wise for a desktop a top of their line desktop PC, which is to make this real this tiny,
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.360]   tiny razor thin edge so that from certain angles, it just looks like a pane of glass floating in the
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:16.640]   floating in the sky. And even the and remember before that the iMac was very much like the Mac
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.280]   Mini it was a rounded rectangle with a very nicely sculpted base to it but a rounded rectangle.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.560]   So it's possible that if there's one place to let imagination go free, right now that's the
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.720]   place to do it in the Mac line or every actually in the entire product lines to do it in the Mac
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.960]   in the Mac Mini, they could do something that's so cool that just like I think a lot of people
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:40.960]   bought the Mac Pro partly because it's it's tubular. It's a black glossy tube. I must have it.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:46.080]   I think that people who might have held on to their iMac for another couple years or decided to keep
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:52.240]   their the their media server Mac Mini going for a while. If they came out with a circle with a ring
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:57.120]   of beautiful lights around it that communicates the intentions and the and the and the functions
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:02.720]   of this device in any given moment in a subtle way that's just really really cool and they enhanced
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.360]   it with a couple of interesting features. I think just the design of it would would spike interest
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.280]   in the Mac Mini at least get people to start remembering that this product exists.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.800]   Yeah, I think that's one of the problems for the Mini, isn't it? It's just not something that comes
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.920]   leaps to mind. You think iMac, you think MacBook? It's a very it's a it's a sorry. Go ahead Renee.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.320]   No, I was just gonna say like to Andy's point, if they really are doing a redesign, Apple is not a
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.400]   highly parallel company when it comes to new designs. If they're working on a larger iPhone 6 that
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.200]   needs a new body. If they're working on an iWatch completely new product, they just finish doing the
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.520]   Mac Pro. They'll do that when they have time to do that, but there's just no way that design
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:42.000]   department scales to everything all the time. Let's take a let's take a break. There is a big
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.360]   design shake up at Apple in software. We'll talk about that. I'll give you an update on my Mac Pro
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:53.600]   and we'll find some other things to talk about including a rumor. I don't credit, but everybody
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:20:00.160]   seems to be buying that Amazon's gonna have a phone later this year that'll feature 3D technology.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:07.600]   Really? Really? Really? Yeah, okay. Okay. Really? Really? Really? Really? Really? Really?
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:14.800]   Should we parallelize on? Can we start this week at Amazon? Really? Really? I just every time I see
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:20.240]   this rumor and it comes from you know Wall Street Journal and boy genius, I go really? I can't I
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:26.640]   can't wait to use my Amazon phone to stream video directly to my Apple TV. Oh yeah, that'll happen.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.240]   I think that's gonna be great. Yeah, that'll happen. Our show today brought to you by
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:36.160]   snack time. Nature Box! Let me go get my new nature box. So nature box we've talked about before. I love
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:45.040]   nature box. The idea is that having healthy snacks around delicious wonderful snacks that you want
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:50.400]   to eat that are that are free of all the junk that's in a lot of snack foods. It's just good for
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.520]   everybody. It's good for business. We have nature boxes all over the business. It's good for the home.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:01.840]   Nature box can be delivered to you monthly. You can get their variety of sizes with delicious
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:07.440]   treats. This is a brand new nature box. When you get your nature box, you can ask for an assortment.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.960]   That's kind of what we do because there's a lot of different tastes here in the studio.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:17.280]   But you can also say if you know I want savory or sweet or spicy only or you can sit you can
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.920]   if you have dieterines, they have vegan, they have soy free, gluten conscious lactose free,
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:29.680]   nut free, non-GMO. You get your choice. And that's kind of cool. Three different sizes. You get
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:35.280]   your five, ten or twenty snack bag box. Actually we get several of them because we have a snack
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:43.040]   happy crew here. What's nice is they work with Feeding America to provide food. 150,000 meals
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:49.360]   donated by nature box. And they're so delicious which it really is the bottom line here. I could
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:56.080]   talk on and on about nutritionist approved. No trans fat zero high fructose corn syrup,
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.720]   nothing artificial. I go on and on about that but then really it comes down to are you going to want
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:07.280]   to eat it? How about these chili lime pistachios? We love these. The Fuji apples. The homestyle
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:13.040]   cheddar mix. So this is you know that other party mix. This is like the like you would make
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:18.400]   at home. I'm going to open this one up because I'm a fan. Wait a minute though. Oh gosh now.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:23.120]   Whole wheat raspberry figgy bars. That's Sarah Lane's favorite. She loves those Italian
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:28.560]   bistro pretzels. You know when nature boxes arrive here at the studio, they usually disappear within
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.680]   the day or two. You're going to love them and that's why I want you to try it. And if you go to
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:40.160]   naturebox.com/twit 50% off your first box. I have to do that. I have to do the homestyle cheddar mix.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.680]   Stay. You know what they're slogan is I love it. Stay full. Stay strong.
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:55.360]   No more empty bellies here. Naturebox.com/twit. Oh this looks so good. So much better.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:02.480]   Cheese flavored corn chips, corn nuts and pretzels. Oh man that's not nice.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:07.920]   I'm sure. I know I'm sorry. Naturebox.com/twit.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.800]   I love it. I hope we don't get like a major manufacturer of peanut butter as a sponsor because I get
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:21.600]   to lay this show. I could cost this. I just you know it was always my dream to have food sponsors
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:28.000]   on this show. And I got to tell you you know thank you to you and Lisa because there's nothing
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.920]   better than coming this wasn't this trip but coming home from a trip and seeing a box and
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:38.400]   expect and it's full of snacks. Yeah. That's all you want. You just want to suddenly without
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.640]   having to do anything snacks appear and are ready to be eaten. That's how it should be. That's how
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:48.800]   life should be. Do we send some to you to Renee? Yes they were absolutely fantastic. They lasted
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.560]   all about a day and a half. Yeah well that's the problem. They need bigger. We're going to need a
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:24:01.600]   bigger box. So Johnny Ive and Greg Christie apparently didn't quite see eye to eye. Christie's
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:07.040]   out Ive of course still there. Christie joined Apple back in 1996. He's been there 18 years.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:13.200]   He worked on the Newton. When jobs came back he cleared out a lot of people but not Greg Christie.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:19.360]   He is listed as the inventor on nearly 100 patents. Has 31 pending patents right now.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:27.280]   Worked on software design is widely credited as the co-inventor of Slide to unlock.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:36.240]   Sources at Apple say after 18 years of the company Greg's decided to retire and cash in his shares.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.440]   Which is probably at this point worth quite a bit of money. Apple said Greg's been planning
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:47.920]   to retire later this year after nearly 20 years of Apple. It's not quite 20 years yet. 20 years
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:53.920]   in two years. He's made vital contributions to Apple products across the board and built a world
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:25:01.920]   class human interface team which has worked closely with Johnny for many years. He did testify in
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:07.600]   the Apple Samsung trial last week and San Jose about Slide to unlock. He gave interviews about
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:13.280]   the process of designing the iPhone to the Wall Street Journal and NPR. So this is hard to say.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:19.920]   You know 9 to 5 Macs it said it's following friction between top Apple human interface vice
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:25.440]   president Greg Christie and senior vice president Johnny Ive. Apple's hardware and software design
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:30.800]   is being dramatically shaken up. Ive of course has always been responsible for hardware design
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:36.960]   but this is seen by some as a consolidation of his power in software as well.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:44.560]   He already has the power in software. I don't think that this is as paid in place ish as people
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:51.120]   are making it out to be. I don't remember my uh uh Gruber used his sources to look into it and
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:56.160]   he agrees as just seems to be a case of someone who's been at the same job for 20 years and sometimes
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.280]   you wake up in the morning and realize that wait a minute how many tens of millions of dollars do
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:04.160]   I have? Why am I going to work in the morning? Uh that sometimes you just you're just ready to move
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:09.200]   on and do other things. That's what it looks like. I don't think any other company uh provokes so much
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.080]   uh speculation that anytime someone moves in or someone moves out that's because there's a knife
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:19.280]   and someone else's back. It's interesting too because I heard about this I think when I was out there
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:24.160]   from Macworld and they announced that eternally at Apple weeks prior to that it was a well-known
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:28.400]   thing. It wasn't public but it was a well-known thing. And like Henri Lamara, like Bazz Holding,
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.160]   there's a bunch of people who've been at Apple for a really long time and these are the people
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:37.600]   who basically by force of will got the iPhone to market and they are tired and they have to testify
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.360]   and they have families who would dearly love to spend more time with their money and it's just
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.920]   there's so there's so much incentive for them just to want to take a break.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:51.120]   Break. That there might well have been friction. I mean WWDC last year he did the introduction for
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.360]   the interface talk but he did not do the interface talk and it's not the general style of design
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:00.560]   that he has historically done. So it might just be all things considered this is a very graceful
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.920]   point of exit for him. Yeah. Yeah. I've heard this is a common story from a lot of really big
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.520]   companies and really big creative companies where you'd wonder Gee why would if someone you've
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:15.040]   got a job of really great creative responsibility at ILM or Disney or Pixar why wouldn't you stay
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:19.440]   there for the rest of your career. And the thing is a lot of these jobs attract the sort of people who
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:25.520]   get restless if they're faced with the same creative problems and the same challenges for
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:31.440]   five, 10, 15, 20 years because yeah the sort of mind that you can like Bill Atkinson who spent
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.440]   years developing software and now he wants to do photography because this is the this is the
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:40.320]   this is the way this is the lane that their brain is taking them down. Yeah. I mean in that
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.400]   light it makes a lot of sense but it's also you can see I mean it might both things might be true.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.560]   You can see Johnny I've saying hey this is where we're going to go with software maybe
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:55.520]   doesn't fit what Greg Christie felt. I mean clearly if he's been there 18 years he has a lot to do
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:00.160]   with the original look of the iPhone not that you know an iOS 7 may be a very big departure for him.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:05.200]   So all in all yeah and he's got some money and he'd like to enjoy his family and God knows
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:09.840]   how many iPhones exhausting right? Organizationally makes a lot of sense to
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.000]   sorry organizationally it makes a lot of sense too because previously even though Johnny I was put
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.560]   in charge of all human interface Greg Christie's department still reported to Craig Federicki
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.640]   and Johnny would basically come and sit in on their meetings and give input and it just wasn't
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.400]   the sort of pipeline you wanted to have that track underneath Johnny I have the same way you had
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.560]   industrial design under Johnny I've and now at least organizationally it makes a lot more sense as well.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:37.680]   Yeah yeah. It's an interesting it's I don't I don't I don't think that this is a
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:42.080]   result of a fight that wound up one person winning the other person going home.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:47.360]   Nonetheless it's going to be interesting to see what happens to the interfaces of everything that
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:53.440]   Apple makes over the past two or three years as Johnny I've gets more and more more control over
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:57.680]   more and more aspects of the things where there's there are few people to really talk to not that
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:02.800]   anything at Apple is ever one person deciding this is the way that we're doing things but clearly
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:08.400]   we're moving towards a place where I think that Apple's turn Apple's user interface design is
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:14.320]   going to be turning into more like the vision of a specific director so to speak where it's not
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:19.280]   just lots of different products with lots with a common sort of design language and it clearly
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:24.320]   came out of the same factory and the same foundries now we're talking about here is a small group of
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:30.640]   people who have a specific vision of what's best for for humans and computers and being able to
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:37.040]   consistently apply that one vision so that's a great thing because Apple has always been tops of the
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:41.520]   heap in terms of making things that work together very very well and making sure that if you buy a
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.440]   brand new product that you've never used before the fact that it came out of that same foundry
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:50.320]   that same shop means that you're probably going to be 75% familiar with how to operate it but
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:58.080]   as I was thinking about this the other day that it's not what Apple's design direction it isn't
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:03.920]   like if you're going to compare it to directors it's not like Scorsese or Spielberg where there's a
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:10.800]   certain fingerprint on it but it's kind of generic enough that it doesn't overwhelm how you come
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.840]   and approach the story and then come and approach the product I think that
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:19.440]   Apple's design has been getting a little bit more towards Wes Anderson or David Lynch
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:24.640]   you know where's not it not as extreme as that but it's definitely a point of view
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:30.400]   and there's no way getting around that specific point of view and so if you don't like that point
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:37.200]   of view of minimalist minimalist minimalist take away as much detail as possible make as quiet
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.360]   and experience as they can possibly put into pixel forms if you don't just if you don't agree with that
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:46.480]   well you're kind of stuck because that really is the emphatic statement being made on every
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:52.800]   single device that they make so I've never been so eager to see a new version of macOS as I am right
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:58.320]   now this one thing we know for sure is that or maybe we don't make correct me if I'm wrong but
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:03.040]   according to 9 to 5 Mac that means all software designers instead of working under director of
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:09.600]   engineering Craig Federighi now work under Johnny I've directly with his industrial design team
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:15.840]   my understanding as well so that's a that's a significant change and if you think about like
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:21.840]   five years ago Steve Jobs had a general idea what he wanted and the design team could make him
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:25.840]   20 versions of a texture and Scott Forest all could say these are the three that Steve will like
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.840]   and then Steve will choose one of those and that entire process doesn't exist anymore so
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:35.600]   Apple has to realign whether Johnny O'Ive is the O turn out Apple or not that simple you know Steve
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:39.680]   Jobs got forceful paradigm doesn't exist anymore so other things have to change or I just so
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:45.520]   is Johnny I would guess Johnny's taking that role then the Steve Jobs role that is the one we're
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.560]   going to do right I mean I don't think they're bringing it to Tim Clegg and saying Tim what do
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:54.160]   you think I don't think that the impression that I get and again my my sources inside are not
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:58.320]   nearly as good as many other commenters but the impression that I get is that there's nobody who
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:03.680]   has settled into the Steve Jobs role at Apple that really this has been a it's there's a group
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:09.200]   mind that's more powerful than anyone single mind yeah understanding as well you agree okay
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:15.200]   I know nothing you guys know more than I do so well they I mean they have really talented people
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.640]   and they tend to if you look at Johnny Ives when he did industrial when he still does industrial
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.080]   design they prototype everything they sit down they discuss it they try to get the essential
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.720]   nature of it it's a very procedural thing and I think the same will carry my guess is that the
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:31.200]   same will carry over to to human interface and the history of almost every significant apple
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:35.200]   product including the ones that were developed under jobs where lots and lots of people having
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.160]   lots and lots of discussions before it comes down to those three options that get presented to Steve
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.200]   so it's not as though there's really as much as I like to make a Wes Anderson comparison
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.360]   because it means that seeing Gran Budapest hotels now tax deductible if something that I mentioned
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:56.480]   it on on a podcast it's always been a story of lots and lots of people who try to do
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:02.560]   exactly your movie admission tickets I would not dare I almost well I can't I can't even I don't
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:06.800]   want to talk about taxes because this is as bad this would be as bad as talking about Android on
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:12.080]   on the Macquarie it is April 15th I just want to point that out I did I did it was so many years
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.840]   my early career where I just short formed it because I just don't even want to have to have it
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:20.640]   I would have to figure out okay yes I did fly to Mackerel Expo to ride a bunch of columns but
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:26.000]   while I was there I did see some friends so if they challenge this I won't okay let's just not
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.400]   they count on that Andy they count on that I don't list that talking that's why Larry and
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:35.920]   Sergey pay so little tax and you pay so much yeah relatively speaking oh because they they make so
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:43.120]   much they contribute so much more to the economy perhaps maybe not I might have sold a few movie
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:50.000]   tickets today but that's basically all I do for other industries did you guys read Don Melton's
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.240]   long piece it was originally in the loop magazine Jim Del Rimple's app but Don Melton the creator
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:03.840]   of Safari in a long time Apple employee going back to next I think wrote a long article on his
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:11.680]   blog Memories of Steve now he wasn't exactly intimate of Steve's but he has some you know it's
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:18.240]   an interesting story he started the web kit project at Apple he says today he's a recovering
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:27.680]   programmer and so it's you know it's fun to read these he says he will not see the Steve Jobs movie
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:32.480]   he did not read the Walter Isaacson bio because he has a few precious memories of working with
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:37.200]   Steve and he doesn't want them colored by other people's impressions which I kind of understand
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:48.160]   yeah there was a Sundance premiered in January the biography of Roger Rebert and because I
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.160]   contributed to the Kickstarter so I was able to watch it streamed and yeah it's a very very weird
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:57.440]   thing when someone that you knew very very well is now the subject of a film or a documentary
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:02.320]   that's designed for people who never knew him and so it's it's a weird experience so I definitely
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:07.920]   understand that yeah yeah yeah Don is I'm privileged to call Don a friend that he's a remarkable guy
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:13.600]   he did Mozilla and then he did Nautilus and then he did WebKit and Safari and he's also responsible
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:19.280]   for hiring a ton of people who now have very senior positions at Apple and just his stories
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:24.720]   are fantastic and those stories in particular there I think are just terrific if you go through
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:29.840]   them especially the one where he ends up sitting back down and saying I'm so fired just because
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.520]   they add sort of a lot of the flavor and you remember that people who work at Apple like every
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.760]   company or human beings and not just drones out there to you know frustrate us and not give us
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:42.720]   what we want immediately when we want it yeah yeah that's the story of sitting in the Apple
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:53.200]   cafeteria eating and there's a few empty seats and they noticed a familiar face looking for an
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:36:01.040]   open table and it was a long time Macintosh designer but Tribble co-founder of Next
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:09.440]   and they all knew Bud Tribble so they so they they say hey there's Bud over there did you guys
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:14.320]   see him what's he doing here Ken and I hadn't seen Bud in months not since easel shut down so we were
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:19.120]   all making guesses about the reason for his visit tired of the conjecture I finally just stood up
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:23.520]   cut my hands and called out to him hey Bud come over here and see your old pals when you're done
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:30.640]   talking to that guy Bud looked up slight pause and that guy turned around a stare at me it was
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:37.280]   Steve Jobs I will forever remember his look a slightly lopsided tight-lipped half-smile eyes
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:42.800]   narrowed I've seen that look actually as if to say I don't know who you are but I won't forget that
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.760]   when I sat back down at least I didn't say something smart ass like I am so fired in front
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:51.760]   of my two engineers although that's what I thought at the time Ken and Richard thought it was pretty
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:55.440]   funny what Steve turned back around until he did I think they were holding their breath to
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:05.440]   spoiler alert I did not get fired hey Bud yeah it's fun um so did you know Don before he went to
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:10.560]   Apple or no I knew him afterwards he came on one of the podcast and we had a good conversation
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:15.360]   and now once a month I got together with Don and Matt Drans and Guy English and we talk about 80s
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:22.400]   movies which is the first thing in the world I love it well it's nice it's a very long blog
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:29.840]   post it's definitely one for a pocket or you know read it later but yeah this is this is something
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:35.120]   I keep coming back to it's it must be really really hard to be at a senior level at Apple
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:41.920]   knowing that so many people outside of Apple are going to imagine a reality series and try to
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:46.960]   cast you in whatever role they need you to fill in that reality series as the person who just
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:51.280]   does part of the old guard who's going to be swept aside by the new designers as the person who has
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:55.840]   a new vision for Apple and is trying to be combative and argumentative as the person who's carrying
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:00.800]   the spirit of Apple with them and are defending it against the incoming uggers and barbarians
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:05.760]   it must be it's something that you really don't get at Samsung or Google or really any other company
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:11.120]   where you just are allowed to do your job and do your projects as best you can without other people
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:15.760]   imagining that they know what your point of view is and what your goals are at the company they
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:21.840]   taught he talks about the rehearsing for the safari announcement jobs wanted to prank Phil
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:28.960]   Schiller so he has a slide deck going along and uh and then the last slide uh I guess he's talking
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:36.480]   about you know um uh let me see I should I should get 1.4 million visitors in the month of December
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:41.920]   alone to this story said so to all of you in the press who doubted us and then he throws up the slide
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:48.320]   which has a 1940 style rendering of a grinning man holding a big mug of coffee next to his face
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:56.160]   how about a nice cup of stfu although he spelled out the stfu and he looks at Phil he says what do
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:03.680]   you think Phil too much and of course it was a joke and never it didn't make it to the deck but
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:09.360]   yeah it's actually good to hear stories of Steve Jobs being lighthearted and fun
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.360]   because all we're hearing these days is of you know Steve the tyrant
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.480]   so it's nice to hear those others at the other side as well well even the parts about the code
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.600]   review in there when he and Steve would turn to each other and decide on like how a feature
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:25.440]   should work in the program yeah it's just nice to know that you know Steve Jobs was looking at how
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:31.600]   that bar filled itself with right right um yeah talking about the safari for windows
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:38.400]   and and and so forth and uh by the way good kind things to say about Scott Forestall as well
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:46.160]   Scott made a great boss he backed me up so this is amazing things yeah champion carbon he championed
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:53.680]   the app store yeah yeah worth reading if you want to add to your stock of stories about apple and
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:40:02.400]   understanding i think of apple uh under Steve Jobs uh let's see apple is testing maps notifications
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:06.480]   uh to inform users of problems that have been fixed
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.160]   that'll never make it into a product
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:16.320]   people are occasionally getting them mac rumors says some of their readers have reported with
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:24.240]   screenshots uh that they've received push notifications so if you report a problem like they're you
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:30.320]   know that bridge is out uh later when apple fixes the map you maybe you can expect a little
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:36.160]   notification saying that problem has been fixed yeah unclear whether that'll be uh in the in the
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:42.240]   that's such a smart idea because we're all used to the idea of uh when you when you
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:46.800]   click on that button and say yes please report this crash you're you're you're you're you're
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.360]   you imagine that this goes into this big big hopper where it's mixed up with all kinds of extra
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:55.360]   electrons and god knows if that has any positive effect whatsoever as soon as you get some sort
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:59.440]   of feedback that yes someone did look at this and this actually enhanced the experience that's
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:03.680]   going to encourage you to go throughout your own local neighborhood and try to fix as much of the
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:09.920]   map as you possibly can and that's the strength of any map service it's not uh how to get from uh
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:14.960]   boston to new work by the highway system it's about how to get from uh the post office in
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:20.800]   denham massachusetts to the to the uh the the chipotle on route one in uh in norwood as these
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.640]   little street things that uh that tell you that no no you don't want to take route one you want
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:28.800]   it there's a actually there's actually a one a next to it that has absolutely no red lights and
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:34.080]   we'll get you there faster that's the if you can sort of trick people into thinking that other
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:38.400]   their help actually has an effect you can actually get the greatest ground crew possible and create
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:44.880]   a really kick butt mapping service there's a here's the shot from uh um macrumers.com
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:50.240]   sent in uh by uh one of its readers who had reported a problem and then they get a lot of
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.760]   notifications as the problem you reported on april six has now been addressed thank you for
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:57.760]   reporting this problem they should do that that's a great idea that encourages people to do it
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.560]   so you're you're being heard i like that idea yeah makes you feel good about the product and it
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:07.120]   isn't in any way it's not an omission of failure it shouldn't be seen that way all maps have to
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:13.680]   be updated all the time yeah it's not a bad thing now are they do they still call the the
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:18.800]   public garden the public gardens and boston oh now you are fix that then you'd get that nice
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:24.400]   thank you i got i got i got to check that again yeah yeah i know it's i i know that this is like
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:28.720]   if you if a movie gets filmed at your former high school and they show a chase going from the
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:33.760]   cafeteria to through the english department you say the cafeteria is near the science wing not
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:37.680]   the english i so i know this is a pathetic thing to complain about but it's something i keep
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:41.760]   noticing every time it bothers me well maybe you'll be glad to know that apple according apple
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:48.400]   insider is using wi-fi access points for indoor navigation they'll fix that in 3d positioning
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:54.880]   um it's a patent though so it doesn't mean that they've implemented it yet but a patent that was
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:43:00.800]   granted to to apple on tuesday describes a robust system that combines gps wi-fi access points and
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:08.240]   on board location databases provide mobile devices accurate positioning even when you are inside so
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:16.240]   you'll know where that cafeteria is it's about time are we going to see a new version of a big new
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.880]   version of maps before ios 8 you think rene or is all of this because they've acquired hop stop
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:26.160]   location or a broad map and bark uh they're you know they're they're really beefing up their data
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:33.040]   they could do it sooner i suppose than ios 8 will they wait to ios 8 well i think the answer that is
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:36.880]   an appalling yes and no and the thing is that the adding in features like trans it's going to
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:42.080]   require new buttons in the interface in a new way of presenting data so that will be um ios 8
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:45.840]   specific yeah things like improving the back end like apparently they're gonna be doing a lot of
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.760]   data sanitizing and data cleansing and just making the stuff that they've already got because they
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.400]   have great tantam data they have great data from several providers but just making it more uniform
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:58.720]   and more accurate and that will just depend on how they stage the rollout that's all server side
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:03.600]   stuff um so it'll be a combination of both of those things whether they beta test the server side
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:08.560]   stuff during the ios 8 beta just because it's convenient and makes a lot of sense to them i don't
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:14.160]   know but that's certainly a possibility be nice you know i mean google updates maps every five minutes
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:20.000]   i don't you know why not you're standing there and they're updated yeah and by the way a new
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:25.280]   interface new button is no problem facebook does that they just but that a complete reality but
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:29.360]   that also points out that you can't you have to be really conserved and really protect the integrity
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:36.000]   of your map data and it's well known that the a lot of a lot of businesses are gaming google maps
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.240]   by if you if you call for uh i need a locksmith i need a snow plow service i need whatever uh they
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:46.160]   basically by because they can add stuff to the map themselves or at least encourage
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:52.000]   there's a system for uh enhancing maps uh that they they basically flood a certain area with
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.760]   like hundreds and hundreds of quote local unquote snow plow locksmith or whatever services so that
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:02.400]   instead of calling what you think is going to be a shop that's located 1.2 miles away you're actually
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:07.520]   calling a call center that will then dispatch someone that is has subscribed to a service that
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:14.000]   they run uh and so it's it's there's nothing that can't be ruined by commerce uh by adding a little
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.400]   bit too much freedom to the mix scooter x in our chat room says apple still reports a carot's
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:23.200]   restaurant in the middle of a nearby park i've reported it many times and it's still there
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:27.440]   you should open one there think of the business you'd get i think a chicken fried steak in the
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:32.240]   middle of a park that sounds like a good meal to me who are you to turn down free location advice
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:39.360]   from people who run the apple stores i actually used to go into the local caros just to get chicken
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:44.320]   fried steak and that my friends is why i will be dead in the next five years uh our show today
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:50.000]   brought to you by gazelle ladies and gentlemen i know you have a hankering you have you don't you
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.680]   wouldn't be listening to show if you didn't have a hankering for the latest greatest shiny toy or
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:59.680]   gadget but how do you pay for that do you sell your old gadget sometimes people do i know
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:05.040]   our chat mod dan is famous for having all the latest greatest stuff i said dan
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:10.880]   given what we pay you which is nothing i don't know how you do that and he says well i sell them
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:17.680]   i sell the old ones here's the easiest way to get cash even for a broken iphone or broken i uh pad
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:24.560]   uh cash for your samsung device time to get out of that you thought it was a good idea at the time
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:32.000]   but now you're realizing you miss your iphone sell your old stuff at gazelle got an old iphone five
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.840]   want to get some cash so you can get the new one no cracks no no problem too look at that price
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:43.360]   look at that price you could unlock it by the way and get and get 40 bucks more 230 dollars
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:48.960]   for an iphone five from atnt but they do buy cell phones from blackberry
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:47:00.640]   hd you don't get as much htc samsung uh nokia yes they will buy your surface tablet they will buy
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:08.880]   your google nexus tablet your samsung or asus tablet even a kindle fire and the nice thing about
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:20.080]   this is this quote that you're going to get is guaranteed uh for 30 days so when you see that quote
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:27.200]   well the kindle fire is not worth much the resale value not great on the kindle fire the
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:33.200]   apple stuff really the resale value holds wonderfully and you see that quote you have time now you
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:39.680]   could say you know i think i'm gonna wait and see what they come up with next i'm gonna transfer
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:45.920]   my data over um and then within 30 days you can pull the trigger they'll send you a box with a
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:50.320]   prepaid mailing label on and everything you pile all the stuff you've gathered in fact go through
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.480]   all those drawers and closets and you know sell all the stuff that's just sitting around gathering
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:48:01.360]   dust yeah your old apple tv's worth some gazelle.com they pay the postage they turn it around fast if
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:05.520]   you forget to wipe the data or as in the case of an apple tv you can't figure out how to wipe the
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:10.160]   tapered up don't worry their experts will do it for you and then they'll send you a check but if
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:15.040]   you're in a hurry you can get a paypal credit or if you use a lot of amazon which i do then do get
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:19.920]   the amazon gift card because that's an additional five percent they bump you up on that gazelle's paid

[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:40.640]   so uh i'm not going to gazelle my mac pro good news
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:46.320]   good app but you know it's interesting there is apparently there's a problem with some mac
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:51.680]   pros i mentioned last week that they were doing a capture mine is not in that range of serial numbers
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:57.360]   but after i sent them the log that showed them repeated crashes and kernel panics and reboots
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:04.640]   they said well we better send you a new one so uh we're going to do a swap which i'm happy i'm happy
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:12.720]   about um stock is still very limited on these mac pros and i do use so by the way i think i got a
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:18.320]   bad one but i think that most people are happy with them i don't hear widespread problem reports
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:22.720]   do you think that the stock is so limited because they can't make them fast enough they can't get the
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:28.720]   parts or the demand is so high are there rumors rday anything you're hearing you've got your ear
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:34.160]   to the ground well the components i believe i'm not sure right now but as of a month ago i think
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:38.960]   all those base components especially the graphics cards and the chips were still in slow supply
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:43.520]   it's a new manufacturing process which always takes time to ramp up and because people in waiting so
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:47.520]   long there probably were more orders than there will be over the normal course of a couple of years
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:52.640]   so there was a pent up demand yes so it's probably you know a pent up demand along with a slow
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:50:00.560]   your ability to supply that demand uh i you know um i'm my advice and i think this is this holds true
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:04.800]   i know Alex Lindsay always said this he just doesn't want to buy the first one off the line
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:09.120]   except we always do because we want to be the first in there don't buy rev-a-boards right
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:14.400]   rev-a-boards yes don't buy rev-a-boards but is it even more the case when it's not only a rev-a-board
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:19.680]   but a brand new plant brand new manufacturing process brand new everything that seems to me
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:25.280]   much more likely there'll be some kinks initially yeah that that's my constant advice to everybody
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:30.400]   whenever you have i i don't have many i don't have any problems when apple just goes to use
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:35.600]   the same body design and simply upgrades the the the cpu and the internals when they go to a brand
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:41.360]   new body design though they're they haven't really figured out how to make this in quantity until
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:45.360]   they've made them in quantity that's the only time when they figure out that okay we need to put
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:50.160]   less adhesive on this spot because it's causing a heat buildup right uh so that's why i tend to
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:55.520]   wait for revision p of anything it's true for cars you don't want to buy the first car in a brand
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:01.440]   new product line i buy i my my favorite cars are fleet style vehicles because they made a lot of
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:06.000]   us by the time by the time they've been making that toyota for eight years yeah they and they've
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.320]   they've they've cranked out so many copies that every single defect has been has been dealt with
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:15.120]   and if it's designed to be run by cops and taxi drivers that big block engine is just not gonna
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:20.720]   screw up i just i i have an old car it's got high mileage and the engine is like you cannot
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:26.800]   destroy this i i blew i blew a coolant hose on my drive back from the airport and i thought oh
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:31.760]   maybe this is it this is it but no driving it hot for for five miles did nothing to the engine just
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:36.560]   new hose and cat and earth change while i was there and it's good i think the same principle really
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:40.640]   affects technology too you should be a little bit not not skeptical but a little bit cautious
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:44.880]   about getting the first version of a brand new design because they do all the diligence they
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:49.440]   have to do and it's the best they can make at that point but you never know what the weaknesses in
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:52.880]   the manufacturing process are until you've made punched out millions of these and that is why
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:58.400]   Andy drives at crown Victoria it's like you have computer nerd please intercept your model i
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:05.360]   i my next car i really want to buy a crown vick if if you i'm i'm telling you if any product whether
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:10.640]   it is a car a computer or a pizza if they ask you would you like the police pursuit package with
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:15.280]   that yes of course i would i thought what's something called the police pursuit package
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:22.560]   i did not buy the police pursuit package on my mac pro however okay you have these competing
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:26.480]   nerds you have like the one nerd on your shoulder going don't buy the revivore you'll be the first
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:31.280]   one in petaluma with a mac pro well and i did and but i but i have an excuse which is that so i can
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:35.840]   review it i wanted to get as fast as possible and thanks again to ed engber who was one of our
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:40.000]   listeners who did buy it the for i didn't buy it the first day and then i found out i won't get it
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.840]   for a month and a half or whatever fortunately he did but had had second thoughts got an i mac instead
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:51.760]   probably a wise decision and i bought it from him uh transferred it over to me so the you know it's
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:56.400]   under warranty and all that stuff uh because he never even got the box i think it just came straight
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:00.800]   to me um i have to say one thing about the mac pro i was little we mocked a little bit the design
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:04.240]   and thought well it's gonna be under the table nobody's ever gonna see it it isn't it's so small
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:08.960]   that you really do keep it on your desk and and it's pretty there and it's also convenient because
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:13.920]   you can plug stuff in in and out and it it really looks good on the desktop so i think that that's
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:18.800]   gonna be a great model as soon as it works out the kinks is it staying clean is it getting dusty
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:25.440]   uh it is not getting dusty although uh from now on i wish an apple just a little tip ship it with
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:32.720]   white gloves uh i i've literally received speakers i think uh i can't remember was it a perion one of
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:38.800]   the one of the speaker companies either emotiva or a perion ships white gloves with their speakers
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:43.280]   and if apple would only do that then i wouldn't have the because it it is a you know when you take
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.960]   it out you hold it and then i have got fingerprints on the side of it yeah so it should be white
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:52.080]   gloves uh my suggestion if for if for nothing else that a pair of white gloves cotton gloves
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:56.480]   got a cost like something like nothing one of these cents but the the impact that you make
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:01.280]   so i've got i never know sometimes like i'm shown stuff like six to eight months before it's
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:06.080]   being like an ownership and i know it's a big deal if it's in a custom anvil case i know it's a
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:10.960]   really big deal if the first thing that they see after they take off that little egg crate you know
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:16.560]   like foam is that there are two sets of gloves so that whoever picks this up does not put any skin
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:20.480]   skin oil on it or anything like that i don't know if that's just a little bit of theatrics but
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:25.360]   again if you were i think that if you've paid three thousand dollars for desktop computer
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:30.080]   give me theatrics give me the full experience yeah give me cotton gloves yeah
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:39.760]   um what else was i going to say about oh silent yes um i've been running you know bioshock
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:44.400]   infinite i've tried to try to tax the dang thing and i can i'm not i'm not editing 4k video
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:52.480]   but um it it no matter what i do i don't hear a thing in fact i told you the other day the loudest
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:58.720]   thing is that old uh um firewire drive that i have on the desk as a backup drive i want to
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:05.680]   like really i turn it off because i don't want to hear everything is it's so nice so nice and as
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:12.160]   far as i can tell and i'll put my hand right over that fan and i it's a little warm sometimes i don't
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:19.280]   ever feel heat it really is a nice nice piece of hardware so i don't want to scare anybody off
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:26.560]   because of my issues i think that i i suspect they fixed them by now uh i watch
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:37.200]   forecast from a company called kgi and our favorite ming qi quote and mings pretty good right
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:41.280]   am i right he's pretty good i mean it's it depends off your grading on a curve and i've
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:45.120]   i get an argument about this because people say he's really reliable but when you look at like the
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:50.320]   tooth this is a 2014 road map which is usually one of the least reliable things because it's only
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:54.720]   april and he's predicting stuff up until the end of october and that's really really hard to do
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:56:00.160]   especially with supply chain sources but if you look at the 2013 version of this maybe 40
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:04.000]   percent 50 percent and a lot of that was you know apple's gonna make new ipads apple's gonna
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.200]   make new iPhones so i mean it's worth looking at it's worth discussing but i wouldn't be
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:13.920]   placing large wagers on them i gotta i gotta i want to look up his 2013 road map real quickly
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:20.080]   just to see um this is the nice thing about the internet apple tv he had a new uh mac mini he had
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:26.080]   a redesigned macbook pro which you could argue maybe the 13 was um there was no new mac pro on his
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:34.000]   road map here's his 20 here's his 2013 apple tv refresh did that happen no uh i filled five s
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:40.720]   third quarter yes new design i fold five yes that was the c right uh ipad five the air yes
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:48.240]   ipad mini two yes he was right in the macbook air coming out in q two towards the end that was of
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:55.040]   course wwdc in fact a new design retina came out then two right so he's a little off in the timing on
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:59.760]   that he did say there'll be a new iMac and mac mini in the fourth quarter of last year no
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:07.520]   modified ipad touch five no no ipad nano refresh no
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:12.720]   and this stuff again the stuff he did get right were things that apple has done previous years in
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:17.520]   those time slots so he's that was more like uh induction than deduction well there's going to be
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:22.160]   an ipad five and a new ipad mini this year because it was like last year right i think again he might
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:26.560]   have sources saying that but it's still those aren't well here's the thing that's that uh yeah i mean
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:30.480]   some of those are just yeah of course you're gonna do that but here's the interesting thing he says
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:36.240]   it towards the end of the third quarter a all new 12 inch ultra slim macbook and macbook pro retina
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:42.880]   upgrade we've talked about that before he says at brown the same time in apple tv upgrade i don't
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:48.880]   know if anybody's waiting with baited breath for an apple tv upgrade are they uh yeah i mean apple
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:53.360]   apple's apple's feeling a lot of i i really think that apple's gonna be feeling a lot of pressure to
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:59.600]   do something really big with the apple tv you compare it with uh what amazon just did with the fire tv and
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:05.920]   i'm switching ab between these two and the apple tv feels slow it for the the interface is seems
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:14.480]   confusing the software just feels like it feels like it's right from 2004 2005 2006 uh it's it's
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:20.720]   again an ab test it's just no comparison and yet if if uh if apple's not good at multi-tasking it seems
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:25.600]   that the apple tv is not a high priority development and that what you just described as a major
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:33.200]   redesign not just a refresh well i mean uh they they a new cpu to make it more fluid uh a new
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:39.920]   operating a new user interface that make it more ios like uh these are and believe it or not as
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:44.160]   although as i think everybody's pretty much half and half on what what they like and don't like
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:49.360]   but ios 7 it's a revamp that would look really really great on a tv screen if they were to make
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:54.000]   it darker as opposed to lighter so yeah they wouldn't they wouldn't have to throw everything away and
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.880]   start all over again so much as just simply tweak the interface so that it doesn't look quite so
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:06.000]   prime for uh 480 pixel standard definition tv so are you voting for it or are you saying it's likely
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:12.400]   uh i i hesitate to say anything that is anything is likely unless it's apple has been on a regular
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:16.800]   schedule of releasing something on a certain date i think that this is not only is it prime for an
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:22.320]   update it's different from the mac mini in which this is a very important market for them uh because
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:27.840]   it's not a hobby anymore it's yeah it's not just a $99 box it's the gateway to selling all kinds of
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:32.880]   content off the iTunes store and also apple's language on the apple tv has changed so much in
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:37.600]   the past eight months where not only did tim cook say it's hard for us to call this a hobby anymore
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:41.840]   but now they're willing to talk about how much money they're making off of this thing so yeah i'm
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:48.400]   sure that and i'm sure that this is as big a problem of uh of lawyer stuff and uh and legal
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:53.520]   deals as it is of engineering but this is something where apple i think they're gonna have it would
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:58.000]   be like a full event almost about how much new stuff they bring to the apple tv at this point
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.240]   at least i i hope so because again they got it's it's it's it's become such an interesting segment
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:10.160]   of the market right now where i got the on my own tv i've got the roku 3 i've got the uh i've got the
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:16.320]   amazon fire uh box and i've got the apple tv and i can have a nice debate about the differences
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:20.400]   between the roku 3 and the amazon about well this one this does this better this one does the
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:26.080]   other thing better but i mean this apple tv is like the number three superpower at this point it's
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.520]   is number one and number two and then there's a hell of a drop off before number three at this
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:35.280]   point yeah you agree with us old yeah no i mean that's 2012 spring 2012 hardware was announced
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.440]   alongside the ipad 3 and look how far we've come with the ipad you should at least put an a7 in
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:45.600]   that sucker yeah it's it's a single core a5 it's eight gigabytes of nand memory it's it's not equipped
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:50.160]   to do the kind of stuff that fire tv is doing even if they just modernize it if there wasn't a7 in
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:55.040]   there if it was given more um storage if it was given more ram i think it's 512 now if it went up
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:59.760]   to a gig or two of ram right if apple finally put the sdk in the field and even if it's not an app
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:05.360]   sdk if it's a game sdk ios is one of the best gaming maybe the best is the wrong way but one of the
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:09.760]   premier gaming platforms right now and there's just so many people and so many games i could do
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:15.120]   it could add so much value to the ecosystem i mean throw spotlight universal search on there
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:20.320]   refresh the interface to yos 7 we do know that apples got some incredibly talented people working
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:24.480]   on apple tv software right now mark german has heard about a new box jim down in bullets that
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:29.120]   it's not coming anytime soon i don't know how big or small those timelines are but i think
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:33.840]   i think we hopefully will see one this year and i think that would be a much more competitive version
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:39.760]   amazon's fire tv does pose a threat to the ecosystem doesn't it i mean it's in the us in the us not in
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:44.720]   your none your neck of the woods but because it is it is a credible gaming device it's basically an
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:52.000]   android device with quad core two gigs of ram a dedicated gpu a controller for an initial $40
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.240]   so you really and amazon's really in fact they've got a gaming studio they're really pushing the
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.400]   notion that it is a gaming yeah it gives them an ecosystem play to put against apples and they
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:06.080]   have any system play you know it's the apple it's the app store is amazon's the content is amazon's
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:11.680]   uh the games are amazon's so might the amazon's yeah maybe a phone we'll talk about that and
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:15.920]   and it is and it is a full android box so it's not limited to there at least their ambitions
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:20.480]   for this aren't limited to just let's just have a host host device to run a netflix app and a hulu
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:24.960]   app this can really do absolutely anything that apple that amazon decides that it wants to do
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:32.800]   and and the other advantage is that you can't ignore that uh the apple tv is a fantastic gaming
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:38.400]   device so long as you have a $400 ipad to play it with so long as you have a $200 iphone to play
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:44.480]   it with with uh with and with uh the the fire tv 99 bucks plus let's say $40 for that really good
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:49.920]   controller and you have a $140 game console that's going to be really really attractive to people
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:55.520]   like me who i have an interest in gaming but i'm no way in hell i'm gonna be spending $500 for
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:59.360]   uh for next generation console i just want something so i could you know play my little racing game
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:04.320]   and play my play cannonball and cannonball and other games like that uh on a big tv from the
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:11.040]   comfort of uh of of of a sofa with a really good control in my hands uh all right okay so other
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:16.400]   things ming chi and i do think the 12 inch is fairly credible uh other things ming chi quote
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:23.840]   says will happen he says the watch the i watch come out uh mid third quarter uh in two sizes
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:30.560]   what's that based on Renee you have any idea well i mean that's that's the theory that you
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:34.080]   would need because there's different sized people there's men women young old you needed these two
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:39.040]   sizes that that's that kind of size not yeah not like the gap not like the Samsung gear where it's
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:45.360]   it's got a band one and a square one but no not so different screen size okay uh all new and this
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:49.760]   is the other one that we're hearing a lot of rumors about all new iphone designs two of them
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:54.640]   a 4.7 inch iphone oh Leo before you go on you skip the part where he thinks that there might be
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:04:01.040]   and i watches up to one two or three thousand dollars oh my god the most expensive version
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:08.480]   costing upwards of a thousand bucks he says it will come in a 1.3 inch and 1.5 inch flexible
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:14.000]   amoled display sapphire cover lens i think that's reasonable biometric recognition
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.440]   can you put a fingerprint reader in that i don't know i i think that's ridiculous that
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.920]   that's the one that takes a lot of space there's i when people are speculating about things they
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:27.360]   might have sources they can't reveal and they might have an insight that they can't really share
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:33.440]   but and i'm willing to say that who knows you know many things are possible but as soon as you
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:39.920]   start talking about a thousand dollar watch that's ridiculous the the moment that apple and i will
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:44.320]   i expect this to come back to haunt me but i will phrase this very the way that i want to phrase it
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:50.000]   the moment apple comes out with a one thousand dollar wristwatch is the moment that i think that
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:57.440]   we can be a little bit concerned about their grip on reality because that's a that's a that's a
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:02.640]   fine price for google to put on to a device that they don't know if they're going to market or not
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.800]   so they can say that look we don't we we have to we're only making about five to eight thousand of
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:10.800]   these so we have to make sure that we can manufacture these and not lose our shirts in the process
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:15.360]   okay that's fine so now you're a special person with the old with one of only five thousand uh
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:21.120]   jonnie i've johnny i've designed uh wrist watches but if they're expecting anybody to do that i
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:25.920]   this is not the company that i know so this is this is the reason why i'm willing to simply
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:34.480]   completely dismiss that as as this just not reality um jason schnell's tweeted according to scooter x
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:41.440]   he believes it will use the ipod name i do not think so who per said that recently too i think
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:45.520]   the i watch it would be interesting the way apple replaced the ipod originally with the
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:51.600]   iphone and they use the ipad to hedge against lower max sales i think that the ipod continues to go
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:56.400]   it it plummets in terms of how much money is making for apple that a wearable could be something that
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:00.640]   replaces that revenue and they've had wearable ipods in the past the ipod shuffle clipped onto your
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:05.680]   tie they've had ipod nano's that clip on those were wearable devices and these could be wearable
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:12.640]   devices that run ios but i mean it could go either way the only i agree with andy that the really
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:17.280]   expensive one makes very little sense to me i could see a range of products eventually from a
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:23.760]   very very cheap shuffle like exercise band to a nano to to maybe a four dollar like premium version
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:28.400]   that does magical things if you start making a golden diamond encrusted one that no you know
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:33.360]   what no matter how many fashion east does you hire that does not seem like a traditional apple i
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:38.160]   don't think that's the case i think but i do think it's possible that apple will say look
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:43.440]   if we are willing to charge a thousand bucks we can put really interesting new technology in this
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:47.680]   thing that we couldn't put in a three hundred dollar or five hundred dollar one why don't we do a
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.760]   reference design we don't expect a lot of people to buy it but we just want to say and it's not
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.840]   going to be diamond and gold i mean that's not the point of it yes i'm sure all of them will be good
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:00.000]   looking because of the higher stuff that's but what if they say there's a technology we could there's
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.560]   technologies we could put in here i don't know what they are holographic 3d projections i don't know
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:09.520]   Mac pro of watches yeah they did it with a Mac pro didn't they no but that's that's that's still
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:13.120]   incredible product because there's a mark uh and also let's not forget the people who are
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:18.880]   buying a Mac pro expect to make money with use of the smack pro apple as much as we joke about
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:22.400]   me we might joke about how there's an apple tax that you have to spend an extra three or four
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:26.560]   hundred dollars for a for a laptop because the apple logo and the apple design and how as much
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:33.040]   as we might joke about how infatuated apple can be about design sometimes to the extent of making a
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:39.360]   pro level MacBook that doesn't have a networking port on it they are still a consumer focus consumer
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:44.800]   driven company i and i think they appreciate that once they put a thousand dollar price tag on a
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:49.920]   watch the expectations of what this is supposed to do and the amount of pleasure it's supposed to
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:54.800]   give the user will be so high out of proportion with what they can deliver that they would just
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:58.880]   throw that right off the drawing board i i even think that five hundred dollars would be a stretch
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:03.680]   although i think that that would be in my own mind that's sort of the high mark for what apple
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:08.160]   might charge for such a thing but again this would still be a very this would still be a premiere
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:13.760]   item with styling that has absolutely no compromises and even a display technology that we haven't
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:18.880]   really seen in a mass market device before uh though the you've got great devices that are going
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:23.360]   for a hundred and thirty dollars right now uh and a lot of different makers that are seen to be
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:28.720]   aiming for 250 as a price point and i think that when you're trying to get people to buy something
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:35.280]   that they've never really heard of before let alone owned before wow every fifty dollars takes
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:39.360]   the ten percent of their interest away there is a group of people who pay more than a thousand
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:44.080]   dollars for a watch i mean but they but these are but these are people who are real fans of watches
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:47.040]   i've got a couple of friends who are watch collectors who will show me this twelve hundred
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:52.560]   dollar watch they bought and they will talk really passionately about how it was manufactured and
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:57.200]   how the movement works and the design and simplicity but how was completely manufactured by hand
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:01.520]   they're they are not the people and when i show them we're not trying to swatch fires either i
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:06.400]   mean there's got to be some middle ground yeah but i'm but i'm saying that uh you're not going to
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:10.800]   get people who simply love watches spending a thousand dollars on this watch unless unless it
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:16.000]   was it's like a johnny and i have bread model which is we were only making 50 of these it cost
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.480]   12 it costs ten thousand dollars and most of that goes to some sort of a charity
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:26.240]   quil also says that an nfc chip i don't buy that apple's done nothing with nfc they couldn't
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:30.560]   care less about nfc what would they put an fc luthuth wireless charging yes that would be a
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:34.720]   that's important i don't know if you can't let me know yeah because you just can't if it's a real
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:39.280]   pain in the butt to charge a pebble right jad also means you gotta put a port into it it's not a big
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:44.480]   thing it's a big pain in the butt with it last four days well that's the difference yeah what apple
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:48.400]   will care about is the fact that if they're going to do that kind of a charger they're going to have
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:54.240]   to have a say they're gonna have to Mars the side of it with two like little copper contacts for the
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:58.800]   magnetic thing that's ugly i want to take off my watch at night and put it on a pad then it can
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:03.840]   charge every night i don't even want that i want them to to make a velcro strap that you risk over
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:09.200]   your your not going to be an adult growing an app okay a magnetic strap magnetic strap what do you
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:14.160]   what do you want astronaut sorry what do you want velcro so go ahead rene we cut you off
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:19.040]   no i was i was just laughing at the velcro thing but i think that you know the i the both the
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:24.080]   iPhone and the ipad entered mature gadget markets like they weren't widely adopted but this is a new
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:28.560]   market for a long time i'm not mature anyway blackberry had been a thing this is brand new this is
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:33.120]   more like the ipod or apple put out a device that was expensive for what i did at the time the original
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:38.560]   ipod was really expensive held very few songs but it was something that over time began to appeal
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:43.360]   to a wider audience and apple so that's the way i've resupplied the product family and the i watch
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:46.960]   could be similar where the first ones because of all the technology they're going to put in
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:50.880]   are going to be towards that five hundred dollar mark that Andy mentioned but in a couple of years
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:55.920]   two three four years we could have a wide array from fifty dollars up to five hundred dollars again
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:59.600]   apple likes those hundred dollar or fifty dollar increments and they like spreading themselves
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:03.200]   out across i i have to say one of the things that comes out of this discussion
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:10.560]   is that it's obvious that there's a wide range of people with a wide range of of ideas what a
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:16.400]   watch is i mean Chad wants a velcro strap okay magnetic magnetic no no don't change your mind
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:21.760]   because that's the that's the point is wrist watches are super personal i i'm willing to spend
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:27.840]   a i'm a watch buff i'm willing to spend a lot of money on a watch and have um Andy perhaps is more
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:34.000]   utilitarian i mean i think that they're this is a very odd market for apple it's a but it's also
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.560]   so many little complicated things i mean i i have been hauling out like uh last week you saw me i
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:42.480]   was wearing my my microsoft spot watch that's from ten years ago because i've been hauling out
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.120]   anything that's a wearable technology to sort of remind myself of of the past and here is you know
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:52.240]   i've i've shown this before my the on hand like wrist pc and i can't wear it because look this
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:56.880]   crappy little jelly strap i gotta get rid of that after after you stop so that's that's going to be
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:01.600]   as important to the user as what the with this little x screen actually does and may i point out
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:07.120]   that people i don't know in what numbers but a fairly large number of people are paying fifteen
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:13.360]   hundred dollars for google glass but again it's totally different it's it's but not much utility
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:18.720]   no uh it's they're they're not buying it for a useful piece of technology they're buying it because
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:23.040]   here is something brand brand new that they can sort of start investigating that might even fit in
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:27.280]   perfectly with how they happen to use a computer uh this is this is like the i think this is the
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:30.960]   perfect way to introduce a product like that where you can charge fifteen hundred dollars because
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:36.080]   you're finding people who are ex journalists journalists accepted they're buying this because
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:40.560]   they are pre-selected to be interested in this sort of technology they're not going if they were
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.800]   a hundred bucks they wear it for about two days record some stupid stuff right about how what a
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:48.800]   piece of crap of this is with absolutely no purpose when you get people who are that interested
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:52.720]   as the first adopters though they're the people who's who can appreciate that look when i go on
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:57.440]   my five mile walk uh every day this lets me really stay tuned in with my environment and now i can
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:02.160]   record things that uh experiences that would have passed me by and blah blah blah blah blah blah
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:06.240]   so it's there's still a lot of steps to make it into a practical consumer product but
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:10.560]   the whole purpose of this experiment has always been let's make this and see what what people use
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:14.640]   with it if apple's making a real watch and i'm not even going up one hundred percent convinced
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:19.040]   that they're making a watch as opposed to something simply like a sports band they're gonna have to
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:24.400]   absolutely come off that block those starting blocks at full speed uh it's gonna have to be an
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:29.520]   iPhone launch it's gonna have to be an iPad launch it can't be like apple tv where they say hey or
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:33.280]   something here's something we're playing with and it's a hobby for us see if you like it we'll keep
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:39.680]   it on the on the i love what you rene and jason snell concluded that uh apple's not here to entertain
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:46.080]   us and that's i mean that was a good but that was a good article however damn this is entertaining
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:50.160]   yeah well the thing is we we actually had that conversation right after being on mac break together
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:54.800]   we went next door got some food and had that conversation and that that strikes two things for me one is
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:14:00.320]   that if apple makes a watch it discludes a large amount of the market people who want fashionable high
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:05.840]   end you know panorize or rolexes or people who have watches for diving because no one's gonna wear two
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:10.560]   watches at the same time or very few people but if it's a band you can wear it with a watch you can
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:14.240]   wear it without a watch you can wear it on the opposite arm from a watch you can even wear multiple
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:18.480]   bands if you want and look like you're you know have an arm from the 80s and that sort of feels
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:23.760]   more like an apple market but even taken as a band uh and ben baharen is very good at putting
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:29.760]   these numbers up there you would have to sell so many bands at such a high price to come anywhere
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:35.360]   near ipad or iphone money that it's hard to think of an i-watch as anything but an apple tv style
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:41.840]   ecosystem booster product for apple and not the next big thing this is why i think that android
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:48.400]   has the leg up on this is because if you use glass for a little while i realized immediately that
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:53.600]   this was just a boon until they get it off your face and onto your watch because oh it's interesting
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:15:00.880]   every swipe every swipe every gesture is makes is perfect for fitting onto a watch right where you
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:05.520]   have lots of screen real estate chat by the way that voice is chad johnson i'm the producer video
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:12.400]   guy and i an aware of a pebble yeah and i should point out that's was what i've been thinking about
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:17.600]   glass which is it is a laboratory for google it may not even be a product ever for google
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:21.920]   they want to understand wearables and i'm sure apple's watching with great interest how many of
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:27.520]   the apple design team you think are wearing glass and just like grenade bomb go ahead the the the
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:34.480]   the a bomb for google is google now and their notifications uh the more i see that as this system
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:39.520]   matures and i see what they're able to do in this little square that's two inches by two inches
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:44.080]   the amount of utility that they can deliver and the amount of information context perfect
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:49.360]   information they can deliver i think about how well this works in a google glass environment i
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:53.200]   think about how well it works on a watch screen i think about if google is actually going to come
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:58.880]   up with their own uh their own roku style box the idea of you're watching you're watching Netflix
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:03.920]   you're watching hulu and this ability for this tiny little little notification to ease in
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:07.600]   to tell you about something that oh by the way you know you have this appointment at four o'clock
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.760]   traffic is such that you should really leave right about now here is a map if you want to action
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:16.960]   your way into that map here's something you can do it is a secret sauce that adds so much
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:23.440]   zest and so much utility to a wide range range of products so that's i don't think apple has
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:27.840]   has quite as demonstrated the same sort of thing with syri and it's because that they have sort of
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:33.760]   cut syri off from that sort of visual communication and just like grenade and leo were saying there's
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:37.840]   no way that you're going to be able to make a watch for every person right but that's not what a
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:43.120]   google market that's not what google is promising that that's why you have lg and motor all smart
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:47.920]   make an api and get everyone and let as many people but apple can't do that apple's a hardware
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:52.320]   manufacturer and they don't have google now kinds of information because they've decided up
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:56.080]   a front that they don't want to and pin jump people's privacy and that's one of the that's really
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:01.440]   the one of the value proposition so vapos phones they both deliberately made card style interfaces
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:07.200]   for the post post pc interest there's no accident that they made google now and that they made syria
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:11.360]   the way that they made it as they were looking far beyond phone apple should sue google because
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:18.160]   they invented the card interface with hypercard way back when they're there be i get me my own
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:24.000]   house uh... you started leo yeah i'm in trouble now uh okay now let's move on to
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.840]   have iPhones four point seven inch phone that's smaller than the existing iphone five s
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.320]   and a five point five inch phone you think both
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:36.320]   right now it's four inches four point seven inches would be the size roughly of i thought
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:42.640]   a five was five inches it's four inches four inches oh my god that's so small how can you people use that
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:49.520]   we have hawk like vision no what was the question so the i've the five was four inches so what was
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:55.600]   the four of us three point five holy cow how did you use it almost a palm beer almost beer so
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:01.920]   and meanwhile there there i see jesus no over here with his what is it five and a half five point
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:08.000]   seven inch uh... galaxy s five taking pictures uh so really apple's gonna move into the into the
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.840]   modern world with a four point seven inch phone it's a sweet it's yeah that's my moto x and it's a
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:19.920]   perfect size by the way you can still hold it in the hand it feels good if they stay with four inches
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:23.600]   because a lot of people still do like four inch phones like if you look at the numbers of what sells
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:27.920]   especially in the north american market super-sized phones have not done as well here as they've done
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:32.080]   in asia and apple's done extremely well with four inch phone so if they keep that around
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:36.640]   even just to ease people out of them and go to four and four point seven uh that makes a lot of
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:40.560]   sense for me i've only heard about one bigger phone this year i've not heard about two that
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:44.560]   doesn't mean there's something bigger that just not being called a phone or i'm not hearing about it
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:50.160]   or is for later in the year or next year but i think to me if you move the five s whether you
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:54.960]   call it a five s year whatever down you introduce the four point seven one above that that sounds
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:59.280]   like a small amount of that might be what they do and i have to say i actually agree the four point
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:06.080]   seven is just right i've been carrying you know this htc one um and it's five inches and when i go
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:11.600]   back and touch my uh moto x which is four point seven i go you know what this is a better size this is
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:17.120]   the right size four point seven is a good size yeah i mean in any event if apple doesn't i feel as
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:20.800]   though apple has to do a larger screen phone at this point to the to the degree that apple has to
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:25.200]   do anything but i think that uh i think it would be a mistake to ignore the popularity of these
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:31.040]   larger screen phones and stick with that form factor that just if if they are serious about the
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:37.920]   the value of the iTunes content market uh god that's uh the iPhone is like the third or fourth
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:42.800]   device i would like to read a book on or watch a movie on at this point right it seems to me that
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:47.600]   there is a sweet spot maybe maybe i mean everybody's different san high-end sizes are different and
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:52.560]   so forth but it seems to me there is a sweet spot and after going back and forth with littler and
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:20:00.080]   smaller and stuff i have to say four point seven yeah feels like it's the sweet spot for everybody
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:06.320]   maybe i'm wrong i i had the uh i had the nochia fifteen twenty phone uh which is so big that i
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:11.760]   actually had to actually it's a very it's a very good two hand back i i actually had to like make a
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:16.960]   purchase of the grocery store to prove a theory that it is exactly as as big as one and a half pop
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:22.480]   tarts that's how big this telephone is pop tart and a half or now you can detect the pop tarts
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:27.520]   andy there you go or i don't care about deductions i want sponsorship deals i want to i want to be
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:33.600]   on these podcasts with like a pop tarts patch and a and a totally totally toria patch unlike that but
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:37.760]   yeah but that yeah i mean there is there is a sweet spot i do think i i did pull up my moto x
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:41.680]   just like you was believe it or not a few weeks ago to start like firing that up again and taking
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:46.800]   a look at it and there's something about that size that is it's larger than the iphone to give a
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:52.560]   much better air much more air to the user interface and also to content it's not as and it's not as
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:59.600]   overt as the htc one which is a brilliant phone but there are times when you feel like if you take
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:04.160]   this out in any environment it's all about how this hi this is me and i'm wearing i'm using my

[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:05.200]   yes and this is a really great one although this is going to be a little bit divisive i think
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:09.600]   90% of the people listening will say oh my god that's such an incredible thing i have no idea
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:15.120]   that was possible and 10% will be thinking oh my god i can't believe that feature has been around
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:19.520]   for so long and you're just think you're just hearing about it now uh but yes i just heard
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:24.720]   about this now if you look in the back of your cable box your hd cable box you will see a firewire
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.560]   port there yeah it looks like a firewire port because it is a firewire it doesn't do anything
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:37.440]   oh yes it does there was in 2004 there from 2004 afterward makers of hi def cable boxes
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:44.800]   are required to predict to have to include a firewire port that allows people to record tv shows
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:50.480]   in a digital format this preserves this preserves the v8 like the vhs sort of functions of analog
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:54.320]   television where you can just if you want to record dave and keep it you can put it cassette
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:58.480]   in so that's exactly what that port is although the cable companies don't really want to tell
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:03.840]   you about that so if you connect a firewire cable cable to that and whatever sort of mojo you need
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:09.840]   to hook it up to your to your thunderbolt thing you can actually record anything that's going on
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:16.960]   on your on your uh on your cable box there this is last night's letterman show recorded not not
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:24.240]   converted from analog to digital the pure 1080 HD digital screen what with that with no conversion
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:30.320]   what's so ever i do not think this is widely known at all and it and it and it works there's also
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:34.880]   there's also communication so all you need is that whatever cable that you need to get it done and I
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:40.160]   it cost me all of thirty five dollars to get the uh the right adapter uh and a free app called fire
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:46.320]   record that hasn't been updated in several years but it works uh and what it does multiple things for
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:52.720]   you uh the simplest thing that it does for you is you just whatever's coming uh whatever your cable
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:58.400]   box is playing if it's an unprotected channel it will just simply record whatever it's spitting out
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:05.920]   into a uh into an mpeg 2 file it can also actually control your cable box so you can actually tell
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:13.280]   it please tune in to cbs at at 1135 p.m. and record for one hour and then and then stop recording and
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:18.640]   stature to a file uh and again now it only does live right you can't take something you've dv
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:23.600]   yard or you can't know again this is the the function of this is to re is to make sure that
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:30.240]   people don't get cheated out of the normal functions of an analog v vcr so this morning i i i asked
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:35.200]   myself the same question if you have stuff that you've dv yard you can just simply start an instant
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:39.760]   recording essentially just push the record button on this app and then start playing something that
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:47.440]   you recorded like a month ago and you can capture all of that and in full hd the mpeg 2 it's mpeg 2 so
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:53.680]   you need to vlc uh the free video player to play it what i do instead is that i simply convert that
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:28:00.320]   file uh using a handbrake and convert it to just a basic mp4 and now you can use it in itunes you
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:06.160]   can sync it to your ipad you can edit it uh i i i really was interested in this because now that
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:11.600]   letterman is on his way out and maybe craig fergusson too i want to start like recording shows that i
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:18.640]   don't want i don't want to lose yeah on the block yep well he was looking into a rat hole he was
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:24.080]   turned the cbs decided to instead of making him the host of the late show to pay him the millions
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:28.480]   of dollars that contractually he's obligated to get if he's not offered the late show so that leaves
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:34.400]   a question of a are they interested in keeping him as the host of 1230 and or will craig be interested
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:39.920]   in keeping on as the most love him but yeah but so but this is something i've been missing for years
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:43.440]   and years and years ever since the digital changeover that sometimes there's a program
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:47.040]   you like so much you just want to keep it and be able to watch it again and again
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:52.000]   and don't think that this is limited just to broadcast channels i was recording it will depend
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.840]   on your cable lineup it any any channel that they have not scrambled or you're not put the DRM on
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:02.720]   it can record so i recorded a dv art show from a month ago that i recorded off the discovery channel
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:06.480]   a national geographic channel recorded just fine unfortunately i don't think it works with
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:12.080]   a turn of classic movies on my cable lineup but believe me i'm i'm i'm about to systematically test
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:20.000]   every single channel so if it's encrypted if it's a like hbo you cannot do this right it will record
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.760]   an hour of stuff but then it will not play because there'll be a mojo on the signal that says oh by
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:27.920]   the way this is protected so don't let this guy i think they're almost everything on my cable
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:33.360]   bucks that Comcast protects everything well it's broadcast channels are definitely not going to be
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:37.440]   locked because they're not allowed to lock up those channels that's the you're supposed to be
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:41.600]   able to just plug your cable if you if you're if you're subscribing to cable you're supposed to be
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:46.160]   able to uh if you're rather sorry if you have a cable in your house you're supposed to just plug
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:51.120]   that into the back with tv with a digital tuner and be able to get your local broadcast channels but
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:56.320]   as i found out and was a little bit surprised to find out with pleasure there are plenty of commercial
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:30:01.200]   channels uh on your cable box that are are at least on my system that are unlocked and fully
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:07.440]   recordable wow i've got i i've got like unfortunately see i've got like half of my uh half of my dvr hard
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:11.760]   drive tied up with stuff that i want to keep and some of the some of the stuffs been on there for
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:16.880]   about a year waiting for me to like i think i'm going to hook up my dvr my dvd recorder to the
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:21.760]   analog channels just uh bank up a coffee on copy on it and now i'm just gonna you know buying a hard
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:27.760]   drive to make sure i can keep these like 10 hours 20 30 hours of hdtv it is absolutely brilliant it
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:33.280]   works just great the worst thing that can that i can tell you is that once or twice uh fire record
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:37.920]   has lost its connection to the cable box in which case you quit you relaunch and it works just fine
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:42.720]   it really is as simple as i'm making itself but that makes a mac mini and even more well now do they
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:47.040]   have fire wire on the uh current it's i don't i don't have i don't have fire wire on the one
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:51.360]   what i've got here again a three dollar fire bar to thunderbolt adapter all you need is another
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:57.280]   adapter cable that will convert the uh the the letter v shaped letter u shaped connector to the
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:03.040]   mark the newer square type connector and that's it there's no fire record has all of the
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:06.800]   scheduling features and everything that you'd want yeah it's it's pretty basic it looks like
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:10.560]   something that could easily be done with apple script studio as a matter of fact i mean as you
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:17.200]   can see this really is the entire interface to it uh and so uh i i'm not sure if you do if you
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:22.000]   do you could definitely set it up to record your favorite programs directly i think it's simpler
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:27.040]   just to let your dvr do the job and then uh that'll record off the ones that you want unless
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:32.160]   you really do want to be an archivist and say i really want every episode of bobsburgers uh
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:35.440]   digitally in which case you can certainly do that the problem is though that if you
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:40.880]   are changing the channel while your while that thing is being recorded then your recording will
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:45.360]   have changing the channel to the amazing race or change the channel to 60 minutes or whatever so
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:51.520]   but but again it works it works it works and boy do i feel dumb for not finding this out until last
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:57.920]   we yeah now i can really can use my mac pro as a uh home theater pc you know actually you should
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:03.600]   buy a second one for that purpose though you know the guy the apple rev i've been talking to
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:08.720]   listens to mac break weekly and uh he called after i complained last week he said no no really we
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:13.520]   can look at your log will know it's been rebooting and it sent him the law he said yes but uh he also
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:19.040]   said now i uh as part of the uh process we ask you how you're using your mac pro and are you still
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:24.320]   using it as a home theater pc and i said that was just a joke i never it's i never meant to use it
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:31.280]   as a home theater pc but now with fire record maybe i will lovely i wish i wish i had i wish i knew
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:35.120]   about this when the Oscars was bersoring or the Grammys were airing or other things but yeah
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:39.600]   well you got ron Swanson on your tv that's a great one for me that's one of those buns because you get
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:45.280]   with the beard um rene richy your pick of the week so and he mentioned this actually earlier it's
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:51.840]   uh an app called screens vnc it's made by adovia and they've just released version three of the mac
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:56.960]   version of screens they've done the ios version redo a few months ago it was really really good the
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:02.960]   mac version is now out i believe it costs forty five or forty nine dollars but what it is is a
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:07.440]   vnc client so it lets you share the screen of other computers whether they're windows computers
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:12.800]   or mac computers or linux computers if you have that mac mini that you have in the closet or in
[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:19.200]   the server room you can access that if you have a linux box at the data center you can access that
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:25.120]   it's uh a very mac like experience there's tons of really good vnc clients available for the mac
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:29.920]   but not all of them are very mac like very few of them are actually mac like and adovia has taken
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:35.520]   a lot of time and effort to make it it's not an ios 7 makeover it's distinct from their ios 7
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:41.840]   apps that's right in it's sort of what i imagine maybe an apple ios 7 redesign for the mac would
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:46.800]   be like just very clear a lot of deference there's not a lot of chrome there and what chrome there
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:53.120]   is is easily hidden all you do is launch whatever computer you want to log into you log into it
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:57.680]   if you hold down the icon on the dockbar it'll give you a list of recently launched computers you
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:02.960]   can go instantly back to them it's sort of like apples back to the mac if it worked really really
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:08.160]   really well and i find myself using it all the time just to hook up to my podcasting machine to
[01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:12.880]   start a hangout if i'm in a different room or you know connecting to my mom's computer to help
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:18.080]   fix a couple things or change some settings and it's because it if you get the mac app store version
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:24.720]   which uses iCloud it'll sync all of your remote computers via iCloud and that means that everything
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:29.440]   you have on your iPhone and your iPad you also have on your Mac so you can do all the same things
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:34.240]   when you're out traveling with the device on LTE or or Wi-Fi and that just makes it a very nice
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:41.200]   solution for me by the way i i was not wrong Comcast does in fact encrypt basic cable
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:48.080]   i had an elgato and all of a sudden i couldn't use it anymore and that's because my in their
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:54.080]   infinite wisdom my cable company encrypts everything maybe local tv is not encrypted all
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:35:01.600]   i mean i'll have to try that the live tv but thank you Comcast once again the worst company in america
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:08.000]   about to get a lot bigger thank god yeah bigger and worse sir it just cracks me up when brian
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.880]   roberts the ceo of Comcast says we're modeling our company on apple in what way exactly you want
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:20.160]   to just the profits basically right yes because in no other way it's Comcast anything like apple
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:25.680]   uh my tip of the week maybe some of you will just throw up a little in your mouth when i mention
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:32.240]   it is office microsoft office they announced a very affordable personal subscription now for
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:39.200]   a single mac plus one ipad or where i guess you could use it on windows if you want uh 699 a month
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:47.280]   for office which includes word excel powerpoint one note and i think that i think it's 72 dollars
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:52.640]   for a year something like that um it's a it's a very affordable way to get office you know if
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:57.840]   you've ever gone to the store i remember the last office upgrade going you know office was at 2010
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:03.360]   or something i went to the store and it's like 800 dollars for a for the box of office i just
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:09.760]   couldn't do it i could not bring myself to write that check 699 a month not so bad uh and it includes
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:16.640]   though some cloud storage skype minutes and so forth so just an ask today i know most of you are
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:22.080]   very happy with other solutions for office but if you have to use a word for some reason or excel
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:29.280]   uh i'm glad that uh that there is a very affordable way to do it awesome deal yeah i think so i
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:35.280]   think so i actually have the ten dollar uh small business one um and that gives me five computers
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:39.440]   which is which is great so and that can be a mix a heterogeneous mix of pcs and mac so i have
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:44.240]   some windows and some macs they also promise that when they update office for the mac which is
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:49.920]   probably in the next year uh you'll get that automatically that's that your pay edition i'm
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:54.080]   glad that i'm glad that there's proving to be an actual upside to the subscription model at least
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:37:00.320]   for uh microsoft and adobe customers because it stinks to say that you're that you're gonna have to pay
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:04.320]   x dollars forever to get access to photoshop but at least they're saying well look here's the
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:08.400]   free things here's the her ways that we're extending and enhancing it for you uh so that maybe you
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:13.440]   will be happy to be spending money every month for this your life for the ability to edit photos
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:23.200]   andi and acco you are my man my man dude dude um that picture by the way that's been behind him
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:29.040]   again is boulder colorado in the beautiful flat iron mountains in boulder it is really pretty there
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:33.680]   and i know that because uh my son goes to school there and it just it's just gorgeous was it was
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:38.080]   it warming up a little bit when you were there god i packed up in the short sleeve shirts it was
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:42.400]   like in the sixties and seventies and then the day after i left it was like they got snow so
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:47.520]   yeah well welcome to boulder it took i've been going to this conference for 15 years and for
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:52.960]   the first six of it i had no idea how to pack for this for like i'll put us no one day and then
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:58.560]   80 degrees the next day it's awesome it's awesome he's easy my son is a complete you know native
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:04.720]   california never it's cost no once his whole life but he's a he's acclimated well he's snowboarding
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:10.240]   and everything loves it i wait it could do with some more oxygen at this altitude it's uh yeah
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:15.600]   it's it's it's it provokes a problem yeah you were but that's okay i'm huffing a little bit as i hike
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:23.040]   around town a lot of the sidewalks are very comfortable to sleep on thank you and he always
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:28.320]   a pleasure you can uh see his uh and and nakozomenac at five by five dot tv are you doing anything else
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:33.520]   you want to plug epic show 100 next week uh reviving reviving uh old tech news so that you can hear
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:39.920]   an audiobook version of my uh my uh tech my tech writings for the sun times and elsewhere uh and
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:44.560]   pretty much that's it so far where can we find old tech news uh also also going to be on the five
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:49.680]   by five network uh you will see it uh i've recorded a show yesterday and another show and another
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:54.800]   show is coming up on 30 so you read your old columns it's sort of exactly that's why i call it old tech
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:00.160]   news because by the time you get it it's probably about a week old oh it's not old but so but so long
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:05.520]   as so long as you know you put it out there i think it's okay you're reading the 1983 version of the
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:11.840]   nakoz exactly exactly all right and uh it's it's a lot of fun because i like the uh it seems to be
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:15.600]   the only way i can talk about a subject and make the show less than 30 minutes if i've actually
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:21.600]   written out 1500 words i can simply read it back so it's a it's a it's a lot of fun and i i i i
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:28.160]   i think it's it satisfies my urge to do a compact one topic show as opposed to uh nakozomenac
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:31.360]   which is what i mean what's what i think would make an interesting conversation today
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:36.160]   and then you realize that oh that episode was two hours long perhaps we should have some sort of a
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:41.760]   bell attached to a timer to to stop that from happening again it was fun but maybe it was more
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:48.640]   fun for me than to listen to well we'll look forward to episode 100 coming soon to five by five dot tv
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:56.720]   slash i-a rene richy does his share of podcasts too for mobile nations you can catch his work at imore
