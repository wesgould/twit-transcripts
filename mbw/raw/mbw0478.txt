[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.380]   Yep, we're going to talk about the new Windows.
[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.940]   Well, actually we'll talk a little bit about the new Windows laptop.
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.580]   But mostly we'll talk about the new Apple TV.
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.900]   The Apple quarterly results coming up in just a few minutes and a whole lot more.

[00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.980]   Every week on this show with Mac Break Weekly and Andy Anaka from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:01.980]   Hello.
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.980]   Hello.
[00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.980]   How are you today?
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.980]   And apparently the Hayward Fire Department.
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:06.980]   Yes.
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.580]   It's one of my favorite caps.
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.980]   I did someone's, I can't remember the fellow's name, but he's a firefighter.
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.500]   He sent me this hat, which I love, and also actual firefighter sweatshirt gear.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.180]   I think they call it a job shirt or a work shirt.
[00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.180]   And it is the warmest thing I own.
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.700]   The problem is though, I have to, sometimes I'm wearing this around the office and then
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.580]   I'm wearing the work shirt because I'm just cold inside the house.
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.580]   That also has the logo on it.
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.820]   Then I'll go out and then someone will think I'm a firefighter.
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.660]   I'm just like, "No, no, no, I'm not a firefighter.
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.460]   I'm not pretending to be a firefighter.
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.860]   I did a podcast for this night.
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.860]   I'm sorry."
[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.340]   Here's $80.
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.980]   Please forget this happened.
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.580]   Also joining us right now, the lovely and talented Renee Ritchie.
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.220]   Elio, how are you?
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.220]   Hey, you're not at home.
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.220]   Where are you?
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.220]   No, I am trial.
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.220]   It was too cold at home, so I left.
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.220]   I abandoned.
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.140]   Well, do you want to say where you are?
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.140]   Is it a secret?
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.300]   No, I'm in the Bay Area.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.740]   I couldn't make it up there, Sally.
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.420]   I was hoping I'd make it up there, but I finished two-
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.220]   You're in the Bay Area, I'm mad at you.
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.220]   I'm so mad at you.
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.220]   I tried.
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.220]   I tried.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.740]   I think someone has a briefing with Twitter that he can't talk about.
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.740]   Twitter?
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.740]   The Twitter wants to talk to you.
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.940]   Well, it's nice to have you.
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.460]   Also, Jim Dowrympel, he is sporting a chappo as well.
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.460]   Just to fit in.
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.660]   What's up on the top and the bottom of my hand.
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.660]   And the bottom.
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.140]   What is the hat there?
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.140]   That's it.
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.580]   Looks like you've been wearing that Bruins hat since 1924.
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.580]   Never heard of them.
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.580]   I love it.
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.580]   Austin Bruins, baby.
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.580]   Oh, man.
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.420]   You know, it's funny because I was talking to a guy from Scotland on the radio show.
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.420]   Great school accent.
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.460]   And I said, I said, "Well, tell me now.
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.540]   What's your favorite football team?"
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.940]   He says, "Oh, no, I think I know what it was."
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.100]   I said, "Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.740]   You're lost by a point in the rugby world, World Cup, to the Australians."
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.580]   He said, "Oh, I don't care about that.
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.140]   I'm a Bruins fan."
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.580]   But that was a little odd.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.420]   But hey, hey, hey.
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.780]   You're a Canadian Bruins fan.
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:18.780]   It's okay.
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.540]   Great to have you.
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.500]   We are all wearing hats to take except for you, Renee.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.180]   You might want to look in your closet there.
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.380]   I'm not wearing a hat out of protest for the spring box losing to the All Blacks.
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.380]   Ah.
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.180]   I hate it when that happens.
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.180]   I know.
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.180]   That's intimidating, man.
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.300]   They can just do the Zulu dance to counter it.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.340]   I'm sure the Zulu dance would be the hot guy, but they don't want to break it out.
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.980]   So I'm wearing in honor of the new Tuit Chappo.
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.420]   The folks at Fezzorama decided to branch out a little bit, and they're now making something
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.140]   they call a Chappo.
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.300]   It's not quite a Fezz.
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.020]   It still has a tassel.
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.740]   This is the official Tuit one.
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.260]   I think that's pretty nifty.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.340]   Actually, it was Andy.
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.420]   You brought this to my attention.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.220]   You saw them at a Comic Con.
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.700]   I immediately ordered one for all of you.
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.460]   You will be all getting your Christmas Chappo.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.420]   A new tradition.
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.420]   Best boss ever.
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.980]   Nice one, Patrick.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.100]   I had your boss.
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.140]   I am using a little bit, something a little bit different today.
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.220]   I am not using my official MacBook, as I often do.
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.220]   Is this heresy, Leo?
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.860]   Are you going to commit heresy rather than shown?
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.940]   Kind of is heresy.
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.660]   But I was really intrigued after reading the Wired Magazine article about the new Microsoft
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.740]   Surface Book, and that's what I have right here.
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.420]   Because it was so clear in the Wired article that Panos Panay and his team really had
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.100]   one and only one goal, which was to take on the MacBook.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.220]   It was like Microsoft just, there was a burrow to their satellite.
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.140]   He wanted to duplicate Apple's design team.
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.260]   The Wired article goes into their secret design room with the CNC millers and all of
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.940]   the different 3D printers where they're worrying away making prototypes.
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.980]   They talked about the prototypes that they made.
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.540]   Was it like the Dell trailer, Leo?
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.180]   Was it like the Michael Dell trailer?
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.980]   It was very much that Bizarro, Johnny Ive.
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.940]   They did come up with something, as you know, you've probably all seen the videos and are
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.940]   unboxing and stuff.
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.420]   They came up with something very unusual, especially with that hinge.
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.860]   But a couple of things that I was interested in.
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:39.020]   One is 3x2, which is something Apple doesn't do except on their iPads.
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.180]   It's a kind of a non-traditional shape for laptops.
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.580]   It's old-fashioned.
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.780]   And I kind of like it.
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.180]   I first experienced it on a Chromebook Pixel and I kind of like it.
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:55.020]   But the other thing they do, which is I think more important to people who use Macs and
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.300]   more of an interest, is it's a touchscreen.
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:05.820]   I have used several touch screen windows machines now.
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.220]   I feel like the more I use it, the more I wish Apple would do one.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.300]   I guess that's what I should say.
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.300]   This is also interesting.
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.460]   When you read the article, they designed a laptop.
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.460]   They designed a laptop that looked frankly a lot like a MacBook.
[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.300]   And then they said, "Well, what can we do that's different?"
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.980]   And really, for more purposes of being different than really, I think people, how people use
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.980]   it.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:28.980]   I should be able to do this.
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.300]   Could pull back a little bit again.
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.180]   I'm going to push this magic button.
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.180]   There's a click.
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.140]   And then you can take the top off.
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.220]   Now, it's not the first convertible we've ever seen.
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.020]   But this is kind of like the iPad Pro.
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:46.620]   It's a 13-inch 3x2 tablet.
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.260]   But in order to do this, they had to do all sorts of weird stuff like this.
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:54.340]   It has its own battery, obviously, which makes it quite heavy.
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.340]   And it also means that it's top-heavy.
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.940]   And so that's why they had to do the weird hinging thing to spread the base out so the
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.140]   thing wouldn't just fall up, flop over.
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.820]   They'd all make all these sacrifices.
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.740]   They also, and again, I have to think this is a shot against Apple's bow.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.620]   They call this the pen.
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.820]   And it has an eraser.
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.220]   So it's not a pencil.
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.220]   Pencils are supposed to have erasers.
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.500]   No, it's not a pencil.
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.420]   It's a pen.
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.060]   And I'm going to use the...
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:28.780]   It's not...I haven't played with the Pro yet, as I know you have all three of you, I think,
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.500]   play with the iPad Pro.
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.260]   But this is a paint program that comes with it.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:40.820]   And I think the latency is a little bit higher than it is on the Pro.
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.460]   But it's still kind of cool to be able to do this.
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.220]   And this is something you can't do.
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.180]   And I'll show you a product camera if that's maybe a little bit more.
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.180]   There we go.
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:53.020]   It really is kind of...
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.900]   It's kind of a bit like erasing.
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.300]   Tiger, tiger, burning bright.
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.300]   But there is...
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.460]   I guess you feel a little...
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:02.820]   This doesn't seem too late to me.
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.380]   I wish you were here, Renee, because you're the graphic design guy.
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.860]   You're the artist, and you probably have more of an opinion.
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:09.860]   I tried one.
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.660]   They had one at the shopping mall the other day.
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.900]   And I went and tried it.
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.900]   It felt very...
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.900]   I've used the previous Surface Book.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.900]   And it felt very Surface Book.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.900]   I mean, that's...
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.300]   Like the Surface Pro, you mean, yeah.
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.300]   Yeah.
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.300]   And they've...
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.540]   Microsoft's been doing ink for a long time and pens for a long time.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.540]   And they're really good at it.
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.460]   It's not quite the same as a pencil, because Apple did that thing where you could turn
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.700]   it sideways and shade.
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.180]   And it's a very different experience.
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.220]   Yeah, you don't have any of that capability here.
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.220]   Yeah.
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.220]   But you do have interchangeable nubbies.
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:39.380]   I hated those on the Wacom because I would just end up putting my favorite on there and
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.380]   keeping my favorite on.
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.620]   Yeah, this just comes with one.
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.380]   You have to go out and buy the other ones.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.180]   I do think this is kind of interesting.
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.220]   Anyway, I guess my main point is not so much...
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.980]   I think this is a really interesting product.
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:57.260]   And I do have to say that there just sometimes feels like it's a very natural thing to touch
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.260]   the screen.
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.260]   You know...
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.260]   You get a tablet, it has to be.
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.260]   Once you take the screen off, you have to have the tablet.
[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.700]   There's no keyboard and mouse anymore.
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.700]   Right.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.060]   But also, let me see if I can find something that Mr. Dalron put a proof of.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.060]   ACTC?
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.060]   I'm looking.
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.540]   I don't have anything...
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.540]   Come on, fork with me.
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.540]   It's flat.
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.780]   There's a wide assortment of heavy metal, a bit more proof.
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.500]   Yeah, but I don't own any of it.
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.580]   Unfortunately, this is Microsoft Groove.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.260]   Well, no, I do at home.
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.820]   This is just the stuff that's in Groove, right?
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.980]   So Sublime is the closest I can come.
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.540]   And I can't play any of it because it's all explicit.
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.060]   But yeah, I say...
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.340]   And then of course, you have to put the on/off button on the lid because...
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.860]   And the speakers have to be on the lid.
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.580]   And there's all sorts of sacrifices you have to make.
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.580]   But I do think that the...
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:47.580]   A couple of things are interesting.
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:56.020]   Is that Microsoft was so driven by competition with the MacBook.
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.060]   When they decided to make a laptop, they didn't say, "Oh, let's beat Lenovo."
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.060]   They said, "Let's beat Apple."
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.060]   Which I think was strange.
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.060]   They all put spy on it.
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.060]   There we beat Lenovo.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.980]   Yeah, it wasn't that hard, was it?
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:09.020]   Well, I mean, that's when the great influences that Apple has over other companies.
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.020]   I mean, it really just shows you that there are people who are willing to spend extra
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.420]   money for something that really looks and feels great.
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.780]   And it also means that it illustrates...
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.420]   I heard about this in the Sun Times a couple of weeks ago.
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.620]   It really illustrates one of the challenges that Microsoft has where Microsoft is the only...
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:29.140]   Microsoft, Apple can basically make a decision and suddenly it's the most important decision
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.940]   that affects the entire product line.
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.420]   Microsoft, they can only suggest really and then Dell and HP and the rest.
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.980]   They're gonna go and make something that they can sell millions of to mostly corporate
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.900]   people and to users who don't have an emotional connection to their hardware.
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.900]   It's just the Toyota.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.620]   They can put the key in and go.
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.620]   So Microsoft is in the position where they have to build machines like this because no
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.620]   one else will.
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.620]   I think it's fantastic.
[00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.620]   Yeah.
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.540]   I also mean, the first machine that really affected me as a laptop with a touchscreen
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.500]   was actually the first Chromebook Pixel.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:05.700]   And even though it was not a detachable tablet, the fact that if you're using your phone for
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.540]   three or four hours and you're using a website, something in your brain makes you want to
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.780]   go out and touch something that's obviously a big touch button.
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.820]   And there are times where you just want to scroll just by resting your hand next to it
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.100]   and flicking your thumb.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:22.260]   I don't think that Apple's being left behind by not having a touch in the desktop.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.940]   But I do think there may be missing a trick.
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.380]   Yeah, I, you know, there's this go ahead, Jim.
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.980]   I don't think it's needed.
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:31.980]   I don't know.
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:32.980]   I don't.
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:38.740]   I mean, you know, Microsoft is trying to differentiate themselves in a way that I don't
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.740]   think is necessary.
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:40.740]   Yeah.
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:47.820]   You know, I mean, people when they sit down at a computer, I don't think that they really
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.460]   need to touch.
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.780]   I just, I don't think that they need to do that.
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.900]   I don't think most people want to do that.
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.580]   It's not normal.
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:04.220]   So Microsoft went all in on this one operating system, you know, across all product lines.
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.940]   And I think that they made a mistake, but they're, they went all in.
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.420]   Well, certainly hurt them with Windows 8, 8.1.
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.620]   I think Windows 10 is interesting because they've gone back to the desktop metaphor.
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.860]   And you really, you see a little bit of the tablet stuff, but not much.
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.460]   But I might disagree with you on the touch.
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.900]   I really have gotten both of the Chromebook Pixel in this.
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.380]   And I think it's because I use tablets.
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:28.140]   I just, it seems natural, not all the time to use touch at all.
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.860]   It's an adjunct to mousing and keyboarding.
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.660]   Every, every once in a while there's a button you want to hit or you want to, it just,
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:38.340]   there's, there are times when the touch is a natural thing, even on the arm's length
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.380]   experience of a, of a desktop computer.
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.100]   What I find interesting is that Apple, it's not that Apple's not doing touch, it's just,
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.740]   they're not doing direct touch on the desktop.
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.420]   They're doing a lot of gestures and a lot of, and they're in force touch and force press.
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:52.220]   But they're doing it through the trackpad or they're doing it through the magic mouse.
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.660]   And it's, it's intermediated, but it's, it's in a position where you're used to for normal
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:56.660]   computing.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.140]   And you're going through the trackpad to sort of touch objects, press into objects,
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.740]   press through them, swipe through them.
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.380]   People who use the iPad with a keyboard, sometimes they complain that they have to take
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:11.300]   their hands off because the iPad is getting much better now with iOS 9 and, and things
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.300]   like command tab and the shortcuts.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.060]   But you sometimes have to take your hands off and then reach for the monitor.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.580]   And that's, that's not perfect either.
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:24.380]   So we're sort of this interesting place now where these two, the touch of the tablet and
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.020]   the keyboard and mouse and the, you know, sort of coming together and everyone's trying
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.740]   to figure out what the optimal expression of both are.
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:34.460]   But I just don't think that we're at the point where, where Microsoft thinks that we
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.460]   are.
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.460]   Or, or where they want to.
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.420]   But Jim, have you never reached out after using an iPad and touch your, your laptop,
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.420]   your screen?
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.420]   No, never.
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.420]   No.
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.420]   Kind of know so many people, including myself.
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.420]   Yeah.
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.420]   I have to do that.
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.420]   Interesting.
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.220]   Because it has a keyboard and a touchscreen and people will have to again try to use both.
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.220]   And it's the size of a laptop now.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.220]   Yeah.
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.780]   Well, it's, it's, it seems odd to me.
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:59.540]   But then again, when you use a keyboard on an iPad and you have to take your hands off
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.900]   the keyboard and, and touch the screen to do things, I find that odd too.
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:10.900]   You know, I, I think that the mobile devices, like the iPad should be used as an iPad, or
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.940]   at least that's how I feel most comfortable in using them.
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.420]   But when you throw in a keyboard, then it just gets kind of weird.
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.020]   And that's Microsoft's whole thing.
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:26.180]   You know, and I just, I don't agree with the whole, you know, one operating system across
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.180]   the board.
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.500]   I don't think it's a great way to go.
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.500]   Yeah.
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.940]   I mean, that's clearly Apple's plan is there's a touch first operation and that's iOS.
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.940]   Right.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.580]   And then there's a mouse operating system.
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.820]   I feel like the mousing operating system, even even Apple feels like is maybe getting
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:41.820]   old fashioned.
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.500]   I feel like Apple's turn is definitely a disaster.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.380]   I'm glad I'm glad it's there is an option though.
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:55.420]   And also, you have, it's just too such distinct philosophies about the, about the direction
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.860]   of computing.
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:02.500]   I think that Apple's is really good in that it's, you know, you're optimizing one experience
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:07.980]   for the tablet, one experience for the desktop, but it does assume that someone is, can either
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:12.420]   afford to have two separate devices or is even interested in having two separate devices.
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:16.460]   Microsoft is optimized towards we're going to sell you one device that is going to be
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:23.820]   a beautiful Intel Core i5 i7 or even core M based desktop windows machine that works
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:24.820]   great.
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:29.780]   It attaches to your nice 4k monitor, attaches to all these other sort of other sort of things.
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.980]   But when you need it to be a really lightweight, convenient tablet for gaming or for content
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.780]   creation or just reading comic books, if you feel as though you're in a situation where
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:42.020]   you'd rather have a tablet, we're going to let you just simply pop off that screen and
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:46.060]   or fold the fold the screen backward and give you that experience.
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:50.940]   So we don't know who's going to win, but I think we're all agree that the winner is
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.740]   the consumer when they get to choose between different attitudes as opposed as opposed
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.100]   to two or three companies trying to clone off each other.
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.420]   If you're going to copy Apple, at least to at least innovate around it a little bit.
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.940]   Well, copy forward is the metaphor, right?
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:08.020]   Like companies that don't copy exactly, kind of they don't contribute anything, but companies
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.740]   and Apple, Apple does that too.
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.660]   Apple, yeah, they very seldom are the first person into a space, but they almost always
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.060]   are the first one to mainstream it and they do that by copying for it.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.940]   They take great ideas and they make them super accessible.
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.180]   And I think if you take that approach and you find what works best and you add the next
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.620]   thing to it, then we then you start to get a good synergy.
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:29.940]   I think that's exactly what we're all hoping for with the Apple TV when it comes up.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:35.780]   That Apple will have taken the ideas that they've used in the past and that other people have
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:41.660]   used and that they will make this a truly interactive type device that we're going to
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.340]   be able to use for TV.
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:49.420]   Did you guys get on the internet about, I don't know, was it midnight?
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.420]   Was it surely after?
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.220]   I set my alarm every hour to go off Leo because Apple wouldn't say when they were going to
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.220]   be available for the first one.
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:58.500]   They just said, went off at 12, went off at 1 at 2 and 5, I think 538 or something that
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.500]   were finally available.
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:05.300]   Yeah, because I gave up and I got up at 6 in the morning on Monday morning and I saw,
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.980]   oh, and I ordered one, but I don't know if I'm going to get it by the end of the week.
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.340]   You have to get rush shipping.
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.340]   I did get rush shipping.
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.980]   Okay, then you should get up by Friday.
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.740]   I hope I will.
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.980]   That's not always the case.
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:20.740]   If you ordered it later in the day, right, they were sold out.
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.060]   Do you remember to get the accessories, Leo?
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.060]   Oh, crap.
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.060]   What accessories?
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.860]   So I got, so you can only use one Siri remote with an Apple TV.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:28.860]   It only pairs at a one-to-one relationship.
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.340]   And it comes with that, right?
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.340]   Yes.
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.340]   What are you, multiplayer gaming?
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.300]   You need either iOS devices or you need the MFI game controllers.
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.740]   Okay, but we all have iPhones.
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.020]   Well, this deal series of game pass.
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.340]   But you think an iPhone wouldn't be a good choice on the new Apple TV?
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:45.500]   You know, the remote app, I'm presuming there'll be a new version of remote app that'll
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.940]   let you do a lot of things.
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.940]   But I think for gaming, it's going to be the difference in using a glass surface and
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.220]   using actual game style gamepad.
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:58.180]   I have to admit, when I really looked at the page and I saw what they're doing with this
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:02.060]   remote, the remote is the most interesting part of this, isn't it?
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.420]   And I did buy 64 gigs.
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.180]   I don't know if I, I don't know why.
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.380]   I just thought, well, it might need it.
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.380]   So think about is cash.
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.980]   The best way to think about it, because it's been confusing for some people, is that the
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:16.140]   Apple TV uses on-demand resources and bitcodes.
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.980]   So Apple has three technologies called app spinning.
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.860]   One is app slicing, which you don't need on the Apple TV because it has its own binary.
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.020]   So that's built in.
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.940]   But on-demand resources, like I had a PS3 and I would go to update a game and it would say
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.500]   four gigabytes downloading, please go have lunch and come back.
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.500]   It was maddening.
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.060]   So what this does is it downloads 200 megabytes immediately and that can be enough to get
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.980]   you going and then streaming a game.
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.940]   Yeah, so that could be like the introductory video.
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.340]   It could be the first level and then it starts downloading two gigabyte chunks and you can
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.620]   have up to 20 gigabytes and it'll just download them in stages.
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.180]   And when something's old, like you've watched a tutorial video, you don't need that taking
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.180]   up space anymore.
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.260]   So it'll just delete that and it'll download it again if you need it, but it doesn't take
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.420]   up your storage.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.340]   So if your Apple TV is empty, it'll just keep a ton of stuff on it.
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:02.220]   As it starts to get filled, it'll keep the most recent and most frequently used stuff
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:06.340]   live and delete the stuff that is infrequently used or very old.
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.620]   So the bigger the device, the more cash space you have.
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:12.820]   So the more likely it is to have movies still in the cash and the more likely it is to have
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.140]   more game levels and more game videos in cash.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.900]   So it just means that you won't have to worry about downloading things as much.
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.740]   And now as I look at it on the website, it says available to ship three to five business
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.820]   days for both memory configurations.
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.380]   Go ahead, Dan.
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:32.180]   How does that drive with Apple actually saying they've actually gone ahead and said that
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:36.660]   put an explainer on this website about the difference between 32 and 64 saying that if
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.060]   you intend to basically use it as a streaming box, you'll probably be okay with 32.
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.780]   If you intend to run a lot of apps, you'll probably be happier with 64.
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.940]   I don't recall them doing an explainer like that on the phones or the iPads or anything
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:48.940]   else.
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.180]   Yeah, so the Apple TV is different.
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.460]   On the iPhone and iPad, they still let you, if you try to download a game and you run
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:57.340]   out of space, it'll say please delete stuff and make space and then you can download it.
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.940]   And they didn't want you to ever have to deal with that on a game console or in a TV box
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.460]   because it's just like a box coming up and saying, oh, you're out of memory.
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.460]   We can't download this movie.
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.820]   We can't download this game.
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.540]   They just thought that would be a horrible experience.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:11.980]   So on demand resources is designed to sort of intelligently manage that.
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.300]   So if you have low bandwidth, for example, you'll want the 64 because if you just watch
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.820]   a movie and someone else in the family wants to watch it, it won't have the chances are
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.620]   it'll still be there in the cache and you can just watch it again.
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.940]   Or if you have a slow connection or if you share your connection.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.620]   So anything where cache is a value to you, the bigger one is going to be great.
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.260]   But if you're fine with an Apple TV now, the current Apple TV only has eight gigabytes
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.940]   of storage and you can just stream everything.
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.260]   Because there's no apps.
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.260]   I mean, it's just whatever.
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:37.260]   Yeah.
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.260]   It's not so cool.
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.780]   There's a separate cache for movies and a separate cache for ads.
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:45.620]   So apps use on demand resources, movies and TV shows just use caching.
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:50.980]   I noticed that they on the Apple site are starting to show some games and they show
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.860]   this third party controller.
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.460]   Apple's not making a game controller.
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.460]   Is that right?
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.100]   Yeah, they have a made for iPhone program and the SteelSeries Nimbus is the one that
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.100]   they were using in all the demos.
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.100]   Is that the one to get you think?
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.100]   Oh, it's tight.
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.100]   I guess I got three of them.
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.100]   Yes.
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:10.420]   But on the other hand, this isn't going to be a PS4 or Xbox One style gaming or is it?
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.940]   I mean, it's weish I think is the best.
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.260]   Yeah, because it's not we're not talking a super fast process or practice.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.700]   I'm hoping that things like you because one of the problems with the way that the on demand
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:24.500]   resources works is that people who make the traditional large style triple A title games,
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.620]   they worry they will not be able to fit things into Apple's app slicing model.
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.460]   So my hope and I'm not a game developer.
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:34.500]   So this might be completely absurd is that things like the Unreal Engine and Unity will
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.780]   start building that into the platform so that when when the games are created, they will
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:43.100]   be sliced in a logical fashion for the developer.
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.100]   And that would be the great way to do that.
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.100]   Yes.
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:53.780]   To be able to have something like that so that developers could write around the core, which
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:57.100]   will automatically be available on the machine.
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:07.220]   So you're downloading a 10 megabyte app instead of or 20 or 30 instead of a gigabyte or two
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.540]   or 20 like the play stick.
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:12.820]   Jim, are you going to be buying guitar hero 50 bucks right out of the blocks?
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:13.820]   Is that the first game?
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:14.820]   No, I can't.
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.060]   I can't play it because you're a real guitar player.
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:22.380]   Because I started to play the real port and it drives me crazy because I could guitar
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.380]   players guitar.
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:28.340]   Well, that should say everything anybody needs to know, frankly.
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.700]   You're not learning a skill that you're going to be able to translate into rock and roll
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:32.700]   heaven.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:37.860]   And then when you start playing and I start playing the real chords or something where
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:43.980]   I try to, then the crowd boos me and I get mad and I try to.
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.780]   You're going to be the one that has to get that accessory strap for the remote control
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.540]   so he doesn't accidentally fly through the TV screen.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.220]   What do you mean that's not how you play sweet style money?
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.220]   Yes, it is.
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.940]   I have a pick.
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.860]   I've been with slash.
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.460]   I was standing next to slash yesterday.
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:06.700]   I just I just hope that Apple isn't going to like impose their own definition of Apple
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.820]   TV on the developers and on the users.
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.300]   We talked before about how they've already said that we're not that they're not going
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.780]   to let like productivity style apps get on board.
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.260]   There's been a whole lot of been talking to a bunch of developers who said that they've
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:23.620]   had a lot of their apps rejected already by for a lot of the same reasons that early
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.780]   iPhone apps got rejected where they're saying, well, that's not really a useful app.
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:27.820]   It doesn't really do anything new.
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:28.820]   It doesn't do this.
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.700]   We don't we don't think that your your app is very good.
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:36.300]   Hopefully it'll follow the same road as the iPhone did where they want to make sure that
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:41.020]   the first consumer experience with the Apple TV app store is really, really positive where
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:45.020]   every single app that they download is a killer game or something that really defines what
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.020]   the Apple TV is going to be about as entertainment box.
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:52.700]   And then maybe a year from now, they'll start to loosen up the handcuffs because I'm a huge
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.300]   fan of this device.
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:58.340]   It's so disappointing that not going to do I work for it because really, there's so if
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.780]   they had you said I work for the Apple TV, did I miss something?
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.380]   I'm saying it's too bad.
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:06.540]   They're not going to do I work for the Apple TV.
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:12.100]   It's too bad that there isn't any any web view technology built into it because if they
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:17.420]   could just if they had a web browser and productivity app, something that is like an office suite,
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:22.140]   and like every school could then simply say, great for $150 per seat, we can equip every
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.660]   single seat in this lab with a with an Apple TV.
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:30.900]   And if a developer could create something that could teach programming trust, it's it's really
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.460]   is it's such a capable device.
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:35.700]   When you look at the hardware that's inside it, when you look at the API that are built
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:38.740]   into this, what it can do, it really is an iOS computer.
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:43.500]   And we've already been had it demonstrated that there's very little that iOS can't do.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.220]   So it's it's it's it's not mind boggets.
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.780]   It's very understandable way.
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.020]   Apple's taking this position.
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:54.540]   But boy, if they if they were to allow this to become everything that it could be, it
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.380]   would really set a lot of people back on their butts.
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:04.340]   Has anybody heard about other music services or video services being allowed on Apple TV?
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.340]   I haven't.
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.820]   But you know, this is a bidding.
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.500]   Well, we've apparently we've already we have a third party.
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:13.540]   Developers already submitted a Twitter app.
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.540]   So I have heard of that.
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.820]   I mean, is that what you mean?
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.420]   Or do you mean like CBS?
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.060]   I mean, like Apple music type of thing.
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.060]   Oh, Spotify.
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.860]   I mean, yes, Spotify.
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:29.100]   Yeah, wonder because I presume the Apple would not encourage that, right?
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:33.100]   Because Apple music is going to be part of this, but we all know the problems that Apple
[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:37.340]   music has Pandora is on the old Apple TV.
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.260]   You think it'd be on the new one?
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:42.620]   Well, I mean, look at music and photos here.
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:43.620]   Let's see what they say.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.180]   They'll probably say and it supports Apple music.
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.180]   Well, yeah.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.180]   Yeah.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.180]   Yeah.
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.180]   So there's two things that the developers have to make it to and Apple's not going to
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.860]   force them or pay them to make the stuff.
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.940]   So and then once they make it, Apple has to approve it.
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.100]   Well, that's the question is Apple going to approve it.
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.100]   They have an iOS.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.460]   I would see no read and they would have such pressure on them if they didn't that it doesn't
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.460]   make.
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:07.060]   But you know, to Andy's point, like there is WebKit does exist is you mean, you're basically
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.580]   running a special version of iOS, the same as a watch.
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.580]   They just made them private.
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.260]   So developers can access that.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.180]   Let's talk about that because we've been.
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:20.180]   So what I'd heard as Andy is that you can't just as many as often happens on iOS frame
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.180]   a web page on there using that.
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.180]   That's intense.
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.420]   So I think the idea there was they wanted people to make native apps and not just make
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:32.300]   a UI or a WK web view or a Safari view controller and stick your website inside it, which
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.220]   you might have done to be there on day one.
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.260]   So this and who knows what the future is going to hold, but also loading WebKit is a very
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:44.140]   large framework and there's a Siri and Don Milton went into it on one of his shows.
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:47.220]   It was a really good explanation that there are some devices that are primary and web
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.300]   first devices and there are some devices that are secondary and not web first.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:54.340]   They don't need the web to drive like the watch where it doesn't make as much sense to
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.660]   have all that stuff and you really do benefit from the native experience.
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:02.700]   And it sort of is a gentle nudge towards, you know, don't just make a web gateway and
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:06.220]   then try to load a bunch of content each time, but really make a good native experience.
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.820]   They don't have Bluetooth keyboard support on this Apple TV either.
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.980]   It was on the last one, but it's not on this one.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.260]   It's really designed not to be a computer.
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.260]   Yeah.
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:20.900]   And, you know, when you look at a true entertainment device and that's what they're going for
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:26.020]   here, you know, like a console, but with some extra things.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:33.420]   So for light gaming, for entertainment purposes, for music, for videos, for all of this stuff,
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:37.620]   and then you add in the new remote and Siri and, you know, all the things that you can
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:38.620]   do with that.
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.860]   It's a very compelling device.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.500]   I'm looking forward to it myself.
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:49.300]   And you know, I don't, these days I don't look forward to pretty much anything that has
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.980]   Apple music on it, but you know, still bitter.
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:58.620]   Let me ask Renee about the Steel series.
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.860]   Can I do I have to order from Apple?
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:06.660]   Is the made for Apple version the same as the regular one?
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.980]   I'm looking at it on Amazon for 64 bucks.
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.780]   I think they're all MFI compliant.
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:16.660]   I was double-fected to make sure, but MFI is a certification program that is tested and
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.660]   works with it.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:18.660]   And it means like it's a good thing.
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.660]   What's made for iPod?
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:20.660]   Is that?
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.740]   Yeah, as far as I can tell, there's only one MFI program.
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.940]   So if it's MFI certified, it works.
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.020]   And that was when we tried the demo and they worked really well.
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:30.980]   All right.
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.180]   So I guess, but it's on the keyboard thing.
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:38.980]   How much was the Steel series on Apple store?
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:39.980]   Was it 65 bucks?
[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:40.980]   There about something like that.
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:42.140]   Yeah, there was a huge disparity.
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.140]   Yeah, all right.
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:46.980]   Yeah, they had that, like for the keyboard thing, I missed it because I used it, but apparently
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:51.980]   the percentage of people who used it was low single digit and it's mostly developers.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:55.820]   So it's one of those things where I hope they added back in, but in terms of shipping,
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:57.700]   I understand why I didn't make it in the first cut.
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.500]   Yeah, I hope it's coming in a next generation.
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:04.820]   I mean, I keep, of course, this is where I do a lot of my messing around with hardware.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.220]   So of course, I got a whole bunch of Raspberry Pies and stuff here.
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:12.020]   And one of the reasons why this is such a great device is that the developers basically
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.060]   said, "All we're going to give you is a box of potential and you can put whatever you
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.780]   want on it, you can build whatever you want on it.
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:21.300]   We're not going to artificially limit what can be done with this."
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:25.820]   And so if you want to use it as an educational PC that runs something like Office in a web
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:26.820]   browser, great.
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.500]   Go ahead, compile that app and go ahead and release it.
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:32.780]   If you want to do it as a core for a robot, go ahead and do it pretty much, everything
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.020]   you want to do, go ahead and do it.
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:39.260]   There's even a box, it runs Plex, you can basically put into a nice case and basically
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:43.380]   use this as an Apple TV if you want to and it'll hook up to whatever Plex or re-art you
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:48.020]   got connected to, work with the keyboard, work with all that other sort of stuff.
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:54.180]   So all I'm getting at is that it's just too bad that sometimes the company that creates
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:57.380]   something is incapable of finding the awesome inside it.
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:02.980]   And the only people who can do that are a million different, totally insane people who
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.500]   want to do that one thing that nobody's ever thought of that's maybe applicable to 12
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:10.420]   people, but then they do it so well that it totally redefines the thing.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:14.380]   And again, they found the awesome that wasn't to be found anywhere inside Cupertino.
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:19.100]   So when they do things like saying we're arbitrary, excuse me, I don't mean arbitrarily, when
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:23.340]   if they were to decide not just simply as something we haven't gotten to, but as something
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:27.220]   that we think is wrong for the product, we're not going to make this work with a keyboard,
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.220]   that kind of disappoints me.
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.660]   And when they say that we're going to limit the sorts of apps you can release for this,
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:32.700]   that kind of disappoints me.
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:37.300]   But as we've seen with other devices, let's wait a year to see where they are in app approvals
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.300]   in a year from now.
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:44.860]   Andy, don't you find that Apple over the years has done this quite successfully in other
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:51.380]   product lines where they say, you know, we've kind of laid out how we want this to look
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:57.460]   and how we want it to act functionality, form everything.
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:03.980]   And we want everything to work like this.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:09.660]   And that's fine because then they open it up a bit later and say, okay, now you can start
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:10.780]   doing other things.
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:16.020]   But it seems like they're trying to redefine what Apple TV is.
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:22.620]   And until that definition is in people's minds, they're kind of hauling developers in
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.860]   to say, no, you can't do this, you can't do this.
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.180]   But yeah, you can do that because it's an entertainment device.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.780]   You know, that's what it seems like to me.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:31.780]   Well, and even in the description of-
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:35.100]   It's another difference in philosophy.
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.900]   And that's been such a positive thing for consumers.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:41.860]   The fact that they put some, the Apple keeps so much control over their hardware that they
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.820]   pretty much make, they basically give the consumer every chance they have the most positive
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.620]   experience possible.
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:52.100]   The flip side of that is just that, for instance, I don't think that there, I have not had convinced
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:59.500]   to me by anybody inside or outside of Apple why iOS lacked even what we call basic keyboard
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:03.300]   support, just the ability to do app switching from the keyboard, just the ability to let
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:07.620]   developers make it easier for developers to put in command equivalents for stuff like
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:08.620]   that.
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:12.860]   And more and more people are using, there's such a great library of productivity apps available
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:13.860]   for iOS.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.660]   That's kind of held it back for years and years and years.
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:21.260]   So that's just an example of if Apple simply said, well, what if we just simply let people
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.980]   do what they're going to do?
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.340]   People who are going to be confused by this will never see this.
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:29.180]   But the people who want to take advantage of having a keyboard attached to the Apple TV
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.700]   will say, well, what happens if I try to pair this keyboard?
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:32.700]   Hey, that's great.
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:37.540]   That means every time I have to type in a password or an account name, I don't have to do it
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.500]   one up arrow at a time and this sort of stuff.
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.620]   So it's a difference of philosophy.
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.540]   They're definitely upsized to consumers each way.
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:52.700]   And Apple certainly has had no shortage of success pursuing their philosophy.
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:56.460]   It does seem though that they're even, they are a little confused about what this is supposed
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:02.260]   to do given the description on the store about, well, you should get 32 gigs.
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:05.380]   If you're going to use this as a streaming device and 64 gigs, if you think you're going
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:09.340]   to be using a lot of apps, it sounds like they're even little schizophrenic about what
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.340]   this might end up being.
[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.340]   There's only two sizes.
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:12.340]   Most iOS stuff.
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:13.340]   I don't think so.
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.340]   Well, that's true.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:19.140]   I mean, when you look at what they're laying out for this, they've already said that the
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:22.660]   future of television for them is apps.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:30.180]   So if you plan on getting a new Apple TV and watching movies mostly and downloading the
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:33.660]   odd app, then yeah, get a 32 gig.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:38.900]   But if you're going to play some games and you're going to buy stuff and you're going
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:42.420]   to do all this other stuff, then the 64.
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:47.900]   But I think what's most compelling about Apple TV and the way that Apple has described
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:54.420]   it is the interactivity with channels like MLB.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:35:01.380]   They're going to bring that to the NHL app, they said, and at the first of 2016, I'm really
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.420]   looking forward to that.
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:08.060]   I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to that because I'm a big hockey fan being
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.060]   Canadian.
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:12.260]   We skate around everywhere we go.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.660]   Sometimes down to the store.
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:19.220]   So I want to be able to watch hockey in an interactive way like that.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:25.180]   I'd love to be able to watch football, college and NFL and all that in that same type of
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:26.180]   interactive way.
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.980]   And I think that's what Apple is laying out for us right now.
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:35.180]   And I think that's why they don't want this message diluted with keyboard support and all
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:39.220]   the other things, productivity and all the stuff that we're talking about right now because
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:46.660]   they want this to be the first step in the future of actual TV.
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:50.260]   Does it worry you a little bit that Apple is competing with Roku and they're competing
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:52.980]   with Chromecast and they're competing with other boxes?
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:36:00.700]   That if someone is going to a quick sidebar example, I needed a replacement for my electric
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.700]   shaver.
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:05.980]   I'm not an electric shaver aficionado and I'm not an electric shaver design wonk.
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:09.780]   So I basically went to the smart home dot com, whatever they recommended.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:10.780]   That's what I bought.
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:11.780]   I bought.
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:12.780]   I'm very happy with it.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:17.540]   And sometimes I think about what it's like when you're not like us.
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:22.420]   Like I just want to I want a box to plug into the my upstairs bedroom, my bedroom TV that
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:26.860]   will get me Netflix will get me who they'll get me MLB that will get me these sports packages.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.620]   And I see, oh, well, there are four of them that do that.
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:29.620]   Great.
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:30.620]   Here's the Roku cost nine bucks.
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:31.620]   Great.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.620]   Let's do that.
[00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:33.620]   I'm worried.
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:36.820]   I just hope I'm just hoping that Apple differentiates themselves saying we're not just another box
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:37.980]   that gives you Netflix.
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:38.980]   I see.
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:43.660]   I don't think that's going to be an issue at this point because Apple's brand is so strong
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:48.900]   because people are going to look at, you know, okay, there's all these names that maybe
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:49.900]   I have heard of.
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:50.900]   Maybe I haven't.
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:51.900]   But then there's Apple.
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.780]   Okay, let's just go with the Apple one.
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:57.660]   You know, it's going to do everything that I needed to do and probably then some and it's
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:00.420]   going to be I'm going to have my music on it.
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:03.860]   You know, because it thinks with all my devices and it's going to have this other stuff.
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.540]   Yeah, let's just go with Apple and be done with it.
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:10.660]   And I think a lot of people will do that because of the reputation of Apple.
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:17.580]   And I don't I don't see any downside to what Apple's doing right now because they control
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.940]   so much of the ecosystem.
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:23.860]   So I can't see that being an issue.
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:25.020]   Okay.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:31.620]   We'll find out as they say in local news, only time will tell where to take a break.
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:37.700]   Come back with more Jim Dalrymple is here from loop insight.com the loop.
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.820]   Also Mr. Renee Richie from i'more.com.
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:42.420]   He's in the Bay Area.
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.420]   Come up here.
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.420]   You're finally.
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:46.420]   You're broke.
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:47.420]   I'm only tried.
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:51.180]   Also, Mr. Andy and I co from the Chicago Sun.
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.540]   Times in honor in honor of the two Canadians.
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:54.940]   I'll give you the Queen's wave.
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:58.820]   I think it's more like it's the screwing in I'm screwing in a light bulb.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.460]   Because he's screwing the light bulb wave.
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.460]   Yeah.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.460]   Yeah.
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.500]   You know, for what it's worth, I also don't know anything about electric razors and these
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:06.500]   so.
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.580]   Oh, somebody's doing your sides.
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:13.340]   I showed today brought to you by Drobo.
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.460]   Great to have them back.
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:19.660]   I don't even have to say if you're a Mac user, you know the name Drobo Mac or Windows or any
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:24.860]   kind of PC, Drobo is a safe, simple, expandable solution for all your storage needs.
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.580]   Maybe you saw the last few weeks I've been playing.
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:32.980]   I set up the new Drobo mini, which I just love.
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.860]   Just love.
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:39.940]   This is the smallest, most compact four drive enclosure I've ever used.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.740]   Has Thunderbolt on it.
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.940]   It has USB 3 on it.
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:51.420]   And one of the great things about Drobo's are it's unlike a lot of other massive storage
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:52.980]   solutions.
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.780]   Hard drive agnostic.
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:56.260]   This will hold laptop size drives.
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:59.980]   I put a couple of two terabyte drives, a 500 gig drive.
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:03.260]   You know, whenever you have lying around, you can put SSDs in it.
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:07.780]   The mini is just over two pounds, four, two and a half inch drive base.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:14.380]   That means you could get as big as eight terabytes, eight terabytes in that little enclosure.
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:15.580]   Small enough for me to take with me.
[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:18.780]   I think a lot of videographers and others will be using these, especially if you need
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:20.940]   speed, you put the SSDs in, but it also has.
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:26.500]   And I love this, a slot for a M SATA caching drive.
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:32.460]   So I put a little 850 EVO Samsung M SATA drive in there.
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:37.180]   I think it was a 256 gig, 128, can't remember.
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:42.540]   And the acceleration bay will really speed up small file reads.
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:47.300]   So if you're using Lightroom or Apple photos, that's what I mean by small file reads, where
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:52.260]   you're going, the caching is incredible, incredible.
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.500]   How about the 5D?
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.860]   It also has an optional M SATA SSD acceleration bay.
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:00.380]   It has space for five, three and a half inch drives.
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:05.100]   That means you go to a whopping 64 terabytes.
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:08.380]   These new accelerated drives, I think this is such a brilliant idea.
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:12.940]   Drobo was originally developed, as you probably know, for photographers, the pros.
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:16.780]   But working with video, you put those SSDs in there, especially with Thunderbolt.
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:20.460]   Man, this thing is blazingly fast.
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.300]   Also great if you want to set up your own network media or file server, you just want
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.300]   a big bucket of storage to back up your files.
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.620]   I mean, the ultimate backup drive.
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:31.300]   Of course, as soon as I plug it in, Time Machine says you want me to use this.
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:37.180]   Super reliable too, because the Drobo, I feel like everybody knows this, but maybe I should
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.820]   tell you, I should show you.
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:44.940]   The Drobo will let you know if your capacity starts to get filled up, so you can swap in
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.180]   a bigger drive.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.980]   These drives do not have to match.
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:53.740]   It'll also tell you if any drive is failing and you can hot swap it out with a new drive,
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:56.100]   it'll rebuild and you'll be ready to go.
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:04.380]   Literally, it took me about 30 seconds to add a third drive to my four drive bay.
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:06.260]   You can use it with this few as two drives.
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.900]   It's nice you can expand it as you go.
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:14.500]   Drobo's have an eternal EUSB device where data is copied if there's a power failure.
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:17.980]   You don't have to worry about long data outages.
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:23.140]   Add or replace with ease, no tools required, they just pop in.
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:24.140]   It's little things.
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:25.940]   The front is attached by magnets.
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:29.740]   You don't need a tool to open it up and put in a new drive or add a drive.
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.580]   It's just you flop it right off.
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:35.260]   The lights tell you everything you need to know.
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:39.420]   The Thunderbolt Gigabit and USB 3.0 connections.
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:43.060]   My Mini has USB 3 and a Thunderbolt.
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:44.580]   Some of the other Drobo's have...
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:45.580]   That's the Mini.
[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.140]   I love this Mini.
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:50.500]   Visit Drobo.com/twit to learn more and check out their complete line of products.
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:54.580]   When you use our code TWIT100, wait a minute.
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:55.580]   Whoa.
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.340]   You get a hundred bucks off?
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:59.740]   I didn't know they were going to do that much.
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:00.740]   That's awesome.
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:05.100]   A hundred bucks off on a Drobo Mini, a Drobo four-bayer, the Drobo five in.
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.820]   Now, how much would you pay?
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:09.300]   That's Drobo.com/twit.
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:13.820]   Use the code TWIT100 to save a hundred bucks.
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:16.980]   Everybody should have a Drobo Mini.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:20.100]   TWIT100 is the offer code at Drobo.com.
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.380]   DROBO.com/twit.
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:25.860]   I think somewhere I actually have an old Drobo jingle that...
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.820]   Leo, can I add something now?
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:28.820]   Yes.
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:31.020]   I bet you know about the Drobo.
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:33.020]   Drobo is also very good for audio.
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:39.940]   Because I had a Drobo years ago when they first come out, sadly, I don't anymore.
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:44.980]   But I used it for audio, for music creation, Pro Tools and things like that.
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:51.660]   Because songs, when you're creating and building a song, they go up to gigabytes of data in
[00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:52.660]   the songs.
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:53.660]   But recording audio...
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:54.660]   What do you like?
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:59.860]   I want to try one of these mini-s, Jim, because I bet you I can get you one.
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.260]   I'm sure Mark, Mark.
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:04.020]   Mark will send you one if you want.
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.660]   I think they're great products.
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:06.660]   Whoa.
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.940]   I just wanted to throw in their audio, you know?
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.020]   Audio, video, anything you're doing.
[00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:12.020]   Great stuff.
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.620]   Yeah, because real time is important.
[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:16.420]   You know, you can't wait while the drives catch up.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:17.420]   Yes.
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:18.860]   I mean, and that's the importance of SSD.
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:21.700]   And you know, you were talking about the hot swappable.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.500]   I mean, that's huge.
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.500]   Yeah.
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:30.060]   I cannot when I'm in the middle of a project and recording audio and, you know, if I'm
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:35.220]   recording a live drummer and I've got people coming over, I need, you know, fast and hot
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:36.220]   swappable.
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:39.740]   And like you said, on the front panel, tells you everything you need to know.
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:40.740]   That's what I...
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.460]   That's what we need in audio.
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:46.420]   So I just thought I'd throw that in.
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.980]   Free plug for Drobo.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:51.220]   It might work nicely with Plex if that gets on the Apple TV.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:52.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.220]   Does the Apple TV...
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:56.780]   Now, the Apple TV has a USB port, but you can't just put additional storage on there.
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:57.780]   No.
[00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.740]   The PC port there is for diagnostics.
[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.620]   If you ever have to troubleshoot it or for developers, if they want to test their apps
[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:03.620]   on the device.
[00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:04.620]   Yeah.
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:05.620]   Too bad.
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:06.620]   That's one nice thing.
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:07.620]   And the lightning...
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:12.820]   Oh, I was going to say the lightning cable is to charge the Apple TV with the Siri remote.
[00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:13.820]   Right.
[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:17.460]   It's one nice thing on like the Xbox One.
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:18.460]   They really did this nice.
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:19.460]   You can go out and you can take...
[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.380]   You could use your Drobo, in fact.
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:24.700]   And you want to add 4 terabytes of storage, 64 terabytes of storage to Xbox One.
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:25.700]   It's easy.
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.980]   You just plug it in on the USB port.
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:31.540]   This is the problem I think Apple faces a little bit as they're playing catch up in
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:34.740]   some regards, depending on what you're looking for.
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:39.340]   If gaming is number one, then you get an Xbox and have some TV capabilities, although
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:41.940]   it doesn't yet have a lot of the TV capabilities you'd like to see.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:44.020]   But it has Netflix and Amazon.
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:45.020]   Stuff like that.
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:48.660]   The only real advantage Apple has brings to the table is it's the only way you can watch
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.540]   iTunes and the only way you can AirPlay.
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:57.380]   I think what we have to remember here with the Apple TV as we're talking about other
[00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:02.820]   services, other things that we can do is that Apple is going for the consumer.
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:08.980]   They're not necessarily going for the high-end person that wants to...
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:13.740]   That has a Mac mini server and tracks and all that kind of stuff.
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:18.380]   They're going for the average person that wants to turn it on, watch a movie and turn
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.100]   it off again.
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.820]   Maybe fire up Netflix or something like that.
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:23.820]   That's who they are.
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:27.140]   There's a gazillion people like that out there.
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:35.900]   Indeed, there are, as Apple has proven, a gazillion and one.
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.100]   One with a hat.
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:44.100]   I don't know if you mean you or me.
[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:46.820]   We both are wearing the hat.
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:49.180]   I can't wait to get mine.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.980]   I have one TV that doesn't have an Apple TV on it.
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.220]   It's going to get the new one.
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:46:00.300]   Mostly I'm interested in the remote and Siri and searching and being able to use the scroll
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.420]   to scrub and things like that.
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.620]   Those will be really nice features.
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:12.900]   It's fab because they're using a TV is so different from using any other kind of computer.
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:17.940]   It's like Google had a search on Google TV and it works very, very well.
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:21.060]   When I reviewed it a couple of years ago, it's like it works great, but that's not how
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:22.860]   I watch TV.
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:27.700]   So Apple is usually so good at figuring out how people interact with their technology.
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:31.780]   I'm really looking forward to getting day to day play time to see if they figured out
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.700]   how I watch TV.
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:36.900]   I don't mean just in my underpants on the sofa.
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:37.900]   That's what I'm mean.
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.220]   Day to day play time.
[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:43.460]   I'm going to be watching some TV over the next few days.
[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:44.460]   It's so smart, though.
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:45.460]   It's like you say, what did I miss?
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:48.060]   Back at 15 or 30 seconds and put subtitles up at the same time.
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:51.140]   That's the old man feature that I really need.
[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:52.580]   I think the act, isn't it?
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:53.580]   What did he say?
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.580]   You say, what did he say?
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.580]   What did he say?
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:56.580]   What did she say?
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:57.580]   But also because you're talking, you then miss the next part.
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:58.580]   So it keeps playing.
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:01.820]   I mean, it's just really, really well thought out.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:02.820]   It's so great.
[00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.180]   It's what I heard about that.
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:09.300]   I was thinking about the time where I watched "Challow Hell" with my mom.
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.540]   I wanted that, Moza.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:11.540]   No, Moza.
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:14.340]   She isn't really changing it to a thing person.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.340]   Exactly.
[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:19.860]   Why is she in the elevator talking to Tony?
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:20.860]   Who is that tall?
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:21.860]   Is that David Niven?
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:22.860]   No, no.
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:25.460]   David Niven died 12 years before this was made.
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:28.220]   That's not a typo.
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:29.220]   It's so smart.
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:33.180]   Show me every episode of a modern family with Scott Vacula is the guest star.
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:35.420]   It goes through and finds all those for you.
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:38.380]   Well, again, we think it's smart.
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:40.460]   Have you played with a developer edition?
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:42.060]   Well, so the developer edition.
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:48.860]   I hate a news publication, "Shall Remain Nameless," did a review yesterday of the developer
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:49.860]   build.
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:53.140]   Siri has not fully turned on and they complained about bug theory.
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:54.140]   It's not on.
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:55.940]   Anyway, it makes me so mad.
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:01.340]   But yeah, at the event and by the time it's released later in this week, Siri, the event
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:02.340]   worked fabulously.
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:03.820]   I tried all sorts of things.
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:05.380]   Okay, so you did get to it.
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:07.580]   Gardner, chat room has a developer edition.
[00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:12.020]   He's wondering, will those upgrade to 1.0 when the--
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.020]   The TV comes out.
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:14.020]   Do we know?
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:18.060]   First, I mean, they haven't said anything, but usually they'll be good about it.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.060]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.060]   I imagine.
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:21.060]   There's so much that can still be done.
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:28.420]   What I like about the Fire TV and about the Amazon TV on the Fire devices is just the
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:34.220]   ability to basically do embedded-- have a commentary-- build an automatic commentary
[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:36.460]   track into the sidebar if you want.
[00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:40.900]   As every actor comes in and comes out, it will show you-- here's the actor's name, tap
[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:43.060]   him to get more information about this person.
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.820]   If there's a piece of music being played, here's a piece of music that's being played.
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.380]   Of course, you can turn that off when you don't want the distraction.
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:54.140]   But if you want-- watching 1776 and remind myself, no, that is not Phil Hartman.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:57.340]   Phil Hartman would have been about 12 years old when this was shot, but it will show you
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:58.700]   no, this is not Phil Hartman.
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:02.460]   So I believe that Apple TV brings some of that sauce to--
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:05.780]   Mutual friend, Dave Whiskus, was saying he wants an app where you all agree to watch
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:07.740]   the same show or movie at the same time.
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:12.700]   And then it lets you sort of enjoy that as if you were sitting in the same room.
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.980]   Keeps all synced up even if one person was.
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:15.980]   Yeah.
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:20.260]   Boy, if they had a way to even do like just automatically syncing a commentary track,
[00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:25.100]   if they had like an XML markup schema for here is how to markup a piece of audio so that
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:29.420]   it will automatically sync up to something that's playing that we've got inside the Apple
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:32.140]   store, boy, that would be a fun thing.
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:35.140]   Well, there were two things that a lot of-- I don't think Apple mentioned this, but you
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:39.420]   actually go on the page, you see that it supports 7.1 audio now, which is up from 5.1
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:45.860]   in the last box, and 1080p up to 60 frames per second, which is nice as well.
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:50.180]   So even though you don't have 4K-- since most people don't have 4K TVs and the 4K content
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:53.060]   is still lagging, that sounds pretty good.
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:54.780]   It's going to work for me anyway.
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.980]   Yeah, and 7.1 is nice.
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:59.300]   Oh, that's two more, isn't it?
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:00.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.820]   In the extra-- over the cliff, where do you get?
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:03.820]   Nowhere.
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:04.820]   We get--
[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:05.820]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:09.220]   Although-- and I guess I don't want to be that guy, but I guess I will be.
[00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:13.020]   I should point out that there are plenty of streamers that do 4.1, and there are other
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:16.140]   formats like Dolby App, most and so forth.
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:17.140]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:18.140]   Yeah, we're getting there.
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:21.300]   I mean, it's going to be interesting because, like Leo, every time we go to CES, we hear about
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.540]   the 4K stuff and the 4K Blu-rays are coming.
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:26.380]   Oh, now they're not here yet, but next time they're going to come and they're going to
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:29.540]   have HDR with them, and it's just such a nebulous time period.
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:32.100]   Well, yeah, but I think we are rapidly entering that time period.
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:33.100]   Yes.
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:37.540]   Do DVD players are coming out this month or next?
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:43.060]   And I think what's also happening is 4K is getting traction very, very rapidly because
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:45.140]   almost every TV you buy now is 4K.
[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:46.820]   But I'm waiting for the good ones.
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:49.700]   I want to wait until I get a 4K TV that looks like Dolby Vision.
[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:51.060]   I am with you.
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.060]   I want HDR.
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.060]   Yeah.
[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:55.820]   But that will be a much bigger deal than the 4K.
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:59.020]   Because unless you're getting a giant-sized TV, you're not going to appreciate the detail
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:02.340]   of 4K, but even if you're getting a smaller TV and you get HDR with it, you're going to
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:06.100]   get all the extra detail you see in it.
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:07.100]   Right.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.100]   I agree.
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:13.860]   This is the 14th anniversary of an Apple product release that changed the world, although,
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:21.660]   and I love, I'm so glad that MacRumors has kept this thread up in October, October 23,
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:25.460]   2001, Apple introduced the iPod.
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:32.140]   And if I were some of these people, I might be running and hiding my head.
[00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:34.820]   If not changing my handle.
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:37.940]   So here's the, this is the thread and still up on MacRumors.
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:41.780]   Apple's new thing, iPod.
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:46.100]   And well, it starts with the Leet Macquer saying, "I poop.
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.100]   I cry.
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.900]   I was so hoping for something more.
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:52.700]   Weezer X80 who says, "No, great.
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:53.700]   Just what the world needs."
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:55.100]   Another freaking MP3 player.
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.100]   "Go Steve.
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.100]   Where's the Newton?"
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:58.100]   What?
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:51:59.100]   What?
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:00.100]   What?
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:01.100]   What?
[00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:02.100]   What?
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:05.140]   Here's my favorite from Pants.
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:08.420]   Sounds very revolutionary to me.
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:10.180]   Sardonic pumpkin face.
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:12.220]   Hey, here's an idea, Apple.
[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:16.780]   Rather than entering the world of gimmicks and toys, why don't you spend a little more
[00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:20.980]   time sorting out your pathetically expensive and crap server lineup?
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:22.980]   Okay, he has a point there.
[00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:23.980]   He doesn't want to.
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:24.980]   He had a point.
[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:31.060]   Or are you really aiming to become a glorified consumer gimmicks firm?
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:32.060]   Yes.
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:36.580]   Yes, as a matter of fact, really, really successful consumer gimmicks.
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:39.300]   I'd like to be a shareholder in their consumer gimmicks firm.
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:40.460]   I want something new.
[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:41.980]   I want them to think differently.
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:42.980]   Why?
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:43.980]   Oh, why would they do this?
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:44.980]   It's so wrong, so stupid.
[00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.140]   Meanwhile, just with their live blogging.
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.140]   It's uncomfortable.
[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:50.020]   Jim, were you there live blogging this?
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:51.020]   I was there.
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:52.020]   Yeah.
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:53.940]   G and MP3 player with an HD.
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:57.260]   How original kind of reminds me of a jukebox I once knew.
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:00.060]   All Jim heard was 10,000 ACDC songs in his pocket.
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.060]   400 dollars.
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:03.060]   At that time, it was 1000.
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:04.620]   Yeah, 1000 songs in your pocket.
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:08.060]   It was a five gig hard drive.
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:11.700]   What was your reaction, Jim, when you first, yeah, I have mine too.
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:16.260]   In fact, I powered it up over the weekend and I still have my music on it.
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:19.660]   I powered it up, but I got the sad folder.
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:25.060]   We won't know what Andy was listening to in 2002, 2003.
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:26.540]   I was listening pretty much the same thing.
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:27.540]   I'm listening to now.
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:31.020]   I'm just kind of sad.
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:33.420]   So you're sitting there, Jim.
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:35.980]   Did you have, was the rumor mill strong?
[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:40.500]   We had to think secret and things like that back then.
[00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:48.380]   I'll admit, I was a bit shocked too.
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:49.380]   I don't know.
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:56.580]   It was just kind of a weird thing because it was, we recognize now that it was the start
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:01.220]   of something pretty revolutionary for Apple.
[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:05.900]   But at that time, you were thinking, huh?
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:13.500]   But they did have some, you know, 1000 songs where even MP3 players at that time from creative
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:17.860]   would basically hold a CD.
[00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:19.860]   So it was different.
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:21.540]   It was different.
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:23.540]   You weren't sold with the right end of the box.
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:25.580]   Jim, they're the size of a disc man.
[00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:26.580]   Yeah.
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:34.060]   Once you get your hands on them and put the songs on there and started using it, then
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:36.140]   you could say, "Oh, okay.
[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:37.900]   I kind of get this now."
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:42.300]   But we had no idea where Steve was taking Apple at that time.
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:51.660]   If we knew that there was going to be a music store and videos and all of this stuff, then
[00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:52.740]   everything would have made more sense.
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:58.020]   But he kind of laid it out for us bit by bit over the next few years.
[00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:03.180]   Somebody recently made the point, which I think is quite interesting, that Apple pioneered
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:08.420]   the, you know, there's this thinking among startups that you should do the minimal viable
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:14.540]   product in software and then let it out into the world and let people play with it and
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:16.060]   then see where it's going to go.
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:18.980]   And somebody pointed out, you know, in some ways that's what Apple did with the iPhone.
[00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:21.500]   And you might even say that with the original iPod.
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.340]   This is the minimal viable product.
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:26.780]   Now let's see what happens so we can iterate on this.
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:27.780]   Firewire.
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:32.540]   It is fairly big and heavy compared to something like the iPod.
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:34.340]   It wasn't the Nano.
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:35.180]   It was the littler-
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:36.180]   Mini.
[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:37.180]   Mini.
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:38.740]   Mini was the one that really took off, right?
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:41.740]   Although I think some people would argue that they make the minimal delightful product
[00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:44.700]   or the minimal attractive product because they don't skimp on it.
[00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:46.260]   They pick their targets well.
[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:49.020]   It's not like it's the worst in everything that they could possibly put out.
[00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:52.500]   It's like we think this and this will be super attractive and it'll be enough.
[00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:55.780]   Like the iPhone, it didn't do a lot of things that other smartphones did, but the interface
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:58.420]   was so compelling that people wanted it anyway.
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:55:59.420]   That's really a good point.
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:01.260]   It's not like it's something you don't want.
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:02.260]   Yeah.
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:05.140]   And there's so many things about this that are just so classic Apple.
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:08.420]   Like this is a music player.
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:11.020]   It is a music player.
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:15.220]   And how many music players have you ever seen where the most prominent button is not the
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:16.220]   play/pause button?
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:18.820]   It is you have to look all the way down here and see this time.
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:20.220]   I couldn't find it first.
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:21.220]   Yeah.
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:22.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:25.140]   It's a tiny little silk screen thing and the word iPod, you have to explain what it
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:29.220]   means because it's not I player or I music or anything like that.
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:31.060]   And it still has a pod.
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:32.380]   What is that?
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:37.740]   And then there's a story, one of the classic Steve Jobs stories about how I mean, this
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:40.020]   is like a crash, crash, crash product.
[00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:44.540]   They were just buying, they were taking a lot of stuff that was off the shelf and combining
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:47.820]   them to get this out the doors quickly as they could with a level of quality that they
[00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:48.820]   wanted.
[00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:54.020]   And so they showed the story that goes that they showed Steve one of the last working
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:56.860]   prototypes or whatever and they showed, okay, here's how this works and here's how the
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:59.740]   click will works and Scott and the stop, stop, stop.
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:01.420]   Why is the screen green?
[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:05.820]   And it was the LCD that had it was a stock like LCB, a green backlit screen that was
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:06.820]   on everything.
[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:08.500]   They said, well, that's the we can get these in quantity.
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:09.580]   This is how we get the price point down.
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:10.820]   I said, no, no, look at this.
[00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:11.820]   It's white.
[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:12.820]   It's chrome.
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:14.780]   We are not putting a green backlit screen on this.
[00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:16.180]   This has to be black and white.
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:17.180]   Yeah.
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:19.300]   So I was just looking at it all the way back and source new screens.
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:26.020]   I heard at a time where they had no time or money to waste just because this had to look
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:30.580]   and feel right because it's like you say, it's in like Renee says, it's not necessarily
[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:33.220]   having a feature complete product at 1.0.
[00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:37.780]   It's about getting someone to fall in love with it so much that they kind of overlooking
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:40.220]   that it doesn't have as many features as something else.
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:45.460]   And when they finally do roll out 2.0 in a year or two, that customer is eager to replace
[00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:47.660]   1.0 with 2.0.
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.660]   Yeah.
[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:51.500]   Mine does light up as you can see.
[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:52.500]   Right.
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:54.220]   You have to, by the way, there's AC/DC.
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:58.140]   It looks like I have high voltage, one song.
[00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:00.100]   It's a long way.
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:01.100]   And money talks.
[00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:02.100]   That's it.
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:03.100]   I'm sorry, Jim.
[00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:04.100]   But I also have the Beatles on here.
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:06.500]   And I don't know how I got the Beatles on here.
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:10.700]   That's bizarre.
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:11.700]   You have to put this in context.
[00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:13.820]   This is 2001.
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:18.940]   All phones were flip phones.
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:24.740]   I think design-wise was pretty striking.
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:29.180]   The other context, of course, is the state of the art in MP3 players at the time was
[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:30.180]   awful.
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:34.900]   We were all very excited about MP3s and the idea of having a hard drive, the Nomad.
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:38.540]   I have actually, well, it's also in my, I don't want to keep sending the staff running
[00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:41.140]   to my closet here.
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:44.580]   I have one of the original car player MP3s.
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:48.980]   And these things, you know, you put the hard drive in the trunk.
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:52.060]   So this is a hard drive based MP3 player.
[00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:53.540]   You're holding the palm of your hand.
[00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:56.260]   I think that felt pretty revolutionary at the time.
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:58.860]   Sheba 1.5, right?
[00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:00.660]   Yeah, I think it was those teach, though.
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:04.820]   Sheba, a little matchbook sized hard drives.
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:06.180]   In fact, that's why they stopped.
[00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:08.100]   Isn't that why they stopped making the classic?
[00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:11.100]   It's because they could no longer source the hard drives.
[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:14.420]   So times have left this amazing device behind.
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:18.620]   But boy, for the time, it was pretty incredible.
[00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:20.180]   I did not go to the event.
[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:25.420]   I was working on the site at MSNBC, I think.
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:26.860]   Or maybe it was at tech TV at the time.
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:31.860]   I remember Jim Lauterback coming back with one of these and saying, look.
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:33.500]   Wow, that's cool.
[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:34.500]   That's cool.
[00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:37.220]   We had played with a lot of MP3 players.
[00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:41.140]   And the UI was uniformly horrible.
[00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:42.660]   Now you look at this now and it's obvious.
[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:45.580]   Well, that's what an MP3 player looks like.
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:49.260]   But at the time, this was so much ahead of what anybody else had done.
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:50.260]   It was also so smart.
[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:53.180]   I remember when I was doing product marketing, they would always point to 1,000 songs in
[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:54.180]   your pocket.
[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:57.420]   It's one of the best ways of explaining a complicated product to every person in the
[00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:58.420]   world.
[00:59:58.420 --> 00:59:59.420]   You just understood what that meant.
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:00.420]   Right.
[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:01.420]   That was brilliant.
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:02.420]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:03.420]   And of course, it was 500 bucks.
[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:07.180]   I mean, by the time they got the mini out, it was smaller, lighter, cheaper.
[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:08.620]   It was half as expensive.
[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:10.060]   And then there was no question.
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:11.220]   This is a brilliant product.
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:15.340]   And they were willing to put out the mini, even though this was a great-- I mean, that's
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:17.820]   one of the things that I've always had for the Apple is that they're willing to handle
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:18.820]   it as themselves.
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:19.820]   Yes.
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:20.820]   Really good point.
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:22.100]   I'm pleased that Mike still works.
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:23.460]   I'm sorry yours doesn't, Andy.
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:26.540]   No, but actually, I know something common to both of us.
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:31.540]   Can you imagine an Apple device that they would delay this another five years to make
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:34.860]   sure that the screen does not look all scratched up like this?
[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:35.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:36.860]   Oh, the back.
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:39.740]   It's all engraved and scratched up.
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:40.740]   Yeah.
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:43.340]   It makes you think about how much engineering an Apple goes into just making sure they're
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:46.740]   choosing a surface that will continue to look good two or three years later.
[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:48.660]   Well, and those are hard learned lessons, frankly.
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:49.660]   It was for a while, too.
[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:53.340]   I think they hadn't made devices that people put in their pockets with their keys until
[01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:54.340]   now.
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:56.380]   I was just saying, my original iPod touches, they all had a very similar back.
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:01:01.460]   And they're all very Indiana Jones now at the same point, too.
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:03.100]   Pretty cool stuff.
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:05.900]   It's a nice--
[01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:07.900]   It's a nice memory.
[01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:13.340]   And thank you, Mac Roarz, for keeping that thread up so we can embarrass a few people
[01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:16.380]   to their credit, said, no, what are you talking about?
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:17.900]   That's a hard drive in there.
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:19.220]   That thing is amazing.
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:23.620]   You would like to see a post where somebody said, I'm going to buy Apple stock right now
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.460]   because this is going to be huge.
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:26.460]   Yeah.
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:27.460]   Yeah.
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:29.460]   He's the guy that's in the Riviera right now.
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:30.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:31.460]   I'm turning 20%.
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:35.860]   What would it be worth if you bought a share of Apple stock in 2001 when the Apple stock
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:36.860]   iPod came out?
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.860]   I try not to do that math.
[01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:39.860]   Yeah, I know it's--
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:40.860]   Yeah.
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:43.620]   Because I still remember 12 and 3/8.
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:48.460]   That was what Apple stock was at when I was urging all of my friends buy Apple stock.
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:52.820]   I can't buy it myself, but I'm telling you it's going to turn around big.
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:53.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:54.820]   I don't do that bad.
[01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:57.180]   I had money that I could have spent.
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:59.180]   I tried not to do that.
[01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:01.020]   Wouldn't need this whole journalism gig, Andy?
[01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:02.020]   It's one thing.
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.020]   There's a whole journalism thing.
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:05.500]   So we have some new releases.
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:12.300]   We have a watch, OS 2.01, and we have iOS 9.1.
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:13.980]   Is it all about the emojis?
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:18.380]   Can you imagine, like, if you ever want to make an instant adoption curve for your new
[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:21.420]   OS, all you have to do is put in a significant amount of new emojis.
[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:22.420]   Middle finger emoji.
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:23.420]   That's all you have to do, baby.
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:24.420]   Taco Leo.
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:25.420]   Taco.
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:27.220]   I mean, burrito.
[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:28.220]   But I'm 14, right?
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:29.900]   Well, I'm filing a radar.
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:33.700]   I want you to be able to hold down the French fries, and it'll pop up and give me 15 tater
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:36.820]   tots, maybe hash browns.
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.660]   And then I think that would be just finish it off.
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:44.220]   Apple, do you know how many Canadians would just adore you if you just did that?
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:45.220]   Yeah.
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:46.220]   Why wouldn't?
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:47.220]   Well, not a poutine fan.
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.220]   You have the exotic college.
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:50.540]   The Quebecas in Canada, unfortunately.
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:51.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:52.700]   Oh, I get it.
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:54.500]   So, Jim, you're an anglophone.
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:55.500]   Yes.
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:56.500]   Yes.
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:57.500]   Not one of them.
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.500]   Not one of them.
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.500]   Frenchies.
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:06.220]   You have a metal festi because you only come to the province, but otherwise I'm sick.
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:09.900]   But I presume 9.1 fixed other things, security and bugs.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.900]   A lot of security fixes, too.
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:12.900]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:14.540]   And there were some Apple music fixes.
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:23.540]   And on the watch, one thing I noticed on the watch is that the calorie counting thing
[01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:27.900]   and fitness is more accurate now.
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:30.540]   So they did some different things.
[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:35.460]   And that's even better from 2.0.
[01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:38.660]   We should point out that Apple, some people are kind of blaming Apple for the middle-fhinge
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:39.660]   layer emoji.
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:46.700]   This is Apple just extending the emoji set to match what the Unicode consortium has
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.020]   determined the emoji should be.
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:49.180]   Pated every one of them.
[01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:52.220]   They made sure, I think maybe because they were including the middle-finger one, they
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:55.180]   made sure that they included everything in the set so they can just say this is the set
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:56.180]   as per Unicode.
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:57.180]   Yeah.
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:58.180]   And that's it.
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:02.940]   Although Megan Maroney, our host at iOS today and of Tech News Tonight pointed out, she
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:07.620]   has middle school kids, all of whom have iPads from the school.
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:11.780]   And she said this is not a good combination.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:14.900]   I think the Unicode consortium is going to be in a lot of trouble.
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:18.500]   Do you think that they don't know?
[01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:19.700]   Who doesn't know?
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:20.700]   The kids.
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:21.700]   No, they know.
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:22.700]   They learned immediately.
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:23.700]   Are you kidding?
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:24.700]   Of course they do.
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:28.140]   I don't want to say what the kids are using.
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:31.260]   I'm not saying that this she wanted to protect them.
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:32.820]   I don't say she wanted to protect them.
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:35.900]   I'm just saying that she wishes that they weren't because now she's getting a lot of
[01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:38.340]   texts with middle fingers and burritos.
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:39.820]   But that's not a thing.
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:42.660]   The kids use fruit emoji for a whiteness thing.
[01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:44.340]   So we don't really need to give them actual.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:45.340]   Nothing you could do about it.
[01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:49.260]   But I also point out that when we were kids, dictionaries had the word butt in them.
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.340]   Do you look at the word butt?
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:53.180]   I just turned up well.
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:55.820]   I just sent middle finger poop.
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:56.820]   Middle finger poop.
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:57.820]   That's all you need to do.
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:00.300]   Since every watch got the emoji as well.
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.580]   So they're both compatible now.
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:02.580]   I'm very disappointed.
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:08.220]   I am going to stop using Windows now because I've gone to emojipedia to see the new Unicode
[01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:13.620]   8.0 41 new emoji characters and Windows doesn't have them.
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:14.620]   The tragedy.
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:15.620]   This is horrible.
[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:21.860]   I'm getting square boxes instead of tacos burritos, popcorn, hot dogs.
[01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:26.620]   Of course they'll have another three years of consider it to be cool.
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:27.620]   Come on, Microsoft.
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:31.140]   I'm here with your great grandfather.
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:36.220]   He basically died when he was 18 years old because he had no vaccinations.
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:39.660]   Please tell him how you suffer by not having a movie.
[01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:40.660]   Go ahead.
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:42.460]   This is all we're going to show.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:48.020]   I can't show you because I don't have a client face emoji, Andy.
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:51.820]   And we should point out as we went to start the show, iOS 9.2 came out in beta.
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:53.540]   No, really already?
[01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:54.540]   But that's in beta.
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:57.100]   That doesn't mean I'm going to get it pushed out anytime soon.
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:58.700]   Well, I make sure they're always working.
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:00.500]   They're always beta testing the next one.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.500]   Isn't that the case?
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.500]   Yeah.
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:07.300]   And this is Edge.
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:10.220]   This is their new browser and everything.
[01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:11.740]   How are the plugins?
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:12.740]   None.
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:15.980]   As you know, so don't pretend you didn't.
[01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:19.500]   Okay, Firefox and Chrome work fine on my own.
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:20.500]   Yeah, they do.
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:26.900]   Well, though, actually Edge's smoother scrolling and some other things.
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:27.900]   Series refusing.
[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:29.060]   Is this true?
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:32.060]   Series refusing to answer certain questions.
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:36.940]   If you're not an Apple Music subscriber, they built a lot of extra series features in
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:37.940]   for Apple Music.
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:41.380]   And it probably means is that they built that in specifically and didn't think about extending
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:44.900]   it to the rest of it or didn't have time to extend it into the full stack yet.
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:45.900]   And hopefully that's something I wouldn't.
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:49.500]   I can't believe I refused to answer some questions.
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:52.180]   Let me try this here.
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.900]   Hey Siri.
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.740]   She never listens to me.
[01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:59.140]   What's the most popular song in the US to.
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:00.740]   I'm not sure I understand.
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:03.740]   Oh, yeah, because I didn't finish the sentence.
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:06.380]   What's the most popular song in the US today?
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:11.180]   Sorry, we hope I can't look up the music charts for you.
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:13.900]   You don't seem to be subscribed to Apple Music.
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:15.420]   Screw you Siri.
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:19.100]   Yeah, no, when Apple Music launched, they show you that they built a bunch of commands specifically
[01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:22.700]   for Apple Music and all of those only work for Apple Music currently.
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:24.260]   Yeah, they probably don't even have.
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:25.820]   Well, does she have the information?
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:26.820]   Probably not.
[01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:29.020]   Well, it's hitting the Apple Music servers for those questions.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:30.020]   Right, right.
[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:31.260]   So, okay, I can't really blame her.
[01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:33.820]   I never would really ask that question.
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:37.300]   So, well, it'd be nice if they found out if you don't have Apple Music instead of giving
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:40.860]   you an error, they just shunted you off to Wikipedia or the web or the web search or something.
[01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:41.860]   Yeah, maybe a little bit more.
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:46.060]   Well, it would be nice if they just answered it.
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:52.140]   I mean, you're not asking it, "Hey, Siri, am I a subscriber to Apple Music?
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:53.140]   You're not asking at that.
[01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:59.220]   You're asking Siri who can go anywhere in the little interwebs and find answers to any
[01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:01.260]   question you have.
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:02.260]   What is the top song?"
[01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:05.940]   Oh, so what it should do, Jim, is say, "Here is the top song.
[01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:07.380]   Would you like me to play it for you?"
[01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:08.380]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:09.380]   There you go.
[01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:10.380]   Or anything.
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:11.380]   That's a very lazy thing.
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:12.380]   That's a very lazy thing.
[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.380]   That's a very lazy thing.
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:15.740]   You can answer the stupid question.
[01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:20.140]   The top song on Apple Music Today is, even if you're not a subscriber, maybe that will
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:21.580]   get you interested in Apple Music.
[01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:22.580]   Yeah.
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:23.580]   But it's a server-side service.
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:25.300]   So Apple can update it anytime.
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:27.700]   The top song on Apple Music Today is this.
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:31.700]   We would play it for you, but you're a moron and you don't subscribe to it, or you're very
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:35.820]   smart and don't subscribe to it, whatever it is.
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:38.380]   So at least give you the answer.
[01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:39.380]   Come on.
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:40.380]   Come on, Siri.
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:41.380]   Come on.
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:46.100]   Or use a little bit of salesmanship, say, "You know, it's maybe a little bit too hip for
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:47.100]   you.
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:50.700]   Only some of our Apple Music subscribers are really into that kind of really young by
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:51.700]   Vaseous."
[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:53.540]   How about some Paul Anka?
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:56.540]   Oh, that would be burn.
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:59.780]   I see, then it's from my phone down on the ground.
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:00.780]   Hey, Cortana.
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:01.780]   Did you buy a new one?
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:03.540]   What's the number one song in the US today?
[01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:06.820]   See if Cortana will know.
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:08.820]   Thinking.
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:09.820]   Thinking.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:15.300]   All right, well.
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:16.300]   It's playing.
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:17.300]   No, who's playing the Beatles?
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:18.300]   That was me.
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:20.540]   Sorry about that.
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:23.700]   I can't reach Bing.com right now.
[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:28.780]   I wanted to double check to make sure that if you'd asked it a simple question about your
[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:31.380]   own music library, it would still deliver for you.
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:33.340]   All right, come on.
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:38.300]   So just being your Cortana did the right thing you'd want Siri to do, which it pushed
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:43.500]   me to Billboard and, you know, number one song, BobBorsst.com, the number one song in
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:44.860]   the US, that kind of thing.
[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:45.860]   Gave me a search.
[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:46.860]   It's long.
[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:47.860]   It's been fixed.
[01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:50.660]   It took a long time to do it, by the way.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:57.140]   Yeah, we Siri comes back right away and says screw off.
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:01.700]   I think you know the reason why I'm reading that question.
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:08.380]   Steve bomber says saving Apple was the craziest thing Microsoft ever did.
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:09.660]   They didn't save.
[01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:13.020]   I know that's kind of a mean thing to say.
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:14.020]   Cause.
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.020]   Kind of Lee.
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:17.340]   That only was crazy.
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:18.340]   You didn't do it.
[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:19.540]   Well, wait a minute, though.
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:24.660]   They did offer $150 million when Apple was kind of in the financial dumper, right?
[01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:28.620]   Yeah, but that because Apple was going to sue them for stealing quick time.
[01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:29.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:33.580]   There's a bunch of things that they settled a bunch of lawsuits that were doing neither
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:35.300]   company any good whatsoever.
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:39.540]   But the most important thing that Apple that Microsoft did was basically commit to continuing
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:44.180]   to support Microsoft Office for Mac, which was a no brainer for them because they don't
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:46.700]   have the vision to think about here's how we can.
[01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:52.740]   They weren't in a position to want to have any paper trail about them one to destroy a
[01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:56.020]   competitor because they're being hit with antitrust.
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:59.260]   And also Microsoft Office for Mac was making them a fortune at the time.
[01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:04.140]   So it did help out a map, Apple a lot because if a lot of people were thinking that, well,
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:07.820]   gee, if I, the only reason why Macs are viable in my office today is the fact that there's
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:09.180]   a version of office for it.
[01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:12.940]   If Microsoft ever decided that Apple was a losing proposition, that there goes that
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:13.940]   reason.
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:17.220]   So they, they helped out Apple, but no, they didn't save Apple.
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:18.220]   It was cheap.
[01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:20.940]   It was a cheap $150 billion check and bombers completely wrong.
[01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:22.700]   I think you're right.
[01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:27.020]   It provided them with cover with the DOJ office was going to make that money back right
[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:28.020]   away.
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:30.020]   All they had to do was commit to making office for the Apple for what?
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.020]   How many, how many more years?
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.020]   Four years.
[01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:33.020]   Four years.
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:36.780]   Gates is giant head up on stage and they got Bill Gates's giant head up on the stage.
[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:37.860]   That's all win all around.
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:42.580]   I can think bombers nuts and keep and keep in mind that that wasn't a, that wasn't like
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:43.580]   a settlement.
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:48.140]   That was an investment that was stock right that they, it was not a non voting stock or
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:49.140]   something like that.
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:50.140]   Right.
[01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:51.420]   But they still, they, they made, they got that money back plus.
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:52.420]   So.
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:59.860]   Siri, oh, let's see, we did that one.
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:00.860]   Let me see.
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:03.860]   I had another Siri story here.
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:05.860]   Oh, the driving?
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:06.860]   Yeah.
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:09.860]   Siri is less is more distracting than Google.
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:12.860]   My friends and family are more distracting.
[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:14.660]   That's a stupid story.
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:15.660]   I'm not going to do that one.
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:17.660]   If you have nothing in the car, you fall asleep or get bored and start to, I mean, like
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:18.660]   this is, you can't win.
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:19.660]   I know.
[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:21.180]   Oh, I know what I wanted to talk about.
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:22.180]   Let's take a break.
[01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:24.780]   We'll talk about the department of justice and Apple and encryption.
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:25.780]   Oh, is it all right?
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:30.060]   Is there something in this study besides just the silly, besides, besides series, it's
[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:35.780]   interesting in that very, very long, very, very long study about the effects of hands
[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:41.100]   free systems start to finish, not just Siri versus Google, also like the, the, the, in
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:42.500]   car entertainment system.
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:46.660]   And it showed it demonstrated an interesting thing that if you think that, for instance,
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:50.540]   you're, I'm only going to use hands free and I'm only going to do it as a, at a stoplight,
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:55.620]   for instance, they show that, well, unfortunately, it takes the brain about a certain amount
[01:12:55.620 --> 01:13:00.420]   of time to shift back into driving mode, even if you are using a successful system to engage
[01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:01.420]   that.
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:06.580]   So you are kind of, you are impaired to your mental load is still compromised for a good
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:09.820]   like 10 to 20 to 30 seconds after that.
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:15.260]   They also demonstrated that things that are difficult get a little bit easier, but they
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:17.260]   never stop getting difficult.
[01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:21.820]   So it's not as though after a month with hands free devices, it's going to be as easy as
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:23.460]   like not being impaired at all.
[01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:28.700]   And the third interesting thing is that older people are no matter how sharp they are, no
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:32.460]   matter how tech savvy they are, no matter how clever they are, they all seem to find
[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:37.900]   these systems more difficult to use than younger people, which is, which is a interesting
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:44.500]   statistic given that the majority of new cars in private hands, according to study from 2013
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:49.940]   is also being is being bought by older people, people from like 60 to, I think the age group
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:52.500]   was 50 to 65, maybe 55 to 65.
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.860]   There's a lot of interesting data.
[01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:56.020]   There's a lot of interesting data.
[01:13:56.020 --> 01:14:00.980]   I wrote about this for cars.com last week and was talking to some of the researchers who
[01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:04.980]   I'm sorry, not the researchers who were involved in it, but some of the people who were involved
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:07.420]   in papers that they cited in that.
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:09.220]   And there's a lot of new stuff.
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:18.780]   The other cool thing is that to make sure that Siri was not screwing up, the people involved
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:22.460]   in the study were not interacting with Siri directly.
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:26.620]   They were speaking the Siri command and then someone else would then type in the command
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:30.940]   manually to make sure that it wasn't being screwed, wasn't getting screwed up by like,
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:32.300]   I'm sorry, could you say that again?
[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:33.300]   Right.
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.300]   Because they wanted to get consistent results.
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:39.620]   If funny, if they do it like they do when they're making movies, have somebody pretend
[01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:40.620]   to be Siri.
[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:41.620]   Yeah.
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:44.300]   They actually called the Wizard of Oz protocol.
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:47.020]   So there's actually a human behind it that was writing everything.
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:48.020]   That's so funny.
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:50.020]   This was a AAA study, by the way, the AAA Foundation.
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:51.020]   Yeah.
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:53.620]   We need to go study with kids in the car because I'm sure the kids that come off worse in Siri.
[01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:56.140]   Actually, the worst thing is the Mazda 6, apparently.
[01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:59.500]   For some reason, Cortana's worse than Siri.
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.900]   Siri's worse at Google now, but nobody's as bad as a Mazda.
[01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:03.900]   Yeah.
[01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:09.980]   Well, the signature thing that they were calling out is that too many systems Siri included
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:14.540]   aren't flexible enough to simply say, "Hi, send a message to Bob.
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:18.260]   Tell him that I'm running 10 minutes late and I'll see you later."
[01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:22.300]   Most of them require you to speak that in a certain way and put things in a specific
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:23.300]   order.
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:27.700]   And even if it's smart to say, "I didn't understand that, tell me what time you're meeting this
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:29.100]   person."
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:31.820]   That's not, dump that one request and then keep on driving.
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:34.900]   It really is continuing to be engaged with the software.
[01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:37.540]   So yeah, very interesting.
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:43.420]   The least distracting vehicle is a Chevy Equinox and even it has moderate distraction.
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:45.980]   I said, "Stop hitting your brother."
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:47.300]   I said, "Stop hitting your brother."
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:48.300]   Put that back down.
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:49.300]   Don't do that.
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:50.300]   Stop kicking this.
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:53.020]   I don't see Ford to sink on here, oddly enough.
[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:56.380]   Most people will be using, I presume in the next few years, will be using the Android
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:15:59.860]   now or Android car or Apple car in there.
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:03.060]   I mean, who's going to be crazy to design your own?
[01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:07.740]   By the way, Category 1 is the same as listening to the radio.
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:13.500]   The best cars are Category 2, which is about the same as talking on the phone.
[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:18.660]   And the worst at a 4.6, it's about the same as uploading social media.
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:23.860]   So driving a Chevy Mazda is about as hard as uploading a picture to Facebook while you're
[01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:24.860]   driving.
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:26.020]   We talked about this a couple of years ago.
[01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:28.420]   I remember when I was in high school, the people I was driving with, they would spend
[01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:31.500]   their entire time with their head turns sideways trying to dial the radio station to find
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.580]   a song they liked and they'd find it by the time it was ending.
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:36.420]   That's to find a new song and if they're humans they're just endlessly distracting.
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:40.940]   It would be nice if they had tested car play in Android Auto just to see if there's any
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:49.140]   improvement using a system designed specifically for in car.
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:53.700]   Second phase of the Foundation found series high complexity and low intuitiveness resulted.
[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:56.140]   So why we need self-driving cars, Leo?
[01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:57.140]   That way we can't, doesn't matter for distribution.
[01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:59.700]   Then we can upload all the social media we want.
[01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:00.700]   Yeah, we don't want it.
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:01.700]   It's a picture of me not driving.
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:04.500]   Here's another picture of the other guy not driving.
[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:08.100]   All right, I showed you they brought to you by something you might want to do in your
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:09.100]   self-driving car.
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:13.020]   Read a magazine on your iPad.
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:14.180]   Texture.
[01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:20.140]   Now you've heard me do ads for a great service called Next Issue.
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:22.220]   This is rebranded Next Issue.
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:23.940]   They've changed their name to Texture.
[01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:27.900]   It's Texture powered by Next Issue.
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:31.020]   It is fantastic, some spectacular new features.
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:33.540]   It is simply the best reading experience around.
[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:38.260]   As a texture subscriber you read all your favorite magazines anytime, anywhere on your
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:41.340]   tablet or your phone.
[01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:44.260]   It's like an all access pass to the magazines you love.
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:49.300]   I have to say, I love reading magazines but very few magazines have more than one or two
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:50.980]   articles I want to read.
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:52.300]   So this is the best way to do it.
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:55.100]   You get everything.
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:59.460]   Fortune, Fast Company, Newsweek, Rolling Stone, Wired.
[01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:02.020]   There's always an article or two I want to read in Rolling Stone but I don't need the
[01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:03.020]   whole magazine.
[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:05.180]   There's always something in Vanity Fair I want to read but I want to read the whole
[01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.180]   magazine.
[01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:08.820]   The next time you get on an airplane you'll be thrilled.
[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:12.540]   You'll be thrilled that you have Texture on your iPad.
[01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:18.020]   They automatically download the magazine so you've got it with or without Wi-Fi.
[01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:19.020]   Find out more.

[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:35.100]   features like videos that you don't get in a magazine which is really nice and you don't
[01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:39.820]   get all that clutter in your house and you're saving a few trees too.
[01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:44.300]   They even have a new top story and a new and noteworthy sections.

[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:53.580]   I hope you will.
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:54.580]   30 days free.
[01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:55.580]   Texture.
[01:18:55.580 --> 01:19:00.060]   T-E-X T-U-R-E.com/macbreak.

[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:05.220]   It's just exactly what you want.
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:06.380]   I love magazines.
[01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:12.220]   I really do but who has time to read all of that stuff?
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:13.460]   You just want one or two articles.
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:15.420]   You got a texture.
[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:19.140]   If you want to read a cover, you can do that too.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:26.580]   Apple says to the judge, Apple says, "We cannot since iOS 8 get inside of those phones."
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:29.620]   So don't ask us to do it.
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:32.940]   The Department of Justice says, "That's ridiculous.
[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:35.780]   Apple doesn't even sell that software.
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:37.780]   They continue to own it.
[01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:39.060]   They're only running it to users.
[01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:41.900]   You could do anything you want."
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:45.700]   This is -- Apple is in a tough position because, of course, it's one of their chief market
[01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:50.140]   advantages is this respect for privacy.
[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:56.460]   Since iOS 8, this strong encryption that they've built into the iPhones, for 90% of the devices
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:20:02.540]   running iOS or higher, granting the Justice Department's request would be, quote, "impossible
[01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:06.420]   to perform."
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:09.380]   Is the DOJ right, Apple, should change the software?
[01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:11.380]   I don't think anybody here would say that.
[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:14.820]   What's this top China from saying, "We want access."
[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:15.820]   Right.
[01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:16.820]   I'm saying, "We want access."
[01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:20.580]   And, yeah, to play devil's advocate, you operate in a country you have to abide by the
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:21.980]   laws of that country.
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:24.500]   Ultimately, Apple have to give in.
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:27.020]   If that's the -- it's not the law yet, we should point out.
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:31.260]   Remember, I forget if it was Pakistan or India or both of them where they demanded
[01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:34.380]   BlackBerry put in with servers so they could intercept the BBM messages.
[01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:35.380]   Right.
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:36.380]   And they won, by the way.
[01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:38.620]   The BlackBerry did it.
[01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:43.140]   And of course, you're always going to be in that position where countries are going to
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:46.980]   say, "We want to see the source code of your so-called secure server."
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:51.260]   I guess there's nothing to say about this, except to --
[01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:52.260]   Well, not me.
[01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:55.020]   It just shows you how pervasive this problem is.
[01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:58.140]   That really, the only defense that a company like Apple has is to do what they've just
[01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:01.220]   done, which is say that, "Look, even we -- go ahead and subpoena us.
[01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:06.060]   We will send you the document that certifies that we have no ability to look at the data
[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:07.820]   inside a phone."
[01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:10.100]   And that's something that they're going to -- that a company is going to have to look
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:13.700]   at, particularly as they're trying to sell phones into other markets.
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:20.580]   If our government starts passing laws, insisting that NSA and other agencies get to have some
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:25.020]   sort of ability to look in on this technology, that makes that technology harder to sell
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:28.860]   to other governments and to other people.
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:30.740]   So this is going to get worse before it gets better.
[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:35.260]   And I hope this becomes -- I hope this becomes questions in the presidential debate to come.
[01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:39.100]   I think it was even more complicated because they said, "Yeah, fine, but this is an iOS
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:41.020]   7 device that we want to look at."
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:43.900]   And then Apple said, "You know, that's a huge burden if you start sending us all these
[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:44.900]   older iOS devices.
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:48.980]   We have to devote time and energy, and that's a lot of work to get into them."
[01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:51.940]   And they're like, "Well, show us that it's a lot of work because you just said there
[01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:54.140]   aren't that many running it anymore."
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:59.540]   So if you're running iOS 7, upgrade is also one of the lessons you get from here.
[01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:00.540]   Yeah.
[01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:01.540]   Yeah.
[01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:09.340]   Speaking of this, of course, the Cyber Security Information Sharing Act is making its way through
[01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:13.460]   the Senate and is not so far off from getting voted on.
[01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:18.300]   This is something Apple and many other tech companies oppose, although according to Boingboing,
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:25.060]   Facebook both opposed it and in private encouraged members of Congress to pass the bill.
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:31.060]   The bill would allow the government, some say, to collect information, personal data from
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:32.060]   these companies.
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:36.820]   The idea is, since companies are under cyber attack, that they should be able to freely
[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:42.020]   share information about those attacks with each other and with the federal government
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:43.940]   without risk of liability.
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:48.140]   And I think, on the one hand, these companies would love to eliminate any liability that
[01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:49.980]   would come from sharing this kind of information.
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:55.140]   But on the other hand, they realize now that in this current climate, this is a very controversial
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:56.940]   thing to do.
[01:22:56.940 --> 01:23:00.820]   The Princeton Center for Information Technology Policy sent an open letter to the Senate,
[01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:03.420]   encouraging them not to pass the bill.
[01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:07.460]   Edward Snowden, of course, has called for SISA to be scrapped.
[01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:13.860]   Apple, Facebook, Google, all saying, "We don't want this bill."
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:18.220]   Although, again, I have a feeling that some of them would love to have the...
[01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:22.820]   There's got to be a people inside of all of those companies saying, "Gosh, legal immunity
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:25.260]   for violating privacy laws would be a good thing."
[01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:27.260]   We wouldn't have to worry about lawsuits.
[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:30.780]   The lawyers are saying, "Are you sure you want to oppose this?"
[01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:37.580]   SISA would allow voluntary sharing of private information with the government and would
[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:40.700]   make it impossible for you to sue.
[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:44.500]   It would also neutralize the Freedom of Information Act.
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:49.300]   So you wouldn't even know if this information is being shared and you wouldn't be able to
[01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:52.260]   find out.
[01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:56.140]   So I was mistaken on a Twitter.
[01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:58.940]   I thought it had already been passed by the Senate.
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:00.980]   It had come out of committee.
[01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:02.940]   So the Senate is close to voting.
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:07.740]   The bill then will have to pass the House of Representatives, although given the makeup
[01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:10.820]   of the House of Representatives, it doesn't look like it's going to face much opposition
[01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:12.100]   there.
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:13.100]   Then reconciliation.
[01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:22.020]   And the president says he will sign it if it crosses his desk.
[01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:25.940]   Brian Krebs in Krebs Uncurities says, "While many business leaders fail to appreciate
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:30.100]   the value and criticality of all their ICT assets, I assure you, today's cyber crooks
[01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:33.020]   know all too well how much these assets are worth.
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:36.700]   And this yawning gap in awareness and understanding is evident by the sheer number of breaches
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:41.980]   announced every week, that will grant you is true."
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:49.620]   I think there are reasons why you would want to promote this, but people like Krebs and
[01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:53.820]   other security experts say it wouldn't really help the issue.
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:25:00.100]   You would just make privacy harder to come by.
[01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:06.580]   Keep your eye peeled and if you have an opinion, which I think you perhaps do, you can go to
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:11.900]   your local member of Congress and let them know, of course, our Senator, Diane Feinstein's
[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:13.100]   want to come up with the bill.
[01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:16.140]   So I probably won't write to her.
[01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:21.540]   I forget who said it, but there was someone who just said, "Imagine any time one of these
[01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:24.060]   laws comes up that it's your newty pictures that are being disclosed."
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:28.420]   And I think how you feel about that and then use that as your determining factor.
[01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:29.420]   Yeah.
[01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:33.260]   Apple stores are going to send some of your phones off for off-site repairs instead of
[01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:40.420]   trying to fix them in store and they will give you a 16 gigabyte loaner.
[01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:44.060]   In other words, something you really won't want to keep.
[01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:48.020]   While they do so, this is to reduce wait times at Genius Bars.
[01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:57.060]   The new repair program for iPhone 6, 6S, 6 Plus and 6S Plus will allow the Genius to
[01:25:57.060 --> 01:26:00.980]   determine that the phone should be shipped to an off-site repair center.
[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:06.900]   If the device is unable to connect to iTunes, if the phone will not power on or if the phone
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:11.940]   does not boot up past the Apple logo, it takes a lot of time to try to fix this in store
[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:15.500]   and do a DFU and rebuild and all of that.
[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:20.820]   So if the customer agrees to have it sent for off-site diagnostics and repair here, she
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:28.540]   will be loaned to 16 gigabyte iPhone 6 to add insult to the injury to use for the injury.
[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:32.060]   I think the first claim was to loan them a blackberry because they don't remember how
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:33.060]   good they have it.
[01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:35.940]   It is the first time they've done the loaner units.
[01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:39.260]   Usually though, if it's really dead, won't they just swap it?
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:41.340]   Yeah, it depends on what the...
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:43.780]   But you go on the internet, go search up and do...
[01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:45.660]   You can do a lot of this probably shooting yourself.
[01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:47.220]   Yeah, you might want to.
[01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:48.220]   Yeah.
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:49.220]   Yeah.
[01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:50.220]   I don't know.
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:53.940]   I mean, they said it takes about a week to get the phone back.
[01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:56.660]   So for a week you have an iPhone 6 with 16 gigs.
[01:26:56.660 --> 01:26:58.140]   The watch has still got sent out now.
[01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:00.780]   So if you've had your watch sent out, you know what the process is like.
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:01.940]   Do you get a loaner watch?
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:03.700]   No, you do not get a loaner watch.
[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:04.700]   I don't think there's enough.
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:06.740]   I can't live without my watch.
[01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:08.740]   I don't know.
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:13.460]   I'm not sure you want wrist hair and dead skin cells that don't belong to you on your
[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:14.460]   wrist for a week.
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:20.620]   I wonder how much of this is just to speed people through the process of getting in for
[01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:24.100]   service and getting out for service and how much of that is the resources that they have
[01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:26.500]   available down in every one of these stores.
[01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:30.340]   It's easy to see all the resources that are in the flagship store, but your average mall
[01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:31.340]   lap is the store.
[01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:34.300]   If you've been in the back room there, there's just not a whole lot of room to do anything
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:36.420]   really sophisticated.
[01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:39.980]   Remember when the HTC A9 came out?
[01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:43.420]   Everybody posted pictures on Twitter showing how much it looked like an iPhone.
[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:45.580]   They moved the camera to the middle.
[01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:47.860]   It really did look a lot like the iPhone 6.
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:48.860]   HTC says, "No, no.
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:50.500]   It's Apple copying us."
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:51.500]   Yeah.
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.660]   Let's get this straight.
[01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:54.980]   I'm so glad they're standing up for themselves.
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:58.980]   Finally, don't speaking truth to power.
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:02.740]   It's not us copying them.
[01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:04.220]   That's just a quick game.
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:07.100]   A9 looks less like the last HTC than the last HTC.
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:08.100]   Isn't that funny?
[01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:10.380]   It looks more like an iPhone than it does like an M9.
[01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:13.020]   Phil Nickinson did a great editorial on Android Central where he just said, "This is the
[01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:16.300]   last thing HTC should be spending their time or energy on right now."
[01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:18.940]   They have so many other things that they need to worry about.
[01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:21.020]   Their eye suspect going to go out of the phone business.
[01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:26.420]   They have a VR helmet which everybody says is the best on the market, the Vive.
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:27.780]   They have a partnership with Steam.
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:30.340]   Maybe just do that.
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:31.620]   Forget this phone stuff.
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:32.620]   It's tough.
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:33.620]   I love that.
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:35.460]   I've loved their phones since the Trio Pro.
[01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:36.460]   I loved the M9.
[01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:38.540]   M7, 8, and 9 were great phones.
[01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:39.540]   Beautiful.
[01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:42.380]   I like they're doing different things with the cameras and stuff like that.
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:43.380]   They're doing different things.
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:44.380]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:45.380]   It's really fun.
[01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:46.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:47.380]   It's an incredible thing.
[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:48.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:49.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:50.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:51.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:52.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:53.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:54.380]   I like it.
[01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:55.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:56.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:57.380]   I like the difference between the two.
[01:28:57.380 --> 01:28:58.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:28:58.380 --> 01:28:59.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:00.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:01.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:02.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:03.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:10.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:18.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:22.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:26.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:31.380]   It's a great thing to get into.
[01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:33.380]   Sometimes, you know, it comes up with a great thing
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:36.380]   from the hardware, but it didn't end up with a lifelong commitment.
[01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:37.380]   Which is a shame.
[01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:38.380]   Oh, real hard.
[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:39.380]   It's a shame.
[01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:42.380]   Although now I have to say, and we've talked to a lot of people,
[01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:44.380]   Jason Howell, reviewed the new Nexus phones,
[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:46.380]   which are from LG and Huawei, not Motorola,
[01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:50.380]   and everybody seems to agree these are the best Android phones ever.
[01:29:50.380 --> 01:29:51.380]   Yeah.
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:55.380]   So, did you decide to keep the 6P or the 5X, Jason?
[01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:56.380]   6P.
[01:29:56.380 --> 01:29:58.380]   6P is absolutely my jam.
[01:29:58.380 --> 01:29:59.380]   Yeah, sure.
[01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:00.380]   Yeah.
[01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:01.380]   I was surprised.
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:02.380]   Who was it we were talking to who says,
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:03.380]   "No, I'm going with a 5X."
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:06.380]   They liked it was lighter, smaller screen.
[01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:07.380]   Is it Rana-Mottie?
[01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:08.380]   I think it was.
[01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:10.380]   Yeah, I honestly have no idea.
[01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:11.380]   I think it was Rana-Mottie.
[01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:12.380]   Yeah.
[01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:14.380]   Sounds like it was probably Rana-Mottie.
[01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:15.380]   Yeah.
[01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:17.380]   They're both great devices.
[01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:19.380]   You know, the 6P is just kind of the step up
[01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:22.380]   and really kind of covers all the bases for me anyways.
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:23.380]   From a design perspective.
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:26.380]   And you reviewed it, didn't you?
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:29.380]   My 6P 5X review is coming up late this week next
[01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:32.380]   early next, because I'm going into town tomorrow
[01:30:32.380 --> 01:30:35.380]   to do my camera tests of both of those phones.
[01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:37.380]   And I love them both.
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:40.380]   It's like some people on Twitter are asking me about my
[01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:42.380]   opinions, they're in the same position of asking,
[01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:44.380]   figuring out whether they want to go,
[01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:45.380]   a Y-Phone or Android.
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:48.380]   And I had to go and say that, isn't it lovely that we're now
[01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:51.380]   in a place where, well, not just we had a,
[01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:55.380]   voice had a choice, but now the hardware is top notch
[01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:57.380]   on both devices.
[01:30:57.380 --> 01:30:59.380]   The operating system is top notch on both devices.
[01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:02.380]   The user experience top notch on both devices.
[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:05.380]   And it can, in my case, it can come down to something
[01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:09.380]   as stupid and trivial as I just think that Android M is
[01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:12.380]   prettier and more interesting to look at than iOS at this
[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:14.380]   juncture on a phone.
[01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:17.380]   And that's truly what it could come down to,
[01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:22.380]   that I just still don't like the new iOS 789 interface.
[01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:25.380]   I just think it's very, very bland and very, very bleak.
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:28.380]   And I think that the Android interface now is just very,
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:29.380]   very exciting.
[01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:31.380]   And how about the cameras?
[01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:36.380]   I've done, I've only done some trivial tests of both of them
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:38.380]   and they're really, really close.
[01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:42.380]   I put up one side by side comparison and just without
[01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:44.380]   saying that one was better than the other, just saying,
[01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:45.380]   well, which one do you prefer?
[01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:48.380]   And the opinion was about 50/50 between the,
[01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:53.380]   the 6P and the iPhone 6 plus, 6S plus.
[01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:56.380]   And looking at them both, I can't really say that one of them
[01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:58.380]   did a poor or better job than the other.
[01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:01.380]   It really is just, do you like this?
[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:05.380]   In this one particular shot, the Nexus was a little bit warmer
[01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:07.380]   than the iPhone.
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:10.380]   In this particular shot, there were some reflections that had
[01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:13.380]   a little bit more detail in the iPhone version of it.
[01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:15.380]   So it's going to be a lot of fun being at the Boston Public
[01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:18.380]   Library tomorrow in the public garden to really spend a day
[01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:20.380]   shooting with both of them to see if there's any difference
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:21.380]   really between the phone.
[01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:23.380]   To be for this miracle for a Nexus camera.
[01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:24.380]   That's not good.
[01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:25.380]   No, absolutely.
[01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:26.380]   They haven't done it at all.
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:29.380]   That's a different, well also, also because, remember that
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:33.380]   Nexus, they've always had the sort of secondary goal of making
[01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:36.380]   an affordable U-Buy, U-Own it, unlocked phone.
[01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:39.380]   Back when nobody was making unlocked phones, there was,
[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:41.380]   so there were priced for, to buy and own.
[01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:44.380]   So they would, like the Nexus, the Nexus 5, which is my
[01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:47.380]   current Android phone, doesn't have a great camera, but it's
[01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:50.380]   made up for by the HDR+ feature and what they do in the server
[01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:53.380]   doesn't have a great processor, but it's good enough.
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:56.380]   These are the first ones where they just seem to say that
[01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:59.380]   we're just going to make super awesome great phones and
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:01.380]   maybe they have.
[01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:04.380]   You know, I, because I was all excited about the iPhone 6X
[01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:09.380]   plus camera, but I find I have to do that many pictures
[01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:11.380]   on my camera phone.
[01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:14.380]   So it's maybe, I'm making, yeah, I'm making maybe a bigger
[01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:16.380]   deal of how important the camera is.
[01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:19.380]   If it's, if they're roughly equal, that's good enough for me.
[01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:22.380]   You use your camera all the time, Jim.
[01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:24.380]   It's the only camera that I really use.
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:29.380]   I've got one of those DXO ones, but, you know, I always carry
[01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:32.380]   around this camera, so that's, that's what I use.
[01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:35.380]   Yeah, but I do too, but I just don't, for some reason,
[01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:37.380]   you're in front of the camera all the time.
[01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:38.380]   I don't take a lot of pictures anymore.
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:41.380]   You have the new, you have the new iPhone camera commercial
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:42.380]   Leo with Lake Bell.
[01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:43.380]   Oh, should we play that?
[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:44.380]   Funpoint.
[01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:46.380]   All right, before we do that though, I just want to point out
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:49.380]   that the new Windows phone may have the best of all of the
[01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:50.380]   cameras.
[01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:56.380]   Have you seen this as an image from the 950 or 950 XL?
[01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:58.380]   They always had spectacular cameras.
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:33:59.380]   They always have.
[01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:02.380]   And it looks like they'll continue to do so.
[01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:04.380]   It's really a shame about Windows phone because...
[01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:05.380]   I know.
[01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:06.380]   Great hardware.
[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:10.380]   This is, I mean, this is a case of, this is a case of good enough.
[01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:13.380]   I want customers to have consumers to have the best camera in
[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:17.380]   their phone they can possibly have because in 15 years from now,
[01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:19.380]   they're going to wish they had a better picture of their kids
[01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:25.380]   for steps than they do right now, which is why I love how Android
[01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:28.380]   allows cameras to write raw data.
[01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:31.380]   So for instance, with the Samsung phone, if you put it into
[01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:34.380]   Pro Mode, it will not only get access to settings, but also
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:38.380]   write an Adobe DNG file alongside it.
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:42.380]   I wish that Apple would allow camera raw out of the iPhone as
[01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:45.380]   well because they might come a day, 10 years from now, when
[01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:47.380]   you're going to wish that you had all the extra data held
[01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:48.380]   for you from now.
[01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:49.380]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:50.380]   Yeah.
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:53.380]   And although the most important thing now is really the
[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:57.380]   processing that's happening in the camera, at least for now.
[01:34:57.380 --> 01:35:01.380]   Yeah, let's see if we can find that Apple iPhone at.
[01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:02.380]   You have that.
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:03.380]   You have.
[01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:04.380]   What is it again?
[01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:05.380]   YouTube.com/apple.
[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:06.380]   Oh, really?
[01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:08.380]   What's this YouTube thing you talk about?
[01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:10.380]   Well, we'll find out for YouTube Red.
[01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:12.380]   Yeah, you know, I'm a little worried.
[01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:15.380]   I still don't know what's going to happen to us with YouTube Red.
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:20.380]   People, everybody from Patrick Norton and our fans on down are
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:22.380]   telling us, "Oh, you're not going to, it's not going to be any
[01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:23.380]   difference.
[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:25.380]   You're not going to, it's going to be fine."
[01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:28.380]   We shall see this is the ad free of YouTube that launches tomorrow.
[01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:29.380]   Here you go.
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:31.380]   This is the iPhone 6S camera.
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:33.380]   This is iPhone 6S.
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:37.380]   Not much has changed with the camera, except how you take a
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:38.380]   photo.
[01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:40.380]   I'm going to go.
[01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:41.380]   Find a photo.
[01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:42.380]   Share a photo.
[01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:45.380]   Ooh, mom's going to love that one.
[01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:48.380]   Your photos themselves have changed too.
[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:50.380]   They move now.
[01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:53.380]   So photos of your friends can do this.
[01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:56.380]   And the ones of your family can do that.
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:35:59.380]   And your pet photos can do, wait, that's your pet?
[01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:00.380]   Uh, yeah.
[01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:01.380]   I dig it.
[01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:03.380]   Oh, now your screen is the flash.
[01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:04.380]   Say cheese.
[01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:05.380]   For yourself.
[01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:07.380]   And the camera shoots video in 4K.
[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:11.380]   So everything you shoot looks amazing.
[01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:13.380]   On that 1080p screen.
[01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:16.380]   You can even shoot Slo-Mo in HD.
[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:18.380]   Nice.
[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:19.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:20.380]   Watch this.
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:23.380]   This is Stefan Curry of the Warriors.
[01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:25.380]   Wait for it.
[01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:26.380]   Splash.
[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:28.380]   All right, that's a great ad.
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:31.380]   That's a good choice for this round and console.
[01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:36.380]   Interesting though, they highlight the stuff the software does.
[01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:39.380]   The software does as much as they do the stuff the camera does.
[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:40.380]   It's interesting.
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:41.380]   It's such a big deal.
[01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:43.380]   And that's just the post-processing.
[01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:50.380]   But in terms of what happens to that photo after you take it, what tools are there to make it a better photo than what can you do with it after you have the image that you want.
[01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:52.380]   Android is way, way up there.
[01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:56.380]   But the third party editing tools for iPhone are really spectacular.
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:37:00.380]   It's just not just fine tuning, but also the creative stuff.
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:02.380]   I'm starting to think that maybe it's wrong.
[01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:11.380]   I'm going away from doing side by side comparisons, publishing them because they're starting to become really irrelevant as these cameras become closer and closer to each other.
[01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:22.380]   If there is a little difference between, let's say, the hypothetically, the new iPhone takes pictures that aren't quite so punchy or interesting in color as the Samsung phone or another one.
[01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:31.380]   They have such a photos app is so good at making it so easy to adjust that photo the way you want to without the color, brightness, saturation.
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:35.380]   Do you want the light to be more lighty or do you want it to be less lighty?
[01:37:35.380 --> 01:37:36.380]   Okay.
[01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:38.380]   Do you want it to be more color-y or less color-y?
[01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:41.380]   Do you want the colors a little bit off this way or a little bit off this way?
[01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:42.380]   Great.
[01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:43.380]   You can make it in 10 seconds.
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:46.380]   You can make it exactly like the way you'd like it to look at.
[01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:51.380]   So it's just phenomenal what you can do in the iOS ecosystem.
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:52.380]   Yeah.
[01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:58.380]   But again, that's kind of the point I was making is as much as I want a good camera, they're all pretty good.
[01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:03.380]   If you get a late model, they're all going to be good enough for most of the stuff you do.
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:05.380]   And none of them are going to be great in low light.
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:07.380]   They're all going to be a little grainy in low light.
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:10.380]   Do you have your fancy Sony, Lou?
[01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:12.380]   And that's why I have my fancy Sony exactly.
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:15.380]   Yeah, if you really care about that kind of thing or your idea.
[01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:24.380]   I took the big camera test for the 6 Plus, 6S Plus was near Comic Con a couple of weeks ago.
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:30.380]   And I took so many pictures there that they're in my Lightroom library and one folder with all the pictures that I took,
[01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:34.380]   including with the $1,000 camera with the $900 lens attached.
[01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:43.380]   And under good conditions, there's so many instances which I just can't really tell a substance of difference between the iPhone picture and the real "camera".
[01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:45.380]   And that's really not true of most of them.
[01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:51.380]   But the fact that a camera phone is now that good is just so mind-boggling.
[01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:52.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:39:00.380]   We live in wonderful times, especially when you compare the original iPhone or the original iPod with the newest iPod.
[01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:01.380]   Grandpa.
[01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:02.380]   Yeah.
[01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:03.380]   You're going to come a long way.
[01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:05.380]   Pictures from that iPod kind of suck.
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:06.380]   Yeah.
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:07.380]   Go to the original iPad.
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:09.380]   They were the best.
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:12.380]   You know what, I think they just forgot to put the opening for the camera lens.
[01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:15.380]   Oh, I got to say, the mirrored back makes it really, really easy to line up selfies.
[01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:18.380]   I have to keep holding it like that to keep the selfie.
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:19.380]   That's all.
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:20.380]   I don't know.
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:21.380]   My mirrored back, I look like a ghost.
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:22.380]   It's all scratched up now.
[01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:24.380]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:29.380]   And if you would prepare your pics, gentlemen, that's next on Mac break weekly.
[01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:32.380]   But first, I'm going to tip for you something called Unity.
[01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:36.380]   It sounds like Unity with a U, but it's Unity spelled with Y-O-U.
[01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:41.380]   And it is a way of unifying all the media on your computers at home
[01:39:41.380 --> 01:39:46.380]   so that you can watch them, see them on your iPhone or your iPad.
[01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:51.380]   Access everything you've got anywhere you are at home at a friend's house at the office,
[01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:54.380]   traveling, and it's free.
[01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:56.380]   So there's no reason not to.
[01:39:56.380 --> 01:40:05.380]   Go to getunity.com, G-E-T-Y-O-U, N-I-T-Y.com/twit, and download it for your desktop.
[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:07.380]   It takes, it's very fast.
[01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:08.380]   I have to say it.
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:13.380]   I've got to say anything quite so fast at indexing my movies, videos, photos, and music on my desktop.
[01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:16.380]   You can do it on multiple computers.
[01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:21.380]   It will read your Lightroom and Apple Photos, Libraries, and Photo albums.
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:26.380]   You can automatically, if you do it on multiple computers, merge the iTunes accounts and libraries.
[01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:31.380]   So all the music on various computers are really available to you on the Internet.
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:35.380]   Yes, you can pass, it's password protected, so it's secure.
[01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:43.380]   It will auto-discover GoPro videos, and you can even use AirPlay to stream it from your phone or iPad to your TV.
[01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:47.380]   Create your own private personal media server.
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:51.380]   It really, it couldn't be easier, and it's free.
[01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:52.380]   Did I mention that?
[01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:54.380]   Getunity.com/twit.
[01:40:54.380 --> 01:41:00.380]   I don't mean free as in freemium or free, they're going to try to upsell you.
[01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:01.380]   It's free.
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:04.380]   Getunity.com/twit.
[01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:07.380]   Works really, really well.
[01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:12.380]   And if you want to get all your photos and videos and music and everything on your phone,
[01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:19.380]   so you can show them to family and friends, there's no better way, getunity.com/twit.
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:22.380]   Andy Inaco, your pick of the week.
[01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:25.380]   First, a quick correction.
[01:41:25.380 --> 01:41:30.380]   I think I called the website where I got my Shaver recommendation, I said that wrong.
[01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:38.380]   It's actually thesweethome.com, but it's a recommendation for thesweethome.com for things that are not really subjective.
[01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:42.380]   This is the Braun Series 7 razors that I bought.
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:44.380]   Again, my old one was crapped out.
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:50.380]   The one that I bought two years ago, for $50 or $60 was so weak, it just can't get through my beard.
[01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:51.380]   It was just terrible.
[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:58.380]   So I'm sick of both of these, so just the sweet home or something like that, whether it's a skillet or a hotter pop or something like that.
[01:41:58.380 --> 01:42:06.380]   It's like either I spend three days, three weeks, three months obsessing over features and learning all about shavers, or I just say,
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:09.380]   whatever the sweet home says, that's the one I will buy.
[01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:10.380]   I'm sure it'll be good.
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:11.380]   And this is...
[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:15.380]   Andy Did you guess where the word goes in the charger also will clean it?
[01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:16.380]   Andy It's got...
[01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:17.380]   Andy You put it head down.
[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:20.380]   Andy As a matter of fact, this morning, I was leaping off of...
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:23.380]   Leaping where my desk had running to find my phone because I could hear it buzzing.
[01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:27.380]   I was like, "Oh, my God, I got to get into the phone." And it was this in my bathroom.
[01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:28.380]   Andy Yeah.
[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:32.380]   Andy You buy these cartridges and it does quite a few cleaning cycles.
[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:39.380]   And then it's got alcohol and it cleans it and I don't use an electric razor, but I got one for Michael, our son.
[01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:43.380]   He's almost 13. He's starting to have a little...
[01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:45.380]   Andy doesn't... it maybe wants to wake him up.
[01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:47.380]   Andy He hates the smell of the cleaner, though.
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:48.380]   Andy I don't know.
[01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:49.380]   Andy He won't let me clean it.
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:50.380]   I like it.
[01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:51.380]   It makes it smell fresh.
[01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:56.380]   Andy It smells like the barber shop that I used to take me to when I was a kid.
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:57.380]   Andy Yeah.
[01:42:57.380 --> 01:42:58.380]   Andy That's fine.
[01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:00.380]   Andy This really is the nicest razor I've ever had.
[01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:01.380]   Andy Oh, yeah, there's so good.
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:04.380]   Andy It really does just go jute right through it.
[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:10.380]   Andy I knew that something had to give when I noticed that I was using the crappy underpowered razor that I bought a couple years ago.
[01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:15.380]   Andy I noticed that it was missing the last rose that I could not get to this stuff.
[01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:20.380]   Andy I started to get... it wasn't like the long hairs there, but I was getting in two months time.
[01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:25.380]   Andy I would have a full weirdo line of beard down here.
[01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:26.380]   Andy You don't want that.
[01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:27.380]   Andy Definitely worth the money.
[01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:28.380]   Andy Yeah, you definitely want that.
[01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:31.380]   Andy But the recommendations for the Sweet Home again.
[01:43:31.380 --> 01:43:34.380]   Andy For cameras, I will go to the obsessive thing.
[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:35.380]   Andy Well, here's what.
[01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:36.380]   Andy Do you want this?
[01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:37.380]   Andy Right.
[01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:38.380]   Andy It's hard to make one recommendation.
[01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:39.380]   Andy This one is, I'm done.
[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:40.380]   Andy I have this two days later from Amazon.
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:45.380]   Andy They got an Amazon credit for the recommendation, and it's just that simple.
[01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:49.380]   Andy I was going to start to say this sounds like the wire cutter, but it's from the wire cutter.
[01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:55.380]   Andy That's why I keep getting them confused, and also their Twitter account name is different
[01:43:55.380 --> 01:43:57.380]   from their actual site name.
[01:43:57.380 --> 01:43:59.380]   Andy Their site name is actually Home Sweet Home.
[01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:04.380]   Andy Excuse me, the Twitter handle is the Home Sweet Home, and so it confused the heck out of me.
[01:44:04.380 --> 01:44:07.380]   Andy The site name is the Sweet Home.com.
[01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:08.380]   Andy Sweet Home.com.
[01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:13.380]   Andy But my iOS pick is Zen Pinball, which has been around for a while.
[01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:18.380]   Andy It's a pinball simulator that has a store where you can buy extra pinball tables, and they just
[01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:26.380]   came out with Bob's Burger's Pinball Game and Archer Pinball Game using original voices
[01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:31.380]   and sound effects from both of those cartoons, and it's fun as hell.
[01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:36.380]   Andy I bought Zen Pinball ages ago, so it won't cost me anything, but that's awesome.
[01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:38.380]   Andy Yeah, you have to buy those extra.
[01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:42.380]   Andy Yeah, those are each of those two games is about 99.
[01:44:42.380 --> 01:44:45.380]   Andy They also have a family guy game, but who cares about family guy?
[01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:50.380]   Andy They have characters keep making appearances, and it's pretty to have fun.
[01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:51.380]   Andy And also it's just a great...
[01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:53.380]   Andy Look how real it looks.
[01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:54.380]   Andy That's the game.
[01:44:54.380 --> 01:45:02.380]   Andy The physics is like I'm right back there in 1992 at the arcade and playing Adam's family
[01:45:02.380 --> 01:45:06.380]   pinball with Raoul Julia and Angelica Houston.
[01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:11.380]   Andy They have that table too, I think it's a good $1.99 worth of entertainment for my home.
[01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:13.380]   Andy They also have Star Wars, I see.
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:15.380]   Andy Yeah, they keep doing licenses.
[01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:20.380]   Andy The other cool thing is that the Archer Pinball Game happened because somebody on Twitter
[01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:24.380]   said that it would be an awesome thing to have, then someone who works for Bob's...
[01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:29.380]   Andy For Archer on Fox, oh wow, that would be awesome, and then they got hooked up.
[01:45:29.380 --> 01:45:32.380]   Andy Then the Zen Pinball people, oh wow, can we actually do that deal?
[01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:38.380]   Andy Truly, that's why this thing got created because people on Twitter thought would be a good idea,
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:41.380]   Andy And it turns out that both of these companies are fans of each other.
[01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:42.380]   Andy Nice.
[01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:44.380]   Andy Then the love happened.
[01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:48.380]   Andy You know what happens after the love.
[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:52.380]   Andy Jim, do you want to recommend something or another rock and roll album?
[01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:54.380]   Andy Anything on your mind?
[01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:55.380]   Andy I'm going for music.
[01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:56.380]   Andy Okay.
[01:45:56.380 --> 01:46:00.380]   Andy So this time I'm going to recommend God's Mac.
[01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:02.380]   Andy Ah, God's Mac.
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:05.380]   Andy God's Mac is a great band.
[01:46:05.380 --> 01:46:07.380]   Andy I mean, some people might consider them...
[01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:10.380]   Andy They're not metal, they're hard rock.
[01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:14.380]   Andy And they use a lot of open...
[01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:20.380]   Andy Well, they use all open tunings on their music, so it's a lot of chugging music.
[01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:27.380]   Andy So, Sony Erna, who's the lead singer for the band, also plays a little bit of guitar.
[01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:30.380]   Andy He was the drummer for the band and a great drummer.
[01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:32.380]   Andy Band at a Boston.
[01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:33.380]   Andy Sounds like a lyric.
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:36.380]   Andy That could be a good lyric if you were a band at a Boston.
[01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:38.380]   Andy We're a band at a Boston.
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:44.380]   Andy So, God's Mac is a great, great band.
[01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:50.380]   Andy You listen to them, they pick you up and it's just straight ahead rock and roll.
[01:46:50.380 --> 01:46:51.380]   Andy Really, really great stuff.
[01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:57.380]   Andy They do have some really nice, slower songs, but they're not like ballads.
[01:46:57.380 --> 01:47:01.380]   Andy They're really deep songs, they're great, great stuff.
[01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:07.380]   Andy If you just want to band a, you can put on and drive and bang your fist on the steering wheel.
[01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:17.380]   Andy You know, a lot of people contacted me about my pick for Blackstone Cherry and said
[01:47:17.380 --> 01:47:20.380]   that they loved it and they wanted more like that.
[01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:22.380]   Andy So, God's Mac.
[01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:25.380]   Andy They were Justin Mokton, I can't believe I missed them.
[01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:31.380]   Andy But they are coming to Edmonton and Calgary.
[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:36.380]   Andy In fact, they're big Halloween concertably in Calgary and then onto Missoula and Niaq.
[01:47:36.380 --> 01:47:39.380]   Andy Acoma, oh, they're going to play the Warfield.
[01:47:39.380 --> 01:47:43.380]   Andy That'd be a nice theater to see them in San Francisco.
[01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:44.380]   Andy Yeah, oh my God.
[01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:46.380]   Andy I'm going to see them.
[01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:47.380]   Andy One is that?
[01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:48.380]   Andy That is November 6.
[01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:51.380]   Andy Be a great theater to see them.
[01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:56.380]   Andy Instead of a big stadium, that's a nice, intimate, you'll be deafened right away.
[01:47:56.380 --> 01:47:57.380]   Andy Right away.
[01:47:57.380 --> 01:47:58.380]   Andy Right away.
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:01.380]   Andy Mr. Rene Richie, you're picking the week.
[01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:05.380]   Andy So, because of Apple TV being on pre-order now, I thought I'd pick a couple Apple TV things.
[01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:10.380]   Andy And the first one is just a really simple stand and it's from Studio Neat and they make
[01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:15.380]   things like the glyph and the cosmonauts dialis and a really talented group of people.
[01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:20.380]   Andy I believe they're in Austin, Texas and this is just a very small piece of wood that's
[01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:25.380]   custom cut made in Austin for the Apple TV remote and it's just designed so that you don't
[01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:29.380]   put your Apple TV down on the sofa or on the table and lose track of it but you put it
[01:48:29.380 --> 01:48:32.380]   in the stand and you'll always be able to see and find it.
[01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:35.380]   Andy And I forget it's like $14 or $18 or something.
[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:36.380]   Andy I $12, really inexpensive.
[01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:38.380]   Andy This is a good idea.
[01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:39.380]   Andy It's a great idea.
[01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:40.380]   Andy It's really good looking.
[01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:44.380]   Andy If you listen to the audio and the video, it's Adam Lissigore, a lonely sandwich between
[01:48:44.380 --> 01:48:46.380]   the audio which is always delightful.
[01:48:46.380 --> 01:48:48.380]   Andy So, it's again super, super simple.
[01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:49.380]   Andy Be a great craft by Tom.
[01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:55.380]   Andy If you're looking at something to charge as well as stand, then of course 12-self has
[01:48:55.380 --> 01:48:58.380]   you covered already and they have a version of their high-rise stand which is what they sell
[01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:05.380]   for the iPhone, designed for the Apple remote and you just, you put it right on top of the
[01:49:05.380 --> 01:49:09.380]   lightning charger, it goes right into the wall, charges up your Apple remote when you're not
[01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:13.380]   using it or when it's low on batteries and either one of these, just depending on whether
[01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:16.380]   you want to build in charge or not they'll both serve you really, really well.
[01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:25.380]   Andy You probably want to run the Apple earnings call has begun looking at the live blog here
[01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:28.380]   from the Wall Street Journal.
[01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:33.380]   Andy They won't release the earnings until about, for another about 15 minutes.
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:36.380]   Andy Yeah, and then the conference call I think is in 45.
[01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:41.380]   Andy Yeah, anything you want to, we should expect to look for?
[01:49:41.380 --> 01:49:43.380]   Andy iPhone 1 is ready.
[01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:47.380]   Andy Excuse me, the first, yeah, the first full quarter of iPhone 6S, 6S plus sales.
[01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:49.380]   Andy Uh huh, all right.
[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:50.380]   Andy China sales will be interesting.
[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:53.380]   Andy Remember Tim Cook said nothing to worry about there.
[01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:57.380]   Andy Actually, I don't know, are iPhone 6S and 6S plus included in this or is it just a
[01:49:57.380 --> 01:49:58.380]   tail end of that quarter?
[01:49:58.380 --> 01:49:59.380]   Andy Or just a tail end?
[01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:01.380]   Andy Don't know.
[01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:03.380]   Andy Yeah, it would be the tail end, wouldn't it?
[01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:06.380]   Andy Yeah, because it came out very late in September this year, so maybe only a week.
[01:50:06.380 --> 01:50:09.380]   Andy Yeah, but you'll see at least something about that.
[01:50:09.380 --> 01:50:12.380]   Andy All right.
[01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:16.780]   Andy And I think we all can agree our pick the week might be in Apple TV if you haven't yet
[01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:17.780]   bought one.
[01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:18.780]   Andy You can get one at the stores.
[01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:20.380]   Andy They're going to be in store Friday Saturday.
[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:22.380]   Andy Something around that, yeah.
[01:50:22.380 --> 01:50:24.380]   Andy Apple hasn't said for sure, but they said end of the week.
[01:50:24.380 --> 01:50:28.380]   Andy Yeah, end of the week.
[01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:35.180]   Andy Twitter is also doing its results and third quarter revenue is up 58% over year over
[01:50:35.180 --> 01:50:42.380]   year, but the stock is tanking down 9%, apparently the analysts expected more or better.
[01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:44.380]   Andy Thank you everybody.
[01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:51.380]   Andy We do this show every Tuesday, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern Time, 1800 UTC on Twitter.TV.

[01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:26.380]   Andy Alright.
[01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:31.380]   Andy If you feel like coming up, we always got to go and borrow a couple of Wi-Fi.
[01:51:31.380 --> 01:51:35.380]   Andy We also want to thank Andy and I go from the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:41.900]   Andy Always a pleasure and we'll look for your review of the new Nex-I phones in the Sun
[01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:43.380]   Times soon.
[01:51:43.380 --> 01:51:45.380]   Andy Thanks to all of you for being here.
[01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:46.380]   Andy We'll see you next time.

[01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:55.380]   Andy Oh, also want to remind you that we only have a few more days for our T-shirt.
[01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:59.380]   Andy If you go to tspring.com/twit.
[01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:02.380]   Andy This is, I think, the prettiest T-shirt we've ever done.
[01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:08.380]   Andy Here, it's loading up here in the fabulously speedy edge browser.
[01:52:08.380 --> 01:52:09.380]   Andy Oh, Andy.
[01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:12.380]   Andy I'll load up any minute now.
[01:52:12.380 --> 01:52:13.380]   Andy Oh, Andy Okay.
[01:52:13.380 --> 01:52:15.380]   Andy Just a couple of weeks left to get it.
[01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:18.380]   Andy This is designed by our own Anthony Nielsen.
[01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:22.380]   Andy And when I saw that, I said, "That is cool."
[01:52:22.380 --> 01:52:26.380]   Andy We have a variety of sizes and styles for men and women.
[01:52:26.380 --> 01:52:30.380]   Andy There's a next level women's V-neck, an American Apparel crew for the Loom T.
[01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:31.380]   Andy And they're all $20.
[01:52:31.380 --> 01:52:32.380]   Andy Very affordable.
[01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:36.380]   Andy We make a little bit of money, but really it's more a limited edition thing we like to
[01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:41.380]   Andy Like to put out these T-shirts and give you a chance maybe for gifts, perhaps,
[01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:46.380]   for Halloween costumes, two more weeks to order, only available until November 10th.
[01:52:46.380 --> 01:52:49.380]   Andy And once it's done, it's done forever.
[01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:54.380]   Andy Tspring, T-W-E Spring.com/twit.
[01:52:54.380 --> 01:52:58.380]   Andy I always love it when we see people in our Twitter in the studio.
[01:52:58.380 --> 01:52:59.380]   Andy Thanks for joining us.
[01:52:59.380 --> 01:53:01.380]   Andy Now back to work because you know what?
[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:02.380]   Andy It's over.
[01:53:02.380 --> 01:53:12.380]   [MUSIC]
