[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:15.000]   But should you wait till the spring or fall? Maybe. We'll also take a look at Apple's amazing success with the retail stores.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.800]   Tim Cook has some numbers. The eye watch just a little bit and we answer the question.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.400]   For once and for all, does iTunes suck? Mac Break Weekly is next.

[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.400]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show the covers your Apple needs. In great, almost one would say obsessive.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:14.400]   Uh, depth and that's because we've got obsessive Mac fans here starting. Let's see where should I go. I'll go left to right.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:22.400]   Actually, I'll go right to left. Andy Inaco affixing his pop filter even as we speak. Hello, Mr. Inaco.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.400]   But I'm surprised that the second pop filter is in a very surprising location.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.400]   [laughter]
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.400]   No, we don't want any plosives on this show. Look how clear he looks.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.400]   No unattended plosives. Doesn't he? Oh, you haven't been here since we said him the Mac Mini.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   And he's got flamour.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   You and the guy who suggested the Mac Mini. He's got a core too. Why? That's not nearly sufficient. And look how beautiful he looks.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.400]   You can see the detail on Wonder Woman's corset.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:59.400]   Yeah, I'll do some shopping for some of the Barbie clothes. Get her a nice little like G-Vonci little sweater.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   Chad, you're getting really good at the zoom.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   [laughter]
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   One would almost think you'd pre-program that in.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:13.400]   Also with this rare appearance of the flightless, actually the flighted Alex Lindsay.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.400]   Here, come this afternoon.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   He's a back on a plane.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.400]   Only for a couple days.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   Hey, is this a different kind of, oh, you just put yellow tape around it so we wouldn't lose it?
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   You know what's funny is this is the adapter for the big Mac.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   Try pulling the big Mac safe.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   It's harder to pull off when you put that extra adapter on it.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.400]   It's like it doubles up the Mac.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.400]   Yeah, it's like it's a double magnet.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.400]   I don't mind that.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.400]   I love it.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.400]   Yeah, no.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   It's a feature not a book.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   It feels like it goes in good.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.400]   We just got a new Mac book era around here and that has new the big Mac safe now.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.400]   So all the new laptops are in Mac safe.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.400]   Everything's been upgraded.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   Welcome back.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   Good to see you.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   Good to be here.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.400]   Also here with us Renee Ritchie from iMore.com.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.400]   Hello, Renee.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   Hi, Leo.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.400]   Welcome back.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.400]   Pleasure to join you.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400]   Yeah, nice to have you.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.400]   Breaking news, Apple.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.800]   Employee laptops hacked in the same way the Facebook employee laptops were hacked last
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.800]   week.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.680]   Apple says they were visiting.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   It was just a few of them.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.520]   No data was lost.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:17.960]   They were visiting according to Ina Freed and all things D a software developer site that
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.320]   had been hacked apparently.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.320]   Consenting adults.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.560]   Consenting software developers.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.560]   Consenting beats.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.800]   They were only trying to learn new skills to make software better for the customers.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.440]   They're only guilty of loving their customers too much.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.680]   Now remember Java is not on Macintosh is at least starting with OS 10 Lion and I presume
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.240]   that these engineers are using the latest version of OS 10.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:51.400]   However, perhaps they needed to use OS 10 and Java for whatever they were up to.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.880]   Also remember that at least on the Macintosh if you don't use Java for 35 days it gets
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.880]   turned off.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.280]   What if they were working on the Java patch that would be ironic.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.280]   They must have been.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.640]   They're doing something with Java, right?
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.160]   Also Safari and Chrome both say hey are you sure?
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.200]   You're really sure you want to run Java on this site.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.560]   So there were many protections to keep them from being compromised.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.560]   This is by the way a known compromise, a known vulnerability in the Java plug-in.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.600]   Oracle's had the worst trouble with this.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   Apple has not been able to keep up with the patches either Apple as you know does their
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.440]   own version of Java for Macatoches.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:33.720]   And Facebook says it was the victim of a targeted attack last month using the same Java flaw.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.760]   Reuters implied that it was the same people doing it but I don't think that that's necessarily
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.760]   the case.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.080]   I think it's just that's the new way.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.600]   That's this is you know a lot of people are see says Apple Mac computers hit by hackers who
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.960]   targeted Facebook said Reuters.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.880]   I don't think that's accurate necessarily but it's a good headline.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.280]   Yeah, I think that's the issue is it's good headline.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.920]   The exclusive in the front of it Apple was recently attacked by hackers who infected
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.760]   the Macintosh and computers of some employees.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.560]   The same software was used to launch attacks against Facebook that does not mean the same
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.800]   people because this is a well known Java flaw that a lot of people are taking advantage
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   of right.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.520]   I think that the information is so thin right now.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.520]   Right.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.240]   Unfortunately I was unfortunate I picked the wrong hour to like leave and do some errands
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.960]   but by the time I came back like 15 minutes for a show time with like two emails from
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.520]   my editor saying hi can you write something like right now about this and so I can't.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.280]   Well there's nothing to say exactly.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.840]   I mean everybody's quoting the same Reuters article.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.920]   Nope and so we can't really guess that these are independent incidents.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.680]   We can't guess that this is a coordinated attack.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.640]   We can't guess that this is one government that's trying to do their own little test
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.880]   missile firings where it's not just trying to test or equipment but also to send the
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.200]   message to other people that hey look what we can do.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.280]   We literally know nothing other than what Apple has confirmed which is that there wasn't
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.600]   a there was attack that wasn't attack.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.520]   Employee computers got compromised.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.600]   No employee excuse me.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.160]   No customer data was compromised and it was using a Java exploit surprise surprise and
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.520]   hopefully we'll have no more sometime in the next 24 hours.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.120]   Yeah it could have been the same thing that others all of us not me but because I turned
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.800]   off Java but anybody who had to turn off Java suspect to remember last month the Department
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.240]   of Homeland Security said disabled Java in your browser.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.000]   I mean this is a you but it comes on the heels of President Obama's State of the Union where
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.960]   he mentioned you know this concern over Chinese hackers the Mandiant story saying that the
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:34.880]   Chinese military there's a unit that is orchestrating a series of texts not on US military but on
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.080]   US companies it's it's it's not it's business warfare not not cyber war.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.680]   Yeah and it's it's always it's maybe Alex we can try not on this too but it's always
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.400]   been for the past at least two or three years to my knowledge every business person that
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.320]   sent to China is given the advice buy a new laptop and burn it when you leave do not use
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:59.040]   any personal email do not do any personal the sick unsecured business transactions anywhere
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.400]   could not to do any sort of a Chinese network because if you are above a certain profile
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.440]   level there is an excellent chance that you are being targeted by a government backed hacking
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:13.160]   squad that wants to get access not to military secrets but just find out if this person is
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.680]   trying to get a secure bid to work here in China I want to know what all the back channel
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.520]   communications are there as a matter of fact just wasn't it just a few weeks ago that
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.680]   we came up that some business people were actually being blackmailed by sort of people
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.200]   who were in that sort of loop in China and suddenly said well here's some embarrassing
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.800]   emails I bet I can really get some sort of money out of these people if I just you know
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.080]   try to feather my own nest instead of what I'm doing on the clock it's industrial espionage
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.920]   that's the word it's it's it's it's very it's very easy to to blow this out of proportion
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.440]   but nonetheless we have to understand that we don't know what we know we don't we don't
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:53.840]   know what the scale of the thing is I guess here's the point for us is that the same vulnerabilities
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:09:00.560]   that Windows users who allow Java in the browser have been susceptible to also hit the Macintosh
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.280]   well the question is how long do we want to keep I mean I think that the problem is for
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.280]   us is that Java is so embedded that it's very hard that it's not everything again it doesn't
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.000]   it doesn't bundle Java you have to download it explicitly it says it turns it off after
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.440]   35 I mean yeah what can you do at this at this point like I think that I really do want my
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:23.520]   screensaver to be a picture of like a Ford Pinto with a Java bumper sticker on it because
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:30.360]   it has has any unsafe at any speed it's like it's been so totally trash by by violent
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.840]   improbably violent danger of use well not only that well I don't know why it is on the
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.080]   Macintosh but when you try to install Java on Windows these days it also says I'd like
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.960]   to install this and that there's like a I think it wants to install the Macafee security scan
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.320]   the ask toolbar the ask toolbar I mean come on
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:54.240]   is that the you tarnish this brand any worse there's a lot of institutions schools governments
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.360]   that have Java just as their runtime as their tools are built in their web tools their internal
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.560]   tools and the IT departments keep people on Java using it and it's not computers they control so
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.920]   they're always going to be vulnerable to this well if you want to play Minecraft on a Mac
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:13.120]   right Chad you have to install Java yeah but that's different than the browser plug in luckily it is
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.680]   different than the browser plug in so disable it in your browser it should be disabled anyway but
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.640]   if it's not disabled to disable it now well yeah I'm personally you know it's very difficult to
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:28.960]   to uninstall it on chrome I mean you have to go through multiple steps it's built it's built
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.520]   into chrome as a plug-in as is flash yeah the advantage of doing that of course from Google's
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.320]   point of view is they can keep it up to date you don't have to they do but the problem is that
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.280]   these patches are not coming fast enough yeah yeah so
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:48.160]   well I think that I think we're going to see whether it's you know DDOS attacks or you know
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:54.000]   these attacks on Java I mean this is the next frontier you know of well there's always something
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.080]   but I think but I think there's always something I mean we've seen it be I think it was a lot of I
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:03.360]   think that the big thing that's happening now is that it's it's becoming more industrial so we've had
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.760]   a lot of hackers that are doing it for a long time but I think that now we're talking about
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.800]   governments really getting involved and it's not just the Chinese government I mean we
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:16.480]   obviously there's most people suspect that we were connected to you know Stuxnet oh we
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.520]   we wrote Flame you know for sure the NSA and other government worked on things like Flame and
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.520]   Stuxnet but I think we're starting to see an industrialization of of this process of the cyber
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.120]   war that we haven't seen in the past I think it's been a little less organized the difference between
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.920]   Flame and Stuxnet is those were aimed at uh that that was cyber warfare this is industrial
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.800]   intelligence and espionage right but it's it's still prevalent and of course let's not forget there's
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.480]   also the just the run of the mill hackers who are trying to get into your system and still credit
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:49.440]   card numbers and take it over zombie it and so forth so yeah basically uh the the onus is on us
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.640]   to protect ourselves and antivirus won't necessarily protect you from things like that because if you
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.360]   say you've got Java you've got the browser plug and turned on and you say yeah I want to run this
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:06.000]   program you're explicitly giving permission to a program to run and no security software I mean
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.160]   the worst it's going to do is what it already does which say are you sure this might be
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.800]   dangerous and you say yes yes I want to run it it can't override that otherwise you'd say I'm
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:20.480]   getting rid of this crap it's keeping me from doing anything well if you have um what is this
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:26.320]   is it Simon this little side little uh the program that watches out bench little snitch if you have
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.760]   little snitch running will it I guess it'll say Java's talking to a server but again if you explicitly
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:37.200]   run it you're gonna say yeah that's supposed to so this is I mean if an apple if an apple
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:43.120]   developer can be bit by this right numerous apple developers what's the solution now I'm
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.240]   I'm not using Chrome on the on the Macintosh I've had problems with it before but that's a good reason
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:53.680]   not to and if you're using Safari unlike Chrome where you have to go into a user colon slash
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.840]   slash config and or what is it config I mean it is here I can run it's a hard thing to go so
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.720]   you're on your settings page then you have to hit show advanced settings then it's under
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.720]   content settings which doesn't make any sense at least they have it okay so it isn't it isn't
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:14.400]   but you don't see it you have to go down to plugins disable individual plugins go to another
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.520]   page and then there's Java and that's how you disable it I mean it is very that's a lot that's
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:25.520]   pretty deep text-based adventure game yeah and meanwhile in in congratulations to apple in
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:31.600]   Safari you just go to security and in the web content tab it's enable or disable Java just uncheck
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.760]   that you know and it will be unchecked by default by the way and even uncheck itself if you don't
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.080]   use it an opera you can even do it just from the pull down window underneath the underneath the
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:47.680]   file menu it's a user an opera now um I have a web kit I've I haven't switched to it I now have
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:54.400]   like a multiple browser strategy where opera is my burner my burner browser where it's always
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:00.000]   it's always set in in in safe mode and I also burn all my history as soon as I use it it's good
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.640]   to have a separate browser like that where I whenever I need whenever I need to just jump
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.840]   out do a quick search for something and then jump back out again or whenever someone has sent me
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:16.800]   a link to something and I don't know with who the source is and I've got even an 8% worry that this
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.120]   is something odd about this URL I will do it inside opera where I know that they can't get
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.440]   out there's it's sealed off they can't get access to stuff clever very clever they're moving to
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:31.360]   web kit I don't think they're web kit yet but I decided ice ice is gonna be a web kit okay yeah
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.360]   so they're gonna make their engine based on web kit which could be a good thing web kit is
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:41.120]   what Safari is based on apple contributes to the web kit uh open source community um but it's
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.840]   Google so does blackberries so does it's right now it's internet explorer and firefox are the only
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.840]   you know two major browsers that don't use web kit well and one of the questions we're having on
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:57.120]   the on the uh IRC is what is the difference between Java and JavaScript ah very important yeah Jimmy
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:06.320]   Mac uh or asked that and um they're not the same at all not unrelated even yeah so uh now you can
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.000]   disable JavaScript and lots of people like Steve Gibson say it's a good idea to disable
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.560]   JavaScript and only re-enable it selectively on sites you need it most of the web including
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:20.400]   all of our sites require JavaScript it's a very common client side scripting language is not the
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:26.000]   same as Java and is not prey to these vulnerabilities however because it's a scripting language it's
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.320]   often used in other attacks so um lots of people use no script and other plugins to protect themselves
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.800]   from this but that's to me it's a major hassle you turn on no script and then what happens is
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.040]   every site on the web breaks you suddenly realize how often JavaScript is being used and you turn
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.800]   that off and what you have to do is individually as you get to a site you go yeah yeah oh this one's
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:51.040]   okay the problem is in this case and I think this is often the case this was probably a very well I
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.240]   don't know what the name of the site was but I'm sure it was a standard well-known commonly used
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.880]   software development site and what happens is and I know this because it's happened to us most sites
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:05.040]   have had this problem if there's a flaw in the content management system used on the website hackers
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:11.200]   first attack that they get on the website they bury into the website exploits which then like this
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.880]   Java exploit will attack anybody who goes to the site so you could be going to a completely
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.440]   legitimate site and enable Java because you think it's legit or enable JavaScript because you think
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:27.840]   it's legit and it isn't so um I don't know what to say just be very careful
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:34.720]   really we have that pinto here's the pinto with Java there you go that's your new screensaver
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:40.080]   thank you to who did that that's great oh gosh let me check you guys are fat that is quick turnaround
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:45.200]   we got some Photoshop wizards out there that was cambo zone by the way
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:52.240]   thank you microsoft and adobe for screwing Mac users okay I'm moving on
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:58.160]   you can't now you have to subscribe to both it's very hard to buy Photoshop alone you have to
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.560]   they really want you to do that creative content thing and and Microsoft same thing they really
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:08.640]   want you to subscribe and if you buy a copy of office it works on one machine only you can
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:14.800]   ever transfer it uh I don't know what Adobe's up to but I was trying to buy Photoshop just I
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.760]   just want to upgrade to and it's they say no no you really want creative cloud it's only 49
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:25.760]   dollars a month come on you really want that I don't we bought my credit you're using it because
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:31.120]   you're creating but we also we we turn it on and off so we we don't buy the yearly we like we
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.560]   you buy it as needed yeah it's a little bit more expensive to do it that way but we'll buy it
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.400]   for a month like oh we're doing an event where the problem is we have a lot of laptops I'm not
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.000]   putting Photoshop on all of them but I don't know which ones are gonna necessarily need Photoshop
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.760]   so we'll flip one on um and you know log in to to use it specifically so the cloud actually I
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.800]   think um you know works pretty well for us at the creative cloud um that that Adobe has like if
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:58.640]   you really do use all those apps it's probably cheap or we just use yeah but I don't I don't well
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:04.000]   now fortunately Lightroom is still not you can still buy Lightroom out right right when that
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.920]   happens I'm just gonna plot so I'm going to aperture I'm gonna say goodbye thank you Adobe
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.840]   well and nice knowing you I mean we make we make a lot of decisions like so so for instance there
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:17.360]   are things that we have to use for instance after effects for um but what is on every computer is
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:22.240]   Final Cut 10 and motion because motion is 50 bucks and can do most of what we need you know rather
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.960]   than you know so you know and that's the I think at some point in time you know that it you know
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.240]   there's a you do have to make some financial decisions when you have enough computers to cover
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:35.840]   it and I think that for what most people need to do as far as like animation goes um you know I
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.520]   you know I think that that motion's enough for that some of the higher level stuff when you
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.400]   have to effects for you can buy motion that's the apple product so you don't they're not renting
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.520]   it yet no no they're not going to and then think well are they not gonna no I don't think so I
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.920]   think apple has right now we haven't seen any apple charge any upgrades at all they're a
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.240]   hard-made company they're not a software well they keep on they keep on um releasing upgrades
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.720]   for Final Cut and motion not not charging for it I mean I'm not saying that they'll never charge
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:08.400]   for it but um motion's the best deal out there as far as uh as far as that goes I the
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:14.160]   the hard part for apple though I mean you know I think is that they still make it so simple like
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.480]   a lot of the new applications and I think aperture is a good example of we'd love to see some more
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:23.600]   tools in there I use aperture I don't use because I don't want to manage I like Lightroom I want
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:30.800]   to manage my files Lightroom Lightroom in the Lightroom 4 has uh uh offline storage man you know
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.160]   yeah it's great I mean I think Lightroom is great I think that I just what happens is you get
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:39.680]   yourself into a system and I got myself in a yeah yeah and I'm for when I do when I do aperture is
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.360]   really really good and so I don't want to do two advantages aperture one it's retina
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:50.000]   which Lightroom still isn't two I don't think and two make books you can make books I make a
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.320]   two and a half it integrates with iPhoto so you have one library so you can kind of go back and
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:04.560]   forth if your Mac user aperture does kind of make sense oh three see it you can buy it at the app
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.720]   store and then you can install it on all your machines and it's 70 bucks which is not Lightroom
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:14.320]   still 300 bucks it's it's much less expensive it's really fast to work with it also you can make
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.680]   books did I tell you about that and you can make books my wife loves it doesn't work but I now get
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.080]   hammered every time I go on a vacation I don't like a book oh yeah yeah if I don't make a book after
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:27.120]   vacation but no one has retina now good and books says it has books I haven't I haven't from when I
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:32.960]   made the decision there was no books too bad it has books now do there you and I think Lightroom is
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:40.880]   great by the way I think it's 99 bucks now all right so rewind and see three and two and a half
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:50.160]   okay well let me let me send some love apertures way because I have both of those apps I like both
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:55.200]   those apps but it just seems as though either aperture is better tuned to the way that I think
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:00.320]   about the problems with a photo or it's just simply better design period I just seems it could get
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:05.440]   much I can get to the image in my head a lot quicker with aperture than with Lightroom I just
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:11.520]   feels I like I understand what I would always try to do by sort of promoting a workflow where
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.360]   you're going to start right here and we're going to move to the next workstation then the next
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:21.200]   workstation then the next workstation I to me that just interferes with the with my own workflow
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.480]   because sometimes I truly am in a position where I've got 400 pictures from Comic Con that I want
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:32.640]   a triage and sort and I can really make through work through that way sometimes it really is just
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:38.400]   though that I've got these 10 pictures I want to isolate one of them do a quick like 20 minute
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.040]   fix and then send it to somebody who's waiting for it and I often just get my head sort of wrapped
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:47.600]   up in Lightroom's process instead of my own and also I just I just love the fact that
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.840]   there's that that area of the picture looks a little bit blue how do I target blue and change
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.680]   it to something that is a little more towards yellow oh I slide this button here bump done
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.800]   that's because I think that's more a matter of what you're used to but I also feel like I think
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.960]   in general when I think of Apple versus Adobe on all of their tools if I want to do something
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:08.000]   quickly I want to do it on an Apple product if I want if I need more control or or deeper power
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.320]   then I tend to use Adobe products and that that tends to be the I own them both and by the way I
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:16.720]   didn't know this but light really we're really behind on Lightroom not only isn't who wrote that
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:23.760]   it's a film on the app store and it does books there you go so but it does it does one more one
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:28.240]   more thing about the about aperture ever since they switched to the unified iPhoto aperture library
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:34.400]   that is such a nice feature especially for people who have like smaller like SSD based machines
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:39.760]   where you can have the you can have iPhoto installed like on your MacBook Air and that's what you
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.320]   vacation with that's what you travel with when you get home after a week you just simply integrate
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:49.680]   that right back into your aperture library and now you can do the big 27-inch cinema screen
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:55.840]   fine tuning and pre-publication pre-flight and he didn't have to have this big huge heavy
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:02.160]   application running on this tiny little notebook in order to make it all work I am um I'm torn
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.440]   I do the same thing as Andy and Alex I don't know what to do because you really do get
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.280]   a story and you can't invest in one of the other you know I mean I just want to do both yeah
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.920]   I do aperture all the time and if I need to I right click and open in Photoshop and then I do
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:22.000]   everything else well that's you but that's like adding a photo show up now because I don't want
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.280]   to get in the creative cloud well I mean I think that that so um the using elements
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:32.240]   photoshop elements or get pixel mix or or pixel mix acorns nice too but if I use a
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:36.640]   glue Photoshop for so long it's muscle memory now and it would slow me down to switch to something
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:42.160]   I think that I think pixel miter is great it's as said it's just I uh I have I still have a hard
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:48.560]   time I miss certain tools that I I'm used to using in Photoshop and elements is uh 80 bucks on the
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.960]   app stores this how close is this to Photoshop maybe I should just get this it's pretty close I
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.920]   mean it's uh you can definitely do an awful lot with elements um and but pixel miter and
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.000]   elements are the two that I would consider I like pixel comparing pixel miter feels more like
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.120]   Photoshop because it's got layers it's although acorns get more and more like that I like pixel
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:12.640]   miter well I own all of this to all of the above but and you want to get your workflow kind of in one
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:17.440]   one rut right yeah and I think that I think today I'm going to use pixel miter you know right
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:22.960]   get good at anything well Adobe is also sort of like you know made things more accessible for
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.880]   you know cheap skates like you and me you know that Photoshop 1.0 all the source code has been
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:32.640]   posted online by Adobe so it's a lot now the the color space is a little bit more limited than
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:37.600]   what you can pack my own yes yeah but I mean as long as you're just you know you're okay with
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:45.040]   just black or white pixels well now I own Photoshop 5 I don't really need 6 how do I get 5 back I
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.360]   know I can't they don't offer for download I guess I have to pirate it even though I own it I have
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.680]   to admit that I I finally got used to some of the newer version of Photoshop you subscribe because
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.400]   it's a business expense well it is and we use it a lot I mean we we but I I question whether I
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:03.520]   really need Photoshop the full Photoshop for a lot of what we do you know what I just do it because
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.760]   I have all the keys and I and there are very obscure things that I do with it that I there's
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:15.120]   the full version but one thing I use it for which is stitching panels so now I'm gonna use that well
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:20.000]   I got PT gooey there's you talked about huddle I think Andy before there's a couple of good
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.320]   huddles free right I think it's open source free and then PT gooey which is not free it's kind of
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:33.840]   expensive it's 179 euros but it does get this this might be my pick this week I just started using
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:38.400]   it it'll stitch up down left right it'll stitch any you know you just get a bunch of photos and
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:43.840]   it'll do HDR nice so you could do an HDR panel which is a kind of an interesting
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:49.040]   you know why I'm thinking about all this because in the fall I'm going to on this like
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:56.560]   Italy grease turkey trip so I want to get my workflow now so I'm ready
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.040]   because I didn't take any pictures in New Orleans and I realized you know I did with all with the
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:05.680]   iPhone I thought I think I cheated myself I should have I should have used this opportunity to
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:11.280]   take some better pictures yeah I think that the ultimate the ultimate sign of respect I can pay
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:17.120]   any camera phone is the first day that I decide that I don't need to take my real camera with me I
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:23.680]   will just use the phone I try to wrap my head around this idea of people using that instead of their
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:28.960]   instead of a proper camera I just can't get that myself the number of times where you're in this
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.880]   space and you take a you take a an okay photo and it's perfectly fine and then you get back home and
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:42.160]   the memory of that space starts to fade a little bit you realize that oh man if I had just taken
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:49.760]   if I had just made space in my bag exactly this big for a tiny little camera that cost me all of
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:54.640]   three hundred dollars now that window light wouldn't be blown out I'd be able to see detail back there
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:00.080]   and oh you know what I did that's I'm a bad man I bet I'll bet I'll meet I'll meet George Lucas some
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:08.960]   time again exactly I I splurged on an omd a little episode on d oh did you because it's so compact and
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.680]   little is it working for you I don't know it's coming today in fact I might leave in the middle of the
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:20.480]   show I would that's that's that's that's that's a very envied camera for me yeah I thought a long
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:26.240]   time and I really you know I have a 5d I love the big camera it's beautiful full frame but I wanted
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.560]   something light and and that's why I was I wouldn't carry the I didn't want to go to New Orleans and
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.960]   walk down Bourbon Street with a 5d and I'm on my shoulder yeah it just seemed it seemed risky it's
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.360]   great to have something you could slip in it's sticking a pocket and and plus there there's so many
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:46.000]   inc circumstances I get into where if you have a tiny little pocket camera and you ask permission
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.960]   to take a picture someplace you're not supposed to take pictures if they will think that a you're
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:56.240]   just a damn tourist so there's no harm done and be all you're going to do is take a snapshot and
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:01.440]   you'll be gone in five seconds as opposed to I I'm just going to do a couple of camera lens switches
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:07.920]   and let me sit my system with a couple of reflectors well and this came up at both the Madonna concert
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:14.080]   and the Super Bowl you can't bring a DSLR in you can't and in the Super Bowl the rule was nothing
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:19.280]   more than four inches lens so I could have brought the oh and the omdan and it would have been great
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:24.080]   pictures you seem like a lens that you can build up like just bring all individual elements in
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:35.520]   a piece of something some glass I just because it drives me crazy you're going to this thing and
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:40.480]   you want good pictures and they won't let you bring a good camera well no you get these you get
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:45.840]   these two x like photo extenders yeah each one costs you what like one stop so if you snap like
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:52.720]   eight of them in a line just hope they turn the lights up so so long so and next to you is also
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:57.360]   taking a flash photo with like a magnesium flare that they're actually shooting at Beyonce with
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:03.520]   the bazooka yeah there would have hands if I'd had a decent camera I would have pictures now Paul
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:07.920]   McCartney right there Jesse Jackson right there I would have had pictures of me at the Super Bowl
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.800]   although Lisa and I are in the gigapan the Super Bowl we found it somebody found it you can zoom in
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:18.720]   you can zoom in and Lisa's like this because the Niners do we're gonna take a break come back
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:25.280]   with lots more we're talking about Macintosh and there's lots of news rumors too Tim Cook
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:33.840]   talking about Apple stores some very interesting this is a good this is a good week we finally
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:39.600]   got some stuff to talk about this week beefy beefy it's beefy also a new version of iOS just came out
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:45.680]   I can guess what it's fixing we'll find out but first a word from our great folks at LegalZoom
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:50.160]   is a new sponsor for us have we talked about this on the show before I think we might have once or twice
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:59.200]   boy I'm really I'm really sensitive now to the need to protect yourself and sometimes you just you
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.760]   know especially you know your little guy little new startup whatever you can't afford a full legal
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:09.680]   team LegalZoom's great it's not a law firm but it will help you do many of the legal jobs you need
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:16.400]   to do step by step at a much lower cost and if you need an attorney LegalZoom also has a set of
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.760]   attorneys that they've already vetted there's reviews and there's all sorts of information
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.480]   I'll give you an example you know when we first started to it I couldn't afford an attorney to do
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:30.720]   an LLC walks through the step by step process and we're still the same LLC organization documents
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:37.600]   that I got in 2005 from LegalZoom we're using today you can do a will there the LLC starts at
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:44.400]   99 bucks the will $69 a living trust $69 here's another one trademark trademark is huge if you're a
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:51.200]   blogger yeah if you if you do anything you can't just add TM to the end of it that's not it but
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:55.440]   not enough hard to do a trademark I did the same thing trademark the same thing by the way trademark
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:00.560]   Twit the logo and Twit the name and I'm glad I did I think it was worth doing not very expensive
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:06.720]   LegalZoom helps you with copyrights patents NDAs and all of this through simple step by step
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:12.160]   questionnaires you can do online of course great customer support and there comes sometimes there's
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.560]   like a question you go gee I don't know I wish I had some legal advice they've got an extensive
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:21.680]   network of attorneys and their legal plan most states they're vetted they have fixed costs so
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.680]   you know how much it's going to cost and you could search the online profiles and unedited
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.520]   customer reviews to make sure you're getting somebody that that you can work with LegalZoom
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:34.880]   is an amazing thing you ought to know about this I think this is really transformational frankly

[00:31:54.240 --> 00:32:04.000]   MBW is the offer code at LegalZoom.com don't put this off you'll be glad you did it trust me LegalZoom.com
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:10.000]   oh let's see moving you just see that just speaking of the Adobe pricing
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.520]   the we've played this on Twitter I'm not gonna play it again but the Adobe CEO he was in Australia
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:22.400]   and they were asked an Australian journalist said why is it 1400 dollars more how can Adobe
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:26.720]   possibly justify charging up to 1400 dollars more for the exact same software delivered in
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:33.200]   Australia delivered over the internet with no box copy compared to the US prices again and I'll
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:43.780]   I'll answer this question. When we look at the creative cloud and we think that's the
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:48.480]   best offering for customers, we really believe that if we look at what we've done with pricing
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:52.740]   there, it's actually a great value to our customers.
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:59.000]   He asks him four more times and the answer each time is when you look at the creative
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.180]   cloud, which is the subscription thing that Adobe clearly is what
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.180]   they want to sell you.
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.180]   I think they're saying that they...
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:09.660]   No, the question was $1,400 more and that's like a...
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.320]   I think it was a saying for Australia versus US price.
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.680]   Yes, for the downloadable software, not the creative cloud.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.960]   They must assume that, well, they're Australians, they must be drunk.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.960]   They're probably not going to look at that.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.640]   That's my screen too closely.
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.240]   Apparently, they did.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:28.520]   And by the way, after this really kind of shameful performance, a week later, they lowered
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.520]   the price, $1,400.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.520]   Oops.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.520]   Thank you, Internet.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:36.400]   This is why I love the Internet because a journalist, this happens all the time,
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.400]   journalist, and you've done this.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.540]   I'm sure Andy Peppers, the CEO, come on, come on, come on, and they won't answer.
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:41.540]   They won't answer.
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:42.540]   They won't answer.
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:43.940]   So you post it on YouTube.
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:44.940]   Right.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.220]   And all of a sudden, the price suddenly magically goes down.
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.220]   I love that.
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.220]   I think that's wonderful.
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.820]   Well, sometimes you have to really...
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:57.340]   When I ask a question three times in a row, usually it's because I can't possibly believe
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:01.020]   that the answer that they're giving me is actually the answer they intend to give.
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.020]   Right.
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.020]   You maybe misunderstood.
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.020]   Yeah.
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:08.280]   Or I feel like you didn't just say that, did you?
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.280]   Or horrible for you.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:17.720]   Well, and sometimes it's really positive, too, like a cell phone contract that is truly
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.720]   unlimited data.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:20.720]   Are you sure?
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.720]   Exactly.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:22.720]   I was saying.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.720]   I will say so.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:31.620]   What I'm saying is that if my account activates on October 3rd, I activate Netflix HD streaming
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:36.320]   on November 4th and keep it going for 28 days, it will not...
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.540]   I will continue to be able to stream HD video at the end of that month and it will not
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:42.620]   cost me a penny more than what I paid for your unlimited plan.
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:43.620]   Yes.
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:44.620]   All right, then.
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:45.620]   That's worth following.
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:46.820]   You know, no, I agree with you.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:47.820]   That's worth pressing.
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.220]   I really want to make sure so that there's no loophole.
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:51.820]   They go, "Well, what you didn't ask?"
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:52.820]   Yeah.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.220]   Well, there's a cap of two gigabytes, but it's unlimited two gigabytes.
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.220]   Unlimited.
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:57.220]   So many do that.
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.220]   But this was good.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.220]   This was a good example where he just...
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.500]   He was like a politician where they ask one question.
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.460]   You just answer another one.
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:06.500]   And credit to the Australian journalist, and I don't have his name, who just said, "No,
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.500]   no, no.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.500]   You haven't answered my question."
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.860]   And four or five times he says it.
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:10.860]   Well, I think Adobe...
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.980]   You know, this is a very important part of their business model is figuring out how
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:16.060]   to get people to subscribe because they...
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.500]   You know, a lot of what they're...
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.500]   You know, the flash is not going to be...
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.300]   You know, what was a big growth area for them?
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.300]   Right.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:27.740]   I think that they are getting to a point where Photoshop is reached about as many people.
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.700]   I mean, it's still growing, but it's not growing like it used to.
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:36.820]   And Australians, by the way, Dr. T in our chatroom, Gizmodo, Australia says, "Don't believe
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:37.980]   the price cut hype.
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.780]   It's still gouging you."
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:48.660]   Well, and I think that it becomes clearer when some companies, and to their credit, like
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.620]   Apple, have dropped the price dramatically.
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.620]   And most of production software that we're looking at...
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:53.620]   I agree.
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.620]   Because there's no box.
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:58.860]   Except for Adobe, most production software is dropping in rates.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:35:59.860]   I mean, so...
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.020]   Is that just a larger universe of users?
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.700]   Well, they're looking for a larger universe.
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.780]   They're looking for, you know, how do we move...
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:11.140]   The reality is, is that the folks at the very top are, you know, competing more and more.
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:16.300]   If you're at the very top, you can still have $100,000 software or $50,000 software.
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:23.500]   But if you're in below that top 2%, or 3%, you're now competing with a much larger group
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:28.180]   of people, which opens up that market for production companies, or production software companies
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.580]   to move in.
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:35.140]   But it also, if you're in that area, it becomes much harder to pay for that software.
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:39.860]   You kind of think piracy has something to do with it too, that they realize...
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:40.860]   People could just steal it.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:43.700]   And so if it's in Africa, we do a lot of work in Africa.
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:46.180]   And people in Africa, you talk to them, they don't even consider buying it.
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.180]   Right.
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:48.180]   Like it's not even a conversation.
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.180]   They're not even having the conversation.
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.780]   That was a big thing with our schools.
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:51.780]   We have partners.
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:55.780]   Our partners, you know, between all the different partners are providing the software legal
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.340]   copies for our school.
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:59.620]   And we made a big deal about that.
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.180]   Everyone else was like, "Okay, that's great."
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.260]   You know, it was like, "But everybody else just..."
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:04.260]   Crazy Americans.
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.260]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:09.180]   But let's be honest, I bet everybody watching this show is a one-time or another pirated
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.180]   Photoshop.
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:15.380]   There was definitely a conversation we had when I was working at a business company.
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:18.460]   We were talking about that, and we were talking about the fact that all of us, our first
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:20.180]   copy of this Photoshop, was always got it.
[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:24.780]   And it was a great way to learn Photoshop, and then you ended up buying it.
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:25.780]   Exactly.
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:26.780]   Go ahead.
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:27.780]   I'm sorry, Renee.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:28.780]   I keep an eye on it.
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:30.980]   No, no, I was just going to say that Apple's model is also really different.
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:34.220]   They want to sell more Macs and more iOS devices, so they don't...
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:39.420]   The software is an ecosystem enhancement for them, so they're not as price sensitive
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.420]   as that.
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.940]   It's a company that just makes software for their businesses.
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:43.940]   Yep.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:44.940]   One, I do think...
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.660]   I mean, I think that that is the case, and I think that that is...
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:50.900]   And I think Adobe is very fortunate that Apple doesn't take some of its billions and
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.140]   point at that direction.
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:56.100]   You know, Steve kind of gave up on that process and went more consumer.
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:00.740]   If Apple decided to go into that and started building things that look a lot like Photoshop
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:01.740]   that were...
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.700]   And I don't know if Apple's even capable of doing that.
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.700]   Of course they are.
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:08.500]   If you said, "I'm going to invest $200 million over the next two years," I'm going to bring
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:09.500]   into team, it doesn't have to be in...
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:10.500]   Because we want to know...
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.700]   I'm going to bring a team, "Your charge is to make a better Photoshop built on Apple
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.300]   hardware to take advantage of the latest Apple hardware."
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.300]   Of course they could do that.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.300]   A couple hundred million, no problem.
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:24.340]   But the reason they don't make that calculation is because they also want to preserve the channel.
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.500]   It's bad for the ecosystem.
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.940]   If Apple starts taking over, then only Apple makes software for Max.
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:29.940]   That's not good either.
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:36.260]   But I think that it's also bad for the ecosystem to have it be $800 for a professional...
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:40.860]   The thing is, there's a lot of opportunity when you start lowering that, pushing that
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:41.860]   price down.
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:45.340]   They put that in the mid-core image so that you could make Pixelmator and you could make
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.340]   Acorn.
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:48.980]   So instead of making their own software, they made it much easier for people to make that
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:49.980]   kind of software for it.
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:54.300]   But what it really takes to go head to head is $100 million to development.
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.300]   I mean, you know, it's...
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.300]   Go ahead.
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.780]   But also compare...
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:03.020]   Let's leave imaging for a while and get something a little bit more directly head-head.
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.780]   Compare even pages to Microsoft Word.
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:11.500]   Pages is the word processor choice for 85 to 90% of what people want to do.
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:16.580]   For that other 10%, it's not even something you can consider because it's just not...
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:18.860]   It doesn't have the same power, it doesn't have the same workflow, it doesn't have the
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:22.100]   same collaboration features as Microsoft Word does.
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:28.100]   But that's okay because this is a $15 app that just needs to make most people happy.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:34.980]   If Apple ever gets into imaging wars with Adobe, man, that's a lot of pain.
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:38.620]   That's crawling on broken glass over miles and miles and miles.
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:39.620]   That's new staffing.
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:42.620]   Well, the rumors are really...
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:48.500]   Unless they were to find someone who can actually deliver Photoshop, Calibre.
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:49.500]   Not the same...
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:55.020]   Not a replacement for Photoshop, but Photoshop, Calibre, creative editing like that.
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:57.820]   I can't imagine them wanting to staff up to that extent.
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:00.460]   Look at the problems they had when they...
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:06.060]   Possibly the most important app that they have on the iPod.
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.540]   Possibly the most important app they have on macOS.
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:12.220]   I'm not saying the most, but I'm saying you could make a case that there is no app more
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.020]   important, more critical to Apple than iTunes for the desktop.
[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:22.060]   There's no... in terms of what a person with an iPod or an iPhone wants to do with it,
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.260]   you got to have a good podcasting app.
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.260]   And they totally...
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:26.980]   Let's talk about podcasting.
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.380]   They completely pun...
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.940]   They completely punted the podcast.
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:30.940]   I think there's a reason.
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:32.660]   iTunes 11 is not great.
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:33.660]   It's not even good.
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:35.900]   It's now it's gone down to sort of acceptable.
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.980]   Yeah, well, that's a good question.
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:40.820]   Because iTunes is their bread and butter.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:45.460]   So you're saying you could throw $100 million, $200 million, half a billion dollars and not
[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.020]   make a better product.
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.820]   Why doesn't Apple make a better iPhone?
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:51.860]   No, no, I think it would be like picking up a porcupine.
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.620]   You can do it, but you got to really do that.
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.060]   The rumor... there have been rumors.
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.060]   That they're making one.
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:03.260]   Well, basically after Adobe sandbagged, the upgrade...
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.580]   But they didn't at least...
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:10.340]   No, and they still... they continue to develop an app that if Adobe ever sandbagged Photoshop
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.780]   Apple would release something for free.
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:16.500]   That's the rumor is that they would go right after them and they do have people working
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.500]   on it.
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:18.500]   I don't know that from anyone inside.
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:19.500]   That's the rumor that has been...
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:24.940]   Well, can I just point out that Photoshop was much more advanced on Windows, probably
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.780]   still is more advanced on Windows.
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:31.060]   So Apple dropped the bomb because...
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.060]   Right.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.020]   It's Final Cut Proit.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.020]   Final Cut Proit.
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.340]   Yeah, and that worked well, didn't it?
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:41.620]   I mean, the reason Lightroom isn't $500 is because Aputure is 70.
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:45.780]   I mean, you know, they can only charge so much for it because Apple is going to provide
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:46.940]   something else.
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:50.540]   And I think it would benefit us as Mac users to have more.
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:51.540]   And I think Pixelmator is great.
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:56.140]   I'd love to see Apple maybe absorb them and put the money in that really is required to
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:57.140]   move that down the path.
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.660]   So I'm going to give you the reason why...
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:04.380]   I understand why the podcast app sucks, but I don't understand why iTunes sucks.
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.380]   Or the apps for apps.
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:06.380]   I don't think it sucks.
[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:09.020]   No, no, Andy, let's be honest.
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.020]   It sucks.
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.100]   No, I don't think it sucks.
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.540]   I think that there...
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.780]   I will start after defending it by saying it doesn't suck.
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.500]   Oh my God, what wonderful praise that is.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:21.260]   Carve that in gold above the lentil apple.
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:26.540]   I have to vent a little bit at a problem, but I was so sure this was a software bug with
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.780]   the first release that I thought...
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:30.420]   Because I'm trying to sink my...
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:33.380]   I'm going to mention this because I think that a lot of people will suddenly have an
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.380]   aha moment.
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:36.140]   Oh my God, here's how I fix this problem.
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:41.180]   I try to sink TV shows that I've purchased onto my iPad.
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.180]   It will not...
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:46.540]   When I get to that page in the sync feature of iTunes, it will only show me the first
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:49.460]   screen full of shows that I've purchased.
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:50.900]   So if I want to...
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:54.500]   If I want to sink 30 Rock, I can't do it because I try to scroll down that list and
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.500]   will rubber band.
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:56.500]   You're sinking it wrong.
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.500]   No, no, no, no.
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:03.340]   Well, see, I kind of am because I assume that just because this scrolling list of TV
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:09.020]   shows responds to like a scroll input that, okay, I guess it just doesn't think that
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.740]   there's more underneath that.
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.920]   Here's what was actually happening.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:20.180]   I have to move the mouse outside of that little scroll view, but still inside the window because
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:25.540]   the entire rest of that scroll list is in like the populated, unseen area of that window.
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:30.220]   So if I scroll the window content, I can see the rest of my TV shows.
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:35.260]   I simply can't scroll the list that exhibits scrolling behavior.
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:39.980]   And this is why I was not sinking anything on any of my TV shows for about a month.
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:41.980]   Oh, Danny, this is version 11.
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:42.980]   Exactly.
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:43.980]   That's...
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:45.820]   And you're saying this doesn't suck?
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:46.820]   I don't have any...
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:49.500]   I'm saying it's streamlined.
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.060]   It's useful for what most people use it for.
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:56.820]   I think that they took a real step backward for it because this is a recurring theme that
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:00.980]   I tend to harp on, that there are two kinds of ways to make something easy.
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:04.580]   One is the sort of easy features that means you can learn this in one day.
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:05.940]   You got it in one day.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.500]   But then there are the sort of features where after you're no longer a newbie, once you're
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:14.460]   using it month two, month three, year one, year one and a half, year two, that makes
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:16.220]   it continually easier to use.
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.860]   I think that iTunes is a step forward in the first type of easy views, but definitely
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:20.860]   step backward in a second.
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:22.620]   I miss the fact that I can't...
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:25.980]   Sometimes you're working on a playlist, but you want to have that window open behind
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:26.980]   you.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.900]   So as you sort of make your way through things, you can just simply random grab things and
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:30.900]   toss them in.
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:35.700]   iTunes 11 is optimized towards maybe having three, maybe four, and it only occasionally
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.340]   really manipulating them.
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:40.260]   And I can go on for an hour on things I don't like about the way it works.
[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:43.900]   I don't think it sucks, but I think that they are...
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:49.420]   It's such a bold statement about becoming a consumer-oriented company as opposed to
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.940]   a more broad appeal.
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.500]   Everybody who likes machines that go Bing, that sort of comes.
[00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:55.500]   90-90.
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.140]   What will 90% of the people need 90% of the time?
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:01.740]   Would you agree the podcast app on iOS sucks?
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:02.740]   It sucks.
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:03.740]   Okay, thank you.
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:04.740]   It sucks.
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:05.740]   See, it's worse.
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:06.820]   It's absolutely useless.
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:09.180]   It does not do the job it was supposed to do.
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:13.300]   Not only that, but it also prevents you from using an alternative.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:18.100]   What I hated the most about it was that if I have the podcast app on this iPhone, I don't
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:24.340]   even have the option of saying, "Well, what if I have a playlist called Greatest Podcast
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.340]   Episodes Ever?"
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:31.940]   So, ever like when WTF did that wonderful interview with Mel Brooks, that goes into
[00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:35.580]   a special playlist that says, "A year from now, two years from now, three years from
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:42.220]   now, that Valkyrie interview on Jeff Goldberg's...
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:43.980]   Excuse me.
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:45.940]   Another podcast.
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:50.900]   But the fact that they were podcasts means that I'm not allowed to listen to them within
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:54.940]   an iTunes playlist, they have to be accessed through the podcast app, which runs the
[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:56.100]   like connection access them.
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:46:00.940]   I think actually Apple is rejecting podcasts like they would reject a bad organ.
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:01.940]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:02.940]   They're pushing them out.
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:04.900]   And this was always my great fear.
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:09.020]   You know, when Apple started including podcasts and iTunes, it was a great day for us and
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:10.420]   all other podcasters.
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.540]   It really improved our profile.
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:16.620]   But I always made me nervous because we were really dependent on Apple.
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:19.620]   And at this point, I think it's clear that Apple has decided, you know, they lost a big
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:23.780]   patent lawsuit last year on this subject.
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:28.180]   I think Apple has decided and they can't do it overtly because they know they'd reach,
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:30.420]   they get the wrath of a lot of listeners.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.780]   But they don't want podcasts to be part of iTunes.
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:34.260]   They want to push it out.
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.380]   They want to move it over to the side.
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:40.780]   And they want you to ultimately give up on the podcast app and use downcast or some third-party
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:41.780]   app.
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:43.100]   And then eventually they'll kill it.
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.700]   And then they can say, "Hey, we don't do podcasts."
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:46.700]   I'll let Renee say this.
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:47.700]   I'll let Renee say this.
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:48.700]   Yeah.
[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:52.500]   One of the problems Apple is facing with the iOS devices is that they're breaking iTunes
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:53.980]   up into many constituent parts.
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:57.780]   And they have an iTunes U app instead of having all the iTunes U stuff in the iTunes app.
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:58.780]   Why do that?
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:04.900]   Well, for the iOS ecosystem seems to favor single-purpose applications.
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:05.900]   It's much easier.
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:07.340]   iTunes is a monstrosity.
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:11.260]   And part of that on the desktop is because they have to port the whole thing to Windows.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:15.420]   So everything that they could possibly want to do with an iPhone or music is one gigantic
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.580]   monstrosity.
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:20.260]   But on iOS, it behooves them to have all these different apps because then they can build
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:24.900]   specific interfaces, especially on the more constrained iPhone screen for those things.
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:25.900]   That makes sense, actually.
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:30.340]   And my understanding is that the people who made the podcast app, Apple has the remote
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.340]   app.
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:34.540]   What app did not get updated for a long time because that engineer was taken off, given
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:37.100]   another job, and he was brought back to it.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:40.900]   And the disadvantage of not being part of the music app, which has more consistent engineers
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:44.780]   behind it, is I think there were two guys, an engineer and a designer who put it out.
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:45.780]   And they seemed really proud of it.
[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:48.580]   And other people at Apple seemed really proud of it when it shipped.
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:50.580]   But then they had bugs and they tried to fix the bugs.
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:53.020]   And now they're really busy trying to get iOS 7 out.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:57.180]   And it's just as much as Apple has nearly infinite resources, billions and billions
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.660]   of dollars, they don't have infinite engineers.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:01.660]   They are starved for good engineers.
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:03.780]   That's the real question.
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.700]   There aren't good people out there.
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.700]   Everyone's starved for it.
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:08.580]   Well, if you're in college right now, learn.
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:14.300]   Become a developer because there's a desperate need for not just day average grunt developers.
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:18.100]   There's a desperate need for brilliant, which take after you get out of college, often
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:19.900]   takes 10 years of development.
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:21.820]   And there was a great programmers.
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:26.460]   Here's why I think Apple is actually actively trying to kill podcasting.
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:29.820]   Because they lost that lawsuit and they were forced to pay $8 million, they now also licensed
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.420]   it at podcasting costs them money.
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:36.220]   And no one knows how much, but day in day out podcasting costs them money.
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:40.100]   The ability to subscribe to a podcast on iTunes costs them money.
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.540]   And I just think that they're thinking, well, we don't make any money on this.
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:44.180]   We can't charge for podcasts.
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:45.180]   It's costing us money.
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:46.180]   Who needs it?
[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:48.060]   But now they don't want to do it overtly.
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:49.060]   But I just...
[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.300]   My sister loves the new podcast app.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:53.460]   She just... she subscribes to one or two television podcasts at a time when they stop having the
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:54.740]   television series.
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:55.740]   She gets rid of them.
[00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:59.580]   And as long that podcast app is perfect for someone who doesn't use podcasts the way
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:00.580]   that we do.
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:03.340]   It doesn't have a list like Andes that doesn't want to sync a ton of stuff.
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:07.020]   If you have four or five podcasts, you happen to like, if you want to use the stations button
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:10.140]   to find a couple of things that are interesting, it's a fine app for you.
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:13.420]   And Apple just once again is not showing interest in the power user segment.
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:16.100]   By the way, Google does a bad job of podcast too.
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:17.660]   Google listen is awful.
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:18.660]   Well, it's gone.
[00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:19.660]   Exactly.
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:22.660]   That's why I disagree with you.
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:27.940]   Google realized that people are... they don't need to have a Google listen app because they're
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:31.220]   wonderful third party apps out there that do the job just fine.
[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:35.980]   Rather than coming out with a half-butted version of it to sort of encourage people
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:37.660]   not to use it, they said, "Okay, we're done.
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.220]   We're not gonna update this anymore."
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:40.740]   If Apple really wanted...
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:44.060]   If Apple really had no interest in any more podcast, then they would simply not have
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:46.420]   released it or said, "Okay, we're never gonna update this over again."
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:48.860]   Well, I think that's the next step.
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:49.860]   Just kill it.
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:50.860]   I mean, that thing is such a...
[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:59.060]   I think that they... my guess is that... excuse me, when a big company releases a piece
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:04.420]   of software that's this bad and it is awful, it absolutely sucks.
[00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:09.000]   The story that I'm usually told by current and former team members a couple or two or
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.200]   three years later, which is that this... on the whiteboard, this was a huge four-star
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.000]   well-funded project.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.600]   At some point, as they were working on this, it became a zero priority for the company
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:24.920]   and they just simply were forced to limp this across the finish line and as dignified
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:27.240]   a fashion as they possibly could.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.200]   So I don't think it's a matter of sabotage.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:34.640]   I think that it's an indication of a lack of will on Apple to have a really good podcasting
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.320]   app baked right in.
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:40.320]   If we look at the... it was supposed to come out at WWDC along with all the iOS 6 stuff.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.600]   I believe it was supposed to be showing off on stage and it was late.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.440]   So it got kind of released in between, which was really odd.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:49.520]   It wasn't at the WWDC and it didn't wait until the iPhone event.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.080]   And Apple, you know, in "Guying List for a Great Article" about this, I think a year
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:56.040]   ago about Apple and retention where people and engineers are their biggest problem now
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:59.560]   because all the early iPhone engineers have had their stock options best.
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:04.240]   All the second generation, the App Store people, all of them, if you look... and I think
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:08.080]   Gruber picked this up, Dan Frommer wrote about it, "Over the last few weeks, the amount
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:12.960]   of people, good iOS engineers, leaving Apple, has gone up."
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:17.360]   So if they're struggling to get iOS 7 out, if they have a constrained amount of engineers,
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:21.800]   they are not... exactly what Andy said, they are not wasting a lot of them on the podcast.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:26.640]   And this is why you want to be a brilliant programmer because you'll vest, you'll make
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.880]   millions of dollars, you're going to retire.
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:33.080]   Well, or not only retire, but you're going to make more money building your own apps because
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.080]   you know where they started.
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:38.040]   And do a startup, do your own thing, build your... they have their own ideas that no one's
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.040]   listening to.
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.600]   The great developers are the gold standard.
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.440]   We're also overlooking the obvious here.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:49.040]   The reason why there is enough people to work on a podcast app is because those 100 engineers
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.920]   they put on the watch project.
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:53.880]   This must be bigger than we even imagined it.
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:54.880]   Yeah, 100.
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:55.880]   100 engineers on 100.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:56.880]   100 engineers.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:59.680]   You know, actually more interesting.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:01.560]   More interesting is the number of engineers.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:04.320]   And I think it is in the thousands they have on CPU.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:08.480]   And we're going to talk about CPU hardware and where Apple's going with that in just a
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.480]   bit.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.080]   We're talking Mac with Renee Ritchie.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.840]   We got such a good team here.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:16.480]   Anything you want to know, you get in the chat room you say, talk about this and we will.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:20.840]   Renee Ritchie from iMore.com, Alex Lindsey of the Pixel Core.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:23.120]   A rare personal appearance.
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:26.840]   We got Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times and we're going to take a break and come back
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:28.400]   with more.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.800]   You know, we have an old MacBook Air that we broke basically.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:40.560]   And I realize I can actually sell this on gazelle.com with no bad conscience.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:43.240]   They will buy broken hardware as well as unbroken hardware.
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.480]   You know about gazelle.com?
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:49.520]   If you've got a drawer, a closet, or a storage space full of old technology that you don't
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:53.040]   want anymore, it actually is worth money at gazelle.com.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:59.120]   I want you to visit gazelle.com to sell your iPod, your iPad, your Mac.
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:02.640]   Your emulation to your iPhone.
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:09.360]   Even your, let's say you've got a Samsung Galaxy S3 and said, enough, enough Android.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:11.520]   I want to go to an iPhone 5.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:12.520]   Here we go.
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.600]   Let's take that and get an offer.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:15.600]   What shape is it in?
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:16.600]   It's in good shape.
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:17.600]   All right.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.280]   Next, this is what it looks like.
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.280]   Free of water damage.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:24.720]   That one in a glass of water, 194 bucks for that S3.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:27.800]   Well, that's almost going to get that's an old phone too.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.160]   That's going to get me real close to my iPhone 5.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.360]   You got an iPhone 4s.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:35.000]   They even hold value better.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   Let's see.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:42.880]   A AT&T iPhone 4s is worth 215 bucks in good condition.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.960]   Now what happens is you get all these old gadgets together.
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.200]   You pile them in a box.
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:50.160]   Actually gazelle will send you the box postage paid.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.320]   They pay the postage on anything worth more than a buck.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:57.920]   You fly it back to gazelle and days later you're going to get a check or a PayPal credit
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:00.480]   or better yet an Amazon gift card.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:03.800]   That's worth 5% more by the way, which I like.
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:07.840]   And since we all use Amazon nonstop, that extra 5% come in handy.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:14.240]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E dot com, even by broken iPhones and iPads.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:17.280]   They don't give you as much of it's broken, but still it's better than throwing it in
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:18.280]   the trash.
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:22.320]   Gazelle's paid $50 million to half a million customers.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.000]   It's fast, it's free.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.320]   Their data experts will even wipe your data for free.
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.400]   I think it's just a great deal.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.400]   Gazelle dot com.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.800]   Recycle the easy way.
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:36.440]   Sell it on gazelle.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.400]   So I've been thinking a little bit.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:44.800]   You know Apple just dropped the price of the 13 inch retina MacBook Pro for 200 bucks,
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:45.800]   right?
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:48.120]   And they speed bumped the other ones.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:51.320]   And I don't know what rumors you're hearing at I'm more Renee.
[00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:59.160]   But I think this is not the time, this is my supposition, to buy a Apple computer, a
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:00.160]   Macintosh.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.160]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.840]   I just read a really good article.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:07.080]   It's an older article on a non-tech talking about the challenge Intel's facing.
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:10.720]   Apple, we know, has over a thousand engineers working on chips.
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:12.240]   And these are not just for iOS.
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:14.160]   I think it's pretty much a given.
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.080]   I know everybody in Intel thinks this.
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:19.640]   But eventually Apple's going to replace Intel with their own chips.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.280]   Does that sound right Renee?
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:24.680]   I would be surprised if there were no skunk works.
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:29.520]   I mean they had a project a couple of years ago to get Darwin booting on ARM architecture.
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:30.520]   I think it's inevitable.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:31.520]   But it's one of those things.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.440]   You know, it's like they had Intel running before PowerPC switch.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:34.440]   Right.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:40.680]   And you have to look at Microsoft pushing Windows 8 on ARM with Windows RT.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:45.680]   Intel is starting to get squeezed because consumers want portable low power devices
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:47.040]   with great battery life.
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.040]   That's really what they want.
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:51.040]   They want it not just in their tablets and their phones but they really would like it
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:54.520]   in their laptops as well.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:56:00.840]   The next Intel talk and this also came from an article I just read on GIGOM about the
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:01.840]   TIC TOC pattern.
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:05.120]   Intel has a, you know, the TIC is a process improvement.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:07.840]   They get it down to a smaller die size for instance.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:10.680]   And the TOC is an improvement in the actual chip design.
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:13.960]   And TOC is coming in June with Haswell.
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.840]   But more importantly, the low power hassles.
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:16.840]   We're not sure where they're going to come.
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.600]   I asked Ryan Shout on Twitter.
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:24.560]   But sometime this year, certainly maybe as soon as September, we'll see Haswell U parts,
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:29.600]   which are of these ultra low power parts that give, can give a laptop, the performance
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:36.120]   of a laptop with the power curve of an iPad so that you've got 20 hours, 10 hours, whatever.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:39.800]   And I think, I think one of the things that's happened is that over the last couple of years,
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.640]   probably the last two or three years, we've gotten to a point where the average consumer
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:46.600]   can't doesn't really notice the performance changes anymore.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.160]   I mean, I think we used to notice it.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:51.760]   It's got to a point where it plays the video back well and it does all the other pieces.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:55.160]   And unless you're a power user, you're not going to notice in power users, we'd like
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:58.600]   to think that we were 50% of the population and we're about to, you know.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:01.240]   And what you want in a laptop isn't what you want in a laptop.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:03.840]   Well, you do want more power in terms of the graphics.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:06.520]   I buy these retinas because of the power.
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:12.920]   By the way, Haswell has a much faster motherboard GPU, much faster, like four times faster.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.160]   It is low power.
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:20.680]   This retina might now get eight, 10 hours, right, be faster, a MacBook Air even more.
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:23.840]   I mean, Renee, are you hearing any rumors about this kind of thing?
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:27.480]   Do you think people should look at this price drop and say, yeah, now's the time to buy
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.480]   a MacBook or maybe wait?
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:30.720]   I have a canned answer for this.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:34.640]   My canned answer is always if you absolutely need it, then buy it now and be happy with
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:35.640]   it.
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.320]   You absolutely need it today and wait as long as you can.
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:39.320]   Of course.
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:40.320]   That would always be something.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:41.320]   But that's always true.
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:44.440]   I think this is a little bit different because we've got a talk coming very soon.
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:45.440]   Yes.
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:50.240]   If you can wait and Apple did a lot of revisions at WWDC and the rest of them in the fall and
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:54.280]   we got a slight processor bump now, but you have to expect, I don't think we'll see a
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:57.080]   retina MacBook Air or anything crazy like that.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:58.520]   But I think you'll definitely see those new.
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:02.040]   I mean, as much as Apple is mysterious, they are bound to the cycles of their component
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:06.760]   manufacturers, so no LTE until the right Qualcomm chip comes out, no better graphics for the
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:10.520]   retina display until the new Intel on-die processor comes out.
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:11.520]   So, yeah, absolutely.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:14.440]   I mean, if you can wait, they'll be much better machines and it'll probably cost you
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:15.640]   the same if not less eventually.
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:16.640]   And not that way that long.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:21.880]   I mean, Haswell comes out in June, usually Apple within a month or so of a new Intel
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:23.640]   chip releases new hardware, right?
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:26.240]   Apple's one of the fastest to adopt new Intel hardware.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.480]   At least they have been in the past.
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:33.280]   I almost always recommend that people not buy a new laptop until there's something physically
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.520]   you cannot do with your old one.
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:38.480]   And I'm not talking about, gosh, Photoshop seems to be running a little bit slow.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:42.320]   I'm talking about you want a new connector and unfortunately this does not have the new
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:43.320]   type of connector.
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:47.440]   Your current one doesn't have the new type of connector you want, doesn't have USB 3.0
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:52.720]   or you spilled like one quarter of a cup of Diet Coke on your laptop keyboard and now
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:55.360]   the trackpad doesn't work anymore and after eight months you feel as though you've done
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:58.440]   enough penance for having been falling asleep on an Amtrak train, holding a couple of minutes
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:01.040]   of Coke in your hand with your laptop open and now you're really good.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.040]   Asking for a friend.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:06.880]   But what if you could double battery life for at least 50% increase?
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:07.880]   That might be a good reason.
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:10.280]   If you're the kind of person that's spending a lot of time away from being a boy.
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:11.600]   Oh man, I would love an air.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.600]   Okay, this is what I want.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:15.120]   A retina air with 10 hours battery life.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:16.120]   Wouldn't you want that?
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:17.120]   Oh, of course.
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:18.400]   13 inch retina air with battery life.
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:19.400]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:20.800]   What if you could get that in September?
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:21.800]   Would you buy an air today?
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.160]   You're asking the wrong person.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.160]   Of course you would.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:27.880]   I was like, I just want to.
[00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:29.880]   I just want to bring this up.
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:34.000]   To me, I was thinking, I did just buy a new iMac, the new iMac and I love it.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   It's very nice.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.760]   I like the Fusion drive and highly recommended.
[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:39.640]   I think that's a great technology.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:42.280]   But I've been thinking about, is it time to upgrade the air?
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:44.560]   Is there getting a couple of years old now?
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.400]   And I think it's time to wait.
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:49.320]   Some people think you shouldn't buy the first generation when the new stuff comes out anyway.
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:52.920]   The first air is nowhere nearly as good as the third generation air was and the first
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.840]   retinomack book is not going to be as good as a one.
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:55.840]   That's true.
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:56.840]   The beefier on ICPU.
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.240]   I have a bigger problem with it.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:04.560]   I tend to have a prejudice that whenever Apple comes up with a marvelous new manufacturing
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.480]   technique, I don't think they're going to really figure out how to make 5 million of
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:12.480]   these until they've shipped 5 million of these and we find we get back all these information
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.440]   about how well these things are doing.
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:18.840]   So anytime there's a radically new chassis design that usually is my personal cue to
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.960]   hold off for at least a few months until you find out what's happening with this first
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.800]   generation stuff.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:25.400]   I have the ghost thing on my retina Mac.
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.400]   I'm a retina Mac book.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:30.480]   Whenever I go to Daring Fireball, for example, I see whatever past windows have been on my
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.040]   screen and that's fairly common.
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:36.560]   So I think the new one that they just bumped fixes that.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:40.760]   So it always behooves you to wait if you're not a giant key quest to buy everything immediately.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:41.760]   I'm bed pixel.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:42.760]   It just happened.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:43.760]   It's crazy.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.000]   Every time I turn on my computer now, I stare at it.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.040]   Sometimes you can rub it out.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.040]   I tried.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.040]   No rubbing his.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.880]   TV ads for the iPad and this one features apps.
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.800]   Boy, you would love if you're an app developer.
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.840]   Then you love to be the app featured in an Apple ad.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.240]   Let's take a look.
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:05.880]   I'm not getting your audio, but you know who's you know who's app that was, by the way.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.120]   You're not getting my audio.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.800]   No, I hate this.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:09.800]   I hate it.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.560]   Let's try it again.
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.400]   I'm going to plug it in again.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:18.120]   Now, the audio is coming out of it, but now it should be going to you.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.040]   Is it you're getting the buzzy thing or you're getting the.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.040]   I'm not getting anything.
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.040]   Well, you get it.
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.680]   Now you're not getting anything.
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.240]   I just want to point out that that first app is Clayton Morris's app.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:32.240]   But I don't know if they say.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.440]   I don't think they give them credit.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.440]   Go ahead.
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.440]   You play it.
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.440]   It's apple.com.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:39.480]   They say the at this right link right there.
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:41.480]   They're almost like blip first.
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.480]   They go so fast.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.480]   I think that there's somewhere there.
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:46.280]   It's called quick read and it's a speed reading app.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:50.640]   And I don't know if they should you know, they're do that's what that is.
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:51.640]   It's a great app.
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:52.640]   There we go.
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:02:01.320]   So they're not saying names of any of these.
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.840]   There is somewhere there's a guide.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:09.720]   I think even Apple has it over all the apps that are being used in their ads.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:15.600]   It's a good app.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:20.560]   Oh, air hockey.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.640]   I think that that's the nod to quick read, which is Clayton Morris's one word at a time
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.360]   speed reading app.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.160]   There's a second ad to play alive.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.960]   Play the second one if you would.
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.960]   Chat.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:33.960]   Wow.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:34.960]   Oh, synthesize.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:41.360]   Who ears who models who drums?
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.360]   Who's something?
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.760]   Who's something else?
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:50.760]   Now we're looking at a Titanic.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:51.760]   Sharks.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:54.760]   It's shark week exercise.
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.320]   Never mind.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.640]   There's my heart pounding on a snowboard.
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.160]   Nice ad.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.160]   I like that.
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.160]   It's a change of pace.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:08.720]   There's also subliminal messaging in there as those words whizz by.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:09.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:10.720]   It's fun.
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.720]   It's more like an iPod ad.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.720]   It's a more of a mainstream.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:14.760]   You don't have Peter Cloyote lecturing you anymore.
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.760]   Now you just get to know yourself.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:21.720]   And it is the ultimate response to any decision to buy an Android tablet, isn't it?
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:26.440]   I mean, freeze frame this on anything and try to find something happens.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.640]   Yeah, it's pretty on the Google Play Store.
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.640]   It's pretty.
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.680]   And it's read quick.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.040]   Not quick read.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.680]   Well, I was reading it so quickly.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.520]   I got it reversed.
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.520]   Read quick.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:42.120]   See, Natalie's going to kill me now.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.400]   So I love Jackie Chang.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.400]   God bless her.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.720]   Ours Technica's Apple columnist.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:51.360]   She writes the Infinite Loop column at Ours Technica, which is consistently one of the
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.240]   best news sources on the web.
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:04:00.160]   I actually pay for Ours Technica premiere, I guess they call it.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.440]   So we remember, we fell for this story.
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:03.960]   Everybody fell for this story.
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.320]   I don't know if it all forts the right word, but everybody was saying it.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:13.200]   It was in that new book inside Apple.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.000]   It was Adam Laskinski's book.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.880]   It was a lot of different sources and a certain way on news sources.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:23.600]   And we mentioned it said that when you get hired at Apple, you might be as an engineer.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:28.160]   You might be assigned to a fake project for a few months to see if you leak.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:33.160]   And given what you've told me, Alex, about the paranoia level at Apple, I kind of believed
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:34.160]   it.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.160]   Well, there was paranoia.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.200]   I think there's a lot less now than there was.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:40.280]   She has searched and searched, talked to everybody inside people.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:44.360]   And universally, she has not found any evidence of this.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:48.360]   And if you think about it, given the shortage of interchanges and resources, it would be
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:55.400]   very, very wasteful to sign somebody good to a fake project.
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:05:00.880]   This is it's Apple is because I when the problems with Apple success is because is that they've
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:04.360]   become more of like a willy Wonka style legend.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:05.360]   Yes.
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.360]   Yes.
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:11.480]   And say, you can spread, you can start almost any rumor that maybe 10% of things makes kind
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:12.480]   of sense.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:16.200]   And the more you think about it, the more sense it'll seem to make.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.520]   And I mean, I didn't buy this from the start.
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:22.640]   Although, I have to admit, the part of me said that, well, is Apple paranoid?
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.640]   Yes, they are.
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:28.200]   Do they get really, really steamed when information gets out that they don't want out at the time
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.200]   when they went on?
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.200]   Yes, they do.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.200]   Do you kidding?
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:32.200]   It wasn't there.
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.200]   It wasn't there.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.200]   I think it was Lucy case.
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.200]   Somebody made a joke about.
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.200]   No, no, no.
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:40.800]   It was on the bugle podcast saying that the awful rumors of people were spreading about
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:46.120]   like Hillary Clinton saying that now I know that he she has never murdered somebody.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.120]   But I cannot.
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.120]   I can't prove it.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.120]   I cannot.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:54.840]   But I cannot say with 100% certainty that I don't believe that she would never murder
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:55.840]   somebody.
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:00.040]   It's just another way of saying when did you stop beating your wife, right?
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:04.000]   I didn't I didn't believe that Apple hires people and puts them on fake projects.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.800]   I don't believe that at no point has there been a meeting somewhere where they suggested
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:12.760]   this and so on said, oh, as soon as we get well, as soon as we get the Apple watch done
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.400]   and the hoverboard, then.
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:19.520]   But it is, you know, Adam Lachinsky actually when Jackie asked him said, well, I never
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:23.600]   said that it was dummy projects that is projects that, you know, when you first get hired,
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.840]   we don't know what you're going to sign you to.
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:31.000]   But Daniel Jalka says seven who who does red sweater software as a long time Apple developers
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.040]   has never heard of anybody wasting, you know, intentionally wasting engineers times on a
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.040]   fake project.
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.040]   So I apologize.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.040]   I did repeat the story.
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:41.720]   But you know, it's a juicy story and it really is a juicy story because it sounds like something
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:42.720]   Apple might do.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:45.120]   If it's into your picture of Apple, right?
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:50.000]   As Andy says, there's a difference also in how this stuff gets translated from what someone
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.720]   might or might not hear.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:52.720]   Right.
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:55.720]   Don Milton also who created WebKit and Safari for Apple came out after the story and said
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:56.800]   he'd never heard it either.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.240]   And I've never heard that.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.440]   And it doesn't make sense from an engineering point of view and it seems like a ridiculous
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.440]   story.
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.440]   But that's not to say that they're a skunk where, you know, a guy comes in for an internship,
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:08.640]   they give him, here's this crazy project, try and get this to work and he spends some
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:11.200]   time doing it and they decide whether they should go forward with it or not.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:15.520]   And if they don't go forward, that it gets canceled, he gets moved on to something else.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:18.360]   But you do hear rumors about Canary traps or people are told things.
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:21.640]   They don't waste engineering time on it, but they're told things, specifications.
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:26.000]   I think they mentioned that in the in the Steve Jobs book, the Isaac's and steps jobs
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.840]   book that different people were different executives were told different things.
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:33.440]   And then when it leaked, they were fired, depending on who was the leak.
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.440]   I heard they were all fired.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.600]   Oh, my no, wait, that was game.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:36.880]   I saw that on Game of Thrones.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:37.880]   Never mind.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:38.880]   That was a different.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.920]   But even the stuff about, you know, like CIA and former FBI agents locking down the room
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:45.240]   and dragging people out at the Apple people who responded to the story said, you know,
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.240]   we've never, never seen.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.240]   I just wanted to mention that.
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.720]   I think I think that's from the firm and the movie.
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:51.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.720]   We're going to find out who Jeff was.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:57.760]   And I say was because he clearly isn't.
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:02.160]   And I'm talking about the Jeff right behind Andy over his left shoulder.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:06.920]   We're also, we're also going to talk about what Tim Cook said about Apple stores and
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:12.240]   some very amazing stats made into graphs by Horace Dettio, you at a Simco.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:16.840]   And why that would explain why maybe Google as well as Microsoft and Samsung is opening
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:17.840]   stores.
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.640]   But first a word about our phone system.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:23.680]   I see what I say that that sounds like, Oh, who wants to talk about a phone system?
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:26.960]   Let me tell you some pretty cool stuff going on here.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:30.080]   When we moved to the Brickhouse studios, we knew we needed a phone system.
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:33.680]   I realized, when did you decide for the Pixel cord that you were going to get off?
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:34.680]   You don't have a phone system.
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:35.880]   No, we have we have ring central.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:36.880]   You have ring central.
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:37.880]   Yeah.
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.880]   We got it.
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.880]   Like a you just got it.
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:40.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.520]   When you're just like all on cell phones, right?
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:46.480]   When you're small, you make your employees use their personal phones.
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:49.680]   And I realized, you know, I just didn't feel I couldn't do that.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.400]   Plus you need a central company number.
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:52.400]   You need a phone tree.
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:53.400]   You have a directory.
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:56.320]   You enter the first few letters and it finds a personal as you get bigger.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:57.720]   You kind of need to do this.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:01.560]   But the last thing I wanted to do was go to AT&T across the street and say we need a
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:05.120]   PBX and the basement and we got a lease it and blah, blah, blah.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:08.720]   And so the first we heard about ring central was from Russell, our IT guy who said he'd
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:09.720]   installed it.
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.120]   So did you hear about it from us?
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.120]   That's why you installed it.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.120]   So the funny thing is, is we knew you were doing something, but we actually we were at a
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.200]   Salesforce event and they were they were there.
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:19.920]   And so we talked to them and they're great.
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:22.800]   And they're very separate and and yeah, they're great.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.160]   And the big thing is flexibility.
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.920]   It's not just that it's another phone system.
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:29.640]   It's the fact that I can route that phone number to my iPhone or I can route it to my
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:30.640]   Android phone.
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:33.200]   I can, you know, I can have you started using the business text yet?
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.280]   I haven't yet.
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:35.600]   So now they have SMS.
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:38.480]   So you have a ring center lap on your iPhone or Android phone.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.360]   You make calls from that.
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:44.800]   The company pays for the call plus the company number shows up as the incoming number, but
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.640]   you can also use it for text messaging.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.560]   So your text messaging from the company's 800 number and inbound text messages to the
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.240]   800 number go to your phone.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.240]   Right.
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:54.240]   So that is really interesting.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:58.000]   I think what that shows is a lot of companies are starting to use text messaging as a way
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   of communicating as little as $20 a month per user.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   And that includes unlimited long distance calling to anywhere in the US.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.840]   You get all as you said, all sorts of feature faxes come to your inbox.
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.720]   And again, the flexibility.
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:14.720]   Routing.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:17.280]   You have to be able to reroute all of those pieces because we have people spread out all
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.640]   over the world and being able to.
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:20.280]   So you don't just use it in this office.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:22.080]   It's basically your phone system.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.320]   Your kind of virtual phone system for a virtual company.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.360]   That makes a lot of sense, actually.
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.600]   I want you to visit ring central.com read all about it.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.280]   We have a special number for our listeners.
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:32.200]   Don't call the number on the ring central page.
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:40.800]   Call 800-543-9980, 800-543-9980 or go to ring central.com and use the offer code TWIT.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.560]   Either way, they'll know it's from us.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:48.600]   800-543-9980, you could try it for a month and they do have a special deal for our listeners.
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:52.680]   When you get by a phone, you get a second phone free up to a total of 20 phones.
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:54.720]   So you really got a kind of an instant start.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:56.240]   Ring central is fantastic.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.720]   And I think the fact that Alex is using it too kind of speaks for itself.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.680]   Ring central.com.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:06.160]   All right.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:11.760]   Tim Cook was speaking at, was it the Bloomberg conference?
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:12.760]   Goldman Sachs.
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.760]   Goldman Sachs, that's what I mean.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:16.280]   I always say Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs conference.
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:19.400]   And he talked about the stores.
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:23.320]   He said, "There's no better place to discover, explore and learn about our products than
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.320]   in retail."
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.640]   And that's of course the reason I think Apple did retail.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:31.800]   It's the retail experience where you walk in and you instantly realize this store is
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.880]   not here for the purpose of selling.
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.760]   It's here for the purpose of serving.
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:39.040]   And so I think that that's accurate.
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.720]   When you go in an Apple store, you don't feel like somebody's trying to sell you something.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:43.000]   It's like, "We've got it all.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   What do you want?
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   What can we do?
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   What can we help you with?"
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.560]   I'm not even sure he said the store is the right word anymore.
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.400]   They've taken on a roll much broader than that.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:55.360]   They are the face of Apple for almost all of our customers.
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.800]   120 million people in the store's last quarter.
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:58.800]   That seems like a crazy number.
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:01.080]   You also called him his Prozac.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.080]   What?
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.080]   He did?
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.040]   Yeah, he said that when he's depressed, he goes to an Apple store and it's like taking
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.040]   a Prozac.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:09.080]   I don't feel, I think it's the other way around.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.080]   It's quite stimulus.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:15.440]   Many, especially most Apple stores are so crowded and they're popping and they're happening.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:16.440]   Everybody knows you.
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:19.000]   Well, they don't know me, but they didn't know you when you walk in.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   They say, "Alex Lindsey!"
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   They usually know.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   That's nice.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   You need to help people.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   That's nice.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   400 stores.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.440]   The first goes to feel like Steve Allen.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:32.000]   400 stores, 370 million visitors in a year.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.200]   That's almost a million people per store.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.360]   It's per store.
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.840]   Look at the graph of people in the store.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:43.880]   Store visitors versus store open.
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:46.320]   The line is store visitors.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.320]   Average store is open.
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:51.040]   And so much of the store is about all of the stuff.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.040]   It's exactly what he said.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.040]   It's all about the services.
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.440]   A lot of times you're going to the store because something needs to be fixed or you
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:58.720]   don't understand why something isn't working or you want to go.
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.960]   The key is people there that aren't driven by bonuses, they aren't driven by making sure
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:04.960]   that they answer your questions.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.960]   They are knowledgeable.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:12.400]   It's a very specialized crew.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.400]   I just don't know.
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.680]   I can't think of another retail outlet like that.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:21.160]   The best number is the amount of sales per square foot.
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:25.400]   $6,000 per square foot in 2012.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:31.160]   That makes Apple more successful by a factor of two than Tiffany the second place.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.320]   The number two is TIFFini.
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:37.880]   And it's 3,000 Lulu lemon.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.120]   Coach Lulu lemon.
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.120]   It's F.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.120]   Oh, you don't.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:42.120]   Doesn't your wife work out?
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:45.080]   It is a girls athletic store, women's athletic store.
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.080]   You don't know Lulu lemon?
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.080]   It's Canadian.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.080]   I'm sure.
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.080]   I'm sure Rene knows Lulu.
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:50.760]   And they have men's apparel too, Leo.
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:51.760]   They do?
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:52.760]   Yep.
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:56.520]   It wouldn't be caught dead wearing something that says Lulu lemon.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.520]   Athletica.
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.520]   That's the other part of the brand.
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:00.520]   Maybe I'll wear an athletic shirt.
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:01.520]   Coach.
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.520]   Michael Kors.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.520]   All right, there's Lulu lemon.
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.000]   All right, you're right.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.560]   There's men, women.
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:10.440]   They sell, yeah, he looks manly.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:13.400]   I'm not wearing baby blue workout shorts.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.880]   That's just not because you're not as secure.
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:17.280]   I'm not secure as this job.
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.280]   No, I'm not.
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:19.280]   I'm not.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:22.200]   I don't want anybody to look at me and say, what the hell are you wearing?
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.200]   There you go.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.480]   Well, it is, but it is, look at this graph.
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:30.000]   It is kind of scary when you realize that Tiffany can learn something about markup from
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   it.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:37.920]   Well, and one of the things though, like when you look at it, so the, like I've tried
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:42.040]   to buy phones at different place, you know, for whatever convenience I bought, you know,
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:45.360]   iPhones at an out of a rising store and an AT&T store.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.920]   And I've gotten to the point now where I will not.
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:51.480]   I just go to the Apple store to buy it because my Apple, my Apple care is immediately is
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:52.920]   instantly added to my system.
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:55.280]   I don't have to take a box home and try to figure it out.
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.640]   I don't have to, you know, and I've just stopped ordering the only thing we ever order
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:03.400]   outside of the Apple store that's an Apple product is really high-end laptops because
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.440]   if we need them that day, we can get them from B&H.
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:09.520]   They're pre-built, but an Apple, you know, takes three days or whatever if we're in a
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:10.520]   rush.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:14.160]   So, but outside of that, we buy everything, you know, that's Apple from Apple.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:17.160]   And I think that that's because the service is so much higher when you do it.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.560]   It's just so much easier.
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:20.760]   The price is still online.
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.160]   But I online from Apple, but always from Apple.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.160]   Yeah.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:28.800]   And I bought it from Amazon, I got like the last version of that hardware and then the
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:30.000]   Apple care didn't get done.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.760]   And also Apple smart, they control the pricing.
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.760]   So, well, there's no advantage to buying from Amazon.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:34.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:35.760]   You don't say if you save five bucks or something.
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:36.760]   It's not working.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:37.760]   And in the story, they'll teach you how to use it.
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:38.960]   I mean, they'll set it up for you.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:42.320]   They'll give you classes on the on the basic software, all for free.
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:46.160]   It's a very, it's almost like going on a cruise ship of retail.
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.480]   Now, the fees in Iran.
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:52.680]   The getting support could be a little frustrating because at this point, you must make an appointment
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:53.680]   to get support.
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.680]   You cannot walk in and say, I need help.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.280]   You actually have to say, well, once you're once your appointment, you have to make a
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:00.600]   walk in, but they'll try to help you make an appointment.
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:04.840]   That's what you'll do is you'll make an appointment and sit around for a while.
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:07.800]   That's not surprising to anybody.
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:11.880]   I mean, when they when remember what the situation was when they first opened these stores where
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:17.320]   you could not get a working demo of a Mac, any and any of the stores where they're available
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:21.160]   because they're going to walk in the store and the Mac screens are all dim.
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:24.360]   All the window screens are active or at least trying a blue screen, at least showing that
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:27.080]   at least the CPU was actually working.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:30.680]   And they needed to do I think that originally from the from the get go, this was conceived
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:37.800]   as we're going to build embassies for the Apple nation inside every mall inside every
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:38.800]   major town square.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:42.200]   We're going to make sure there's a place where someone wants to see why a functional
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.800]   Apple anything and why it's such a good thing to buy.
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.080]   That's where they go.
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:50.400]   And what's amazing is that even as Apple has worked its way up out of that abyss, that
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:55.040]   it still does function that way that you go there and these are places where people play.
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:17:00.640]   I mean, there's a Microsoft store in the Prudential Center in Boston, which is roughly across the
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:03.920]   street from the landmark Apple store in Boyleson street.
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:08.400]   And to its credit, the Microsoft store, it's usually quite busy.
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:12.640]   The Prudential Center is a very, very busy downtown mall.
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:15.560]   But when you go into the Apple store, you see people just sort of hanging out and you
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:20.880]   see kids like playing and it really does have that sort of town square sort of vibe to it.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.440]   It's not a place of transaction.
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.760]   So it's it's quite an achievement.
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:27.960]   And any history of Apple has to put the Apple stores.
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:32.280]   I would say in the top six of accomplishments that the company has done in the entire history.
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:38.960]   And I think that one of the things that is not only is the service really good, but the
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:40.160]   it's so frictionless.
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.880]   You know, I mean, you know, a good example.
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:46.880]   I mean, so being a we buy more stuff from being a just we buy from Apple and just hard to
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:47.880]   believe.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:52.240]   And so we spend a lot of time there when I'm in New York and they're like a great store
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:53.400]   and audio company.
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.400]   The camera.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:58.480]   Yeah, they do video and gear and you know, and I but they're more like a warehouse, right?
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:01.240]   You go in there and it's crazy products.
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:04.960]   There's the one place in the world that you can just kind of walk in and grab right the
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.640]   kind of equipment that we use.
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.080]   And and so when we're in New York, a lot of times we develop new pipelines and everything
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:12.760]   else because we can just walk into being aged, but the thing is being aged though, you have
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:15.080]   to brace for impact because you're going to go there and you're going to talk to one
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.200]   guy and they really know what they're talking about.
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.480]   But then they're going to give you a slip and then you're going to take it over to another
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:22.480]   guy and then and then he's going to take that slip and he's going to put it into the computer
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.960]   and then he's going to wait for all the stuff to show up to him and then he's going to send
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.240]   that to another person's on the slip.
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:29.520]   And there's like, there's like a half an hour that takes to buy anything there.
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.160]   Now the place is packed.
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:34.880]   So whatever they're doing is working, but you do that and then you walk over to the Apple
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:39.920]   store, you take the subway down to the Apple store in Chelsea and you don't even talk to
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:40.920]   anyone.
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:44.960]   You take your iPhone and you take pictures of your, you scan, have you done this with
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:45.960]   the Apple store app?
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:46.960]   No.
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:50.800]   You walk up and you just, you take the item and you say this one's fine.
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:54.960]   And then you scan it and you charge it and you charge it and then you walk out and you
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:55.960]   feel like you're like shoplifting.
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:56.960]   I just can't do it.
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:57.960]   I just, but it's so exciting.
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:58.960]   Too low key though.
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:06.200]   I bought my last MacBook in the Boyleson Street Apple store and it's like, oh, right.
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:11.440]   And I was expecting to be like sat down and handed tea in a couple of high end biscuits
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.080]   because I'm making a major purchase.
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:16.560]   But it's like, I'm going to walk out and drop $2,000 here.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:17.560]   And it was like, okay, great.
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.560]   Here you go.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.800]   Did you want the better display or the okay display?
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:21.800]   Okay.
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:22.800]   There you go.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:26.000]   There's a message that I think there's an unconscious intentional message there that
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.640]   $2,000 is no big deal.
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:29.640]   Right?
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:30.640]   Like, yeah, that's fine.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:31.640]   What else would you like to buy?
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:32.640]   We don't need your money.
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.160]   I know that I'm a working journalist.
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:35.160]   Yeah, we don't need your money.
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:37.240]   Well, and most importantly, that salesperson doesn't take it.
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.680]   That salesperson doesn't need your money.
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.440]   They're getting paid where they're getting paid no matter what.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:44.720]   And it's really funny because like when I try to buy this stuff on my own, just because
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.480]   I'm fascinated by the process.
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:51.920]   And if you slow down at all, someone walks over and goes, hey, do you need a hand?
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:56.120]   You know, they're not paying attention to you until you look like you're having trouble.
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:57.120]   Anyway, so it's--
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.760]   And they're also, I mean, their job is to delight you.
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:02.280]   And they're given, especially the geniuses, have a wide range of latitude.
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.280]   And you'll see people--
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:04.280]   They're really good at opening boxes.
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:08.160]   By the way, you know, all the Apple boxes, they'll show you all the secrets to how to
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.680]   open those boxes if you ask them, they'll like you open it in the store.
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:13.440]   And you always see at least four or five of them trying to figure out how to get your
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:17.640]   data off that old Windows laptop or PC and move it on to your new one for you or looking
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:21.160]   at that scratch on your iPhone and trying to see if your Apple care can somehow cover
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.160]   it for you.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.160]   They do a lot of good work.
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:26.960]   Anyway, I mean, and I know, you know, we're definitely going into the fanboy zone here
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:29.520]   with the-- but this is why they're making so much money.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.840]   If you're wondering why-- I mean, I think it's going to be hard.
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.960]   I think it's very hard to create that culture.
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:37.440]   I think Google's going to try it and Microsoft's going to try it.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:40.560]   But I think it's very, very difficult to create that culture again.
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:41.560]   And I think it's hard.
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.720]   I walk into the bus line, there's nobody there.
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.400]   I go there and every section is empty.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.080]   I find one guy says, not my section.
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.080]   He runs off.
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.560]   And then they don't have any customers, so they cut the staff for it.
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:50.560]   Right.
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:51.560]   Right.
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:52.560]   It's a vicious cycle.
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:56.640]   Well, yeah, I think that that's why I think that the Microsoft stores, they've got the
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:02.960]   best shot, but even there, what they don't understand is that Apple has always been a
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:08.280]   community of people who have been attracted to specifically this brand and specifically
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.280]   those features.
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:14.800]   And so if you erect a clubhouse, then people are going to come and go see that.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:19.080]   Whereas Google doesn't have that sort of aura around it.
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:22.520]   I think everything will change once they have Google Glass actually shipping.
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:25.920]   I think that's why they're building Google stores is really it's all about demoing Glass
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:26.920]   more than anything.
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:34.840]   And so just as Java is associated with browser exploits, I think that Google Glass is going
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.840]   to be associated with conjunctivitis.
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:41.600]   I definitely bring your alcohol wipes once if you want to demo those at the store.
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:47.880]   I mean, is there the same sort of user community that says that I'm I was here to buy a pair
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:51.800]   of slacks at JCPenney's because I'm that much of an Apple fan.
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:55.600]   I'm just going to stop by the Apple store just to see what's doing because I got another
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:56.600]   45 minutes of my parking.
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:00.520]   I'm not sure the people are going to do that for Microsoft store or Google store.
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.520]   Are there Google fanboys or are there Samsung fanboys?
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:04.160]   It's much more fractured market.
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.320]   I'm a Google fanboy.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.320]   I'll admit it.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.840]   Well, they don't historically have consumer face.
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:09.840]   Show us your tattoo.
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.760]   A lot of their show us the tattoo.
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.800]   No, I don't have a tattoo.
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:16.160]   I know you have I know you only got it out one.
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:17.640]   You don't have the fading in yet.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:18.640]   Yeah, I'm waiting.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:23.720]   Who is Jeff and what happened to Jeff?
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:26.880]   The guy over your left shoulder.
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:27.880]   Andy.
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.320]   Oh, the guy behind you.
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:32.560]   I can't I can't believe you don't recognize Jeff Peterson.
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:40.520]   Oh, the the the the co host of the of of of late late show with the with Craig Ferguson.
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:41.920]   Oh, that's who that is.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:44.560]   That is that is Robot skeleton sidekick.
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:48.320]   I know I love Craig Ferguson, but I but he's on too late.
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:52.480]   If we're just the late show, I could watch it, but the late late show I can't be.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:57.480]   Or he is the animatronic human skeleton that serves as a sidekick.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:02.720]   I think Craig Ferguson is actually doing some some of the most innovative stuff ever.
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:03.720]   I love him.
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:08.480]   Well, that's why without getting into too deep around hold, this is why I love like what
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:11.440]   happened with Jeff Peterson originally.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:15.960]   This is supposed to be a limited gag, which they they pro it's the Jeff is I had a tour.
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:20.440]   I am working on hopefully an article about Jeff and it's and his construction.
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:22.940]   Jeff has actually driven by an iPad.
[01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:23.940]   You kidding?
[01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:29.840]   The voice the person who does the voice is off camera and within line of sight of of
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:32.040]   the of the host so that he can actually have conversations.
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:34.440]   It was built by Grant and Mahara from the myth bust.
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:38.120]   Don't like Grant and Mahara runs off of two APC UPS's.
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:39.120]   Wow.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:43.400]   But what I love about it is that originally he was designed to be programmed with like six
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:48.600]   like banal like catch phrases saying in my opinion, your pants.
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:52.080]   So that just sort of make a joke about how like sidekicks they're just there to like
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:54.520]   trigger catch phrases and not really do anything.
[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:59.520]   But unfortunately they had the voice guy actually on set for a couple weeks and they had so
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:04.080]   much fun that okay, I guess I guess the sidekick is a really makes a valuable contribution
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.080]   to the show.
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:06.080]   Right.
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:07.080]   Fine.
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:08.080]   You're still not getting on camera.
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:10.760]   Well, okay.
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:11.760]   I have I feel bad.
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:13.760]   I know it was.
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:17.480]   That's my favorite iPad accessory because I am I am a fan, but I just haven't seen the
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:19.160]   show very often.
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:22.000]   So that's good to know.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.560]   All right.
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:30.560]   Interesting article in the New York Times about the lightning cable Brian X Chan writing
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:33.800]   on Valentine's Day.
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:38.680]   The reason I was interested is because I keep waiting for Mophie to do a Mophie case for
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:41.480]   the iPhone 5 and it's taken a long, long time.
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:43.480]   It just came out by the way.
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:48.360]   And that's the context of this is that Apple really tightly controls accessories now because
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:49.560]   of this new lightning connector.
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.080]   You have to get a license for it.
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:54.120]   And in fact, the connectors are serialized.
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:58.040]   So they know there's authentication chips, but also a serial number.
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:02.840]   So they know whose accessory it is.
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:08.640]   Well, and they have Apple has a lot more power to tighten that down because it's programmable.
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:09.640]   So right.
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:12.040]   Any update to I if they decide they want to change everything.
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.040]   They can screw you.
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.040]   And they can.
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:17.920]   So you know, this is definitely not one of those places like to buy something that's
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:19.720]   off brand.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:24.120]   You know, your lightning connectors, you know, that's not going to last to the next.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:25.600]   So that's the thing to watch out for now.
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.320]   Monoprice, I guess, is actually, and I think Amazon both have.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:30.320]   They're charging though.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:33.120]   I don't think that they do all the capabilities of a lightning cable.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.520]   They're essentially charging cables.
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:35.520]   Yeah.
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:36.520]   Okay.
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:37.520]   Right.
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:40.240]   That's that so be careful when you buy a cheap lightning cable.
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.240]   But I think that they are licensed.
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:42.240]   I think that they are licensed.
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:46.520]   You know, I think that I think that the I believe I saw that Monoprice does have a lot
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:47.520]   of it.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.360]   Well, that would if it's licensed, that's fine.
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.080]   I don't know if there's a is there a badge?
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:52.880]   Is there some sort of Apple approval?
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:58.800]   Is that a program you have to join and yeah, yeah, it makes the NDA for the software stuff
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:00.960]   look timid by comparison.
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:05.120]   So anyway, the good news is there finally is a mophie for the iPhone 5.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.040]   It's called the juice pack.
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:10.080]   Helium comes out March 1st.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.840]   It's 1500 milliamp hours.
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:14.440]   So it probably doubles the life of the iPhone 5.
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:15.440]   Much needed.
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.360]   I got to say, I've been using it all week.
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:18.360]   Have you?
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:19.360]   You like it?
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:20.360]   Yeah.
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:21.360]   I like it.
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:22.520]   It's a little bit more soft touch than the previous one, which I don't like as much.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.680]   So it feels almost velvety.
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:24.680]   Good.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.720]   It looks smaller too.
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:26.720]   The other one was huge.
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:28.840]   It is smaller and the biggest.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:31.680]   I don't know if it's a problem, but the biggest change is because the headphone jack is at
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:32.680]   the bottom.
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:36.160]   They now have a very deep hole for the headphone and it comes with an extension in case your
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:37.160]   headphone won't fit in that.
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:39.000]   I have that problem with a lot of cases.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.640]   I can't get my headphones in there.
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:45.280]   So they have a little adapter for the iPhone 1.
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:46.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:47.280]   Well, anyway, good news.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:48.280]   Well, good.
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:54.120]   I'll let you give us a review when you're done reviewing that for iMore.
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:58.160]   See a couple of quick stories and we're going to get to our picks of the week.
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:02.680]   McAfee revokes the key for signing Mac apps.
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:03.680]   Whoops.
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:08.200]   I guess it's fixed now.
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:12.840]   Who's apple loses his Brazilian iPhone trademark ruling?
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:17.920]   Johnny Ive gets a gold blue Peter badge.
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:21.640]   I had to go start looking that up because that was such a.
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:24.760]   It's a BBC program, right?
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:29.120]   It's like Captain Kang grew or Mr. Rogers is beloved by people of a certain age in England.
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:30.120]   Right.
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:35.000]   And they give badges to the listeners for achieving certain things and there's rewards
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.480]   for doing certain positive things of the show and that social widespread tradition that
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:44.160]   there are there are like museums and places where if you flash your if you ever earned
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:48.360]   your badge, you can flash this badge and get free admission of to certain things.
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:54.120]   It got such it got and became such a big deal that people were selling their blue Peter
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:57.960]   badges on eBay because they became really, really valuable.
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:04.680]   So now there's like a now they had to create a brand new system created by one of the kids
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:10.360]   who watches the program who was awarded the silver blue Peter badge for her efforts that
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:14.360]   that requires a photo ID to accompany that badge in order to work.
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:20.200]   So apparently it is a it is the gold badges are only given to like huge dignitaries,
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.200]   big, big deal people.
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.480]   The queen has one for acceptance.
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:28.040]   So whenever she wants whenever she whenever she purchases at least a two two scoop ice
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:33.720]   cream, she gets a free topping of choice.
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:36.960]   In the US M Cal 27 says, you don't know about blue Peter.
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.760]   No, we never heard of that in the US.
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:40.040]   That's a that's an English.
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:41.040]   Mr. Rogers.
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:42.040]   We have Mr. Rogers.
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:45.400]   Johnny, I bet they never heard I bet they never heard of the Radio Shack battery of the
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:46.320]   month club card either.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:49.480]   Ah, you know, they're these cross cultural things.
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:52.040]   It's just cross control.
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:58.160]   David Beckham's got one Barney JK Rowling and the queen.
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:28:59.160]   That's neat.
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:00.160]   That's the and Johnny.
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:02.720]   I've said I grew up watching blue Peter.
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:09.160]   Um, he says he vividly remembers, uh, designs from the show and loved it that they reused
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:11.000]   products he thought were no longer useful.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.080]   That really is the, uh, the gift for the person who's got everything.
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:15.080]   A blue Peter.
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:20.880]   I had a blue Peter once, but, uh, I saw a doctor and, uh, let's see.
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:24.440]   Uh, I think we're going to take a break and come back and get your picks of the week.
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.440]   Gentlemen.
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:27.040]   Oh, there was iOS 6.1.
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:28.040]   Yeah.
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:29.520]   And I said we're going to talk about it.
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:31.200]   Now this fixes the exchange error.
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:34.720]   No, does it fix the very nasty lock screen error?
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:38.440]   No, I couldn't get it to work eventually and neither could Christina Warren or Matthew
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:43.000]   Panzerino from other outlets, but ours technica managed to get the exploit working again.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.200]   So it doesn't appear to be fixed.
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:45.200]   Ah, that's too bad.
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:50.600]   This is an exploit that came in iOS 4.2 that allowed somebody to bypass your lock screen.
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:56.240]   Can you access all the contents of the phone or can you just get to the dialer?
[01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:57.240]   You can do limited things.
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:00.560]   You can get to limited forms of contacts and some other information, but I don't, I don't
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:02.440]   believe it gives you full unfettered access.
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:05.640]   And that's good news because it means evasion still works.
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:07.160]   Yeah, evasion still works.
[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:09.760]   And it's also, uh, and that exploit is rather complicated.
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:14.000]   I mean, it took, I think it took Christina 10 tries to get it working and I still haven't
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.360]   gotten it working, but you know, respected outlets have got it.
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:20.440]   I think if you practiced, it's harder than the Konami code.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:21.440]   Okay.
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:23.360]   It's not up, up, down, down, up, left, right, left, right.
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:26.520]   And you need physical access and you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:27.520]   But that's the thing.
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:31.120]   If you say, if you leave it on a bar and you go to the bathroom, somebody could, if they
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:33.320]   got a depth that I could, call them.
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:34.600]   I could tweet something nasty.
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:36.600]   Yeah.
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:39.160]   But the exchange bug was annoying a lot of people and Microsoft was working around it.
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:40.400]   So it's nice that that's good.
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:41.400]   Yeah.
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:42.400]   That's 6.12.
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:45.040]   Here's, uh, is this Christina doing it?
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:48.000]   No, she's that's not this is the verge of wage doing it.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.800]   But you have to like hit canceled and hit home, then type in a certain number and hit
[01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:57.080]   call and disconnect it, then lock and then unlock.
[01:30:57.080 --> 01:31:00.440]   I mean, if you know it, you could probably get it done pretty quick, right?
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:01.440]   Yeah.
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:02.440]   It's finicky though.
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:03.840]   I mean, it takes several tries.
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:04.840]   Timing is critical.
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:06.840]   And yeah, boy, this is a quite a.
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:07.840]   There you go.
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:09.520]   Now you got in the contacts.
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:15.760]   You got the dialer, but the thing that's weird is that this bug was in 4.2 and fixed
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:17.040]   and now it resurfaced.
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:20.280]   So it's like somebody, somebody in the chat room said Scott Forestall checked it back
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:23.480]   in from the, but it's like the exchange bug has happened.
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:26.640]   There's these parts of code where they fix bugs, but they're kind of leaning up against
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:30.960]   each other and then change one of the things that comes back as a cards.
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:31.960]   Yeah.
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:32.960]   Thank you.
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:33.960]   Yeah.
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:34.960]   Well, I was going to mention that.
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:35.960]   So you certainly should update your, your phone.
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:37.520]   Is it all iPhones?
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:38.520]   Is it?
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:39.520]   Okay.
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:40.520]   It's all of them.
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:41.520]   So the last one was just iPhone four.
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:42.520]   Yes.
[01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:47.440]   And there is a beta for 6.1.1, which is probably going to get renumbered now to 6 point.
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:49.240]   Yeah, because they're at 6.12.
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:50.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:51.240]   Very confusing.
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:54.480]   All right.
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:57.280]   Our show today brought to you by audible.com.
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:59.280]   We love audible.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:03.080]   I just, you know, I love my days off Mondays a day off for me.
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:04.600]   I fire up the Sonos.
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:06.840]   I put audible on all my speakers in my house.
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:09.400]   I do the laundry and I'm listening to my audio books.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.400]   And it's like, I don't care how long the chores take it.
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.040]   They could take all day because I'm loving.
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:17.760]   I'm listening to the second book of Peter Rothfuss's King Killer Chronicles.
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:19.680]   And I just, I'm in that world.
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:20.680]   And it's just great.
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:26.080]   People you're doing chores or you're exercising or you're driving your horrible commute.

[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:44.960]   I don't think you'll will cancel because I think you're going to love it.
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:48.640]   Now the key is to get that first book to have it be something really great.
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:52.640]   Andy, as, oh, Andy, I listen to every book you recommend, Andy.
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:55.440]   You have never steered me wrong.
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:59.280]   So here's a chance for you to recommend another book.
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:03.880]   This is the second volume of Carl Reiner's autobiography slash memoirs.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:06.040]   I remember me.
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:07.600]   His first one was Enter Laughing.
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:13.520]   And that was the, it's when he, when, when, so a comedian, writer, someone of his legendary
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:15.440]   stature writes the first memoir.
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:16.440]   Yeah.
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:23.400]   And he's a story of, of, of conceiving of and creating and writing the, the Dick Van Dyke
[01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:24.400]   show.
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:27.040]   So all the, all the most frequent highlights you'd get out of Carl Reiner's career.
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:28.320]   We're covering the first one.
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:33.160]   This was like, that was his perspective like as a young old man.
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:35.800]   Now he is 90, 91 years old.
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:39.280]   And the second volume of the memoir is mostly, well, I lost my wife a few years ago.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.280]   Here's how that works.
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:44.520]   Here are the things that I'm really kind of focusing on in my older age.
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:45.520]   But it's still.
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:50.800]   So if you have purchased neither one of them, then I think that Enter Laughing is the one
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:51.960]   to go for.
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:57.080]   If you have already seen the first one, then the, I remember me, I bought it.
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:59.640]   I skimmed it in an actual bookstore.
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:03.760]   And the first couple chapters really, really stuck with me so that what that became, I
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:07.840]   haven't listened to the audiobook version yet, but he's a great reader, a great performer.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:12.440]   One of these guys that, man, if you could be one tenth as creative as this person in
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:15.480]   one half of his lifetime, you could, they will bury you with a smile.
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:20.200]   And his face because he is just one of those brains that just keeps creating, keeps working,
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:25.160]   and keeps operating on such a high level that he has my utmost admiration.
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:30.920]   So this was, it was, it was, he received one of these awards for me where the fact that
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:35.680]   he has a new book out means that I'm purchasing that book an audiobook form.
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:39.360]   You know, it's funny, once you buy that book, then, or look at that book, then you start
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:42.280]   getting all the other Hollywood memoirs as recommendations.
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:46.760]   Who bought this also bought Dick Van Dyke's memoirs, My Lucky Life.
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:48.600]   Dick Cavitt's memoirs talk show.
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:51.040]   Yeah, I mean, so that's one of the fun things about this.
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:55.200]   And very often, you know, Carl Reiner narrates is, most of the time I don't like authors
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:59.320]   to narrate their own books, but when it's a showbiz celebrity, you want to hear their
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:00.320]   voice.
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:04.640]   So, and also, I mean, these previews are really important because I, but there is another
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.800]   book that I actually bought and started listening to last week, but kind of had to abort after
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:15.080]   the second chapter, the reader was, because the reader was trying, was almost as if he's
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:20.360]   trying to explain to you where you can pick up your luggage after your plane has landed.
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.800]   Generally, Audible is very good.
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.520]   They hire actors, Broadway actors.
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:27.800]   Did you recommend Michael Caine's book, The Elephant to Hollywood?
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:28.800]   Yes.
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:33.360]   Because just having Michael Caine narrate a book is a good example of, you want to hear
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:34.360]   this.
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:35.360]   A bird in a bottle party.
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.680]   You need to either bring a bottle or a bird.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:39.160]   Well, I couldn't afford a bottle.
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:40.760]   So I brought two birds.
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:45.200]   I want to go to a bird in a bottle party.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:49.520]   So audible.com/macbreak, the problem, as you can already see is you're going to see a
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.280]   hundred books you want to listen to.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:54.200]   I got to tell you this is going to change your life, especially if you spend time in
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:58.680]   the car commuting at the gym, working out, doing housework, walking the dog.
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:59.960]   I listen to Audible whenever I can.
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:03.120]   I've got a running, the Audible app on my iPhone, my Android phone.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.560]   They've got Blackberry and Windows phone too.
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:07.000]   They even have a Metro app if you're a Windows 8 user.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.960]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:11.480]   I bought five books the other day.
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:14.000]   Chad just got to be an audible guy.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000]   Just say no to Unitesk.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.000]   What did you buy?
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.840]   I hear, let me go into my library.
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:18.840]   I bought...
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:21.000]   Chad's turning into one of us.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.000]   Yeah.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.640]   Well, it came to our world.
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:25.480]   So I bought in the plex.
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:26.480]   I'm feeling lucky.
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.480]   Awesome.
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:28.480]   Ghost in the wires.
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:29.480]   Right stuff.
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:30.480]   Pandora's Star.
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:31.480]   Oh.
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:32.480]   Civilization.
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:37.040]   And then the second book in the King Killer Chronicles.
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:39.120]   See, Chad, what's happening?
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.560]   This is a college education for you.
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:42.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:46.880]   I learned so much more from Audible books over the last 10, 15 years that I've been
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:47.880]   a member.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:49.440]   It's an ongoing education.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:50.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:52.280]   So I like it that you're mixing fiction with nonfiction.
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:53.280]   That's great.
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:54.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:55.280]   That's great.
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:56.280]   You're going to love the Peter F. Hamlin.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:57.280]   Have you listened to any of his stuff before?
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:58.280]   I haven't.
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:36:59.280]   Oh, no.
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:01.480]   And that was suggested to me.
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:04.880]   I really like the cyberpunk stuff.
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:06.520]   Yeah.
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:10.920]   His characterizations, he's a great writer, which makes his books especially good.
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:15.000]   You got to listen to the dragon one.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.760]   Falling dragon fall dragon falling dragon.
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:18.000]   I'll find it for you.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000]   Anyway, enough.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.840]   We could go on and on.
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:22.560]   As you can see, we're kind of fans.
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:25.560]   Audible.com/MacBreakNow.
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:27.000]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.800]   Let's start all the way to the right with Renee Richie.
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:32.880]   I'm going to pick up my pickle who I ran and slapped on the...
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:33.880]   Oh, there it is.
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:34.880]   ...muffic cases to show you.
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:38.120]   So it is roughly the same thickness as the old Mophie case.
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:39.120]   It looks similar.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:40.120]   Yeah.
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:43.360]   The only weird thing is because the iPhone 5 is so light, you can feel the difference
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:46.720]   more, but it works really well at recharges.
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:48.720]   And it's got the...
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:51.000]   Oh, he just popped up.
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.160]   That was always the problem with the Mophie cases popping the bottom off.
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:58.160]   Now, that's weird because the light is on the bottom and it's got lightning.
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:37:59.160]   Yeah.
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:01.160]   Cool.
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:02.160]   Fallen Dragon.
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:03.160]   That's the name of it.
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:04.360]   Thank you, John.
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:05.360]   So there's the Mophie.
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:08.680]   That's called the Helium available March for $79 in the US.
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:10.040]   The dark one is available now.
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:11.200]   The light one comes out later.
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:12.200]   Oh, good.
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:13.200]   I'll leave us now.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:14.200]   We're around about now-ish.
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:15.200]   Okay.
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:16.200]   Great.
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:17.200]   But my pick is actually something completely different.
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:18.200]   It's called Search Path.
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:23.040]   And it's a new tool, a web service from Manton Reese who's well known for Tweet Mark or
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:24.040]   Watermark.
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:30.120]   And he also has a tool that you can use Tweet Library, which I used for my Twitter archive.
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.560]   But Search Path is a new service.
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:32.960]   It's $8 a month if you want to use it.
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:37.800]   And it puts a very elegant, very small search box onto any web page.
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.600]   It'll work as a backup for your website as well.
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:42.240]   You put it on, you type in a search term.
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:45.240]   The demo only does Peter Pan, but it'll show you what happens.
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:50.080]   And everything comes up in a popover so you don't lose the context of your site when you're
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:51.080]   demoing it.
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:52.920]   Oh, I like this.
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:58.440]   He also, he and Daniel Jalkot do the Core Intuition podcast where he spoke about it on
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:01.680]   this week's episode, which is a very interesting show too.
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:05.160]   And it just, it gets out of your way, it does what it says it's going to do and it works
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:06.160]   very well.
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:10.960]   I'm going to put this on Leo, Villan, if we like it, and we should use it on Twitter.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:12.960]   We use Google search right now on Twitter.
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:14.960]   Whoop, we broke it.
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:18.560]   I should have done it before.
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:20.800]   Before you mentioned it.
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:22.440]   I'm sorry, Manton.
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:27.840]   I'm sure it'll come back any minute now.
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:28.840]   Searchpath.io.
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:29.840]   Yes.
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:32.440]   Are you using it on iMore?
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:36.520]   I don't, we still use Google on iMore, but we'll probably roll our own custom thing
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:40.680]   eventually just because we want full page search results, but I'm going to put this,
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:44.320]   most likely on my personal site when I redo it because then I want people to still be
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:47.120]   able to see the content when they're searching for stuff.
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:48.120]   This is really good.
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:49.840]   I'm very intrigued.
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:54.280]   Eight bucks a month, but you can try it for free.
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:56.120]   Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:00.960]   You've pulled out something that we played with on iPad today.
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:01.960]   Have you ever ordered?
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:05.120]   We'll go ahead and show it.
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:09.520]   This is, Autodesk keeps on putting out just these great super apps.
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:15.400]   They have one, two 3D catch and a variety of other pieces of software.
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.400]   They're just really moving into this market.
[01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:23.400]   The new one here is one, two, three-D creature.
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:29.560]   You basically start with a skeleton.
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:33.200]   Once you have that skeleton, you can move it around, you can start adding to it.
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:35.720]   You can really build this entire object.
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:37.240]   Do you have an overhead of mine?
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:38.720]   No, I don't know.
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:39.720]   Do you?
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:40.720]   Chad?
[01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:41.720]   Right there it is.
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:42.720]   There's something.
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:43.720]   Whoa.
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:44.720]   There you go.
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:45.720]   That's the best I got.
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:46.720]   That's good.
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:47.720]   That's good.
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:48.720]   That works.
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:49.720]   We'll take it.
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:55.920]   I can add parts to his legs, I can then move his legs around.
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:00.920]   You can see how you can start to play around with exactly how this.
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.960]   You're building basically this creature.
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:06.840]   Then you go, "Okay, I want to bake that skeleton."
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:08.880]   It's going to sprain biogeal.
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:10.640]   This takes a while actually.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:11.640]   It's rendering it.
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:17.840]   The point is, is that what this lets you do is actually have a really easy way to build
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:19.680]   little creatures.
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:20.680]   It's just a lot of fun.
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:21.680]   My son.
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:22.680]   They're all symmetric.
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:24.840]   I found it hard to build anything too weird because it's so symmetric.
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:27.040]   I think you can actually turn the symmetric on.
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:28.040]   Symmetric on symmetry.
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:29.040]   Yeah.
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:30.800]   It's easier to get started.
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:33.400]   Yeah, it's a good starting point.
[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:36.200]   With being symmetrical because most of it will be.
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:38.000]   Then you can go in there and turn that off.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000]   You can paint.
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.640]   A lot of the sculpting tools from what they bought, Mudbox.
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:45.280]   A lot of the sculpting tools are found their way there.
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:46.720]   There's a lot of stuff.
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:50.720]   What's really interesting is that what they're doing, I think really well, if you look at
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:52.720]   this here, you can see you can start to...
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:56.520]   Let's see here if I want to sculpt.
[01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:57.520]   My battery's going low.
[01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:59.840]   I'll turn up the power so you can just kind of see it.
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:07.400]   You can start to see me sculpting this creature out.
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:11.520]   What they're doing is they're taking a lot of the technologies that Autodesk has acquired.
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:13.520]   You understand how sophisticated this is.
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:17.520]   To me, it's like it was very hard to do in an iPad.
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:20.320]   Yeah, it's quite a thing.
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:22.520]   It's quite a thing to be able to do this.
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:24.400]   Anyway, it's a lot of fun.
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:25.680]   It's a dollar and 99.
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:28.120]   It's iPad only.
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:31.320]   For dollar and 99, for less than a coffee, I would highly suggest giving it a shot.
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:32.320]   And then you can print.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.320]   Yeah, so one thing down.
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:34.320]   You can actually make a three...
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:35.520]   This is what I wanted to do.
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:36.520]   Have you ordered any objects for any?
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:37.520]   I'm not ordering any objects.
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:40.440]   This is what I wanted to take John and Simi and note by saying you really ought to order
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:42.440]   an object for next iPad today.
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:49.320]   You render it and then it goes to a service where you can actually get a physical model.
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:51.320]   You can design it and...
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:53.360]   You can paint it and all that stuff too.
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:54.800]   You gotta paint it, color it.
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:55.800]   Yeah.
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:56.800]   So you're son's been using this?
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:57.800]   Malachi?
[01:42:57.800 --> 01:42:58.800]   Malachi, I think it's awesome.
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:03.160]   He saw me playing with it and he started going in there and painting on it and putting
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:04.160]   it together.
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:05.160]   It's so cool.
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:06.160]   It's crazy.
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:07.160]   I look at my kids.
[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:11.680]   They're reality because they spend so much time playing around with the iPads.
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:17.200]   Being able to do this is just like, yeah, whatever, compared to when I grew up when I was trying...
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:19.640]   I was excited because I could get pixels to turn on.
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:20.640]   I'm like, "I don't know."
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:21.640]   It's so different.
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:22.640]   You know what it's like.
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:23.640]   You don't want to slide there.
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:24.640]   It's so amazing.
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:25.640]   You can't!
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:26.640]   You're not!
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:31.080]   You used to have to take a putty knife to play!
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:33.560]   We didn't have Boolean functions.
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:37.800]   We had to draw those polygons by hand in the Chanel walking backwards.
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:39.680]   One, two, three-D creature.
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:41.640]   Yeah, one, two, three-D creature.
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:44.840]   And you mentioned one, two, three catch before, which is really cool.
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:48.040]   Pretty much all the Autodesk iPad apps just go up, spend $10 a day.
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:49.040]   Some are free.
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:50.040]   Some are free.
[01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:51.040]   One, two, three-D catch is free.
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:52.040]   Yeah.
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:53.040]   But this one is not, $1.99.
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:55.120]   And you can see them all kind of slowly.
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:57.200]   Could find their way to working together.
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:44:02.960]   But Autodesk is just knocking it out of the park with the consumer apps.
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:05.080]   You just wouldn't expect it because what they're really known for is really high.
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:06.080]   Look at that.
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:08.080]   Could I do that?
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:09.080]   You could do that.
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:10.080]   They built those in there.
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:11.080]   You'd have to be pretty good.
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:12.080]   You could do it.
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:13.080]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:14.080]   Look at my son.
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:16.880]   The other thing is he could open you.
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:19.240]   So my son opened this crab.
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:21.320]   And then he went to town on the crab.
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:23.960]   So you can open that up and then keep on editing it.
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:24.960]   Existing ones.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:25.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:26.960]   And so it's really awesome.
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:29.120]   I love the idea that you can get a physical printout.
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:30.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:31.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:32.120]   Wow.
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:33.120]   Anyway, it is like Spore.
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:34.120]   A little bit more control.
[01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:35.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:36.120]   A little more control.
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:37.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:38.120]   One more control.
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:39.120]   It's a real thing.
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:40.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:45.800]   It is a really fun, slash useful app for the iPad called MyScript Calculator.
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:51.440]   It is a drawable math program that I just keep playing with and playing with and playing
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:52.440]   with.
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:55.960]   So if you want to do a calculation, let's say I want to find out what like 17 divided
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:45:02.160]   by five is you draw it on there and it will turn that into an actual solution.
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:03.920]   And then you can just keep adding to it.
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:06.280]   Actually, now I want the square root of that.
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:07.280]   Whoa.
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:08.280]   Nice.
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:12.840]   Times the cosine of, let's say, 42 degrees.
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:13.840]   Oh, wait.
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:16.160]   Did I say 42?
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:20.520]   I actually meant actually meant 13 degrees.
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:21.520]   Oh, wow.
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:22.520]   Great.
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:26.560]   And now that's like the angle that I want, but I need to I need to have.
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:29.200]   And it can even do like like math.
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:36.000]   So if I want to find out that times what equals a thousand or a thousand.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.440]   I'm running out of space here.
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:38.440]   Look at that.
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:41.720]   And the answer is 55.659.
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:43.640]   And that is really sweet.
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:44.640]   Yeah.
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:54.160]   I mean, it does it doesn't understand absolutely everything, but you can see again, you just
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:58.600]   keep messing around with this and messing around with this.
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:45:59.600]   I'm going to put it.
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:00.600]   It's Android.
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:02.880]   Also, I'm going to put it on my galaxy note because I could use the stylus with that.
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:03.880]   Yeah.
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:04.880]   I mean, it's cool.
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:11.960]   Hey, it's it's it really you download it because it's just plain fun type things and work with
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:13.360]   these things.
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:17.880]   But then you find out that I find that it's actually my go to calculator because I kind
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:20.360]   of prefer to do my application that way.
[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:25.120]   So if tapping it and then you find yourself in the situation where I actually do need
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:31.040]   to know if I want to chop this length of wood into X number of pieces, how long will
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:32.960]   each piece going to be?
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:37.040]   And then you'd swell one inch to write as a cut right as the as an equation, then just
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:40.840]   simply substitute in the variable that I want it will calculate the variable.
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:45.960]   And it means I no longer have to cross multiply and divide whenever I know a basic formula,
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:47.720]   but don't know goodness.
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:51.080]   It's it's fun and it's free and it acts and the thing actually works.
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:52.080]   It shouldn't be free.
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:53.080]   What are they?
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:54.080]   What are they thinking?
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:55.080]   It's fantastic.
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:56.080]   It's like finger painting with math.
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:57.080]   Yeah, I'm down.
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:02.800]   I look at I look at this app and I went I downloaded a couple of weeks ago and I just
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:06.040]   was like he should charge for this just to make sure that he makes lots of money at
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:07.040]   it.
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:10.600]   So he just keeps on making it cooler because I just he also makes a notepad app.
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:14.480]   Same guy, vision objects, my script memo.
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:15.880]   Interesting.
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:17.320]   And then they have they do have a paid app.
[01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:21.480]   So I guess the whole thing is to get you into the paid app at some point.
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:24.320]   Yeah, just does all of the above just just do it.
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:28.880]   Yeah, with this sucky app, it doesn't do anything remarkable at all.
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:30.600]   Wow.
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:33.600]   I want to try it as a notebook app.
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.960]   It's eight bucks for the notebook app.
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:40.000]   But then you can do other things in addition to the math.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.360]   Wow.
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:44.240]   And then the trial version is my script memo.
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:48.400]   Neat, vision objects is the company my script calculator.
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:49.400]   Install them all.
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:50.400]   They're fantastic.
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:51.400]   Yeah, really neat.
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:54.120]   Hey, I want to thank you all for being here.
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:56.400]   Renee Richie is from imore.com.
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:03.040]   Great site, a must read site for anybody who's into the Apple ecosystem and what's happening.
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:05.040]   Great place for rumors.
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:08.240]   And we have a bunch of iWatch stuff up and a bunch of other stuff up this week.
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:11.280]   Have you got any confirming details on the iWatch?
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:16.840]   I believe that it is going ahead that the project is moving forward.
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:18.440]   Wow.
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:20.040]   That is intriguing.
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:23.480]   Yeah, imore.com read more at imore.
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:25.040]   Alex Lindsey's with the Pixel Core.
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:29.120]   Hey, I posted one of my first pictures from our school in Rwanda.
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:30.120]   Oh, neat.
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:32.720]   Yeah, so we posted on my G+ page.
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:39.040]   And if you go up there and check it out, we are now using Google Hangouts to do classes.
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:45.120]   So we did our first class today where I teach from my house in Petaluma in Rwanda.
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:46.120]   What?
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:47.120]   Yeah, so we're doing--
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:48.680]   What time do you have to work if you're--
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:49.680]   It's easy, actually.
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:53.080]   It turns out 8 a.m. my time is 6 p.m. there.
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:54.080]   So it's actually a perfect--
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:55.080]   Look at there they are.
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:56.080]   Oh, man.
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:57.640]   That's so cool.
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:00.520]   And so, yeah, there they are.
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:02.600]   So that's there and the hangouts.
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:06.840]   They've got projectors there and they're able to ask questions and I can share my screen
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:07.840]   and show them what I'm doing working on.
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:09.320]   Now, this is your school.
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:10.320]   This is my school.
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:12.040]   This is my school in Rwanda.
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:13.040]   Exactly.
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:14.040]   Wow.
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:15.040]   So this is--
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:16.040]   Do they have some live instructors as well?
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:17.240]   Yeah, we have two live instructors down there.
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:18.240]   We have Ryan.
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:19.240]   Ryan, you old?
[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:21.240]   Ryan, you old down there.
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:22.240]   He's down there teaching.
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:23.240]   He's down there teaching.
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:27.360]   Remember when he was going, he had a little trepidation and now he says, "I'm never coming
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.360]   back."
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:29.360]   Yeah, it's good life.
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:30.360]   He's not loving.
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:31.360]   He's not loving.
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:32.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:33.360]   And Alfred is also down there.
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:41.560]   So there's-- so anyway, that was our first test of running a class in Rwanda from here
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:43.240]   and we're going to be doing it pretty often.
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:47.040]   So what were the ideas that give them videos, video training and they'll do the training
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:49.640]   and then we'll have discussions about what they did and everything else.
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:50.640]   So we're pretty excited about it.
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:51.640]   So check it out.
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:55.080]   Pixelcore.com and of course follow Alex at Alex Lindsey.
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:56.080]   Alex Lindsey.
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:59.320]   If you're interested in that distance learning and all the stuff that we're doing there,
[01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:03.400]   just follow me on Twitter, Alex Lindsey or on all the pictures in real posts will be
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:04.400]   on G+.
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:05.400]   L-I-N-D-S-A-Y.
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:06.560]   Hey, why?
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:12.400]   And Enoco writes with the Chicago Sun Times what you're working on right now.
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:20.320]   I'll probably have a post about the Apple kerfuffle today in some way to perform sometime
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:21.320]   tonight.
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:26.920]   And I've also got a couple of things in the pipeline that are just sort of clearing out
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:30.960]   old reviews that I killed off on to learn more stuff about.
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:34.400]   But now the clock is definitely running down and it's like nobody really wants to know
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:38.560]   that the Palm pre, maybe I still don't really know how I feel about it but I should probably
[01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:40.040]   review it sooner rather than later.
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:41.040]   The Palm pre.
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.040]   The original one, the pre-minus.
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:44.040]   Yes.
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:45.040]   There's a new one?
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:46.040]   Oh, I'm coming back.
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:51.080]   How much time I spent photographing that over the weekend?
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:52.080]   You just can't win.
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:57.160]   I hear there's something coming along called the trio that is just going to blow you away.
[01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:00.400]   To think HTC was making trios for a while and now look at them.
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:01.400]   They're struggling.
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:02.400]   They're dying.
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:06.120]   Although I have to say they showed the new HTC One which looks like a very nice phone
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:08.720]   and clearly calls out to the iPhone 5.
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:09.720]   It's metal.
[01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:12.240]   It has that kind of look and feel to it.
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:14.120]   The double press in the home but yeah.
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:16.000]   I was blogging for Android Central this morning.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.600]   They needed more hands because they had events in New York and it London at the same time.
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:21.600]   So I was writing HTC One stories.
[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:22.600]   It's phone season.
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:25.720]   We're going to see lots of new phones including S4 in March.
[01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:31.480]   The thing I find interesting and I, this might explain why Apple was slow to go to 8 megapixels.
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:36.420]   This new HTC One is a 4 megapixel camera and what they're saying is this megapixel
[01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:41.480]   race has been bad for phone photography because the sensor sizes aren't getting bigger.
[01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:45.320]   So the pixel sizes are getting smaller which means they're not as good and it's better
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:47.400]   to stay with a 4 megapixel.
[01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:48.400]   Two microns.
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:50.400]   Yeah, so it's only a micron.
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:55.440]   It's an 8 megapixel sensor that down samples down to 4 because it uses light value from
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:56.440]   4 pixels.
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:57.440]   It gives you better low light.
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:58.440]   They have built in hardware image stabilization.
[01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:00.160]   This is going to be very intriguing.
[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:05.400]   I would love, I think the real race, one of the real races is in camera phones.
[01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:08.240]   I think it's camera phones and I think it's light sensitivity not resolution.
[01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:09.960]   I think that this definitely.
[01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:11.680]   Just better pictures.
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:16.280]   I mean that's, we're about to start a whole new show but yeah.
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:17.520]   Now everybody has LTE.
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:19.080]   Now everybody has a large screen.
[01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:21.960]   Now everybody has like multi-core processors.
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:24.920]   There's we're running out of things that they can put into a camera that will cause a
[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:29.160]   someone who's testing out a new phone to say, "Wow, I want the phone that will do that."
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:36.160]   And it really is the way that the Lumia 920 absolutely humiliates the iPhone 5 and low
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:37.640]   light in so many situations.
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:42.320]   That's like there is a failure point that Apple needs to address with the iPhone 6.
[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:43.320]   Blur and grain.
[01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:44.320]   Those are the two things.
[01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:50.400]   There's also a 1080p 7.7 inch 468 PPI display on that thing.
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:52.000]   Yeah, that's what I'm interested in.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.120]   I don't need a, I want a high res screen.
[01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:55.320]   I don't necessarily need a bigger screen.
[01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:58.040]   I have a bigger screen with my note but it's not that high of a resolution.
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:01.440]   I'm just, I'm just curious to see if I'm going to need to get rid of kurtami surgery.
[01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:02.440]   Yes.
[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:05.280]   I just appreciate the increase in resolution.
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:06.280]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:11.840]   We do Mac break weekly on Tuesday mornings, 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time 1900 UTC.
[01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:14.240]   If you want to watch live, it'd be great to have you.
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:20.000]   Just tune in Twit.tv but we do make on demand versions after the fact available wherever
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:26.800]   you can download shows including Twit.tv/mbw so you don't have to miss an episode audio
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:28.800]   and video on demand.
[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:29.800]   Hey, thanks everybody for being here.
[01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:30.800]   We'll see you next time.
[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:31.800]   Now get back to work.
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:32.800]   Great time is over.
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:47.520]   [Music]
