[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.540]   What will Apple announce?
[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.480]   The judge inadvertently gave out some secrets in the Touch
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.220]   Disease case and Apple's iOS 11.4.
[00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.080]   It's out.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.920]   What's new?
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.380]   We'll talk about it next.

[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.260]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show a week over the
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.060]   latest news from Apple.
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.380]   And there's news from Apple.
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.940]   Yes, indeed.
[00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.860]   Renee Ritchie is here from iMore.com.
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.700]   And the Vector Podcast, Renee joins us every week from
[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.020]   his studio in Montreal, where he records about eight
[00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.260]   podcasts a day.
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.620]   Hi, Renee.
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.060]   Hi, Leo.
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.940]   I seem to be laggy.
[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:43.660]   I apologize.
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.700]   Maybe it's all the airplay too.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.140]   You know how I know?
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.300]   Because the frame rate of your Apple TV screen saver has
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.580]   gone down.
[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.660]   Ah, intolerable.
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.540]   Also, Renee and I go to the chica of the
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.900]   Celestial Waste of Ban with.
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.300]   That's what I was saying.
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.020]   You can tell that there's sort of a behind the scenes beef.
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.580]   If I have a screen behind me that's just doing random
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.380]   static just to kill the frame, just to kill the
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.100]   compression rate on the screen.
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.220]   Just to drive us crazy.
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.860]   Yeah.
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.660]   No, I like your Japanese paper screens.
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.740]   That's good.
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.220]   That's a good one.
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.500]   It also makes you not see what a slob I might work
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.020]   desk is.
[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.660]   Well, we can kind of see through the crack.
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.300]   I hate to tell you.
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.580]   There's a little gap.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.820]   Mind the gap.
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.460]   Also with--
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.460]   Oh, no, no.
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.140]   I'm absolutely--
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.140]   I'm a tidy adult.
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.420]   Don't need some to clean up after me.
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.980]   That's the beauty of video is that you can control the frame
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.740]   and make sure that you don't see anything outside the frame.
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.020]   Also here, Alex Lindsay in studio.
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.660]   He's working on a 3D model of me that will allow me to
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.340]   phone the show in soon.
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.260]   We're getting close.
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.820]   We've been really impressive.
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.620]   I'll put this up.
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.540]   We'll talk about it later.
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.940]   Yeah.
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.180]   That's been working on digitizing you for what?
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.500]   15 years now, since.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.260]   At first, the first time you did it, I think, was in Canada.
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.820]   No, it was in the old--
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.180]   The old screen savers.
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.980]   The old screen savers.
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.820]   You used a magic marker to put dots on my face.
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.980]   Right?
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.820]   So that you had points.
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.260]   Right.
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.020]   You had to do it all by hand.
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.980]   Now I just had a phone look at you.
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.740]   And it took a long time, a lot of pictures.
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.980]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.460]   Then in here, he did it with a few seconds with an iPhone
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.900]   10 because of the cameras in the front.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.740]   That's pretty-- the depth sensor in the front.
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.700]   Hey, speaking of iPhone 10, iOS 11.4 got pushed hours ago.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.260]   And a big-- actually, it's funny, just two, but two very
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.700]   important feature updates.
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.460]   Renee, Richie, I know you've been working on AirPlay too.
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.140]   Tell us about it.
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.820]   So these are features that were originally announced back
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.580]   at WWDC 2017, just to give some timeline to it.
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.140]   And they did in-ship.
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.580]   And there were reasons for that.
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.780]   Apple kept testing iMessage sync, for example, and kept
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.180]   testing AirPlay too.
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.820]   And they ended up with a lot of edge cases.
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.580]   They weren't anticipating, like, what if people had these
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.460]   speakers set up?
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.660]   What are your expected behavior?
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.300]   If someone else tries to do it, how should it--
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.220]   so it ended up being a much bigger project than they
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.340]   thought it would be.
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.460]   But it was in beta testing internally at Apple for the
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.340]   last few months.
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.820]   And they've pushed it out now.
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.020]   And in essence, AirPlay too takes the same functionality
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.500]   as AirPlay, the ability to beam content from your iPhone,
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.700]   your iPad, your Mac, your Apple TV, to an AirPlay
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.620]   receiver, the HomePod.
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.860]   Other AirPlay devices speakers have the technology built in.
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.300]   And the new update lets you do both paired devices.
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.380]   So if you have two AirPods, you compare them.
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.180]   One becomes left, one becomes right.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.740]   And then they fill a much bigger space with the same sort
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.460]   of computational audio.
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.860]   They work as a unit to make sure that everything is
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.300]   balanced out and that you have bias towards the left side
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.180]   towards the right side and a bigger sound stage.
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.100]   And also lets you do multi-room audio, which a lot of people
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.060]   are familiar with already from Sonos.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.820]   But basically it means you can sit there and say, I want
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.260]   Chuck D playing in the bedroom and the score from greatest
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.100]   show playing in the living room and just have it exactly the
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.100]   way you want it.
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.700]   Or, and the more challenging thing is had the same thing
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.060]   played in multi-rooms without having lag make it sound
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.420]   like you're in an echo chamber.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.020]   That's really the challenge, I think.
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.700]   Absolutely.
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.140]   So it has to listen and time and make sure that everything
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.140]   stays in sync, which is why AirPlay produces a
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.140]   bit of it.
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.140]   I think there's a two second delay once you start playing it
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.980]   and that lets it play around with the time to make sure
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.980]   everything stays in sync.
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:22.980]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.620]   So is this something that other speakers are taking advantage
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.900]   of or will they will have to get new speakers or they'll have
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.540]   to get an update to take advantage of?
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.540]   It's unclear.
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.260]   In some cases they're probably going to be stuck on AirPlay
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.620]   one because either the manufacturer, they're old enough
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.380]   that the manufacturer is no longer supporting them or they
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.780]   never built in an update feature.
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.780]   Is it a hard?
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.460]   Does it require hardware updates?
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.460]   It's as far as I know it's software.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.460]   Okay.
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.420]   So there are many cases where they're running a Bluetooth
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.020]   modem that doesn't support it.
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.620]   Bluetooth radio doesn't support it.
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.540]   Hopefully that's minimal stuff where they're not
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.540]   Wi-Fi.
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.540]   There could always be something.
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.940]   But I think in most cases if they make a software update
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.740]   available, it will be software updateable.
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.020]   I don't expect many will though, Leo.
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.300]   I mean, it's not a great history of accessories that you
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.780]   bought being upgradable.
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.780]   Yeah.
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.260]   You can also control AirPlay from the control center now.
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.100]   AirPlay 2 from the control center.
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.860]   What new controls are there going to be?
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.460]   So it depends on what you're doing.
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.460]   If you have a stereo pair, that presents itself as one unit.
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.460]   So you don't see AirPlay left and AirPlay right.
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.340]   You just see the AirPod pair now.
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.540]   So whatever room it's in or whatever name you give it.
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.740]   Like one of my AirPods is R2 and one is BB8.
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.980]   But I just see the HomePod pairing now.
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.860]   If you have them in different rooms, then you'll see the
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.900]   different AirPods for the different rooms and you'll
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.260]   target them separately or similarly.
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.900]   Although I wonder how many people are like you and have
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.260]   multiple HomePods?
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.260]   Very few.
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.260]   I mean, $250.
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.940]   And they just announced availability for Canada, France,
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.820]   and Germany and the Canadian price.
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.980]   Exchange is what it is.
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.140]   But when you still see it, you get the sticker shock of $450.
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.020]   So it's probably a very minimal market now.
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.940]   But it's a technology that Apple can grow with for the
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:55.700]   next several years.
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.620]   It's so funny because this week Lisa discovered our HomePod.
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.140]   I mean, it's been sitting in our kitchen since it came out.
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.780]   But she's something about it that she just really likes.
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.780]   And she says, I want one for my office.
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.220]   But now that means if you want to use stereo pairs or
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.420]   multi-room, you have to have one for each room for
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.860]   stereo and one.
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.420]   So one by itself is not mono.
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.620]   That's a common misconception.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.060]   One by itself will still take all the channels available to
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.740]   it, analyze all the data it has, and give you the biggest
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.580]   sound stage possible.
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.500]   With two of them, though, you have two speakers to sort of
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.540]   make a bigger, more nuanced sound stage.
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.020]   Yes.
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.860]   You don't require them.
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.260]   One speaker cannot do stereo.
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.540]   However much computation you're doing, there's this much
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.860]   separation.
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.420]   So you need to have separate physical separate walls.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.500]   What their trick is, is they bounce off a wall.
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.260]   What have you put like six of them in there?
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.340]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.540]   Because that was the implication.
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.580]   Will it be more nuanced?
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.180]   If I just start adding--
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.380]   Would they announce that I would have--
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.260]   That you could have multiple, you know, many of them.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.660]   Not that I would do that.
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.340]   You can't have multiple-- I haven't tried a
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.580]   trinary pairing yet.
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.900]   Because there's multi-room, you can have them function as
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.060]   multi-room speakers.
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:07.940]   I don't know if you get this.
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.180]   I don't think they'll start splitting things into like
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.980]   Adobe 6.1 or 7.1 stereo system fashion, but they will
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.180]   sort of modulate for their environment.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.500]   I really think the bigger deal is being able to do
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.580]   multi-room.
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:25.820]   Because if you have a budget of $700 for a pair of stereo
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.380]   speakers, wow, can you do so much better than any smart
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.220]   speaker that I've ever seen.
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.140]   Even a cheap pair of--
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.780]   excuse me, a budget pair of good speakers that go for $300
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.380]   bucks a pair plus a halfway decent $300 ramp, I think,
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.660]   will fill a room, give you better presence, give you
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:47.260]   better base than either the Google Home or the HomePod.
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.860]   But the real cool thing is when you realize that the
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.660]   reason why you've been cranking up a speaker in one
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.660]   place is because you also want to hear it as you're
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.780]   shaving in the bathroom.
[00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.660]   Or you've got like--
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.620]   the kitchen goes off the family room and you want--
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.140]   you're cooking, you want to hear the same music.
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.340]   And so once you have the ability to simply say, I'm
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.100]   going to have one smart speaker in the bathroom, one
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.060]   smart speaker in the living room, one smart speaker in the
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.060]   kitchen.
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.020]   And that's when you realize that you didn't have to crank
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.820]   it up to 11 and all the time, you just needed a speaker
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.420]   within close proximity.
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.620]   So this is why it's going to be even more exciting.
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.780]   I think people are going to buy a lot more interested in
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.860]   the $350 HomePod if and when Apple figures out how to
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.980]   package that in $100, $150 package.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.180]   Something that is not in the featured spot in your house
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.620]   is just that, again, I want this sound to extend into my
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.780]   living room-- excuse me-- into my kitchen or someplace else.
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.860]   Nothing has sold more Google Home speakers in my house
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.380]   than having multiple groups set up and having one group.
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.140]   And basically, again, being able to fill the entire place
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.180]   with music without entertaining this people in the street
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.380]   outside.
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.820]   The really cool thing is there may be an Apple HomePod mini
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.340]   in the works, but there also AirPlay 2 is a technology that
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.420]   they're willing to license out.
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.060]   So you don't have to get a $350 HomePod necessarily.
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.740]   You might just get a small AirPlay speaker for the bathroom
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.740]   that you don't need to have all the functionality or a
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.100]   Beats pill that has the AirPlay 2 stuff built into it in the
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.220]   party room or something.
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.060]   You can almost mix and match to make exactly the capability
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.740]   and vendor probably that you want for the different setups.
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.540]   So you also could do a handoff.
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.420]   So Apple says you can say, move this music into the living
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.420]   room, and it will just move it over to the-- if you have
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.820]   HomeBods in multiple locations.
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.740]   And Sonos does it right now.
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.580]   I mean, that's what I have at the house.
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.820]   But you can't talk to your Sonos.
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.380]   But you can't talk to it.
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.420]   Well, you sure it can.
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.060]   I have the one with an echo in it, but it doesn't do much.
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:48.620]   Right.
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.460]   It doesn't do a lot of the things echoes do.
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.380]   No, I mean, I think that Sonos does it now, but it's
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.700]   definitely not as advanced.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.300]   I have.
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.140]   It's nice to be able to build--
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.460]   I mean, my experience is mostly Sonos because I've got a
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.020]   bunch of them throughout the house.
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:02.580]   And it's--
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.980]   And I use Sonos with echoes.
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.300]   You decide you want to go through it.
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.140]   With echoes, you can do it because you could say, listen to
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.460]   Lord on my bathroom Sonos, and it'll play through that
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:17.060]   bathroom Sonos, or everywhere, which is nice, or in my
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:17.820]   bedroom group.
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.700]   But do we think that Sonos will be competitive, I guess,
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.020]   over time?
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:27.180]   I think the play five speakers are as good as the HomePod.
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.260]   They don't have all the fancy multi-directional drivers
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:30.820]   and all of that.
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.740]   But I think it's as good as a HomePod.
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.660]   And so--
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.580]   I like being able to design--
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.420]   Mine are all just the controllers that go back to
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:38.820]   speakers.
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.340]   Right.
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.220]   So that's the best way.
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.220]   So there's a stack of great speakers, right?
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:42.820]   Yeah.
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.380]   Exactly.
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.900]   All right, so you could play music at the same time in
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:46.540]   multiple rooms.
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.700]   You can control your audio system through your house.
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.500]   You can use Siri to move stuff around.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:58.100]   The lock screen, control center, all are now
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.980]   AirPlay 2 enabled.
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.060]   You could take a call--
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:01.780]   this is another one.
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.700]   This is from the Apple Notes.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.500]   Take a call or play a game on your phone without
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.620]   interrupting playback on your speakers.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.660]   I didn't know that that was a problem.
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.900]   So if I'm playing back on AirPlay and I get a phone call,
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.780]   the speakers stop playing music, I guess that makes sense.
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:18.580]   Yeah, the old version.
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.140]   The old version.
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.740]   Now they will continue to play.
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:25.740]   HomePod pairs, left, right automatically sense their
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.940]   location, the room balance the sound based on locations.
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.940]   Beamforming provides a wider sound stage, bouncing off the
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.220]   walls.
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.500]   And HomePods will automatically update.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.660]   And less updates are disabled in the Home app.
[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:40.180]   So there you go.
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.420]   That's AirPlay 2.
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.980]   Let's talk about messages in iCloud because actually, this
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.940]   is something a lot of people have wanted.
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.180]   Something you've had with most other messaging apps, if they
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.060]   have desktop support, multi-phone support, a Facebook
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.740]   messenger for sure.
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.580]   So what does Messages in iCloud do for you, Renee?
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.140]   So it's a little bit different.
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.340]   And first, it's opt in.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.580]   I believe it's off by default.
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.340]   Yeah, you have an article on how to turn it on.
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.460]   So that's something people should--
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.140]   So the previous model of iMessage was in many ways
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.820]   constrained by Apple security model.
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.820]   And there was all sorts of annoyances that came with that,
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.700]   including groups that fractured because one person didn't
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.700]   have the other person's email address but had their phone
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.540]   number or vice versa into it.
[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.140]   And they wouldn't allow you to see that contact because that
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.060]   was leaking information.
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.720]   So there's all sorts of design decisions that were based
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.460]   around security.
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.700]   And one of them was that it didn't sync messages because in
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.380]   order to maintain the end-to-end encryption, what it would
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.420]   do was try to deliver a unique version of that message to
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.780]   every device for 10 days.
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.020]   And if it couldn't deliver it, it would just stop trying.
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.780]   So what you had on a device depended on that unique version
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.220]   of the message getting there.
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.660]   And now what Apple has built out is a secure version of iCloud,
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.340]   basically, which is built on CloudKit that handles the
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.980]   encryption end-to-end within that infrastructure.
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.900]   And the messages now go there where they're centralized and
[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:57.940]   then synced sunk, synced across all your various devices.
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.980]   So they stay connected.
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.940]   And that means that if you delete it on one device,
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.260]   previously it was not deleted on other ones because, again,
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.860]   each of them had a unique copy.
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.980]   But now it'll start doing things like making sure all the
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.380]   messages are in the same place.
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.500]   If you delete them, it'll delete them across.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.180]   If you're used to the old behavior, there will be some
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:13.940]   sort of changes.
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.980]   You'll have to make just your own thought process.
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.100]   But in all, it'll make sure it's just like an iMac email box.
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.340]   Every message you have in one device is mirrored across all
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:21.940]   your devices.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.460]   And any changes you make are mirrored across those devices
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.020]   as well.
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.620]   >> So contrary to what you might think, this is not a
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:29.780]   setting in messages.
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.220]   I was looking for messages that couldn't find it.
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:37.100]   Go to Settings, tap your head, and then go to iCloud.
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.780]   And now there's a new on/off switch in messages.
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.380]   And as you can see, by default, it's off.
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.940]   So if I turn this on on my iPad, will it turn it on?
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.340]   Everywhere I have 11.4 installed?
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.620]   >> I haven't actually tried that.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.340]   But what it should do is take the contents of your messages
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.340]   on that iPad and suck them up into the secure iCloud--
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:55.540]   >> OK.
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.060]   >> Secure Cloud Kit infrastructure, and then make sure
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.660]   those messages are balanced across other devices.
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.500]   >> So once you get 11.4, if you want to use iCloud messaging,
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.020]   and I think most people will want to, if you have multiple
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.980]   Apple devices, that seems to me a no-brainer, then you'll
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.820]   want to go into your iCloud settings, which you get to
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:16.260]   be tapping on your head.
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.420]   >> Whatever it is you have is great if you just tap on your head.
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.420]   >> And they did test it.
[00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.220]   I mean, one of the reasons it took so long is that they kept
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.140]   testing it to make sure that you didn't--
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.300]   because data destruction is an end break, is a game breaker
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.060]   for this kind of stuff.
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.140]   Sorry, it's your breaker.
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.140]   So they would test it and make sure nobody lost messages
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.340]   or nobody unintentionally deleted them, or they didn't lose
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.620]   state, and all those things.
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.260]   And now they would put it in the beta, and then take it out
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.660]   of the release, and put it in the beta, and keep testing it
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.780]   until they were sure it was as rock solid as they could.
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.420]   >> So the thing that we're--
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.100]   I guess I'll test because I've installed I-114 on my iPad,
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.620]   and I'm doing it right now on my iPhone, is whether it will
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.980]   merge the messages from the different devices into one big
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:55.500]   iPhone.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.900]   >> It should have a unified set of conversations when you're
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:58.100]   fine.
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.500]   >> That would be nice.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.660]   That would be nice.
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.460]   Oh, see, it won't.
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.340]   It says, "Update an iCloud pause.
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.540]   Plug in your device and connect to Wi-Fi.
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.340]   It won't do it unless you're plugged in--
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.740]   even though this has a 75% sent charge, it won't do it
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.700]   unless you're plugged in and connected to Wi-Fi."
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.180]   That's ridiculous.
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.220]   >> It usually does.
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.700]   It usually does.
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.220]   It might think that once in a while it believes that an
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.180]   update is big enough that if it drains you of power,
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.180]   something really bad will happen.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:22.780]   >> This isn't the update.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.380]   >> And that'll let the iCloud message upload.
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.260]   >> Interesting.
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.220]   I've been honest since the beta.
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:28.980]   I don't recall that.
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:29.980]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.180]   So, well, I turned it on, as you saw in my settings, and I
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.820]   went to Messages, and it says, "Updating to iCloud paused.
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.740]   Plug in your device and connect to Wi-Fi.
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.460]   I am on Wi-Fi."
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.100]   But that's fine.
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:41.940]   I'm not in a big hurry.
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.460]   >> I think they did that for photos.
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.540]   And they do that initially for apps as well when you're
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.380]   thinking in your device.
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.300]   It might just be that much--
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.540]   >> I guess it could be years worth of messages, right?
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:50.540]   I mean, if you keep it--
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.180]   >> Some people have gig-- I mean, some people have gig--
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.420]   my mom sends me, like, eight or nine different bitmoji
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.940]   every morning, and I'm sure there's, like, eight gigs in my--
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.380]   >> Well, that's something to be aware of, too.
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.820]   If you have iCloud storage and you're paying for it, you
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.140]   may not have enough or it may fill it up suddenly.
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:05.900]   >> It's also local.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.620]   It takes up a lot of people's local device storage.
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.460]   So previously, they would be like, best practice would be to
[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.580]   delete a lot of old messages.
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.340]   And some of them auto expire now, too.
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.780]   Content to make it more helpful.
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.940]   But a lot of people have just gigs of stuff in there.
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.780]   >> Wow.
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.620]   There is a new version of TVOS as well.
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.380]   Does this-- is this related?
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.020]   Is this--
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.540]   >> Yeah, so in order to use AirPlay 2, you have to update
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.540]   your iPhone, for example, to 11.4.
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.100]   Then you have to update your HomePod.
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.780]   It will do it automatically, but you can go into the Home app,
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.700]   tap on Software Updates and force the update.
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.940]   In order to use the AirPlay 2 on the Apple TV, you have to
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.500]   update to TVOS 11.4 as well.
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:45.020]   And all your devices have to get all of today's updates.
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.020]   Nothing for the Mac yet.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.660]   Sadly, there's no AirPlay 2.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.140]   Mac already has multi-room capabilities, but it's not
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.060]   specifically getting AirPlay 2 yet.
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.060]   >> Oh, interesting.
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.500]   Unfortunately, I started the update on--
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.060]   I had all the notes.
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.900]   Apple really should fix this.
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.300]   Before you do the update, you can read all the notes about
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:02.940]   what's in the update.
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.700]   But as soon as you do the update, those notes are gone.
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.700]   >> Yeah, remember they do.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.300]   They used to do an animated thing where it would come up and
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.340]   say, "While we're updating, here's everything that's new and
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.420]   exciting about it."
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.300]   >> And I can't find it on the Apple support pages.
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.180]   >> It was a bit of a morning, Leo, because one publication
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.260]   put it up on Eastern Time instead of Central Time.
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.540]   It was three hours early.
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.340]   And then it took it down, and then somebody else put it up,
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.540]   and then everybody decided to put it up.
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.180]   But the update wasn't ready, but all the articles were
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.860]   written as though they were ready.
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.340]   So it was so boring.
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.420]   >> Okay, so you have the notes.
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.580]   I'm sure you cut and paste them and did something smart
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.140]   and kept them around.
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:35.660]   >> I do.
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.020]   >> There's more than just AirPlay 2 and messages in the cloud.
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.460]   Those are the two big marquee features, but tell us about
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.380]   some of the other features.
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.060]   >> I don't, sadly, I don't have them in front of me.
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.740]   >> See, I thought you would have the notes, and I had them,
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.700]   and then unfortunately it started installing and they're gone.
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.900]   >> They have the usual plethora of security and hands.
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:52.940]   Security fixes.
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.420]   >> There's this scary stuff, but there were some other new
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.380]   features too, which they're not getting a lot of coverage,
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.100]   unfortunately.
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.180]   >> Yeah, the big.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.700]   >> Apple support note doesn't talk about it.
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.180]   >> Mm.
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.420]   >> Yes, yes, Mr. Naco.
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.980]   The added a couple of things just to support all the classroom
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:07.980]   features that they introduced.
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.380]   >> Classroom, that was it.
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:09.860]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.380]   >> So basically now teachers, they're using the classroom
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.700]   app can now use iBooks as part of the curriculum,
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.940]   use that to monitor what they're reading, that sort of stuff.
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.100]   >> That's nice.
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.020]   >> Nice of them.
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.620]   >> Yeah, I'm looking at the--
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.180]   >> You got the notes.
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:30.460]   >> No, no, I'm looking at the press release for my inbox.
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.620]   >> Oh, there you go.
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.340]   >> Because I haven't installed it yet, but I have to say
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:38.860]   that Joanna Stern has the best take so far because she was
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.260]   highlighting in the boilerplate where it's like,
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.300]   and you can do so many other things with it, like set a timer
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.700]   and Joanna's like, really--
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:51.300]   can we do more than one timer finally on with Siri?
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.300]   It's like, we're having such--
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:52.980]   >> That's funny.
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:54.740]   That's funny.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.460]   So yeah, it's probably a worthwhile thing to get.
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.740]   I don't know specifically if it's just--
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.020]   >> Oh, there is, I believe it.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:04.020]   It's either 11, 3, or 11, 4 that will alert you if a website
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.700]   asks you for your username and password,
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.300]   and they're not on HTTP.
[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.620]   I don't remember because I've been on the beta
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.740]   since the launch, but is it-- is it 11.3 or 11.4
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.460]   made that change, which is really helpful?
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.100]   Some people are upset with Chrome because it'll alert you
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.820]   no matter what, if you're on an HTTP connection,
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.780]   and some people believe that breaks the web because the,
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.220]   you know, old web pages and archives and the web should be
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.340]   free and people shouldn't have to have an HTTPS certificate.
[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.340]   So what Apple's doing instead is it will only alert you
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.420]   if it asks for your credentials and the connection
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:32.020]   is insecure.
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.500]   >> I think that's the right way to do it, but of course,
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.100]   because Google says this is going to impact your search
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:41.340]   listings, they're using their strong arm to force everybody
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.500]   to go to HTTPS.
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.500]   We had to-- now the good news is, for a lot of simple sites,
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.100]   you can use Let's Encrypt and it's free.
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.180]   And I agree, HTTPS is a good thing.
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.900]   The web should have been designed that way from the first
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.540]   place, but it is a bit of a burden on everybody.
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.300]   We had to do it.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:02.940]   We had to pay for certs, HTTPS certs for the Tech Guy Labs
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.340]   site and the Twitch site.
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:05.740]   >> It's not--
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.700]   >> A lot of archival sites that just aren't maintained
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.940]   and are never going to get that update.
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.620]   And now they're going to warn people that they're insecure
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.980]   and will cause a lot of confusion.
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.260]   >> Yeah, I mean, what I think the unintended consequences,
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.860]   people are going to start ignoring those warnings.
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:18.300]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.300]   >> Yes.
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.180]   >> And that's exactly what you don't want.
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.820]   >> Well, it's also-- remember that a lot of these unattended
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.260]   sites might be running like old versions of a CMS, old
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.020]   versions of WordPress might have had--
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.460]   might have had code injected into them.
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.260]   So I don't think there's a right way to do it.
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.100]   I think that Apple's way is probably better in the long run
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.620]   just for the reasons that you say the more false--
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.100]   the more false positives you get, the less likely it is.
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.540]   You are to respond to a honking car alarm by calling the police.
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.420]   But there's a bunch of different ways to navigate this.
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:46.940]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.620]   Yeah.
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.780]   So when you move stuff to iCloud, does it move it off
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.540]   of your device messages?
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.900]   >> No, I believe it's still-- everything that is local
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.260]   to the device will stay local.
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.900]   Apple typically uses what they call--
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.740]   they don't call it this.
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.500]   It's called Nearline, which means that the things that
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.740]   are more recent and frequent are stored locally,
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.580]   and the things that are older and infrequent
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:08.580]   are stored on the cloud.
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:12.500]   But I haven't seen any large-scale imestage reduction
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.540]   in storage capacity yet.
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.620]   >> That's too bad, because your mom would benefit, right?
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.860]   >> I would, because she's the one sending you all those pictures.
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.380]   >> Oh.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.180]   There was a story a while ago about bringing messaging--
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.460]   I think it was Google brought messaging to India,
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.860]   and everyone immediately started sending everybody 10
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:29.580]   good morning messages.
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:30.900]   They started running out on bandwidth.
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.180]   >> It never expected-- that's what my family's been like
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.100]   for years ago.
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.740]   My sister and my mom is just-- it's like that.
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.540]   >> This comes from an Indian family.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.580]   Many people don't know.
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.300]   All right, well, the good news is it's a small update.
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.180]   It downloads quickly and installs quickly.
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.380]   So it's already--
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.780]   >> And still, what we're interesting
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.580]   is they got it out ahead of WWDC.
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.980]   It's one of those things where they clear the deck.
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.020]   So they have-- because the keynote has already chalk a block.
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:56.540]   So--
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.300]   >> That's a very good one.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.780]   >> --you want to get all the old stuff out of the way
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.300]   before the new stuff kicks in.
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.660]   So just to give-- you know, follow up here,
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.740]   messages in the iCloud is not turned on on the phone.
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.580]   So you will have to turn it on in every device
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.180]   that you want it on.
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.580]   That's a per device setting, not a global setting
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.500]   for your iCloud.
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.780]   >> So you're involved in illegitimate chocolates muggling.
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:16.940]   You don't want any trail.
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.900]   >> Yeah, no, I think that makes sense.
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.540]   You probably-- that's exactly right.
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:22.420]   You don't necessarily want everything moved up
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.020]   to the cloud on every device.
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:25.380]   I do.
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.220]   I would like everything to be unified.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.140]   And that's the other thing.
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.980]   I'm curious if it will propagate messages
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:34.740]   that were only on my iPad over.
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.500]   >> Does.
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.500]   I'll double check that, but I believe it does.
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.180]   >> Good.
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.980]   All right, there's 11.4.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:47.060]   And you can get it now for iOS, for iPad and iPhone.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.540]   There is a TVOS update.
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.060]   Is there a watch update as well?
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:50.540]   Is that coming?
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:51.500]   >> Yeah.
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:51.940]   >> There is.
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.500]   Everything's updated.
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.020]   >> I don't think the Mac update is live yet.
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.340]   I'll have to double check, but it wasn't live.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.580]   >> Oh, there'll be a Mac update too, OK.
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.180]   I believe the Mac update is coming too.
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.700]   But sometimes that's a little bit later.
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.620]   >> That does kind of imply that we're not
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.260]   that we were expecting to see new hardware at WWDC.
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.780]   But if there was new hardware that
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.820]   required new operating system updates,
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.700]   they probably would have held the new OS until then.
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.780]   So it's another data point to against if you're--
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:16.500]   >> Oh, that's interesting.
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:21.100]   >> If you're waiting for a new iPod in June.
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.300]   >> OK, so maybe not new iOS devices,
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.580]   but they are holding onto the Mac OS update.
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:27.620]   >> So--
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.580]   >> I would still suspect iPad is probably
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.660]   one of the more likely updates for Dub Dub.
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:32.620]   >> You think they'll be in it?
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:33.220]   See, I would--
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:33.700]   >> They could slip.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.300]   I mean, it's so hard to tell because so many things
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.340]   slip these days, but it just seems like we had the iPads
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:42.460]   and Skylake, Macs last year, so we could have the A11 iPads
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:43.940]   and Coffee Lake.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.340]   Again, Intel may have announced three other processor
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:51.140]   optimizations since then, but Coffee Lake, Macbooks, and iMacs.
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.540]   >> So this is--
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:55.980]   actually, and we'll be streaming this live Monday, 10 AM.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.140]   If you want to come in, Alex, if you're around,
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.420]   I think you're out of town, aren't you?
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:00.420]   >> I'm out of town.
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:00.780]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.420]   I don't wonder where he's going.
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.820]   >> So--
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.380]   >> Yeah, I'm sure it's Cleveland.
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.740]   So we will-- I think--
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.660]   so, OK, so we were talking about this in iOS today
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.580]   this morning, and I maybe have gave Megan some bad advice,
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.580]   because I said, I don't think they'll be an iPad update.
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.060]   You think there will be?
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.980]   >> I think-- again, there's so much of this stuff
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.300]   has slipped to the fall lately that I would never
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.900]   bet money on it, but I also would never
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.700]   buy something right before the ladies.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.980]   >> I think, and then actually, you need to order some equipment.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:29.820]   That's what we need.
[00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.140]   >> Yeah, yeah, I want to be sure, Leo, you've got to buy it.
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.140]   >> Just to set this all up.
[00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.180]   >> Well, I know the thing I'm waiting for is a MacBook Pro
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.300]   with a real keyboard.
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:37.940]   >> You don't want to--
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.700]   >> I want this 15-inch--
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:40.220]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:44.500]   >> I want a MacBook Air or a MacBook with that keyboard.
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.500]   That's never going to happen, I know, but that's what I want.
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.140]   >> Think Mac Mini.
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:48.220]   Order Mac Mini this week.
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:48.740]   >> Mac Mini.
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.220]   >> We need one.
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.100]   We all got to do it for the kids.
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.860]   >> Join the real world, my friend.
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.300]   >> There's not going to ever be an update.
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.300]   >> Join an R Mac.
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.660]   >> If there is one, it'll be an R.
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:05.740]   The interesting thing is, today Dell announced its 15-inch XPS
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:09.180]   based on this new KB like G. This is the new Intel processor.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:13.900]   The one we'd heard of that had the unholy alliance of Intel CPU
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.900]   and AMD GPU in one chip.
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.100]   It's basically discrete GPU in a single--
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.420]   >> They're not speaker's name.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.300]   >> Yes.
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:26.380]   >> KB like G. So that is now available because Dell is making
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.380]   in their laptops.
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:30.940]   That is also coincidental, don't you think, timing to the fact
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:35.380]   that next Monday, 10 AM, Tim Cook and Phil Schiller and the gang
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.900]   are going to take the stage?
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.180]   I think they're going to announce-- I'm hoping a KB like G.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.860]   >> It's just such a weird time.
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.580]   I mean, Intel really hit a brick wall with 14 nanometer,
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.100]   and it's so hard to predict.
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.980]   We're talking about KB like G in a year
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.420]   where we're supposed to be talking about Canon Lake,
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.380]   and now we still have Coffee Lake,
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.060]   and I forget Whiskey Lake and Ice Lake
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.140]   and all these other things.
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:56.980]   >> We're way behind.
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:58.860]   >> And it's so confusing to see where Intel is going,
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.700]   and there's been a bunch of articles this week
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.660]   saying that maybe Intel is not going anywhere,
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.500]   which is sad given how big a lead they had in this space.
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.820]   >> Ice Lake, by the way, is the Canadian only version
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.380]   of the Intel chips, I believe.
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.540]   >> I can't tell anymore, because they were going to do
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.780]   a split desktop laptop strategy where one went to 10 nanometer
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.140]   and one stayed at 14 nanometer,
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.420]   and it's getting to more and more complex.
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.060]   It used to be-- remember that was TikTok.
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.060]   TikTok, it would be a process strength,
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.260]   and then an architecture change,
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:26.340]   and now it's TikTok, optimize, optimize, optimize, optimize.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.300]   Okay, optimize, we don't know if they'll get another tip.
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:33.300]   >> But don't you think this AMD GPU with an Intel CPU
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.420]   is right up Apple's alley,
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.460]   because Apple's all in on AMD, right?
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:43.460]   That's their chosen partner for the radiance for their GPU.
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.620]   This would be a natural for a pro laptop.
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.900]   >> Right.
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.100]   >> To see it, yeah.
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.820]   >> Plus, plus all the stuff that's being pushed off
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.380]   to GPUs these days.
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.260]   The idea of having a hybrid CPU like that,
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.820]   that's such an easy--
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.340]   an easier-- we were talking about last week
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:02.580]   about how one of the big difficulties
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.660]   of designing a really high powerful CPU
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.380]   is that electrons are way too big and chunky
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.780]   for the speed they're trying to get out of them,
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.220]   and one of the ways around that is to become,
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.500]   work on these more clever hybrid designs
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:19.380]   and a combination CPU, GPU on one single component
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.220]   is a really good way to get at that.
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:25.540]   >> And the G is designed for laptops.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.380]   >> Yeah.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:30.860]   >> So I think I'd be willing to put money,
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.220]   or at least a fine bottle of wine,
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:37.060]   on the new Mac book--
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:37.900]   >> New Mac book.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.980]   >> If pros this week--
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.180]   >> If it ships with this plus a T-chip,
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.100]   then you'd have ARM plus Intel plus AMD on this engine.
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.460]   >> What a weird combination, huh?
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:51.940]   >> So I'm pretty sure that we're going to see new MacBook Pros.
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.940]   I don't know if we'll see new MacBook Airs or MacBooks,
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:54.980]   but I guess that.
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.140]   >> MacBook Air probably not.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.500]   The Air is probably a sub-chip.
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:58.500]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.020]   Plus I think that the consumer MacBook line
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:05.580]   is a subject of much ambitious discussion right now,
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.580]   and that any more time that they can get to
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.060]   before holding off on telling us
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.540]   what their plans are, the better.
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:15.700]   I'm keen to see if they do talk about a brand new MacBook,
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.980]   if they at least talk about, without admitting any fault,
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:22.220]   whatsoever given now two class action lawsuits,
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.500]   they say, and don't worry, the butterfly keyboard
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.180]   that you love already is going to be even better.
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:31.060]   >> Yeah, butterfly three, right?
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.060]   >> Or something new.
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.300]   >> I'd be surprised.
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.140]   >> It doesn't feel like something Apple wants.
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.740]   >> 100% of all Mac--
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.300]   almost 99% of all MacBooks we sold last year
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.780]   were with this keyboard design.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.260]   The people have spoken.
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:49.580]   Yeah, but they might have to encourage people
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:53.460]   to keep the faith either that they are going to make this
[00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.260]   into an option or they're continuing to evolve it,
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.060]   they're going to continue to improve it,
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.180]   that the original design wasn't bad,
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.420]   but there's always ways to make things better
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.180]   and they're committed to making sure
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.500]   this is their future keyboard design,
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.980]   if that is indeed their plan.
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:09.300]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.820]   It'll be interesting.
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:15.180]   And you think, Renee, for sure, iPads.
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.500]   >> I mean, again, nothing is for sure,
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.540]   but we got the new iPads,
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.820]   we had the 10.5 and the 12.9 update,
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.980]   the 810 updates last year,
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:22.780]   and it seems like, you know,
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.780]   A11 updates, FaceTime, all those sort of things,
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.220]   sorry, not FaceTime, FaceID,
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.820]   all those sort of things are in the pipeline.
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.660]   >> Would we not have heard rumors
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.300]   from the supply chain by now about this?
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.740]   >> Probably, I just don't ever want to discount
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:36.580]   any of those.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.780]   I mean, I would personally prefer,
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.700]   I prefer it when there's no new hardware at WWDC,
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.540]   I like to spend time with the software,
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.540]   but most people these days get excited
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:44.860]   about hardware, not software.
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.940]   >> And you're saying they announced the iPad Pros
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.100]   at WWDC last year?
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:49.940]   >> Yes.
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:50.780]   >> Okay, I didn't remember that.
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.900]   All right, so it is not unprecedented
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:57.100]   for them to announce both laptops and tablets at WWDC.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.460]   >> They just, whatever the next show is,
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.540]   if the stuff is ready, it goes.
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:00.660]   Like they never hold anything back
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:02.100]   and they can't ship something that's not ready.
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.740]   So WWDC is the next event that they get in the future.
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:05.580]   >> So they're not thinking,
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:06.620]   "Oh, this is a developer conference,
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.380]   "let's not say something that's consumer focused."
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.420]   They don't, that's not in the calculation at all.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.260]   >> Okay.
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.100]   >> I agree.
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:14.780]   Everything they ship is supported
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:16.180]   by developers, so technically everything
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:17.220]   is developed for police.
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.060]   >> All right, that's true.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.780]   >> And I totally agree with Renee.
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.900]   I never believe, or I never believe anything
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.980]   that is rumored or that I might even be suspecting
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:29.540]   about an announcement until I'm watching the stage
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.780]   and I see the thing either appear or not appear.
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.620]   That said, I have not seen anything
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.420]   that I would have expected to see by now
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:41.020]   if there were a new iPad arriving next week, certainly.
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.260]   They could certainly announce something,
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.260]   but I'd be surprised right now at this.
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:49.260]   If they were to say, "N," it'll be ready to order
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:50.420]   in one week from today.
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.260]   >> Yeah.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:52.980]   >> And iPad is super interesting
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.420]   because we went from having one six months apart
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:58.980]   from the iPad 3 to iPad 4 because that processor,
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.660]   and then we've been like 18 months between updates too.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.540]   Like it came out in the spring or in the summer
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.900]   or in the fall, so we could just as easily go to the fall.
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.740]   But again, I hate guessing about dub dub
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.660]   because one year the rumor was Apple TV was primed,
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.500]   ready to go, and then, "Ah, no, it's coming out on the fall."
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.700]   And then two years ago, it was, "Oh, MacBook Pro, finally.
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.540]   It's ready."
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.020]   "Ah, no, it's coming out on the fall."
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.940]   >> Yeah, as long as we issue the caveat
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.100]   that Apple doesn't say and no one really knows
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.140]   what Apple's going to do, they might have something
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.420]   the day before they're ready to announce
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.780]   that they pull at the last minute.
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.300]   So there's really no way of saying with any certainty at all
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:31.940]   about what Apple will do on Monday.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:32.940]   >> And sometimes they don't know.
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.980]   I mean, the last few updates have been significantly delayed
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.220]   by Intel's roadmap because they're waiting
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.100]   for specific versions of those chips.
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:42.300]   >> I'm waiting for a levitating self-driving car.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.380]   I don't get that on Monday.
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.980]   >> Key point, project type.
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:45.820]   >> It's pretty good to be said.
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.900]   >> It might be a VW bug though, apparently.
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:48.740]   >> Oh, there you go.
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.020]   (laughs)
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:51.860]   All right.
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:52.700]   >> Or Chels.
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:57.020]   >> All right, I'm holding on to a little packet of change
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.980]   if they did come up with a better keyboard,
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.340]   'cause I'm still using the 2015 MacBook Pro,
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.340]   which is fine.
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.060]   Actually, I really shouldn't buy a new one,
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:05.700]   'cause there's, I have zero complaints.
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.540]   You're using it too.
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:08.660]   You have zero complaints about it, it's a great laptop.
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:09.500]   >> Works for what I need to do.
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:10.420]   >> And it's fine, it's fast.
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.540]   I'm using it with Photoshop,
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.500]   as well as everything else, and it's fast.
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.140]   It's not super fast, but it's fast enough.
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:18.140]   >> I think that for the immediate future,
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.820]   the best solution, if you have lots and lots of money,
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.620]   is to contact Ben Heck.
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:23.460]   (laughs)
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.300]   >> He's available.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:28.380]   >> Buy a brand new top of the line MacBook.
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.300]   Send it to him and say,
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:32.100]   "I want you to build this inside a case
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.180]   that has at least three standard USB ports.
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.380]   I want a real keyboard."
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:37.780]   And yeah, I think that's the only thing.
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:38.620]   >> Are people doing that?
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:39.460]   Could you do that?
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.500]   Could I take the guts of a MacBook
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.980]   and put it in a better case?
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.700]   >> You could certainly do that.
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.700]   There's a, (laughs)
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.820]   I am the owner of a MacBook that I can't use anymore
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:57.020]   because, again, some idiots build soda into the keyboard.
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.140]   And so I've been looking at,
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.420]   well, what if I were to take this apart,
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.580]   rebuild this into a different case,
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:05.460]   and put like a hidden USB connection
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:09.140]   between a keyboard that I like and the main board,
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:11.060]   and there's ways to do it.
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.780]   You basically have to trick.
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:14.460]   As far as I've been able to tell,
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.620]   as far as an engineer has told me,
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.980]   you'd have to trick the MacBook into thinking
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.100]   that the old keyboard is still connected
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:24.500]   while you also have a second keyboard attached through USB.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.860]   It was complicated enough
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.900]   that I got distracted by a bright shiny object
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.740]   before I started the CNC machine going.
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.180]   But you could do that.
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:34.460]   And remember that the Apple used to actually have authorized,
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.300]   I don't know what they call them,
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.900]   but remember there used to be versions
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.460]   like the tablet aluminum G4
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.380]   that people were authorized to, again,
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:45.580]   starting off with an actual factory bought PowerBook G4.
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.620]   They would rebuild it behind a touchscreen
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:50.940]   that would be emulating a standard mouse
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:53.020]   and basically give you a tablet, Mac.
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.780]   - Well, I would pay good money for...
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:58.460]   I don't, the guts are fine.
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.020]   I would love that just a better keyboard on that thing.
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:06.300]   - It really is phenomenal
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.700]   what people are doing.
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.580]   Like we're not just talking about,
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.420]   I'm gonna take like an old Atari 2600,
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.740]   take the board out and put it inside something smaller
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.380]   with a clamshell LCD case.
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.500]   But we're talking about communities
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.020]   that are forming around like very sophisticated game consoles
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.100]   and actually taking a saw to the board,
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.300]   figuring out that, okay, all of this is just power
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.380]   so we can literally saw this all off.
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:30.900]   Right here is memory that we can saw off
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.820]   and then remap to someplace else,
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.060]   resulting in a board that used to be about the size
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.180]   of maybe an index card now being about the size
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:41.980]   of like five postage stamps.
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:45.420]   And if that community ever got around rebuilding Macintosh's
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:48.060]   like PowerBooks, MacBooks,
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.500]   that would be super interesting.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.260]   The idea of having a custom made MacBook
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.900]   that like what could you do if you had a MacBook
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.140]   that was one inch thick?
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.460]   And all I'm all the only thing,
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.940]   the only man did I'm giving you is that you,
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.540]   it can be no thinner than one inch thick
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.980]   and give me as much comfort and convenience as possible
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:09.100]   without exceeding, let's say 90 pounds, I don't know.
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.420]   That would be an interesting mandate for someone.
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:15.260]   And if I win the half a billion dollar Powerball someday,
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.460]   I am definitely in commission
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.260]   for different people to do that for me.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.100]   - Is this real?
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.380]   - Can we get the Modbook Pro?
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:22.260]   - Yeah, that was an older one
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.500]   where they put a touchscreen on it.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.340]   - Yeah.
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:27.060]   - Can you imagine a Netflix show like Fastest Cars
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:30.020]   where you have one Apple Store MacBook
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.260]   versus a bunch of homemade MacBooks
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.860]   winner takes all, it'd be a great show.
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.700]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:40.580]   Okay, Monday 10 a.m.
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:44.340]   Megan Moroni and I will be doing our customary annotation
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:48.380]   of the keynote stream.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:52.260]   You could tune in at 10 a.m. Pacific 1 p.m. Eastern 1700 UTC
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:56.420]   on Monday and then the next day, we'll all talk about it.
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.820]   I don't know, Renee, will you be able to join us?
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:58.660]   Probably not, huh?
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.540]   - No, no, I'm stuck in South Bay, sadly.
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:02.660]   - But I'll be back the next week.
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:04.420]   - Okay, and Andy, you will though.
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.460]   You're not going out.
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:08.140]   - I am staying very much put, yes.
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:12.060]   - Yes, and Alex, you're busy because, well gosh,
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:14.260]   something's going on that week, I'm sure.
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.220]   - Traveling all week.
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.060]   - All week.
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.580]   - He's with the Avengers, he's with the Avengers.
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.660]   (laughing)
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:19.500]   - Oh!
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.500]   - I don't know what it is.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.580]   The Iowa Regional Shoe Repair Coalition,
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.220]   that's a big conference, it's over 8,000 people
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.900]   going to be there at the convention center.
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:28.740]   - Mm-mm.
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.940]   - I could actually buy this Modbook Pro, it looks like.
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:35.020]   - You know, not saying that, I thought,
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.500]   if I was Alex, I would just pick everything
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.260]   I loved in the world and get myself at, like,
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.700]   "Oh, Disney, you need help with this?"
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:42.300]   Oh, Nike, you need help with that Lego, yeah, I'll be there.
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.140]   - Exactly.
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:43.980]   (laughing)
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:44.980]   - It's much more fun.
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:46.540]   - I'm, damn.
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:48.540]   Yeah, that would be great.
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.540]   (laughing)
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:51.980]   - Hello, tasty cake factory.
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:53.860]   I think that someone should document the process
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.780]   of making those delicious lemon little pies that you make.
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.780]   If I might have to be like embedded
[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.980]   for three months to make sure I get all the footage I need.
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.060]   (laughing)
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.620]   - Look apart, I'm gonna stream that crack cake
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.140]   to everybody in the world.
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.940]   - I think we should document how whiskey is made.
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:08.780]   I think there was a very good--
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:10.900]   - Yes, I can show you how wine is made.
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.740]   I can show you how, 'cause our sponsor,
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.460]   Wink makes their own wine, amazing wine.
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.580]   And we went down actually to the Wink headquarters
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:21.340]   in Los Angeles, and I met the winemaker.
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:24.340]   They actually work with many winemakers all over the world
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:28.340]   to make some amazing wines, and then you subscribe
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:32.380]   and you get your wines by mail in the lovely Wink box.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:35.660]   This is our box, actually.
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:37.420]   Lisa and I get four bottles a month.
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.860]   That's about right, one a week.
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:39.860]   Not that we're gonna drink them all.
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:42.580]   We, you know, maybe a couple of romantic dinners.
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.980]   We open a bottle of wine, then we got a bottle of wine
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:48.780]   to put away for future in our little mini wine cellar,
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.260]   and then maybe a bottle of wine to bring to friends
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:55.220]   when we go out, we visit their houses.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.220]   We just love these wines.
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:00.380]   Let's see what's in the Wink case today.
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.700]   Tempo Vero.
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:06.180]   This is a wine from
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:09.940]   with wild beaches, ancient forests,
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.980]   and tempting local cuisine.
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:17.380]   The wine region of Salento in the heel of Italy's boot.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:18.340]   Isn't that cool?
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.820]   A southern Italian wine.
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.820]   This is gonna be a nice big red I have a feeling.
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:24.220]   You go to, if you go to the site,
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:28.140]   t-r-y-w-i-n-c.com/macbreak,
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:32.500]   you could take their short little taste test.
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.260]   This is to figure out what your taste buds like.
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.940]   How do you take your coffee with cream and sugar, plain?
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.780]   What do you like or I don't drink coffee?
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:43.900]   You could do citrus, umami with the mushrooms,
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.740]   the berries, what flavors do you like?
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:48.620]   Once they figure it out,
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.700]   they're gonna put together a selection for you.
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:55.260]   You choose, the default is two whites, two reds.
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.420]   We always get all reds
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.300]   'cause Lisa doesn't like whites all that much.
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.700]   I think the summertime,
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.140]   you gotta get a little bit of white, especially.
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:06.300]   They're very, very popular.
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.820]   They have a white that everybody just loves.
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:10.700]   There's summer water.
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.180]   It's not really a white, it's a rosé.
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.580]   Yeah, summer water rosé.
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.300]   Here's Frappato.
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.420]   I think Lisa did all Italians.
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:19.340]   Oh no, here's a French one
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:23.980]   from the Costa Rica name AOC.
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.940]   So, La Téliè de Usoo de.
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:29.860]   So they have wines from all over the world.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.460]   Incredible.
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.300]   I just love Wink.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:36.700]   Why drink the same old bottle every day
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.260]   when you could try some wines personalized for you,
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.940]   just take their palette profile quiz.
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:43.980]   They send wines curated to your taste.
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.980]   The more wines you rate,
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.660]   the more personalized your monthly selections.
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.980]   They wink works directly with top winemakers and growers
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:50.820]   from around the world.
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.700]   They make all their own wine each month.
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.500]   New delicious wines.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.980]   They also partner with local artists.
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:57.140]   The labels are always beautiful.
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:58.940]   So these are always welcome as gifts too.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.660]   I mean, they really are gorgeous.
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.060]   Look at these.
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.980]   It's kind of hard sometimes for me to just choose for.
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:06.420]   Shipping is covered.
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:07.820]   If you don't like a bottle, they send you.
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:08.860]   They'll replace it.
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.740]   No questions asked.
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.660]   The bottle you'll love.
[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:16.300]   Oh, the folly of the beast, Pinot Noir.
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.500]   That's my style of wine.
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.460]   Sit back, relax, or celebrate with Wink.
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:22.860]   Why settle for the same bottle of wine
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:23.860]   you always get to discover.
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:24.660]   Great wine today.

[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.900]   And man, we have found some wines that we just now,
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.060]   and I probably shouldn't do this.
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.620]   We just order every month.
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:50.220]   We always say, well, you gotta have a bottle of that.
[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:53.140]   What is the one that we, we just love?
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.380]   It's so good.
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.780]   It's a Austrian style.
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.740]   Oh, so delicious.
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:02.180]   W-w-i-n-c is Wink.

[00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:14.620]   Lots of Apple news today.
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:19.620]   Besides iOS 11.4, Samsung loses in court
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:23.180]   and must pay Apple, you know, it's a pittance.
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:26.300]   $539 million for infringing iPhone patents.
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.020]   This is a jury trial.
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.300]   It's about halfway.
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.700]   They compromise between Apple and Samsung.
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:36.820]   Samsung, though, is a little upset.
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.260]   Half a billion dollars.
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.860]   The bulk of the damage is $533 million
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:44.900]   for infringing three Apple design patents.
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:48.900]   The remainder, $5.3 million for two utility patents.
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.780]   There was no question Samsung had already been found
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:51.780]   to infringe the patents.
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:55.140]   The trial was really all about the damages.
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:58.940]   Samsung had fought the earlier damage findings.
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:03.500]   And in fact, it got it down, I think, to $399 million.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:07.020]   Nope, you're gonna have to pay a little bit more.
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.780]   Well, they're gonna keep it in court
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:09.940]   for probably another two or three minutes.
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:11.180]   Yes.
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.380]   Samsung says the fight is not over.
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.700]   Today's decision flies in the face of a unanimous Supreme Court
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:20.260]   ruling in favor of Samsung on the scope of design patent.
[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:23.020]   Images will consider all options to obtain an outcome
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.220]   that does not hinder creativity and fair competition
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:26.940]   for all companies and consumers.
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:28.260]   They're fighting for us.
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:30.100]   They're fighting for all of us.
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:30.940]   Thank goodness.
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:32.900]   It's the cheapest amount of money they could have spent
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.540]   on the R&D that let them quickly make it.
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:35.540]   I actually agree with you.
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.540]   They should just say, "Hey, we've got a deal.
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.380]   "Thank you.
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:39.380]   "It worked out fine."
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.580]   Check, it's 1% of our daily profit.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:42.420]   Yeah.
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.580]   We'll sell three more to that last tomorrow.
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:45.980]   But on top of that,
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:47.780]   however much it costs to litigate,
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:50.380]   I bet that they're making so much more money
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:53.260]   just basically holding on to that $500 million
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.220]   and whatever they've got the money in.
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:56.060]   (laughs)
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.700]   If they, whatever investments they've got,
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:43:59.820]   the $500 million in,
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:01.540]   they've probably got that funding,
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.100]   the continuation of the lawsuit.
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:05.060]   And there's probably gonna be just some spreadsheet
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:06.540]   that says, "Okay, at this point,
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:09.300]   "we're not making as much money off of what's left over
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:10.380]   "as we are fighting this."
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:11.900]   So at this point, yes, we'll cut them a check.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.100]   We'll raise the price of side-by-side refrigerators
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.660]   for three quarters and make up for it.
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:20.020]   - And also, I'd love for Samsung just to get behind.
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:21.980]   I mean, there was a time where Samsung was just shameless.
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:24.300]   They made a blackberry, they made a blackjack,
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.540]   they made ports that looked like dock connectors
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:27.380]   for no reason.
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.620]   They made everything they could.
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:30.180]   And that was what you did in the utility industry,
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:32.420]   using refrigerators, look like refrigerators, whatever.
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.540]   But then with a Galaxy Note, and then after that,
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.260]   they started making such unique such release,
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.420]   like Samsung started owning their own design.
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:40.460]   This sort of harkens back to an era before that.
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:41.900]   And I think it would behoove them,
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:44.620]   just as a company to sever all of those things,
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.780]   get all of that behind them,
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.980]   and then go on and keep making awesome Samsung stuff.
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:51.260]   - Samsung had argued that $28 million was fair.
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.980]   Apple wanted $1.07 billion.
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:55.060]   There was a little bit of a--
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:55.900]   - They met in the middle.
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.980]   - The jurors was like, "Let's just cut it down the same."
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:00.100]   - I actually seen that interview to a few of the jurors.
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.900]   And they were not ignorant about technology.
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:06.380]   One of the jury, a four person,
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:07.940]   was a manager at a Barnes & Noble,
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:11.540]   but one of the jurors was a technical writer for Cisco.
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:15.900]   And they both agreed that Apple had really pioneered it.
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.540]   So it's an interesting case.
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:19.620]   - So what happened was Samsung said,
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:20.660]   "Yes, cut it in half."
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:22.740]   Apple said, "No, no, no, we don't want you to cut it in half.
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.060]   Just let Samsung have everything."
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:24.940]   And so on the end, they gave me.
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.100]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:28.780]   And in fact, it was the older phones,
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:32.060]   'cause the jury was asked specifically
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.820]   to assign damages for each phone.
[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:34.900]   And they actually did.
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:39.300]   The big one was the droid charge,
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:43.820]   or the Galaxy S4G, those, oh, the Galaxy S2.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.860]   - Galaxy S2 was the one that Verizon didn't have an iPhone
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:47.780]   and desperately wanted one.
[00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:49.260]   - I love that they came down.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:50.100]   - They came down.
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:54.340]   - I love that droid charge came down to 54,839,
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:55.860]   and $113.
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:58.260]   - How do you come up with $113?
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:00.460]   - There must have been some, I don't know.
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:04.620]   - 74 was the new Markarita machine for the base.
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:08.620]   - Yeah, well, there's a lot to love on both sides here,
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:12.140]   where I think Samsung was right to defend
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:14.740]   because a lot of the chargers were kind of ridiculous
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:18.100]   that there was parts of it where Apple was kind of saying
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:20.300]   that no, no, no, here's a device that has a home button
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:23.700]   and rounded rectangles and pocket-sized devices
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.380]   that's dominated by a screen.
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.660]   And okay, well, what about these other devices
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.380]   that may predate the iPhone that do that?
[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:30.220]   Oh, well.
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.180]   But on the other hand, for heaven's sake,
[00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:35.660]   it's like you got your hand in the cookie jar,
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:38.140]   you got crumbs all over your face and your shirt.
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:40.620]   At some point you say, okay, it's a fair cop.
[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:43.900]   I will sit in the corner for three days.
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.500]   There were points in which they were actually
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:50.260]   like copying the actual icons where there was,
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:53.340]   I don't know if there was intent to defraud or deceive,
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:58.140]   but there was a lack of interest in innovation, let's say,
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.060]   in the designs of their first entries
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:02.420]   into Android touchscreen phones.
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:05.380]   So there's, I agree with Renee,
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:09.460]   I think that if I really wish that Samsung would write
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.300]   that check.
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.460]   (laughing)
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:12.300]   - Do your stuff.
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:15.180]   - Do your, at some point you do your 30 hours
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:19.460]   of community service, then you take off the orange vest,
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:21.180]   you stop, you put away the trash picker,
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.300]   and then you move on with your life.
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:23.420]   I think that's what they should do.
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.980]   - Here are the three patents.
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:30.020]   And again, it was already decided that Apple's patents,
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:31.540]   you know, were infringed.
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:32.540]   I'm not sure I agree with that.
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:33.580]   This was a damages trial.
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.940]   This is one of the patents was on the,
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:37.980]   basically a phone with rounded rectangles
[00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:39.820]   and a black face, this is the other one.
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:42.380]   You recognize these, these are the original iPhones.
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.260]   These are pretty old.
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:47.900]   And then the third patent was on the grid of icons
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:48.900]   on the screen.
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:49.900]   (laughing)
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.660]   - That's kind of a reach.
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.580]   - All of them feel fairly generic.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.620]   You know, I don't know how you would design a phone
[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:57.940]   that didn't kind of look like that.
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:00.940]   - It's a ludicrous journey to get to a sensible place.
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:01.860]   - Yeah.
[00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:06.140]   Again, they're also suing Geos for Tari ST.
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.180]   They're also suing cigarette machines
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.780]   that had buttons in a grid that's okay.
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:12.620]   - No, they're not.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:13.860]   (laughing)
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.180]   But Samsung has some deeper pockets.
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:19.220]   - Samsung, it felt like it was a personal insult, right?
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.300]   Like going all the way back to Steve.
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:21.820]   It's like, we made this phone.
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.540]   We partnered with Google and Samsung to do it.
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:26.020]   And now they've launched Android and Galaxy and damn it,
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:26.860]   it hurts.
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:27.700]   So we're gonna make them.
[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:31.060]   - No, this is very much a sunny, corleone sort of thing.
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:33.660]   Where there's a consiglieri somewhere saying,
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:36.140]   Steve, this is business.
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:38.060]   You're letting this get me personal.
[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:39.660]   This is just about business.
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:40.500]   - Yeah.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.700]   - Well, I think it's all the baggage of windows.
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:43.340]   I mean, it's a thing.
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:46.100]   - I think it's also a little bit like,
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:49.500]   you know, in the scene in Unforgiven
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.660]   where he beats the, you know, beats mercilessly,
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:55.980]   the guy who, you know, he's like, I'm not talking,
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:56.820]   I'm not beating you.
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:57.660]   I'm not beating him.
[00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:59.340]   I'm telling everybody else.
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:01.140]   - I think I'm hitting you, Bob.
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:03.300]   - What I'm actually doing is talking.
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:04.140]   - Yeah.
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.300]   - Talking to every faux-legged trail tusser
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:08.220]   that there ain't no money to get here.
[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:09.060]   - Yeah.
[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:11.460]   - And if there were, well, you wouldn't want to come here
[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:12.300]   and try to get it.
[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:13.140]   - Yeah.
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:13.980]   (both laughing)
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:15.140]   - Exactly.
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:17.260]   So I think that there's a little bit of,
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:19.340]   we're just gonna keep this going because every time
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.580]   it gets a little PR, people, you know, everybody else
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:23.860]   who might want to copy something is reminded
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:27.220]   that Apple will hang on to this.
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:30.940]   And so, tenaciously, and I think that both companies
[00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:33.540]   can afford to win or lose this case,
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:37.780]   but the reminder that the company is litigious
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.620]   is probably useful for Apple.
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:45.980]   - Apple as responding as everybody is this week
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:48.580]   to GDPR, Friday GDPR.
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:49.740]   - I think this is the new--
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:50.580]   - 2K?
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:51.420]   - 2K?
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:52.260]   - Why 2K?
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.100]   - Why 2K?
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:53.940]   - Because if you had to do it,
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:54.780]   I'm sure you had to do it.
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.580]   Any company that has a website
[00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:58.420]   has to at least consider GDPR.
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:00.740]   - It's really unclear exactly what you have to do
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:01.580]   in many cases.
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:04.820]   - Well, it isn't, but it would be prudent
[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:06.060]   to at least do something.
[00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:09.220]   We've revised our privacy policy.
[00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:11.700]   Reconsidered our data retention policies,
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.660]   changed those, shortened the amount of time.
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:14.500]   Any company--
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.140]   - There was a today that went to links,
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:17.540]   went to like a links version of their website.
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:20.540]   - Yeah, it's interesting 'cause the original USA Today website
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:24.700]   you get in outside of the EU is 5.4 megabytes.
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:28.380]   The one you get inside the EU is 542K.
[00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:31.140]   And that's because they took all of the stuff,
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.500]   all of the bad trackers and everything.
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:38.500]   But then there's the newspapers like the Tronk papers,
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.780]   LA Times and the Chicago Tribune,
[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:45.180]   the Arizona Star, there are a lot of newspapers
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.820]   that just block EU users.
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:51.300]   - Well, because it's, I think that's just what they have
[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:52.620]   to do right now.
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:56.860]   It's hard to overstate how difficult a problem this is.
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:01.140]   It's not just talking to your own IT department
[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:03.540]   and making sure that your own site
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:06.660]   or your own property conforms to all the stuff.
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:10.660]   There's also every single service that you contract with
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:11.980]   to do your IT.
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:17.180]   Every single piece of code that you have incorporated
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:20.420]   if your IT department is using a framework,
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:22.380]   you have to now make sure that you're coordinating
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:23.860]   with the developers of that framework
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:26.740]   to make sure that you know exactly what this thing is doing.
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.260]   And so that's why I don't think they're gonna,
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.900]   I certainly don't think they're gonna shut off access
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:33.020]   to EU users forever, but until they,
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:36.060]   there was a hard deadline with no excuses and no extensions.
[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:39.220]   And if given the extreme punishments
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:42.420]   that you can hand down for violating this,
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:44.260]   there's just really only one answer.
[00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:46.540]   If you, it is just like Alex has said,
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:48.700]   this really is like a Y2K.
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:51.140]   A lot of companies started preparing for this
[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:54.340]   as soon before the, before the,
[00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:57.940]   the before this plan was made official.
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:02.180]   This was made official in 2012, 2013, I think.
[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:04.220]   And so there are a lot of people that just weren't ready
[00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:05.060]   for it.
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:07.220]   And so there's a lot of people that are just standing by
[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:09.980]   just like in Y2K, standing by to see if their computers
[00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:12.460]   would shut down or not because they just ran out of time
[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:14.100]   and there was no way to get an extension to this.
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:14.940]   - Well, and I wonder.
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:15.860]   - It's not great conference.
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:16.900]   - Oh, go ahead, go ahead.
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:17.740]   - Right.
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:19.420]   - I saw a great conversation between two developers,
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:21.340]   one of whom said, this is fantastic.
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:22.180]   It's the best thing ever.
[00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:24.220]   I'm finally seeing what all these scummy websites
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:26.660]   and apps have been collecting about me forever.
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:27.500]   Another developer said,
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:29.460]   this is the worst nightmare I could imagine
[00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:31.860]   because I'm not concerned about what I'm doing,
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:34.140]   but I'm concerned that if I make a clerical error
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:36.500]   or I misinterpret something or they interpret it differently
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:37.900]   than how it was originally stated,
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:39.300]   I'm gonna be an example lawsuit.
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:40.140]   I'm gonna learn every,
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:41.860]   I'm gonna lose everything that I ever had.
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:43.300]   And like, somewhere in the middle, there's a truth,
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:44.700]   but there's very different reactions.
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:46.940]   - And I doubt that you use gonna come down hard
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:49.740]   on people who aren't,
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:51.780]   I think it's really aimed at Facebook and Google
[00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:53.300]   and companies like that,
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.700]   but there are, it is fairly owners.
[00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:59.100]   I would imagine millions of man hours were spent last week.
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:02.980]   Certainly, we spent 40 or 50 trying to figure out what to do.
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:04.580]   We rewrote our privacy policy,
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:07.940]   which as I said, changed our data retention policies.
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.260]   Any website that collects IP addresses,
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:12.460]   which is virtually every website has to consider this.
[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:14.940]   If you get emails, if you have an email newsletter,
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:16.820]   that means you're getting people's emails collecting them,
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:18.180]   you have to do something about this.
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:20.220]   - Well, any privacy is right behind it.
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:21.860]   - Yes, the new one is e-privacy,
[00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:25.100]   which maybe even is more draconian.
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:26.500]   I have very mixed feelings about it
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:28.260]   'cause I think it's also good for users.
[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:31.100]   For instance, Apple had to update its privacy.
[00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:33.180]   You can go to privacy.apple.com
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:35.260]   and log in with your Apple ID.
[00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:37.460]   And you can see what Apple's doing,
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:41.820]   but you can also download or correct your data.
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:43.620]   And this is all GDPR required.
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:45.420]   The good news is Apple, like most companies,
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:46.980]   has decided to extend it
[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:49.780]   to not just people living in the EU, but everybody.
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:50.780]   So-- - I wonder.
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.780]   - I went to Google's version of this
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:54.460]   and I have turned off everything
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.860]   that I could possibly turn off over the years for Google.
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:58.580]   And I went there and all of it was on
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:00.700]   and I tend to go and reposs it all.
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:02.300]   And it turned out that previously it depended
[00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:03.860]   like what device you did it on,
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:05.580]   whether it be that device or globally.
[00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:07.340]   And in most cases, it was never globally.
[00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:09.180]   And there was like three or four different versions
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:10.020]   you had to turn off.
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:11.300]   And now it's all in one place.
[00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:12.420]   And if you don't want to share anything,
[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:14.700]   you can make absolutely sure you're not sharing anything.
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:17.260]   So in cases like that, it's a huge boon, I think,
[00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:18.100]   for consumers.
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:20.540]   - And I wonder, though, is when you listen
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:22.660]   to the startup process of a lot of companies
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:24.700]   that got off the ground, like Instagram,
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:26.580]   they have a good example of just kind of
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:27.900]   like it just kind of accidentally worked.
[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:29.420]   - And then they had a server.
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:30.660]   And then there's only a lot of people
[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:31.900]   we're using in the server crashed.
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:36.100]   And I wonder whether those kind of companies
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:38.180]   could start up in this environment,
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:39.660]   especially with the e-privacy coming.
[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:43.020]   And I also wonder whether some startups may start
[00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:45.660]   to just go, "Well, we're just gonna block."
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:46.500]   There might be a lot of things
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.940]   like we're just gonna block Europe when we start up.
[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:51.340]   Now, if we're successful, we'll incorporate them later,
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:53.500]   or we'll have a much more cut down version,
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:54.820]   or much more, you know, like there,
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:58.180]   you know, I could see how European users may get
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:00.740]   greatly affected if it's not, you know,
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:02.180]   you start targeting certain countries
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:05.140]   as opposed to trying to incorporate Europe
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:06.820]   because it's too troublesome.
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:08.300]   The question is whether you could do that anyway.
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:09.700]   I mean, what happens when they travel?
[00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:11.100]   And are you blocking the IP addresses,
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:12.820]   or are you blocking their credit card address?
[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:14.380]   You know, those types of things.
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:16.100]   - So here's Apple's page.
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:19.540]   If in a few easy steps you can ask for access to your data,
[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:20.620]   this is a little confusing.
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:24.220]   If your account is set for a country outside,
[00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:27.460]   the EU, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, or Switzerland.
[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:29.220]   So I guess the rules are different.
[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:31.420]   So I'm gonna say I'm in the United States.
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:34.100]   - They deployed it for the EU immediately on May 24th.
[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:35.300]   It's gonna come to other regions,
[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:36.580]   but it's not every region yet.
[00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:38.020]   So if you're in the EU, you get everything.
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:39.860]   You get change your data, download your data,
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:40.700]   all of those things.
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:43.500]   If you're not, you might just get one or two functions for now,
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:46.060]   but over the summer they're gonna be rolling it out for all GOs.
[00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:51.220]   - So it's asking me to email them for access to data
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:54.500]   if my account is outside those countries.
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:58.100]   So if you're inside those countries, you can...
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:55:59.980]   - I had deactivate in one other option.
[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:01.100]   I did not have changed data.
[00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:02.500]   I did not have download data yet.
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:03.340]   - Yeah.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:06.740]   So okay, so at some point you'll be able to download
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:07.580]   your data.
[00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:09.940]   - It's interesting, it's your iTunes purchases.
[00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:11.020]   Like it's not...
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:11.860]   - Apple doesn't know that much about it.
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:13.020]   - It's surprisingly small amount of data.
[00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:14.020]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:17.100]   Okay.
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:19.060]   So I'm not gonna send an email to Apple.
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:22.020]   You can also delete your account.
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:22.860]   - I think it's like a week or something.
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:23.700]   - You can delete your account.
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:25.820]   Can you do that even if you're not in the EU?
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:27.740]   - Yeah, I don't know if the wording is deletor deactivate.
[00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:29.340]   I think you have both options in the EU,
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:31.380]   but I think you only have one option.
[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:33.420]   - Here in the US it says delete.
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:35.740]   At any time or for any reason you can request
[00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:38.020]   and permanently delete your account
[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:40.540]   for your security, we verify all deletion requests
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:41.980]   it takes up to seven days.
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:44.820]   And they tell you all the consequences,
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:46.820]   all the things you won't be able to do.
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:47.900]   - And there was some confusion.
[00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:48.740]   Like some people were like,
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:50.540]   well, where is my Siri logs, for example?
[00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:52.220]   And it just, they literally don't have them.
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:54.740]   They give you a unique ID every time you use it
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:56.500]   and they perish that ID fairly quickly.
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:58.820]   So there's no record that you're the one who use Siri.
[00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:00.980]   So they can't ever give that back to you.
[00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:02.860]   But they give back to the things that they are stored
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:04.220]   that are connected to your ID.
[00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:05.780]   - And actually that's kind of the point of this
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:10.180]   is that companies should stop being so packrats
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:12.580]   collecting so much personal information
[00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:16.540]   that they don't need or that they want to use.
[00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:19.260]   And this is what e-privacy's gonna really affect.
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:21.100]   We're apparently already in the EU,
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:26.100]   we're seeing huge drops in ad tech purchases,
[00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:29.300]   but e-privacy's gonna even--
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:31.300]   - You wanna think that what's interesting about this?
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:33.300]   Obviously plays heavily towards Apple
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:34.740]   and will heavily away from just about
[00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:36.380]   all their major competitors.
[00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:37.580]   You know, like that it's, you know,
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:39.940]   this is something that Apple will be the best
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.540]   they'll be best able to handle.
[00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:43.220]   - I forget who said it, but one of the Apple people said,
[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:45.620]   nobody cared about security until Windows XP.
[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:47.660]   - Right. - And suddenly everyone
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.140]   heard about security and they felt
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:50.060]   that we were getting that way,
[00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:51.620]   like with Cambridge Analytica or something,
[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:52.820]   we were getting that way with privacy.
[00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:53.820]   - Right.
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:55.460]   Well, what we're seeing here is the difference
[00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:57.380]   between having absolutely no regulation.
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:58:00.180]   Here's what a business or an industry will do
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:02.380]   with absolutely no restrictions placed on them
[00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:05.260]   by any outside agency and how hard it is
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:10.260]   to redefine an entire business once a society has decided
[00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:12.860]   that no, this is not gonna do any more, we can't trust you.
[00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:15.860]   There's, I was reading a lot of coverage in ad week.
[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:17.740]   That's really, of course, very relevant,
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:19.460]   saying that there are a lot of ad agencies
[00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:21.460]   that are just gonna have to go out of business
[00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:25.500]   because it's just not possible to conduct digital ad sales
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:29.220]   or digital, basically tracking it forensics
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:32.860]   of ad impressions, the way that that business
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:35.780]   has been built up, that you're gonna see a bunch,
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:37.980]   a bunch of these servers try to change over to
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:41.620]   a more traditional sort of like newspaper or magazine thing
[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:44.460]   where instead of targeting you specifically
[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:46.900]   because they know that you like to kayak
[00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:49.820]   and now it's springtime and now you might wanna buy a kayak,
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:51.580]   they're gonna have to go back to, okay,
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:54.260]   this person is a reader of the New Yorker.
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:57.980]   I'm gonna start advertising, I don't know,
[00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:02.060]   will blazers with leather patches and tobacco pipes
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.220]   because I think that New Yorker
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:04.220]   read her does to do that.
[00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:05.220]   - In his hope, you know.
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:07.500]   - Actually, this is really good for us
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:10.700]   because anybody who does that kind of advertising
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:14.700]   that isn't highly targeted using ad tech
[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:16.540]   has been at a disadvantage, it's hard at a hearted
[00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:17.940]   to sell against Google and Facebook
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:20.580]   because I can't tell our advertising.
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:21.980]   When Wink comes to us, they say,
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.380]   "Well, do your people drink wine?"
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:24.980]   I said, "I don't know."
[00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:25.820]   (laughs)
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:26.660]   I think so.
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:27.940]   - But that's what it was with,
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:29.180]   it was like brand advertising,
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:31.220]   it wasn't, there was this whole thing with trackers.
[00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:33.620]   Like, trackers started because ad companies said,
[00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:35.420]   "Oh, we have the internet now, we can monitor people
[00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:37.860]   "and I don't wanna pay to show Leo this ad seven times
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:39.460]   "because if he hasn't bought it after the seven time,
[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:41.780]   "he's never gonna buy it and I'm wasting my money."
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.100]   And so they would try to track you
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:44.940]   and figure out, "Oh, we've shown him this seven times,
[00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:46.140]   "we'll have a different ad."
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:47.820]   But in reality, a lot of these companies,
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:49.820]   like if you're not gonna buy a Toyota today,
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:51.180]   and Samsung is great at this,
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:53.900]   they wanna make sure you're so blanketed in their brand
[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:55.380]   that the next time you do want something,
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:56.740]   you automatically think of them,
[00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:58.100]   and we've locked so much of that.
[00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.340]   - I'm not sure it's such a good thing,
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:01.940]   even though I benefit from it,
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:04.460]   I don't like seeing ads for stuff I'm not interested in.
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:06.620]   - Well, I don't wanna see an ad more than seven times
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:07.460]   if I'm not gonna buy it,
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:09.780]   so some of those things seem like a good thing.
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:11.780]   - Well, and I also think that trackers are on risk.
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.220]   - Trackers maybe. - Yeah.
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.180]   - But I think that when you're building that also
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:18.020]   for small companies, it's key because they don't have
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:20.900]   the money to carpet bomb an entire country.
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.300]   - It makes advertising more efficient.
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:23.420]   - Yeah, if you look at like,
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.420]   we're launching a studio in DC,
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:27.420]   and so we're looking at Facebook,
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:29.420]   and our Facebook and Google AdWords,
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:31.420]   I can say, okay, I'm only looking for the city,
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:32.740]   and I'm only looking for people who are interested
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:34.740]   in these things that would possibly need a studio,
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:35.780]   and I'm only looking for the people,
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:38.060]   you know, like, I can kinda tie that all up.
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:39.860]   Now I'm gonna spend money only on the people
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.900]   that I'm looking for,
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:44.100]   not sending out to everyone.
[01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:44.940]   - I think that's the right thing, no.
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:45.780]   - But I think that's-- - Why would anybody
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:47.980]   wanna see an ad for something they don't want?
[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:50.860]   - Right, but if only we're just about ads.
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:54.220]   My real difficulty with unrestricted tracking
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:57.660]   is that now there are companies that pretend
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:59.620]   that they're gonna apply scientific principles
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:01.140]   to marketing and profiling,
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:03.820]   to be able to tell a potential employer,
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:05.500]   tell me all about this and you not go,
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.100]   who is he, what's he interested in,
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:09.380]   what should we be worried about,
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:13.220]   a potential, if it comes to time to buy a house,
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:15.820]   that credit score is very good,
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:18.220]   well, he's a freelancer, so why don't we just take a look,
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:21.380]   oh, this phony baloney marketing,
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:23.900]   this phony baloney quote analytics company
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:25.540]   that has thrown a lot of machine work
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:27.020]   like Machine Learning at us,
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:30.460]   says that he's very, very likely to grow a beard
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:34.100]   and decide to become a fur trapper by the age of 54,
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:35.780]   and that's right in the middle of the loan period,
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:37.100]   so we shouldn't loan it to him.
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:38.900]   That's the difficulty, I think, of all this stuff,
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:43.060]   where you don't know how this information is going to be used,
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:44.500]   whether it's legitimate information,
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:48.100]   or, again, phony baloney stuff that is being marketed
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.140]   but as parts of sewer science.
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:53.340]   - Yeah, it's an interesting challenge.
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:56.420]   I think it's good for the economy
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:59.820]   and it's good for end users, if it's used for advertising,
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:01.380]   I think it's a good thing.
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:04.140]   - I think overall, what the law should really say,
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.540]   it is restrict the use of it in certain ways,
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:07.380]   but they're not doing that.
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:08.260]   - Also, the implementations are horrible,
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:10.500]   that's what leads to the five gigabyte webpage
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:11.340]   and five megabyte page.
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:12.180]   - Yeah, no, I agree.
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:13.820]   - Because all the trackers are, no, it's clear,
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:15.780]   AdTech brought this upon itself
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:19.500]   and the surveillance capitalism brought it upon itself.
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.340]   But it's a shame because I think,
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:23.380]   and again, it's good for me
[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:26.700]   'cause we don't use AdTech, and so.
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.420]   - Well, and I think one of the tricky ones is,
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:31.020]   for instance, but I don't wanna sell inefficient ads.
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:34.180]   I feel like it would be better for us
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:36.380]   if advertisers knew that they were advertising
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:39.340]   the right people and their ads worked better,
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:41.060]   I could charge more for an ad.
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:43.460]   It would be good for everybody,
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:44.900]   but that isn't gonna happen
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:47.420]   because people are so squirrely about privacy.
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:49.700]   - And I think that e-privacy, again,
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:51.420]   I think is gonna be the one that's much more complicated.
[01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:52.860]   So for instance, one of the things that--
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:56.180]   - Here's legislation currently provides one condition
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:58.740]   under which a company may use data or metadata
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:01.040]   about users' electronic communications.
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:06.300]   You have to obtain explicit and informed permission
[01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.940]   for a specific or agreed upon purpose.
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:11.580]   Otherwise, you can't collect the data,
[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:14.620]   but you must still offer the same services.
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:15.460]   That's the tricky part.
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:16.780]   - So if you're WhatsApp,
[01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:20.460]   this is specifically targeted at companies like WhatsApp,
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:23.640]   and if you're WhatsApp, you have to say, okay,
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:28.180]   we would like to collect metadata and location data
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:30.980]   and so forth, and this is exactly why we wanna use it,
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:34.580]   not for Andy's purposes, not for insurance companies,
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:36.140]   but because we wanna sell advertising,
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:37.420]   and you have to agree to it,
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:39.860]   and WhatsApp, if you even say no, you can't do that,
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:42.220]   WhatsApp still has to offer WhatsApp,
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:44.860]   a free service to you in exactly the same form.
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:46.900]   - Interesting, because every time I get a new Android phone
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:49.220]   or I do an update, I always go and turn Google Assistant on,
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:51.380]   and it says, can we monitor your web and app activity?
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:54.300]   And I say no, and it says, well, you can't use Google Assistant.
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.900]   And every time I'm like, well, there's still others,
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.220]   they could tell me what the temperature is
[01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:59.140]   if you're not monitoring my app or my web--
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:03:59.980]   - Or my web-- - Well, they have to,
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:01.420]   you know, your location to tell you
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:02.260]   what your temperature is.
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:03.180]   - No, location is fine.
[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:05.020]   I just don't want them monitoring my webber,
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:06.660]   but they don't give me that choice, it's all or nothing,
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:08.620]   and this might force them to give me a choice of,
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:10.460]   I'll share this data to get these features,
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.020]   but I won't share that data understanding
[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:13.460]   that I won't get those features.
[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:15.500]   - Yeah, the big deal is that this is the separation
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.900]   between the user having no rights
[01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:20.860]   to the user finally having some rights.
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:22.740]   For instance, it's not just about ad tracking,
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:25.060]   it's about things like, one of the things
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:28.340]   that might keep you in Spotify and not moving to Google Play
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:31.700]   or to Apple Music is that, well, I've got all these playlists
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:32.900]   and I've got all my favorites.
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:36.540]   Part of this is saying that is a guarantee of data portability.
[01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:38.820]   So that if your data is all on one service,
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:41.100]   they have to give you a way to get that data out
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:44.060]   and use it on another service should you choose to leave.
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:47.900]   It also includes ways to create class action suits
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:52.980]   against companies that are very, very explicitly stated
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.380]   at a level that's much, much higher
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:56.220]   than whatever agreement that the company wants
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:57.540]   to sign you up for.
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:59.380]   So there's a lot of good stuff here.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:01.820]   I'm sure there's gonna be some wobbling
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:03.820]   over the next year or two as we figure out stuff
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:07.100]   that is just so impractical that it needs some modification,
[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:10.460]   but again, the difference between no rights whatsoever
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:13.180]   and some rights and the ability for the EU
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:15.300]   to really put the hurt on even a company
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.660]   like Google and Facebook, that's a landmark step.
[01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:23.460]   - Well, the question is, is can Facebook, under e-privacy,
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:25.260]   keep you from having an account
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:27.780]   if you're not using your real name?
[01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:29.140]   'Cause right now they can, right?
[01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:30.540]   You know, you can have-- - They try to,
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:32.380]   it doesn't work very well.
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:35.780]   - But there's all kinds of verification processes.
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:37.540]   For instance, if you want a live stream
[01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:39.660]   it used to be, if you wanted a live stream on YouTube,
[01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:42.660]   you would have to put in your phone number,
[01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:45.260]   to certify, would they not be allowed to do that?
[01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:48.300]   And those aren't issues around trackable,
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:50.260]   trackability, they're around issues of,
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:51.420]   we wanna know, make sure that we know
[01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:56.540]   who is actually using the product for liability reasons.
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:58.660]   And for instance, YouTube is a good example
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:00.340]   of the reason that YouTube comments
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:02.660]   for a live stream, for instance, are completely useless
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:05.100]   is because everybody has a handle.
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:06.420]   And in Facebook it's a lot better
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:08.140]   because everybody's got a name.
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.860]   You know, and so the thing is,
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:12.220]   there are management processes are,
[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:16.460]   if I can't do that, is that going to now,
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:19.540]   create more chaos for the actual user
[01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:22.220]   who's trying to enjoy the show, so to speak?
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:23.340]   - I had to give its own number
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:24.980]   to get a Gmail address yesterday.
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.300]   And I was thinking about it, but then I'm like,
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:27.420]   do I not, do I want people to be able
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:29.300]   to make unlimited Gmail addresses who aren't real people?
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:30.140]   I don't know.
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:32.980]   I don't know the answers to all that stuff.
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:36.380]   I suspect what's gonna happen is you're gonna see
[01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:39.220]   fewer free apps and more paywalls.
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:40.740]   And you're gonna be paying for more stuff.
[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:41.580]   - Paywall don't scale.
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.460]   I mean, in the old days you go to a newsstand
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:44.540]   and you see a bunch of papers
[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:46.340]   and you choose the one you'd like and you buy it,
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:48.420]   but now you're supposed to subscribe to all these papers
[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:51.020]   and then all these services, like Netflix and Hulu
[01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:54.260]   and the Washington Post and the New York Times
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:57.660]   and Apple Music and Spotify and it just, it doesn't scale.
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:59.620]   - Well, I don't like it either, but that's what you're
[01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:01.100]   gonna get, I think.
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:03.900]   That's just what you're gonna get.
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:07.620]   - And again, I also wonder if I can start up.
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:08.460]   - Welcome to the new world.
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:11.620]   The EU has now insisted that that tech die.
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:12.700]   It's gonna die and that's it.
[01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:14.260]   - And I also wonder whether if I'm a startup,
[01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:17.380]   whether I just say I'm gonna block the EU when I start up
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:19.740]   because it's not large enough, it's not large enough
[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:22.580]   of a market for like, if I have something that I think
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:24.540]   is gonna be successful in the rest of the world
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.940]   or the US specifically, do I just say,
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:28.420]   I'm gonna block that for now.
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:31.420]   If we're successful, I'll figure out how to manage that later.
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:32.740]   Or maybe I never do.
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.620]   - That's why I wonder if those newspapers really
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:36.340]   will ever stop blocking the EU,
[01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:38.100]   'cause they don't care, 'cause advertisers aren't paying
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:39.140]   for EU readers.
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:41.580]   - A lot of US advertising doesn't,
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:43.380]   like they don't care about global advertising.
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:45.500]   And so the question is, does it become--
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.060]   - The Arizona Star, I guarantee you,
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:49.220]   does not sell ads based on the number of people
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:50.300]   in the EU that read it.
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:53.300]   So those guys are free writing already.
[01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:55.020]   No problem cutting them off.
[01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:56.780]   The problem is it does make an issue.
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:58.140]   I had a caller on Saturday said,
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:00.700]   I want to post an article from the Arizona Star
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:03.380]   on Facebook and it says, you can't.
[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:07.740]   And I'm thinking that that's because the star doesn't know
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:11.260]   whether its content will be viewed in the EU on Facebook.
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:13.820]   And so I was doing some sort of sharing block.
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:15.700]   That's gonna be a problem for them.
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:16.540]   - Right.
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:20.740]   - I think what's happening, look, I understand.
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:24.860]   And, you know, yeah, so now people have privacy rights.
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:27.620]   But what we don't see on the other side of it
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:30.220]   is what the consequences are gonna be.
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:31.580]   And I think it's a very different internet.
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:33.180]   It's not how the internet was built
[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:34.660]   and it's gonna be a very different internet.
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:36.980]   And, you know, we'll see.
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:39.140]   - I mean, I guess the question is a study over that.
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:42.100]   - We can all, you know, like, I think one of the things
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:44.300]   would be similar to, like, we're suddenly being stopped
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:47.060]   every 10 miles for our ID, which I've been in countries
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:49.460]   where you are stopped every 10 miles for your ID.
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:51.900]   And it's annoying, you know, like, you know,
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:53.980]   and I think that it does, you know, slow things out.
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:57.220]   Now it does keep everybody protected in those countries
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:58.660]   that I've been in.
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:08:59.900]   They do that because they want to make sure
[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:02.500]   that there's no terrorists and there's all this other stuff.
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:04.660]   But it is a pain in the neck to have to stop
[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:06.460]   and be in a line every 10 miles.
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:08.700]   And so, but I think that those are the kind of things
[01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:10.940]   that that's what this is almost creating at the beginning.
[01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:13.060]   I think they'll maybe they'll find something in the middle.
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:16.900]   But I do think that it could be messier than Y2K.
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:18.380]   - That's interesting though, because like,
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:20.140]   I had a conversation with some of the people who make
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:22.340]   this ad tech back when content blockers were a thing.
[01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:24.060]   And everyone was nervous that content blockers
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:25.580]   would do exactly this.
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:26.900]   And, you know, these are smart companies.
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:28.180]   It's like Google Ad Exchange
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:30.700]   and they could care less about the quality of their ads.
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:32.300]   Like we don't, there's no, we've found out
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:34.660]   there's no money in making better quality ads.
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:36.740]   Sometimes the worst ads convert better.
[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:38.660]   And the entire industry was apathetic
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:40.140]   to the people who at the end of their ad campaign.
[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:41.220]   - Sorry.
[01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:42.060]   And now-
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:42.900]   - And now there's some-
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:43.740]   - Yeah.
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:44.580]   - You got what you got what you-
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:47.180]   - It was absolutely zero respect for the end user.
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:49.900]   - And frankly, I think ad blockers, I think are not gone.
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.460]   I think they're only getting worse.
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:54.740]   I think this is, that's another thing
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:56.660]   that hasn't really fully played out yet.
[01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:59.260]   I certainly, our audience, I would say
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:01.740]   the majority use ad blockers.
[01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:04.900]   You know, so again, all of this is great for us.
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:08.900]   You know, but I don't know if it's great for advertisers
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:11.300]   and I don't know in the long run how it's gonna play out
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:14.620]   for most content players like iMore.
[01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:17.260]   And I don't know how it's gonna play out for end users
[01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:18.900]   'cause I don't know what the internet's gonna look like
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:21.740]   after, you know, when this comes to its logical conclusion.
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.540]   Will WhatsApp be free?
[01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:28.300]   If they can't monetize, will it be free?
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:29.180]   - It is now, isn't it?
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:32.020]   Didn't they remove the 99 cent thing a while ago?
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:34.100]   - It's basically free.
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:36.260]   But will it stay that way?
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:37.580]   And how much are you worth to it?
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:39.780]   So how much will they charge per user?
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:42.340]   99 cents seemed a fair price one time only, right?
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:44.860]   Or was it a year, I guess it was a year.
[01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:46.100]   Skype is free.
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:50.660]   - Although Skype credit, like if you wanna do certain things,
[01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:52.180]   like you wanna get Skype credit for it.
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:53.820]   - Right, right.
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:55.180]   It's interesting because also a--
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:57.980]   - A freemium model might survive, right?
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:58.820]   - I think it will.
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:00.020]   - Why sticker packs and that supports the app?
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:00.860]   - Yeah.
[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:05.020]   - We should see.
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:07.220]   - I do think it's an interesting stratification,
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:09.660]   'cause now I know that I get these things
[01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:12.620]   that pop up for New York Times and Washington Post.
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:14.900]   And now I just don't, if I see it in Flipboard
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:17.820]   that is Washington Times or I just flip past it.
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:18.660]   - Lumber.
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:19.500]   - I'm like, oh, I don't wanna do it.
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:22.140]   - Lumber wants $35 a month.
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:23.620]   I can't-- - I'm not gonna pay it.
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:24.500]   - I just skip all of those.
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.260]   You know, I just like online.
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:29.260]   - And yet Mark Gurman is not skippable.
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:32.500]   So I don't know what I'm gonna do about that, right?
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:33.620]   I get 10 articles.
[01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:36.060]   Here's a little flaw in their logic,
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:38.420]   'cause I get 10 articles per browser.
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:39.900]   It's a browser cookie, so.
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:44.900]   But if they lock that one down, 35 bucks a month,
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:47.020]   is outrageous, I'm not gonna pay 35 bucks a month
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:48.140]   for Bloomberg.
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:49.580]   - I can see all this coming to Canada,
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:50.700]   but do you think it would come to the US
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.300]   something similar to these regulations?
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.780]   - No, never.
[01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:55.860]   - No.
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:58.260]   - This is, it's antithetical to everything we stand for
[01:11:58.260 --> 01:11:59.420]   in this great country.
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:01.380]   (laughing)
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:03.260]   - Well, the one thing we've got on our side
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:05.780]   is the fact that Facebook and Google
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.900]   are a monopoly on the ad business.
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:12.900]   And if they can figure out a way to give privacy rights
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:17.780]   to individuals in a way that works within their model,
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:20.900]   but will not work within anybody else's ad model,
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:24.540]   then they will start to basically promote this
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:25.540]   and lobby this and say,
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:27.540]   "Well, gosh, if Google and Facebook,
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:29.420]   "they know what they're doing, and sure,
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:30.340]   "let's get behind this."
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:31.500]   And they can, just like Apple,
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:34.420]   is able to really bang the drum on,
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:36.180]   "Oh, well, you don't understand how much privacy
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:37.540]   "is being leaked out, you don't understand
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:40.140]   "how much companies are monetizing."
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:42.460]   Again, that is a big principle for them,
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:44.740]   but that also works very well for them.
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:46.660]   Google and Facebook could do the exact same thing.
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:48.860]   We're already seeing Google do something like that
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:49.940]   by saying, "Well, we've got this,
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:53.860]   "where in Chrome is gonna have this brand new ad,
[01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:56.460]   "this new ad blocking technology
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:58.500]   "that doesn't block all ads, it just block ads
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:00.820]   "that we deem to be naughty," or I'm sorry.
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:05.100]   The industry, totally independent industry coalition
[01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:08.940]   has developed a list of 10 no-nose
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:11.380]   that they built basically based on the no-nose
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:12.620]   that we suggested that they adopt,
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:14.780]   but hey, they're still the industry no-nose,
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:16.740]   and we're gonna subscribe to their no-nose
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:18.300]   and make sure that those ads don't go in.
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:21.580]   Again, these are ad types that Google
[01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:23.820]   is not really interested in right now
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:26.500]   or can easily adapt to deal with,
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:28.980]   whereas other ad networks, it just basically torpedoes them.
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:31.140]   So that's our same-- - Part of the problem
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.100]   with this is that you have,
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.980]   and this is really, I think, gonna be the real issue,
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:38.300]   the internet, which is a global entity,
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:42.820]   is regulated by individual countries
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:44.860]   in ways that impact everybody.
[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:48.180]   So GDPR impacts everybody, whether or not the US
[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:49.020]   will ever do it.
[01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:49.860]   Here's another example.
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:52.140]   Russia is now demanding that Apple
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:54.580]   remove Telegram from the Russian App Store.
[01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:57.420]   Russia's been doing a lot to ban Telegram,
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:00.260]   blocking IP addresses, all sorts of stuff
[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:02.080]   because it's encrypted.
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:07.380]   They wouldn't provide backdoor access to Russia.
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:10.260]   So now Apple's again in the position of
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:12.820]   doing something Russia wants it to do,
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:15.900]   just like they were doing something China wanted it to do.
[01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:17.540]   I imagine Apple will comply.
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:19.340]   I don't know why they would do anything different
[01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:20.860]   in Russia that they do in China.
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:25.020]   This is kind of a problem.
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:29.060]   While I appreciate GDPR,
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:31.860]   and I think in many ways we get benefits from it,
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:34.780]   I guess I wonder also whether we're gonna see
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:35.780]   a lot of the impact.
[01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:37.860]   I mean, I have a friend for instance,
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:39.020]   that sells a little product,
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:43.660]   and he said, you put a certain amount of money into ad words
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:46.020]   and you get a certain amount of sales back.
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.380]   And it's one of those things,
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:48.420]   it's not like he's got this big,
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:50.260]   he's not Google and he's not Facebook,
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:53.420]   but he is making, he's putting $4,000 of advertising
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:56.020]   and getting $8,000 back every month.
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:59.140]   You know, in this little model that he has to sell
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:00.140]   his product that people like.
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:02.060]   You know, I'm not gonna get into what the product is,
[01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:03.860]   but anyway, the point is, is that
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:09.180]   for all those little companies that zeroing in
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:11.020]   makes a difference, it's not just Google
[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:12.020]   that's going to be affected.
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:13.860]   It's going to be a lot of companies that have
[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:15.740]   very effective advertising campaigns
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:19.620]   that aren't Cambridge, Analytica or anything,
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:21.100]   anybody else, they're like little mom and pop.
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:23.860]   So they're gonna be basically run over
[01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:24.700]   because of all of this.
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:26.300]   And I think that that's gonna be the next set of news
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:27.540]   that we start seeing six months
[01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:28.500]   or a year down the road.
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:29.820]   - Yeah.
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:32.580]   Steam users, gamers who really were thrilled
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:36.580]   by the idea of playing their desktop steam games on iOS.
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:38.500]   - Bad news, you won't be able to.
[01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:42.860]   Apple has rejected Valve's Steam Link app.
[01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:46.580]   Now, I'm hearing conflicting reasons for it.
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:51.180]   Apple, Valve said Apple, which had originally
[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:53.620]   approved it for release on May 7th,
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:55.580]   sent them a note saying,
[01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:58.140]   "Do to business conflicts with app guidelines."
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:15:59.260]   I'm not sure what that means,
[01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:01.780]   that the original review team had not seen
[01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:05.420]   Valve appealed and has lost the appeal.
[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:08.940]   I think Phil Schiller said, oh, I don't know what Phil said
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:09.940]   something.
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.740]   - They're working with Valve too.
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:12.580]   - Right, exactly.
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:14.180]   - They're gonna fix it.
[01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:15.540]   What do you think the real reason is?
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:19.180]   Why is Steam Link being blocked?
[01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:22.300]   - There could be a lot of different categories here.
[01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:25.740]   There's content, there's the content itself,
[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:27.980]   some of which is quite explicit
[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:29.420]   because it is an open content.
[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:32.220]   - Yeah, but it's a game I already own on my desktop.
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:34.900]   - But that's the thing that's needed.
[01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:36.060]   - They're just bought it.
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:38.140]   See, what are you protecting me from?
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:42.300]   - We've seen this play out so many times
[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:45.540]   before, I remember the early days of content controls
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:46.780]   in the App Store where you say,
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:49.060]   well, the reason that someone could actually visit
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:51.380]   a website off of this app and that website
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:52.900]   might have explicit content on it.
[01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:54.900]   - They might have, maybe, you can maybe justify it,
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:57.260]   but this stops you from playing a game on my desktop
[01:16:57.260 --> 01:17:00.420]   that I already bought and own on my iPad.
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:03.660]   - What I'm saying is that I think this was a level one,
[01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:05.700]   level one or level two kickback.
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:10.700]   And then once the company has an open and frank discussion
[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:15.660]   with Apple, then people who are a lot more poised
[01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:18.900]   to make nuanced decisions take a look at it.
[01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:20.060]   I think this will get wrapped up.
[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:22.500]   I think part of it might be simply membership fees.
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:25.420]   Part of it might be the idea that it is,
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:27.220]   the Steam's big thing is that, well,
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:30.460]   this is just like any other like VNC sort of app.
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:32.460]   All we're doing is we're opening a connection
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:34.020]   to a remote computer.
[01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:36.500]   There's, I'm sure it's not as dire as that.
[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:38.460]   I think they made a huge tactical mistake
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:40.660]   by saying that, oh, they're banning us
[01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:43.300]   because it's an incompatible business sort of thing,
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:44.460]   which we'd invite people to think,
[01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:46.660]   oh, well, Apple doesn't want competition
[01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:49.140]   from their own games in the app store
[01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:51.740]   when actually it's probably nothing like that.
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:53.860]   So, well, hold tight for a month.
[01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:56.220]   I'm sure it'll get settled out very quickly.
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:57.900]   - I think the business conflict was that
[01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:00.820]   there were in-app purchases that Apple didn't get 30% of,
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:02.620]   is actually what it was.
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:04.420]   - We could went up with the Comixology sort of thing
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:05.900]   where the app will be there,
[01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:07.820]   but it will be impossible to make purchases.
[01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:09.700]   I think the original version there was possible
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:11.580]   to make purchases on your Steam account
[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:13.940]   where the money wasn't going through Apple somehow.
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:17.260]   - Yeah, it actually required kind of a hackery work around
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:18.100]   by the end user.
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:19.260]   - Well, this is the way Audible works, right?
[01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:21.340]   You have to buy your book on the website.
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:22.420]   - On the website, webpage.
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:24.780]   - Which makes it much less useful than the Audible on Android
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:25.860]   where you can buy it directly.
[01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:26.700]   - It's so annoying.
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:28.100]   Like you go, oh, I want a book into this.
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:29.820]   Now go to your webpage and you're like, oh, yes.
[01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:31.260]   - And that only applies for digital goods,
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:32.300]   not for real life goods.
[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:34.220]   There's no whole prohibition on real life.
[01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:37.300]   - Here's Shiller's email, which was posted on Reddit.
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:38.700]   Unfortunately, the review team found
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:41.420]   that Valve's SteamOS iOS app is currently submitted,
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:45.100]   violates a number of guidelines around user generated content.
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:48.380]   Maybe that's the adult stuff.
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:53.540]   In-app purchases, content codes, et cetera.
[01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:54.380]   Yeah, maybe that's it.
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:56.900]   Maybe it doesn't reflect the content code.
[01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:59.980]   Although again, it only lets you play apps you own
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:01.500]   on your desktop.
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:02.860]   - There's weirdness with Apple too.
[01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:05.700]   Like I know a lot of games that have coupon codes
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.260]   that you can type into the game to get.
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:09.580]   You can't run those on iOS the way you can.
[01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:10.580]   - Right.
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:13.500]   - On Android, they just don't have that system in place.
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.300]   I think these things usually end one of two ways.
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:17.740]   It's usually like Apple has made some dumb decision
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:19.300]   and then they walk it back.
[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:21.380]   Or there's something going on that we're not immediately aware
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:22.220]   of.
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:25.020]   The connection's not as secure as Apple wants it to be.
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.980]   Or there's some possibility that a kid
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:28.100]   will buy something they shouldn't buy
[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:31.300]   and then Apple will be in the middle of a litigation lawsuit.
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:32.980]   And either way, it tends to get wrapped up
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:34.140]   pretty quickly like it's a bit.
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:36.140]   - I'm gonna guess that Apple's gonna continue to work
[01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:38.340]   on the work with Steam to figure this out.
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:39.180]   - Something with some.
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:40.180]   - Until Steam gives up.
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:41.020]   - Yeah.
[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:42.860]   (laughing)
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:43.860]   - No, I think they're gonna be like,
[01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:46.980]   "Let me, we're gonna give you a ton of communication
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:48.980]   and go, "No, no, no, no, but we're working with you.
[01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:49.820]   We're working with you.
[01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:51.260]   We're working with you and then Steam's just gonna go,
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:52.420]   "This isn't worth it."
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:57.300]   The problem is that it's too competitive with the game.
[01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:59.260]   I don't think Apple's looking at Steam.
[01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:03.500]   I think Apple's looking at every game developer on the iPhone.
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.020]   Which is, you know, or Valve.
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:06.660]   I mean, I don't mean Steam.
[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:08.900]   Thank you for Beatmaster.
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:13.900]   But with Valve, they're looking at all of the game developers
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:16.100]   'cause games are a big deal on the iPhone.
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:18.500]   And having them be native is something
[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:19.940]   that is important to Apple.
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:21.980]   I think that's what this all comes down to.
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:24.020]   - That may be just a crappiest experience.
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:26.780]   It is available for Windows on Xbox, for instance.
[01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:29.300]   You could play Xbox games on Windows.
[01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:35.820]   But I think Valve, this rollout of Valve on the iPhone
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:40.820]   or on iOS would be devastating to the current game developers.
[01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:44.540]   And I think that it would, 'cause it works really well.
[01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:47.980]   And I think that Apple will use a bunch of excuses
[01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:51.700]   to drag this out until Valve decides to do something else.
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:53.540]   You know, like I think that because I think that it's not,
[01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:58.300]   because it's a non-native development.
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:20:59.900]   If this is really successful.
[01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:01.820]   I mean, I'm not saying this is the way it should be.
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:04.180]   I'm just saying, I think this is the way it is.
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:07.900]   So I think that you're basically moving all your game development
[01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:11.100]   into a non-native platform away from your platform.
[01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:15.660]   If I was Apple, I'd find every way to avoid having that happen
[01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:17.780]   because it pushes a huge part of their business
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:18.620]   out of their platform.
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:21.660]   - Well, this money is, when In-App purchases first came out,
[01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:24.140]   that was Apple's worry, that everyone would make everything free
[01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:26.340]   and then it would have a button to buy from their website
[01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:28.700]   and it would cut Apple completely out of the revenue stream.
[01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:31.740]   And that might sound fine, but Apple would be then supporting
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:33.700]   every one of these free apps for free,
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:35.900]   like all the transactions that downloading the storage,
[01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:37.140]   all of that.
[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:41.180]   And there would be, right now the paid income dwarfs,
[01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:42.820]   the costs of supporting this for free,
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:44.980]   but if almost everyone can figure out a way to go free
[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:46.660]   and to save that 30%, they'll do it.
[01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:48.700]   And then there's no App Store economy.
[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:52.060]   So when they move to allowing free apps to have in-app purchases,
[01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:54.260]   they disallowed sort of the direct buy
[01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:56.100]   because, you know, Comixology would be free,
[01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:57.460]   but you'd be buying everything from Amazon.
[01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:58.660]   So Apple gets zero revenue.
[01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:01.340]   The game would be free, but you'd be making all the in-app purchases
[01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:03.060]   directly with EA or Valve or whomever
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:05.300]   and Apple would be making zero dollars off that purchase.
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:06.660]   And I think Alex is right about this.
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:09.620]   There's a way to wholesale, move the platform off of iOS
[01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:11.460]   but still access iOS customers.
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:13.420]   Apple feels like they're then maintaining the store
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:15.500]   that they're no longer generating any income for
[01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:18.180]   and it's sort of like setting up a pop-up store inside Walmart
[01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:20.460]   that then you keep everything from the pop-up store.
[01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:22.140]   And that's not just simply not in Walmart's best future.
[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:24.780]   - And it's not, it's not, and then it would be moving on.
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:26.100]   - I should say one thing, can I say one thing?
[01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:26.940]   - One thing.
[01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:28.620]   - It's not like putting a pop-up store into Walmart.
[01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:30.540]   It's like putting another Walmart into Walmart.
[01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:35.540]   Games are a huge part of the revenue of the app store.
[01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:38.180]   So it's not, it's like putting a door in Walmart
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:39.500]   that is a whole nother Walmart on the other side.
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:40.820]   - This way, to our store.
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:42.900]   - Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:45.020]   Lucy, you got some explaining to do,
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:48.340]   US District Court Judge Lucy Coe,
[01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:50.900]   maybe gave away some secret information.
[01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:54.260]   There's a lawsuit going on about touch disease.
[01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:59.060]   That the Apple knew about touch disease
[01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:02.500]   before it told the people or whatever.
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:04.940]   And this lawsuit, there were some internal Apple,
[01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:06.700]   these are why lawsuits are bad for Apple,
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:08.620]   the secrecy kings.
[01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:10.740]   These some internal Apple documents were filed
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:13.140]   under seal in that lawsuit.
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:16.020]   The alleged Apple misled customers about touch disease.
[01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:19.460]   They're still under seal, but Judge Coe,
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:20.780]   inadvertently I would guess,
[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:22.060]   made some of the information public
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:24.120]   in a recent opinion on the case.
[01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:28.780]   She, and this is the pleading with the smoking gun,
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:31.700]   Apple's internal testing determined the iPhone 6
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:34.380]   and she quotes this, so this comes from the documents,
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:39.380]   was 3.3 times more likely to bend than the iPhone 5S.
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:42.260]   And the iPhone 6 Plus was 7.2 times more likely
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:46.220]   to bend than the 5S.
[01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:50.700]   And she uses this to underscore that Apple
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:52.900]   sometimes knows about this stuff but doesn't disclose.
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:55.900]   This was before, more likely to bend easily
[01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:57.940]   when prepared before they shipped it.
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:02.820]   So this isn't even related to the touch disease, but.
[01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:06.140]   - Yeah, so I mean, this has been reported
[01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:07.540]   in really weird content.
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:10.300]   So like the way it works is like Apple moves materials
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.820]   and they have a whole materials department
[01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:14.580]   and it's their job to weigh concerns with capability.
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:17.260]   So for example, when they moved from aluminum to plastic
[01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:20.020]   with the iPhone 3G, they knew that plastic is more likely
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:22.180]   to crack than aluminum, but it had other characteristics
[01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:24.580]   they liked and lo and behold, iPhone 3G's cracked
[01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:26.580]   and they got better with iPhone 3GS.
[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:28.500]   Then they moved to glass with the iPhone 4
[01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:31.100]   and again, they knew that glass is more likely to break
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.660]   than the plastic was, but it gave them characteristics
[01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:35.220]   they wanted and people would drop them
[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:36.660]   and now they'd break on two sides.
[01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:38.380]   And the same thing happened with iPhone 6,
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:40.380]   Apple knows, 'cause again, this is physics
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:42.340]   that metal bends the way that glass
[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:45.100]   was ceramic shatters, metal bends.
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:46.900]   They probably didn't realize it would be the extent
[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:49.220]   that it was or that it would have other effects
[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:50.340]   like the touch disease.
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:52.980]   And so when they realized that they made iPhone 6s,
[01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:55.220]   even better than iPhone 6, but these are,
[01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:56.860]   like it sounds sinister, like, ha ha ha,
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:58.420]   we're gonna let everyone's iPhone's bend,
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:01.420]   but it really is the cost of changing materials
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:03.260]   in a product that ships in hundreds of millions
[01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:04.420]   and then you're always playing catch up
[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:05.260]   with the next generation.
[01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:07.180]   Although they must have been just a little disconcerted
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:10.140]   when like day one somebody bends it.
[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:12.100]   Well, yeah, I mean, so on YouTube.
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:14.740]   You can finally have a month or two before.
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:17.700]   I really didn't like the headlines here.
[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:19.580]   I really didn't like them with the stories being told.
[01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:22.100]   When you read the actual core document,
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:24.780]   what basically what they're saying is that
[01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:28.460]   Apple not being idiots was aware that the iPhone,
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:30.780]   they didn't, these stories don't mention
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:33.700]   what the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 5 design was.
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:38.420]   A solid aluminum frame going all the way around
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:42.420]   the entire outer edge of the device with two panes of glass
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:45.580]   that they're making it super, super, super stiff as well.
[01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:47.140]   So basically what they're saying is that
[01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:49.300]   when they decided not to have this thick
[01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:52.260]   aluminum frame around the entire phone,
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:55.100]   they were aware that this was not going to be as strong
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:56.580]   as the previous one.
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:57.940]   And so if that is a complaint,
[01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:00.380]   then the complaint is that Apple should always make phones
[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:02.420]   that are stronger than the one that came before.
[01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:05.460]   So they were, so I believe that they leaves open the idea
[01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:07.420]   that they thought they thought it was still plenty strong.
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:09.340]   Just of course, not going to be as strong
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:11.820]   as this previous design, which was, as Renee said,
[01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:13.940]   was designed that way for a number of reasons
[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:16.140]   and strength was probably not the number one reason
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:18.500]   or probably was a sacrificial reason.
[01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:20.620]   And then the second complaint was aha,
[01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:22.900]   then to approve, here's the smoking gun,
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:26.100]   they redesigned it later on to make it less bendable,
[01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:29.220]   which again, if you're a little bit less conspiracy oriented,
[01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:31.260]   it's that they took advantage of the fact
[01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:34.340]   that now they've seen tens of millions of these things
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:36.180]   in the wild and they have determined,
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:38.820]   they can now see where this thing fails
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:41.260]   on a scale of millions of things in the wild
[01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:43.420]   as opposed to thousands of things in the wild.
[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:46.020]   And while I'll be darned, they decided to make it stronger
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:48.660]   without having to redesign the whole damn thing.
[01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:51.460]   So yeah, I mean, it did point out that,
[01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:53.140]   whereas there was a lot of laughter about,
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:55.460]   "Oh yeah, look, if you bend your phone like this
[01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:57.500]   "and you're stupid enough to bend it like that,
[01:26:57.500 --> 01:26:59.300]   "well, take better care of your phone,"
[01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:02.940]   the more nuanced and more interesting thing to point out
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:05.740]   is that we have a lot of people that weren't aware
[01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:07.540]   that they were bent that in their pocket,
[01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:10.740]   the phone was bending just enough not to cause
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:13.020]   a visible wobble in the phone,
[01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:15.300]   but to unseat certain pieces of circuitry
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:17.420]   that would cause that touch disease.
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:19.540]   And that was one of the things that Apple was addressing
[01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:22.620]   in this redesign, but yeah, this is another thing
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:24.580]   where the headline wrote itself before us,
[01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:27.500]   I think anybody really read what was being talked about here.
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:28.340]   - And I have-
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:29.980]   - She must be so tired of Apple by now.
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:32.580]   - And I have to say that I don't,
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:34.060]   like I've had all these phones,
[01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:35.260]   I haven't bent any of the phones
[01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:36.740]   and one of the primary things that I don't do
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:38.340]   is I don't put them in my back pocket.
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:40.420]   You know, like the idea that you,
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:43.620]   the idea that you could put that a phone, you know,
[01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:45.980]   this big or bigger into your back pocket
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:47.660]   and sit on it and not expect to break it
[01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:49.180]   is kind of absurd to me.
[01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:51.620]   You know, and not at least bend it a little bit,
[01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:53.780]   there's a certain level of understanding physics
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:55.660]   that I think people, you know,
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:57.500]   I just feel like sometimes these lawsuits
[01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:59.860]   are an excuse for being an idiot.
[01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:00.700]   You know, and so-
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:01.540]   - Well, I don't know.
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:02.540]   - You know, like the thing is,
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:04.180]   is that you're putting it in your back pocket
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:06.140]   is a silly thing to do.
[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:08.900]   And I, you know, and the last time I put it in my back pocket
[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:10.260]   admittedly was the smaller phones,
[01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:12.660]   but once they got bigger, it seemed like an obvious thing.
[01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:14.820]   And it's fine for you to put it in back pocket
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:16.340]   and it's fine for you to break it.
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:17.820]   It's just not fine for you to blame Apple.
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:19.460]   - You could actually argue that the reason
[01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:21.980]   it got bent so fast is 'cause people looked at it and said,
[01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:23.980]   "Oh, look, I bent this little bend."
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:24.900]   (laughing)
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:26.060]   - Well, also-
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:27.820]   - Well, it's obvious, right?
[01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:30.060]   - That if you put in your back pocket
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:32.100]   and then a week later you put it on the table
[01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:33.100]   and you'll notice it's wobbling,
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:35.500]   say, "Oh my God, I shouldn't be putting it in my back pocket."
[01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:38.620]   It's different when you visibly, nothing bad is happening
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:41.820]   and then something very, very subtle happens later on
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:44.500]   where why is the screen no longer working?
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.140]   Why is this button no longer working?
[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:48.180]   And you don't really correlate it with a behavior
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:50.780]   that you should have terminated on day two.
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:52.420]   - On day zero.
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:55.220]   Like, I mean, I think part of it is also, you know,
[01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:59.100]   treating 600 or 800 or $1,000 items,
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:00.500]   like they're 600 or 800 or $1,000.
[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:01.940]   - You haven't met my kids.
[01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:03.060]   - No, no, I have this argument.
[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:04.500]   I will admit, I have this argument with my wife
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:07.660]   who will constantly put her eight, you know,
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:09.900]   whatever, plus in her back pocket.
[01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:12.300]   And I'm always just kind of like, if that breaks.
[01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:14.660]   - You're like, "You're not buying you a no one."
[01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:16.740]   Like, "No, I'm not buying you a no one."
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:17.860]   I'm getting you a five C.
[01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:19.020]   You know, like, you know, like, you know, like,
[01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:19.860]   - That's what I tell my kids.
[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:21.740]   - Yeah, so, now that,
[01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:23.780]   - Abbie's using a Samsung phone now.
[01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:24.620]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:25.460]   - Four kids.
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.260]   - That's summer weather again.
[01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:29.340]   Do you keep your phone in your front,
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:31.180]   in your front shirt pocket,
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:32.540]   then knowing that it'll get, you know,
[01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:34.860]   your body's gonna sweat and that moisture is gonna sort of
[01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:36.800]   condense on the surface of the phone.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:38.900]   And again, after weeks and weeks and weeks,
[01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:41.100]   hey, it's still working, this must be perfectly safe.
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:43.140]   And then five or six months later,
[01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:44.900]   when something starts to fail and they open it up
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:46.820]   and say, "Well, yeah, there's been moisture in grass."
[01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:50.780]   And given by the smell of Irish spring inside this phone,
[01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:52.180]   we're guessing it was body spl-
[01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:54.180]   first-piration that made this happen.
[01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:57.260]   At that point, you can't really call someone an idiot
[01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:59.980]   because again, they're looking for cause
[01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:01.580]   link directly to effect.
[01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:05.900]   It's hard to link behavior that over time,
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:08.100]   the odds start to creep up on you.
[01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:11.860]   So I think the suit is silly, but who knows?
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:15.220]   - I have some visitors in the studio from Portugal.
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:16.060]   Nice to have you.
[01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:18.400]   And they say I have been pronouncing,
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:21.980]   trèche pointeich wrong all this time.
[01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:22.860]   How do you say it?
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:27.100]   I was saying it's Spanish and it's,
[01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:29.140]   of course Portuguese is from Brazil.
[01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:30.140]   - So instead of the scibillating,
[01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:31.660]   it's more of a trèche.
[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:32.660]   - Trèche.
[01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:33.500]   - Pontage.
[01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:34.340]   - Pontage.
[01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:36.220]   Trèche pointeich.
[01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:38.540]   However you say it is amazing coffee
[01:30:38.540 --> 01:30:40.380]   cause you will agree with this.
[01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:42.300]   The best coffee comes from Brazil.
[01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:43.220]   Absolutely.
[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:44.980]   They got coffee in the coffee in Brazil.
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:47.620]   Let me tell you folks, we're big fans.
[01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:51.900]   We've been drinking trèche pointeich for,
[01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:53.900]   for a couple of months now exclusively.
[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:58.140]   It's the official coffee of Twit and my house too.
[01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:00.740]   It is, it's actually a great story.
[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:03.660]   It's a single family farm in Brazil
[01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:06.700]   in the trèche pointeich area of Brazil.
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:09.180]   They, the race family, they've been growing coffee
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:10.700]   for a hundred years.
[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:13.620]   It's multi-generational, three generations.
[01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:16.180]   Some of the best premium gourmet coffee in Brazil
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:19.060]   where some of the best coffee in the world is grown.
[01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:20.620]   There's some advantages actually.
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:21.940]   This is the first time they've ever exported it
[01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:23.220]   to the US by the way.
[01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:25.020]   And it's, and I want to say one of the things
[01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:27.060]   we all know about great coffee besides starting
[01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:30.380]   with really good beans, you gotta have it fresh roasted
[01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:31.820]   and this is so smart.
[01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:34.540]   Trèche pointeich coffee, the race family,
[01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:37.180]   ships it to the US green and then it's roasted here
[01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:40.300]   in the US so, look this was roasted May 21st.
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:41.500]   And we've had it for a few days.
[01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:45.580]   So you're gonna get fresh, great coffee.
[01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:47.180]   I love this feature.
[01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:51.220]   On the back of every Trèche pointeich bag is a QR code.
[01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:54.100]   I'm gonna take a picture of the QR code here.
[01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:54.940]   And let me see.
[01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:56.940]   And then it'll show you on a map
[01:31:56.940 --> 01:32:00.540]   where your beans came from right there.
[01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:03.060]   Right there, there's the bush.
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:06.300]   I love that.
[01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:07.140]   I love that.
[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:08.740]   Do you want to know where your coffee came from?
[01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:10.940]   That's where it came from.
[01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:13.940]   So single farm sourced 100% of rabbit-go-hole beans,
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:17.900]   non-GMO certified coaster, picked by hand,
[01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:19.260]   roasted in small batches.
[01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:21.140]   Oh, there's one more thing.
[01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:24.580]   Coffee in Brazil doesn't have to be washed.
[01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:27.740]   A lot of coffee coming from more equatorial countries
[01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:32.740]   where it's hotter has to be washed because of mold.
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:34.740]   They don't have that problem.
[01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:39.060]   So Trèche's pointeich is naturally pulped, not washed.
[01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:39.900]   And what does that mean?
[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:41.660]   It means you get a smoother,
[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:42.580]   I'm gonna open this bag
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:44.460]   so you can see these beautiful beans.
[01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:46.780]   You get a smoother brew.
[01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:49.580]   It is fan, oh man.
[01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:51.340]   Oh boy, does that smell good.
[01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:54.580]   It is a fantastic, these are the dark roast, I guess.
[01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:57.660]   Just a fantastic, and the pulp is still on there.
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:00.220]   And that means that the brew is smoother
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:02.980]   than the washed beans you get everywhere else.
[01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:05.140]   Get freshly roasted beans sent to you
[01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:08.900]   on as you need them, one, two or four weeks,
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:09.980]   12 ounce bags.
[01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:12.660]   I like the idea of getting a smaller amount
[01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:14.780]   shipped more often that way.
[01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:19.780]   And shipping is free, so you don't have to worry about that.
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:20.980]   In the US it's free shipping.
[01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:23.660]   So I like the idea of getting a ship more often that way,
[01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:25.620]   you always have a fresh bag.
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:27.060]   Light, medium, dark, and French.
[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:28.060]   Let me open the medium,
[01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:32.740]   'cause these are such beautiful coffees here.
[01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:33.940]   This is the medium roast.
[01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:35.180]   Or should I do the light?
[01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:36.740]   Should I do the light?
[01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:37.900]   I shouldn't open all these bags,
[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:39.260]   but I guess I don't have to worry.
[01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:40.100]   It will be drunk.
[01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:41.860]   You had something, didn't you?
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:43.100]   Right, it was good?
[01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:43.940]   Did you like it?
[01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:46.300]   All right, (speaks in foreign language)
[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:47.140]   Here's the deal.
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:51.220]   If you sign up for a subscription, which I recommend,
[01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:52.620]   if you do sign up for a subscription,
[01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:54.940]   you're gonna save 10% off every bag of coffee.
[01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:56.300]   And because you're watching Mac Break,
[01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:58.460]   we're gonna get you an extra 10% off.
[01:33:58.460 --> 01:33:59.300]   So here's the deal.
[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:04.300]   You go to trespontas.t-r-e-s-p-o-n-t-a-s.com/macbreak.
[01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:06.460]   And if you use a code Mac break,
[01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:11.540]   an additional 10%, that means 20% off every bag.
[01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:14.940]   20% off, by the way, for Father's Day.
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:18.660]   What a great gift of freshly roasted coffee subscription
[01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:21.620]   from the race family farm, from their dad to yours.
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:24.260]   Oh, that's so good.
[01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:27.260]   You'll actually be tempted to eat them.
[01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:28.260]   (laughs)
[01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:29.540]   They're so good.
[01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:30.900]   You can also order on Amazon,
[01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:33.020]   but if you want that 20% off,
[01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:34.660]   you gotta go to trespontas.
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:36.260]   I say it that way so they can spell it.
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:39.460]   T-r-e-s-p-o-n-t-a-s.
[01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:41.260]   That means three points, right?
[01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:42.340]   Yeah, 'cause it's a mountain.
[01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:45.380]   You see it right there on the logo with three points.
[01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:49.620]   trespontas.trespontas.com/macbreak.
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:50.540]   Yeah, did I get that right?
[01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:53.060]   Use the offer code Macbreak.
[01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:54.860]   And this can be the best coffee you ever had.
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:56.740]   And dad is gonna love it.
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:35:00.420]   And I'm a dad so I can say that.
[01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:02.700]   Dad's like coffee, right?
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:03.740]   If not get 'em blind.
[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:04.580]   You need it because of the kids.
[01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:05.420]   Or get 'em both.
[01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:06.980]   (laughs)
[01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:08.420]   It's name is Pontas.
[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:09.420]   Trespontas.
[01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:10.260]   Trespontas.
[01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:12.220]   Yeah, that's somebody said say it like,
[01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:14.300]   Sean Connery would say it.
[01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:15.140]   You'll get a right.
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:15.980]   Trespontas.
[01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:17.580]   (laughs)
[01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:18.420]   Mm.
[01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:23.140]   Renee Ritchie, that was my pick of the week.
[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:23.980]   What's yours?
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:26.420]   So my pick of the week, I'm gonna have to turn this
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:27.420]   to see if you can see it.
[01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:28.580]   So bear with me.
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:30.820]   Oh, this, I'm turning the camera
[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:33.300]   so that hopefully you can see the window here.
[01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:34.140]   Yes.
[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:35.140]   All I'm gonna say is,
[01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:37.460]   hey Siri, close the living room blinds.
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:38.300]   No.
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:40.940]   (humming)
[01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:41.780]   It's fantastic.
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:42.780]   (humming)
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:43.620]   And here they come.
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:44.780]   That is actually really great.
[01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:47.180]   And you could tie that to a routine, couldn't you?
[01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:48.540]   So that you could say,
[01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:50.100]   you know, like I'm going to bed or something
[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:50.940]   and we do all of it.
[01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:52.220]   Oh Leo, you can do so much.
[01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:54.780]   In HomeKit, you can have like the one accessory do it.
[01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:55.900]   Let me just turn it.
[01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:57.860]   Hey Siri, open the living room blinds.
[01:35:57.860 --> 01:35:58.860]   That is pretty cool.
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:35:59.700]   Who are these?
[01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:02.020]   Are these some particular company?
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:04.180]   These are the Lutron Serena blinds.
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:05.740]   And what's so cool about them is that you can just say,
[01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:07.220]   open the blind or close the blind.
[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:08.420]   You can assign them to a room.
[01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:10.220]   So I have two blinds assigned to the living room.
[01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:12.860]   Oh, this is what those guys were crawling around doing last week.
[01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:13.700]   Yes.
[01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:14.540]   (laughs)
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:15.380]   And you have zones.
[01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:17.140]   So you can say the living room and the dining room
[01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:19.580]   are part of the main floor or the basement zone.
[01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:20.420]   And then you can just say,
[01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:21.780]   close the basement blinds.
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:22.900]   You also have automation.
[01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:25.580]   So you can say when the motion detector detects me getting out
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:27.060]   of bed, open the living room blinds
[01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:29.220]   so that they're open by the time I get there.
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:30.060]   Nice.
[01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:31.300]   And these are black out blinds.
[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:32.540]   So you can set scenes too.
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:35.660]   So I can say movie time and it'll close the blinds,
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:37.740]   turn the lights to what I want,
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:39.780]   boot up the stuff that I want.
[01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:41.500]   You can just lose yourself in this.
[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:43.260]   I'm not doing everything with them yet,
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:46.300]   but just the ability to stand there like Tony Stark
[01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:49.020]   and just ask Jarvis to do all these things.
[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:51.660]   I've seen them in demos before,
[01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:54.020]   but just getting them is so much fun.
[01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:56.580]   I mean, they're almost Alex expensive,
[01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:59.060]   so they're not for the faint of heart.
[01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:01.580]   But if you do sort of want to take your home automation
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:02.420]   to the next level.
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:05.380]   That's the best thing about Japanese hotel rooms.
[01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:07.780]   Yes, they all have buttons to lower the blinds.
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:09.100]   Right.
[01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:10.500]   Now you don't even get translucent ones
[01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:11.340]   and long blackout ones.
[01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:13.220]   You can get whatever, they have a whole wide variety.
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:15.220]   SerenaShades.com.
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:18.020]   Siri enabled blinds from Lutron.
[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:20.100]   I think this is what Stacey Higginbotham got
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:22.540]   that fixed her blinds issue.
[01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:26.740]   'Cause she didn't blinds, it never did quite work.
[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:27.580]   Nice.
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:28.420]   And these are battery powered,
[01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:29.940]   so you do have to change the batteries when they run out,
[01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:31.100]   but hopefully that won't be for a while.
[01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:32.500]   SerenaShades.com.
[01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:33.340]   Andy?
[01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:37.940]   I've got a tentative pick.
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:39.580]   This is, it's called,
[01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:41.940]   it's an app called, a photo app called Photo Leamer.
[01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:43.900]   Oh, I love Photo Leamer.
[01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:44.900]   Yeah.
[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:45.740]   I use a lot of these.
[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:47.220]   This is from Mac fun.
[01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:50.900]   It is now part of Skylum Software.
[01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:53.740]   They renamed, they renamed it because they make windows stuff,
[01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:56.380]   so they couldn't call themselves Mac fun.
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:57.220]   Right, right.
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:37:59.220]   So, but it's been around for a while.
[01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:00.060]   Yeah.
[01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:00.900]   It's really cool.
[01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:03.340]   Now a lot of people who use like purpose built cameras,
[01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:05.140]   you know, like Sony's, Nikon's, whatever,
[01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:07.260]   they complain that the pictures that this camera takes
[01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:10.220]   aren't half as good as the ones that are taken by their iPhone.
[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:12.260]   And that's because their iPhone does a lot
[01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:14.500]   of intelligent processing to make it look,
[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:17.180]   make the skies look blue, they identify faces
[01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:19.540]   and do different sort of processing on the faces.
[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:21.780]   Photo Leamer is really cool because it brings that kind of
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:26.220]   smarts to automatic processing of not only your phone pictures,
[01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:28.940]   but essentially pictures are come from anywhere.
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:31.340]   So you can get all the advantages of having a purpose
[01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:34.020]   built camera, big sensor, good lights and sensitivity,
[01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:36.900]   zooms flashes, but also get without having to do a lot
[01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:40.460]   of twiddling around in Apple Photos or Lightroom
[01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:41.820]   or anything like that.
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:43.580]   And it's going to be bigger and bigger.
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:45.860]   There's a new version coming out just next month,
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:48.100]   a version 2.3.
[01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:50.460]   It's a particularly, it's the,
[01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:52.220]   I'm recommending definitely you download it
[01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:53.940]   because it's very, very simple.
[01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:55.420]   It's just one step.
[01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:57.380]   It just does some percolating and then shows you
[01:38:57.380 --> 01:38:58.620]   what it looks like.
[01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:01.420]   The only control that you have over it is that there's a simple
[01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:05.460]   left to right slider that lets you decide how much of the,
[01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:08.700]   how much are you looking at the photo as shot versus how much
[01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:11.940]   are you looking at the 100% enhanced version
[01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:13.300]   that photo leamer came out with?
[01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:16.580]   Maybe the photo leamer version is a little bit too intense.
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:19.140]   You want something that is a little bit closer to original.
[01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:21.100]   So you just push that slider back a little bit.
[01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:22.540]   But the other cool thing is that if you,
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:25.700]   you're on vacation and you've just shot like 400 pictures,
[01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:26.940]   you are not going to sit there.
[01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:29.460]   Even if you're in like Apple Photos,
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:31.980]   clicking auto, clicking auto, clicking auto,
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:33.740]   you can just drag all of them into this app.
[01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:36.180]   It'll process all of them and split them back out again.
[01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:37.580]   And then if you want to, you can,
[01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:39.540]   if you want to be a little bit more hands on,
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:42.340]   then go into photos or Lightroom and adjust them a little bit
[01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:43.340]   more the way you like.
[01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:47.540]   But the thing is, even if you are that hands on 80% will,
[01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:49.580]   80% of it will be pretty much done for you.
[01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:52.140]   It'll be so close that the only difference is going to be
[01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:55.220]   what you personally like, what your taste in pictures is.
[01:39:55.220 --> 01:39:59.540]   I came across it just last week because I just,
[01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:03.700]   I had 200 pictures from Roller Derby last weekend.
[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:07.860]   And it's, I am, I love editing five photos.
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:11.220]   When it comes to taking 200 pictures that are taken inside,
[01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:14.860]   like a very badly lit indoor ice arena
[01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:17.100]   with bad fluorescent lighting,
[01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:19.740]   it's like, I wish there were a tool that could do all of this
[01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:21.340]   for me automatically.
[01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:24.580]   And photo lemur was the app that I really, really liked.
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:27.700]   So I did wind up buying it and there,
[01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:29.900]   you can get a deal right now if you buy it ahead
[01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:31.380]   of the new version coming up in June.
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:33.500]   And so I decided to definitely go for that.
[01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:34.580]   - Well worth it.
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:38.100]   This is, you know, Scott Born is on the board of Skylam.
[01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:41.860]   And a lot, and of course Trey Radcliffe did the Aurora HDR,
[01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:42.900]   their HDR app.
[01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:44.580]   So this company is good.
[01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:48.060]   They do photo, I actually have been slowly moving over
[01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:52.060]   all my stuff from Adobe to Skylam stuff
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:54.300]   because it's very good and it doesn't have
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:56.620]   a monthly subscription fee.
[01:40:56.620 --> 01:40:59.660]   And it doesn't force me to use that crappy new Lightroom.
[01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:04.300]   So I don't know if they have yet got managed to end.
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:06.180]   That's the thing is the digital asset.
[01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:07.260]   - They're working on a library.
[01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:08.700]   - On a library management.
[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:12.620]   I'm kind of, I really like Luminar
[01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:14.580]   and it's great for like one off stuff.
[01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:17.380]   I haven't found, I'm really keen to see what they do
[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:18.980]   when they have a library management app.
[01:41:18.980 --> 01:41:20.300]   What I like about Lightroom,
[01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:22.500]   and you can still get either the old version
[01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:25.700]   or the new like CC version, which is designed to be cloud based.
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:28.300]   But when it comes down to, I have shot a thousand pictures
[01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:31.900]   at roller derby, I need to weed this down to the 500
[01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:33.180]   that are worth taking a look at.
[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:35.380]   And then the 200 that are maybe worth editing
[01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:36.780]   and then getting through all that editing
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:39.620]   really, really quickly, I just haven't found the groove
[01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:42.940]   for Luminar that I'm into with Lightroom.
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:45.500]   But I'm definitely, everything they've done
[01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:48.220]   has been high, high quality, unlike the Lightrooms,
[01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:50.940]   unlike the Adobe stuff, it's not platform agnostic.
[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:53.540]   It really is designed, it feels like a Mac app.
[01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:55.660]   And so I'm really keen to see.
[01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:57.780]   They did acquire Photo Leamer.
[01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:00.860]   They also acquired the CEO of the company.
[01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:03.220]   They had a press release just last week
[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:06.060]   about how they're creating a new like AI division.
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:08.380]   And so there's gonna be a lot more,
[01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:10.780]   the idea, the impression I get is that Photo Leamer
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:14.100]   is gonna continue as an easy to use standalone app
[01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:15.740]   that works with everything,
[01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:18.420]   but they will also be integrating some of the,
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:20.460]   some of the smarts that, some of the brains
[01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:23.340]   that created Photo Leamer are also going to be
[01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:26.140]   adding their expertise to Luminar.
[01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:28.620]   And that's gonna be better for all people, I think.
[01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:30.100]   - It's gonna be very interesting.
[01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:31.780]   - Even knowing this, I did pay 40 bucks
[01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:33.180]   for Photo Leamer because it was that good.
[01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:34.260]   - Yeah, I'm with you.
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:36.660]   It's very easy to use, which is one of the things.
[01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:37.860]   - One click, yeah.
[01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:39.820]   - There's another tool that will give you
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:41.380]   this huge panel of buttons.
[01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:43.220]   So look how sophisticated we are
[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:44.740]   in auto enhancing your picture,
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:46.500]   totally losing the plot that look,
[01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:49.020]   I want an auto enhance 'cause I don't want buttons
[01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:51.220]   and sliders, I want, here you go, idiot.
[01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:52.980]   Here is a much better version of what you gave us.
[01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:56.820]   Thank you, thank you smart AI Photo Editor.
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:00.460]   So this is why, also Lemurs are good.
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:01.300]   Lemurs are fun.
[01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:02.120]   - Nothing wrong with a Lemur.
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:04.660]   - Photoleamer.com.
[01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:05.680]   Alex Lindsay.
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:08.760]   - So I'm pretty excited about my pick.
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:10.980]   - You are, I think it was just released.
[01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:14.000]   At least I just found out about it this morning.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.040]   So I was looking around, I was doing my morning research
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:17.760]   to figure out what I was gonna finalize on
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:18.960]   and this popped up.
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:20.720]   So this is related to the little scan
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:22.080]   that we were talking about that I actually tweeted out.
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:24.160]   I tweeted the three-
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:25.760]   - Oh good, so Alex Lindsay on Twitter,
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:26.600]   you can see the-
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:30.200]   - But that's not what I'm recommending at least this week.
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:31.240]   What I'm recommending is the next thing
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:34.280]   I'm gonna try to apply that to, which is called FaceCap.
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:37.240]   And as far as I know, FaceCap was released in the next,
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:38.440]   in the last, very recently.
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:39.560]   - This is so creepy.
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:43.480]   - Now I retweet your tweet 'cause this thing you made of me.
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:44.480]   (laughing)
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:45.680]   It's just weird.
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:47.920]   - Now the thing to look at that, now that's Bella's 3D,
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:49.400]   I don't think that's available publicly yet.
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:50.400]   - This will be at some point.
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:52.000]   And you're looking at a Cinema 4D.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.160]   - Yeah, I rendered it out a Cinema 4D and it is,
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:57.440]   but that literally from the time I scanned you
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:59.280]   to the time I rendered that was like five minutes.
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:00.280]   - And this rotates, right?
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:01.120]   You can see my left.
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:02.600]   - I could rotate it, yeah.
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:03.440]   - Yeah, it's all in three.
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:05.520]   That's a 3D model of you.
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:07.160]   - So what is this next thing?
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:08.800]   - So this one is called-
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:09.960]   - Oh, this is wild.
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:10.800]   - FaceCap.
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:11.960]   - And if you-
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:15.640]   - So you hand me the phone so I can show people how it looks.
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:20.320]   So the idea is this is gonna use the front camera array
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:22.880]   on an iPhone X, it requires an iPhone X.
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:26.440]   And then you can see that, show my screen, if you would,
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:27.880]   please.
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:30.400]   So you can see as I'm talking,
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:32.400]   I kind of have to do it at a weird angle unfortunately,
[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:35.640]   but as I'm talking, it moves the face the most.
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:37.920]   So this is kind of like Animojis,
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:39.600]   but with an arbitrary head.
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:42.240]   Could you put this head on that face?
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:43.080]   - That's what I'm working on.
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:43.920]   That's what I'm working on.
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:44.760]   That's why I scanned it.
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:45.600]   I'm gonna work on it.
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:47.520]   - Yeah, yeah, so that's creepy as hell.
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:48.760]   - So that's why I wanted to get it.
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:52.360]   So anyway, what's different about this in Animojis
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:54.920]   is that this is actually recording the data
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:57.600]   and it's basically applying it as an FBX
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:00.240]   as a very standard way to transmit.
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:02.080]   So basically, you can mail it.
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:03.360]   I'm using airdrop.
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:06.080]   So what I can do is I can literally take that,
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.360]   the animation and--
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:10.040]   - And then wrap it with something that--
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:11.680]   - Basically send it back out.
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:13.040]   So what I have to do is what I have to do now
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:16.160]   is take the model that I shot of you and build blend shapes
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:18.240]   and then drive those blend shapes
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:19.560]   with what you're doing with the phone.
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:20.560]   - You make it sound easy.
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:22.120]   This is not probably something--
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:24.000]   - But here's the thing that's interesting about it
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000]   is that for those out there that are a little geeky.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.040]   Once we build the model, so once I built you,
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:31.440]   I could have anybody who wanted to drive your face,
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:33.240]   which is simply need the app.
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:34.080]   - Right.
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:34.920]   - You know, like--
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:35.920]   - Is this better than Animoji?
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:37.480]   I mean, it looks a little bit like Animoji.
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:38.800]   Does it a little bit more--
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:40.040]   - It's using basically the same,
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:41.480]   it's all the same tech as Animoji,
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:44.440]   but Animoji doesn't export the FBX data
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:46.080]   back out to your 3D applications,
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:48.640]   whether you're using My or Cinema 4D or 3D Max
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:50.320]   or whatever you're using out there.
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:52.680]   You can basically send this out into a file format
[01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:53.520]   that we can use.
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:57.600]   Well, the reason this, in my opinion, is very revolutionary
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:00.520]   is that now imagine--
[01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:01.960]   I think this is gonna be an explosion.
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:04.080]   This kind of technology is going to be an explosion
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:06.960]   for whether it's e-learning, corporate,
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:08.680]   or even YouTube content.
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:12.720]   The hardest part of animation is the facial animation.
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:14.960]   And while this is not going to replace
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:18.840]   the animations for Thanos, which were amazing, by the way,
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:20.920]   they-- it is not gonna replace that,
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:23.400]   it's not gonna be the next column.
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:26.080]   But imagine having, whether it's training materials
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:31.040]   or having even just imagine fun little YouTube videos
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:33.320]   where you can generate--
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:36.920]   you have some basic, mean emotions for the body,
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:39.240]   but the hardest part is all that facial animation,
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:41.560]   which you can now drive in real time.
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:43.640]   Export it out, put it on your character,
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:47.080]   and immediately have it all animated.
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:49.120]   I think that this kind of technology--
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:51.120]   and again, it's not that it wasn't possible before.
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:53.080]   There's plenty of facial animation,
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:54.560]   but it was a rig, and it was a thing,
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:56.280]   and it was a real technical person.
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:58.480]   Because this is using a standardized platform
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:46:59.560]   and a standardized output,
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:03.520]   once you build the receiving end of this in your app,
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:06.160]   for me, it's Cinema 4D, for other people, it's Maya,
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:10.640]   once you build that receiving app,
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:13.440]   what comes out of this phone from anybody's phone
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:15.480]   is gonna be a standardized output
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:17.520]   that can be applied to that quickly.
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:19.720]   So yes, there's a little bit of work on it,
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:23.120]   but it's super exciting.
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:24.880]   There's all kinds of fun content.
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:27.120]   I think that we're gonna see people using this
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:32.120]   in weeks or months that could be literally daily
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:36.680]   or weekly, whether it's comedy or commentary
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:40.640]   or whatever, done in 3D, because it's now suddenly
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:41.560]   very easy to do in this part.
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:43.440]   - How about fakes, though?
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:44.840]   I mean, is this also--
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:46.000]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.320]   The reality is that the thing is,
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:50.480]   the reality is that there's a lot of better ways
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.800]   to do fake stuff than this.
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:56.120]   There are ways, you've already seen being able to use AI
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:48:00.640]   to drive very realistic versions of someone's face
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:01.480]   with something else.
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:03.960]   So that kind of stuff's out there already,
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:05.800]   and this is more of a,
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:07.960]   I can build a cartoon version of Leo.
[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:08.800]   I could use that model.
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:10.840]   - It would obviously not be real, but still--
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:12.000]   - But it'd be really funny.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.280]   (laughing)
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:16.440]   - It would still hurt your feelings deeply, Leo.
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:17.720]   But imagine the thing is,
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:19.880]   is that there's like, a good example is,
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:22.160]   you know, another fun thing that we could build.
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:23.240]   I mean, we'll see if we can do it,
[01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:27.000]   but what if we did this for everyone?
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.960]   You know, like, get Andy and Renee and I and you.
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:32.400]   And there was like a fun little, you know,
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.160]   VR version of us, you know, that we could drive--
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:36.000]   - Sure.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:36.840]   - Little bits and pieces of it.
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:37.680]   - Sure.
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:40.160]   - It might not be the whole thing, the whole show, but maybe.
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:41.880]   But anyway, but the point is,
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:44.240]   is that there's lots of fun little bits and pieces
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:46.080]   that could be created that before
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:47.480]   was not gonna be something we would do,
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:49.560]   because it would be way too much work.
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:51.320]   But this is literally like, pick up your iPhone
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:54.200]   and do something, and it records all the audio with it.
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:55.360]   So you get the audio back,
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:58.760]   so we might have a better microphone and so on and so forth.
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:01.520]   But the point is, is that I can get all that audio back
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:04.200]   from my, someone anywhere in the world,
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:06.140]   I can get that data back and apply it immediately
[01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:08.680]   to a 3D character that I spent some time building
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:11.160]   and publish it, you know, the next day.
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:13.080]   You know, and I think for, again,
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:16.480]   for your kind of Samantha Bee kind of content
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:19.240]   or whatever, this could be a lot of fun.
[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:20.080]   - It's very cool.
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:22.040]   - Anyway, so I think that it's a.
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:23.600]   - Is it free to download?
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:26.160]   - It is free to download and the,
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:30.440]   it is free to download this, it's like $6 or $7.
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:33.680]   Okay, by the way, which is again, amazing
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:37.080]   that we've gotten to this economy that you can spend $6
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:39.560]   for something to export facial animation.
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:42.800]   - I've been doing this for a long time.
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:46.280]   - And like, can I describe that as
[01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:49.200]   suspiciously low amount of money?
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:52.680]   - Yeah, here's an app for, oh, by the way,
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:56.160]   we have these powerful servers in Russia and China
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:57.720]   that will process this.
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:01.200]   And what's great is it's processing it all on the phone.
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:02.600]   It's not even, you know, the funny thing is,
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:05.200]   is that it's grabbing all that because of that real-time data,
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:07.200]   it's grabbing all the real-time data from the phone.
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:09.800]   When I hit export, it's literally just sending it over
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:12.400]   airdrop to my computer.
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:14.000]   There's no, there's no weight at all.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.560]   And same thing with the Bella 3D,
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:17.160]   which is what I was using to scan your face.
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:19.280]   It's all being done on the phone.
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:20.760]   And that's not available yet,
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:22.640]   but perhaps sometime in the app stores.
[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:24.640]   - And I'll make it a choice when it's,
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:25.480]   - What's your app?
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:28.160]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, I'll make it a pick
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:29.400]   when it's available publicly.
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:30.240]   But it's--
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:31.160]   - That was pretty cool.
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:34.680]   - And the, but the thing is, is the idea
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:36.680]   that you could take $6 and export that.
[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:38.760]   I mean, the first time I did it, it was like,
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:40.800]   I think that when we did it 10 years ago,
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:43.360]   it was $1,000 a minute, you know,
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:45.720]   to have somebody else process that,
[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:46.920]   that's amazing for us. - It's amazing, yes.
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:48.680]   - And so now it's $6 on my iPhone.
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:49.520]   - Yeah.
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:50.720]   - Anyway, so I'm old enough that,
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:51.840]   and I've been doing this long enough
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:54.640]   to be really excited about cool technology.
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:55.640]   Anyway, this is a really cool one.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:57.840]   And again, it's free to download.
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:50:59.320]   You should, if you're listening to this,
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:01.400]   just for fun, just download it.
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:02.920]   Even if you don't have a 3D app, just download it
[01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:05.320]   and think about the things that you could do.
[01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:07.040]   - Think of all the things you could do.
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:07.880]   - Exactly.
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:08.720]   - You, Chia.
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:09.560]   - I'm amazed, we were just--
[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:10.480]   - You're also old.
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:11.840]   - Okay, sorry.
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:12.680]   - We were talking about your--
[01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:14.720]   - You're also old enough to have seen Westworld
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:17.280]   and a beige and the body snatchers and the stepford watch.
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:19.200]   - This does this on modern TV show, Andy.
[01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:20.680]   - It's so great though.
[01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:24.320]   - It's great until everybody dies.
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:25.160]   - Yes.
[01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:26.320]   - It's kind of like happy cows in California.
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:28.160]   - I'm just gonna have to start wearing a guy's socks
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:29.000]   everywhere I go.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.760]   - Great, and you get ahold of it.
[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:32.640]   - Exactly, he's gonna be very upset about this.
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:33.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:34.560]   (laughing)
[01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:36.080]   - Thank you, Alex, thank you, Andy.
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:37.320]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:39.720]   Renee Ritchie's at iMore.com.
[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:41.560]   Find his wonderful work there.
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:46.360]   Not just typewriting, but actual videography.
[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:47.520]   Go to iMore.com/factor.
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:48.360]   - Try it, Leo.
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:49.920]   - Yes, awesome stuff.
[01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:52.800]   Andy Inako is at Fast, often appears in Fast Company,
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:55.800]   and you can find his work at ihnateko.com,
[01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:57.480]   i-n-n-o-co.com.
[01:51:57.480 --> 01:51:59.240]   Alex Lindsey's on the Twitter,
[01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:02.320]   and that's where he puts images of my face and other things.
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:03.160]   - Fingers.
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:06.960]   - A-l-e-x-l-i-n-d-s-a-y,
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:08.000]   and your face on a plate.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.360]   - Founder, head on a plate.
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:12.280]   - Chief cooking bottle washer at the Pixel Core.
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:16.520]   Have a great week next week, whatever, wherever you may be.
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:17.440]   - I'm gonna be signing mostly,
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:19.000]   it's gonna be in South Pacific.
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.400]   - Oh, is it really?
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:21.240]   - Nice.
[01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:22.080]   - No.
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:22.920]   (laughing)
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:24.440]   - We will be here, don't forget Monday,
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:26.920]   10 a.m. Pacific for the live coverage
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:30.560]   of Apple's WWDC keynote, Megan Moroni and me.
[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:32.640]   We'll be talking all about it.
[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:35.520]   I hope you will join us 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern time,
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:38.000]   and of course, we'll be back one week from today
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.680]   to get the panel together, to assemble
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:43.440]   and talk about what it all means.
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:44.360]   Thank you for being here.
[01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:45.720]   We do Mac Break Weekly Tuesdays,
[01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:50.320]   11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time, that's 1800 UTC.
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:52.440]   If you wanna join us, you can in a couple of ways.
[01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:54.080]   You can always visit us in the studio,
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:57.880]   like David and Andre did, our Portuguese friends,
[01:52:57.880 --> 01:53:00.680]   via Sweden, they live in Sweden now.
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:02.140]   Who knows what that means.
[01:53:02.140 --> 01:53:05.360]   But you can just email tickets@twit.tv, we love having you.
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:07.200]   If you wanna watch live on the stream,
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:09.000]   you can do that, twit.tv/live.
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.520]   That's a whole different experience.
[01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:12.160]   You're not only watching the podcast,
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:14.320]   but the stuff that goes on in between,
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:18.400]   it's kind of the show about the show being made,
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:20.040]   I guess is the best way to describe that.
[01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:22.320]   Twit.tv/live, if you do that,
[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:24.600]   you should join the kids in the back of the class,
[01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:28.040]   the chatroom@irc.twit.tv.
[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:29.280]   Now, once the show is made,
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:32.600]   you can always get it on demand audio or video.
[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:34.640]   Every shows it, twit.tv, in this case,
[01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:37.760]   twit.tv/mbw.
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:41.080]   You can also subscribe in your favorite podcast application,
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.600]   and that way you wouldn't have to worry about it,
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:46.920]   you just automatically get it every time it's available.
[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:47.840]   Thank you for watching.
[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:51.240]   Now it's time to get back to work, 'cause break time is over.
[01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:53.820]   (upbeat music)
[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:56.400]   (upbeat music)
[01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:58.980]   (upbeat music)
[01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:01.060]   (upbeat music)
