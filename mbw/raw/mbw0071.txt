[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.560]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 71 for January 14,
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.640]   2008. What would Steve Jobs do?
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.200]   It's been an awful long time, but we're back together again.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.000]   The Mac Break Weekly crew.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.240]   In fact, we're really-- we're all assembling seriously.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.800]   Oh, you know who's missing in it before we get too far down
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.600]   the road?
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.160]   Mr. Andy and that co is also supposed to be with us today.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.520]   Let me introduce the group, and I'll
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.360]   see if I get a whole of Andy while we do so.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.720]   First of all, Scott Bourne.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.160]   I'm girls gone geek.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.400]   Hey, Scotty.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.760]   Hey, I'm now part of girls gone geek.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.600]   Wow, I don't look much like a girl.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.680]   Well, aren't you the evil genius behind girls gone geek?
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.400]   Well, OK.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.320]   I'm not an official girl geek.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.040]   I'm just crazy.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.760]   Yeah, I'm like the Simon Fuller of American Idol
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.600]   to a girls gone geek.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.800]   Simon Fuller.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.760]   I mean, Simon Lebon.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.280]   I think you mean Simon Le Bon.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.280]   Simon Le Bon?
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.320]   Simon Says.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.920]   Simon Fuller.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.240]   He's the original creator of American Idol concept.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.480]   Oh, not Simon Cowell.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.880]   No, Simon Cowell's just--
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.480]   He's just an ugly judge.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.920]   Simon Fuller.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.080]   Oh, he's the Brit guy probably who
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.280]   thought this whole thing up.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.120]   Got it.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.880]   Well, how would you like me to introduce you, Scott Bourne?
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.680]   I just joke it.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.560]   Our Apple Phone Show girls are going, you know,
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.400]   our Apple Phone Show girls gone geek.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.040]   And, uh, Paddango.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.480]   Paddango.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.880]   Merlin Mann.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.080]   I guess this is going to be a habit now.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.720]   Good morning, Leo.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.160]   How are you?
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.840]   Hello, Mr. Mann.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.360]   How was baby--
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.000]   He sounded like you're recuperating.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I was really stuffed up.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.800]   The reason we didn't have a Mac break weekly last week
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.840]   is because I was on my deathbed.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.560]   But for some reason, they didn't--
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.600]   I wasn't called, so I came back.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.120]   And I'm feeling a little better.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.920]   I'm still stuffed up.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.440]   But I'll be all right by tomorrow, because tomorrow is
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.040]   the big day Mac world Expo.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.800]   And that's what we're all gathered together here
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.080]   to do a pre-show show, Lil Arlay this week.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.400]   Merlin's at 43folders.com.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.520]   He's also the guy behind and now shipping Omni Focus.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.080]   Yeah, just me.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.160]   Well, we were like the big consultant.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.960]   You know what I like to do?
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.000]   You know how I like to work, Leo?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.440]   I just go heads down, and I just work really hard.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.960]   And so I was able to put out that entire package by myself.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.520]   The Omni Group thing is a front, you know?
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.560]   There is no Omni Group.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.760]   It's all Merlin Mann.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.800]   You know who I met?
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.280]   Do you know who Leaven-Leavenger is?
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.680]   The Leavenger catalog.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.440]   People love Leavenger.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.480]   The Leavenger circa?
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.920]   Is that what it's called, their little organizer?
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.120]   Yeah, they do a 3x5 card organizer, which is really cool.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.560]   It's kind of based on the hip-top PDA.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.840]   But it's using 3x5 cards, and you get them pre-printed,
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.800]   and they have leather holders, and they have a whole setup
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.720]   and stuff.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.480]   So I'm on the tour through Egypt.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.520]   And there's a college kid, college sophomore, pulls it out.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.200]   It's all pre-printed, nice leather thing.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.920]   He started taking those and said, oh, that's really neat.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.680]   You get that Leavenger, and he kind of smirks and laughs.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.600]   I said, you know, because they have that whole setup.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.400]   He kept getting right.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.400]   He said, no, it turns out his dad is Leavenger.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.880]   So the Leavenger catalog people were on the trip with us.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.840]   So that was kind of--
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.040]   So old, old index card money, has this kid flying all over?
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.040]   Old index card money, baby.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.040]   Actually, they were great people, Steve Levine
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.600]   and his wife, Lori, Kal and Corey, their kids.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.000]   Alex Lindsey is here.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.360]   He is also celebrating baby's first Christmas.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.960]   Yes.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.280]   How was that?
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.400]   It was great.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.960]   How come I'm happy?
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.560]   He's great.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.400]   His mother-in-law got him a Santa suit, which--
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.360]   I think actually people go up to my little blog.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.480]   I think there's some pictures of him, at least with the hat on.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.800]   He didn't really like the Santa suit that much,
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.720]   but the hat is makes him look like a little elf.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.080]   It seems like you and Merlin both kind of dedicated
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.920]   to humiliating your children early on.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.200]   He has no idea what she's in for.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.120]   Lori's got bunny ears.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.360]   Alex has got a Santa suit.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.360]   I have to say that he's probably the most well-documented.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.560]   I think probably both of our kids.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.960]   But I know for me--
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.880]   Well, the most well-documented kid I've ever seen,
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.040]   because I'm going to shoot probably 20 or 30 photos a day.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.600]   Holy cow, yeah.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.720]   I'm going to have a series coming up
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.880]   where we'll be dressing her up as popular comedians
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.080]   of the '30s and '40s.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.280]   So we're doing W.C. Fields.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.480]   Oh, I like that.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.840]   Harpo marks.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.880]   That's really good.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.640]   Also-- all of the Ritz brothers also.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.440]   See, then that's fun because nobody even
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.320]   remembers the Ritz brothers, so it could really be anything.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.160]   Right?
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.680]   That's the story.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.600]   Does anybody remember the Ritz brothers?
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.120]   No.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.080]   They were kind of a cut rate marks brothers.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.800]   A lot of people think they were not as good as the marks
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.320]   brothers.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.080]   That's what people say.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.200]   On the spectrum, three stooges to marks brothers
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.640]   were they kind of in the middle?
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.000]   I mean, I think a lot of people would
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.160]   say that they were kind of like Europe was to Led Zeppelin,
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.600]   in the sense of like that their act was so similar in an approach
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.240]   that-- and so not as good that--
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.720]   I'm just--
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.920]   I don't want to get in trouble here,
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.240]   because these Ritz brothers, people, they can be pretty tough.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.240]   And they will find you.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.360]   They're like the wrong-- all people.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.200]   You don't want to mess with them.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.480]   So glad Annie and Naco's not here,
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.600]   because we get some sort of silver surf or analogy.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.640]   We just go on forever.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.000]   So we'll get Annie on.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.400]   We're still working.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.720]   Chris Brain is also here.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.680]   The Mac Daddy.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.720]   The Buffet of all Mac knowledge.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.560]   Yes, I am.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.160]   Yeah, and the hair is looking spectacular this week.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.480]   Have you pumped it up for the show you have?
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.960]   I have.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.240]   Yeah, I've got some special goo that I reserved for just this week.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.960]   And so I've applied it liberally, and it's just going to--
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.520]   And it's a cumulative thing.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.560]   So by Friday, my hair is going to be like ethel merman.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.920]   It's soft, but manly.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.880]   And tall.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.680]   And tall.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.800]   And it's like burning man.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.480]   It'll be like burning man.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.640]   There's a big build up, and then at the end,
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.600]   we just set it on fire.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.880]   We do, exactly.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.760]   And because it is so tall, I've got about 15 minutes
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.720]   to put it out, because it starts from the top
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.760]   and burns its way down.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.880]   And I can stop it after about 10 minutes.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.520]   And by the way, Chris, according to IDG staff,
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.320]   the reason we all have to be at the speakers lounge so early
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.600]   this year is because they needed to get you in early,
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.640]   because your hair was so high and they got to get a crane.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.320]   Well, that's right.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.200]   And my staff has to come in early, too,
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.600]   to start preparing it.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.040]   I like how he calls his entourage, his staff.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.600]   Well, it is my staff, because it's--
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.040]   now that Brother James has passed on,
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.520]   I now have his people working for me now.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.920]   So Brother James--
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.400]   Yes.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.280]   Artis working man and show business, Mr. Dynamite,
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.120]   Soul Brothers and the group.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.440]   That was part of your staff.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.360]   I didn't know that.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.040]   Well, they are now, because once Brother James passed on
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.400]   and they finished, I'm dead to her.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.240]   No, really, seriously, I am so dead now, to her.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.880]   They had nothing to do.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.200]   I actually interviewed James Brown once,
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.200]   and I went to the show before I did the interview.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.520]   And he was really late.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.120]   The Soul Brothers, they start--
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.120]   Doo-doo-doo-doo.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.360]   Ladies, gentlemen, doo-doo-doo, Mr. James Brown.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.440]   And he doesn't show up.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.800]   And they go, doo-doo, they vamp for vamp vamp.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.680]   And I found out later when I did the interview
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.360]   that he actually did have a hair implosion.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.160]   There was a hair problem.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.280]   So later in his life, it was harder to get it up than--
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.760]   well, I guess that's true for all of us.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.680]   But I am not--
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.680]   I'm not--
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.120]   Hand to God.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.800]   It's the truth.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.360]   So let's talk about-- we're going to--
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.680]   every one of you is--
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.960]   every one of you-- and I'm still trying to get Andy in that car,
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.520]   I'm sure we will.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.560]   He's in Chinatown-- or I'm sorry, a Japan Town Hotel.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.280]   And it may be that right at this moment,
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.960]   his back is getting walked on.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.120]   So he can't join us.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.400]   But we'll keep trying.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.120]   Every single one of you is doing some sort of elaborate
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.320]   presentation at Macworld.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.560]   And so we'll give you a chance later on in the show
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.480]   to plug these elaborate presentations.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.320]   This is going to be a short show, though, because really,
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.160]   we are doing a lot of Mac break weeklies this week.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.320]   We've got one tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.800]   right after the keynote, which we'll probably
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.240]   be able to get to pushed out to you
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.880]   by early afternoon Pacific time.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.240]   And then another one, Thursday.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.880]   Why are we doing that one, Alex?
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.920]   That's kind of covering the one after two--
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.720]   the one right after the keynote is just about the keynote.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.640]   Yeah, obviously.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.600]   As we look at the Thursday one, it's really about the show,
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.680]   the things that we saw that stuck out on the show--
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.000]   By then we'll see some stuff.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.120]   But then we will have walked around.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.120]   Best I-Podix accessory, that kind of thing.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.480]   I think it's like 4 o'clock.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.120]   It's right before--
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.360]   Don't you have the PDF?
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.320]   I got it around here somewhere.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.320]   Hold on.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.280]   I printed it out.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.440]   I have to say I printed it out, and it prints out really
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.320]   tiny if you try to get it on one page.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.200]   I couldn't read it.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.400]   No, no, Mac break weeklies at 1,600,
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.400]   if somebody will only be glad.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.640]   I don't know why Alex uses this.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.840]   Right before girls go on Zulu time.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.040]   Zoom.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.840]   1,600 Thursdays.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.440]   1,600--
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.200]   4 o'clock.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.560]   4 o'clock.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.920]   Thursday.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.560]   OK, and then there's a Mac break tech.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.560]   But there's a whole lot of stuff.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.360]   You know what I'm going to do?
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.200]   Here's what I'm going to do.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.640]   You sent me a revised one, and I'm
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.240]   going to attach that PDF-- well, not attach it,
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.800]   but I'll push it out on this feed right after this show.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.520]   I was going to push it out earlier than I thought.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.360]   People go, oh, great, a new Mac break weekly,
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.560]   and then they'd get this PDF.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.720]   And they go, oh, never mind.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.480]   But now they'll have a Mac break weekly and a PDF,
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.160]   telling you everything that is going on at this--
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.600]   it's in the West Hall.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.960]   It's really-- it's a really big theater.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.480]   I got a little nervous looking at it yesterday.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.520]   So the Thursday one's going to be at that place, too.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.000]   Everything.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.400]   They're all-- yeah, everything's there.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.520]   Oh, it's basically there.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.480]   We got three Mac break weeklies this week.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.280]   Yes.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:43.680]   Yes.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.760]   Which is why we're valuing our time.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.240]   That's why this one's going to be short.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.680]   That's why this minute is jammed.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.720]   So good night, everybody.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.280]   And thank you very much.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.280]   That's why we're--
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.280]   That's why we're so quick here.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:53.920]   --we're so quick here.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.720]   Bleed from the ears, Mac break experience.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.120]   Oh.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.560]   Well, and it's not only Mac break weekly,
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.560]   but we're scheduling out about 20 Mac breaks.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.560]   So there's-- we've got--
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.560]   Just case.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.760]   --just in case you missed anything.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.240]   If you want to see the video part,
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:13.120]   we've got like six crews that are running in different times.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.800]   And we've got--
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.760]   Callie Lewis, Justine Esrich, Kendra,
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.440]   who's always been on the Mac breaks,
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:25.000]   and also Kirsten Sanford from This Week in Science.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.680]   So they're going to be wandering all over the place
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.280]   in addition to the--
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.080]   You're doing that on Thursday?
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.640]   We're doing it every day.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.720]   Oh, I could do that on Thursday.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.440]   That'd be fun.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.240]   You couldn't?
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.120]   Oh, let's grab Merlin.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.440]   We'd love to have you.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.000]   Next year, Paul Kent says they're
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.120]   going to name the show Mac break Expo.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.120]   It's really odd.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.200]   It's really odd.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.920]   So it should be good, both Mac break and--
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.360]   and I said, the studio is going to be--
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.040]   it's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.000]   We're really getting into both doing all these podcasts,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   but we have a lot of how-to's, how we do green screen
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.480]   and camera work and video shows.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.360]   And we also got-- we've got a trainer from NPR
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.240]   talking about recording and audio and stuff like that,
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.320]   as well as tons and tons of podcasts.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.880]   So it should be-- it's really going to be worth checking out.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.560]   Excellent.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.760]   Excellent.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.800]   But we'll get more and more depth and detail
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.800]   about all those things coming up.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.320]   But first, I think really-- let's get down
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.320]   to the meat of the matter.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.520]   And that is tomorrow-- what is it?
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.960]   Is it 9 a.m., Steve takes the stage?
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.840]   9 a.m., although we get to be there like hours before.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.440]   6 a.m., what are they opening for?
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.440]   The hardcore fans.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.040]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.480]   Well, oh, yeah.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.400]   Some people have to be there at like 6.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.600]   Some of us have to be there at 7.15.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.200]   What-- why do you only have to be there at 7.15, Mr. Paul?
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.720]   7.15 is when the speakers lounge closes.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.280]   Those speakers lounge.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.840]   Those who are part of the conference faculty.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.880]   Not us, OK.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.400]   Yeah, but you--
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.040]   No, we are.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.920]   We are.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.680]   Yeah, the thing is, is if you already have your pass,
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.640]   if you don't have your pass-- well, this is all inside baseball.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.920]   We could talk about that in the next episode.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.840]   But anyway, if you are a normal human that
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.720]   has a simple Macworld Expo pass, you should get there at--
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.920]   Now, 4 o'clock.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.280]   Live or clock.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.160]   4 a.m., they open the doors.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.400]   They open the doors for that crew at 6 a.m.,
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.200]   and it will--
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.720]   The line will start at 6.16.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.400]   You think the line will start at 4?
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.320]   That's what it usually does.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.920]   We go out the cupboard.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.520]   It does officially at the-- every year at the Apple Store
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.520]   on Stockton, they have a kind of group photo,
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.560]   and they start at 4 a.m.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.280]   It's been-- it's been traditionally, you know?
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:31.600]   You know what?
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.960]   And it's nice, as if you get there early.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.000]   They have free coffee and leads on girlfriends.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.920]   She's at 4 a.m.?
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.960]   4 a.m.?
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:39.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.880]   Yeah, there's a lot of chicks there at 4 a.m.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.400]   One or two here.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.000]   There's a girl who'll date geeks in Detroit.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.960]   So wait a minute, though.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.920]   But why are they lining up at the Apple Store, which
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.480]   is blocks from Moscone Center?
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:51.960]   Well, they do a--
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.400]   They do a group photo.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.160]   Group photo, and then you walk together on--
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.040]   Then they walk together down to--
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.040]   Walk together down to the Moscone, which is only
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.400]   like two blocks away.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.240]   OK.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.360]   And they'll-- OK, so--
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.360]   And if you don't get there--
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:05.960]   Let it sit.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.280]   If you don't get there pretty early,
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.920]   your chances of getting in as a normal human are pretty poor.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.400]   Right?
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.200]   OK.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:13.560]   There.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.720]   Or you end up in the overflow room.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.320]   Oh, they're-- OK, then they do that, too, right?
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.720]   They put video out.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.960]   So even though you've got the past to get into keynote,
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.440]   the keynote passes are much harder to come by this year,
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.360]   because everybody wants to see it.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.480]   So they're bringing a lot of press in.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.000]   But so likely, you're going to be shoved off into an overflow
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.280]   room if you're not there at the crack of dawn.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.240]   Wow.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:39.440]   And now Chris Breen, as a esteemed member of the Macintosh
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.160]   Press Elite, working for Macworld Magazine, you probably
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.400]   just show up like 858.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.920]   Well, it depends on how I want to go in.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.840]   I could go in as a press person, or I could go in as a speaker.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.200]   And generally, I go into as a speaker just because those
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:54.840]   are my peeps.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.960]   And so I like to hang with them.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.480]   You like to hang with the speakers, not the press.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.080]   Because constantly, you know, Mossberg's always
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.520]   asking me for insight information and told to go get back off.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.240]   You guys find a decent source somewhere else.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.400]   Mm.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.240]   That was the truth.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.200]   You just want to go because we get free breakfast.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:13.720]   OK.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.520]   Actually, that's right.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.360]   But the press sometimes will get a cup of coffee.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.040]   How many people can get into this room?
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.520]   Only those that have a conference faculty badge
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.800]   or a special Alex ban.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.040]   No, no, I'm in to see into.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.520]   I don't care about the speaker's room.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.760]   Oh, how many people can get into C Steve?
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.320]   I think it's 2000.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.000]   Really?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.800]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.400]   I spoke at WWDC in the same room that they do.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.520]   I think they're the same room that they're doing it in.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:41.120]   And there in the space that I was speaking in held about 1,100
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.600]   people and not that there were 1,100 people there,
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.360]   but it had 1,100 seats.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.240]   And I was told that was like half or less.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.680]   So it was probably like 2,500 or 3,000, I think.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.720]   And I don't know if it's in the same room this year,
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.600]   but that's where it was before.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.600]   And this will be a speech.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.720]   OK, everybody gets a chance to vote on this.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.840]   A, worth getting up at 4 in the morning and waiting in line 4.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.080]   B, worth getting in the overflow room 4.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.080]   C, worth staying home and refreshing and gadget every five
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:11.800]   minutes.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.840]   Or D, watching leave it to Beaver reruns until your brother
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.920]   in law calls you and says, hey, did you hear what Steve said?
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.320]   So are they doing a live stream this year?
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:22.960]   Who knows?
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.680]   They don't even really--
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.440]   No, I don't think so.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.840]   I think they post the video later.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.800]   So I have to say back in the old days,
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.680]   when they did the live stream, when they could do the live
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:30.880]   stream.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.680]   And of course, you had to get in early because otherwise you
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.520]   couldn't get into the feed.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.800]   It was really fun to sit around.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.360]   We'd sit around and we'd let it play.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.800]   And we'd be doing whatever talking and having bagels
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.600]   and watching it.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.400]   And that was fine.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.160]   I didn't really need to feel like I needed to be there.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.480]   For then, for two years, I actually went to the keynote.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.840]   And then last year, I was like, I don't want to get the keynote.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.520]   Too much trouble.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.520]   And I feel like I'm going to--
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.600]   You skipped the iPhone keynote?
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.360]   I did.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.320]   Oh my god.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.840]   Because that was probably a pretty important one.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.600]   What I'm asking you is--
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.800]   It's pretty-- the thing is, guys--
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.280]   I missed it.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:00.640]   I missed it.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.720]   I wish I had been there.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.440]   It's pretty well covered.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.800]   And that's what I'm saying is how important is it
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.240]   that you see this one in person?
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.760]   But you missed the distortion field.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.000]   You missed the distortion field.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:10.680]   That's the problem.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.480]   You have a good thing.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.080]   You have the same error, Steve.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.720]   And you missed the giddy excitement of the audience.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.000]   I'm so sick of the giddy excitement at that.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.360]   Yeah, but you get the really good seats.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.480]   I see you're the one that's escorted to the front.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.080]   Leo's like, oh, can we bluff?
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:25.520]   You know, you're--
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.600]   You did do that for you.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.120]   And they did do that once.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.520]   I know I saw that.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.120]   It was a really-- I got there really late.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.000]   The traffic was bad.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.440]   And they said, oh, Leo.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.080]   And they brought me in.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:35.580]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.800]   But I don't think they'll do that this time.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.280]   And here is your eye fluffer.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.040]   You know, I think I'm with C.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.840]   C the one where you reload--
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.240]   And gadget over and over.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:45.740]   Yeah.
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.480]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.440]   It sounds like fun.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.640]   But it is early.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.320]   So even though we have arranged for you, Merlin Mann,
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.720]   to get in there with them and even have that donut
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.360]   or whatever it is you get in the speaker's room.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.280]   You've arranged for that?
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.960]   I have a faculty pass, my friend.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.120]   OK, whatever.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.360]   But someone arranged for it.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:00.840]   I didn't--
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.840]   No, no, no.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.840]   You know all the other things.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.680]   You have that precious pass.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.560]   You've got the golden ticket, my friend.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:07.760]   Well--
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.600]   I don't have pass.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.400]   It's-- I could let me put it this way.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.760]   I completely understand why people are excited about this.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.960]   But I think I got to say, I mean, I am personally
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:22.080]   getting a little bit worn to the nub
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.280]   with madness over things that aren't really--
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.240]   what kind of the madness over something
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.560]   that you can do get plenty of coverage of what
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.480]   happened there in 10 minutes?
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.200]   Like this whole live blogging thing?
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.200]   I mean, this has got to be the nadir of journalism
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.640]   is typing what music is playing while people walk in.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.080]   I just feel like for myself, I'm glad stuff is happening
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.960]   and I'm excited to hear what happens.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.560]   But I don't know.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.840]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.080]   I just don't feel that same need to be there.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:51.480]   I don't know.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.240]   Maybe I'm just--
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.760]   And you can always just listen to our podcast that later
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.280]   that afternoon.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.320]   We'll give you all the details and everything that happened.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.280]   Well, I will say there is one advantage of being in the room
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.640]   is that you can see how the crowd reacts to stuff.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.520]   And sometimes, Steve will announce something and say,
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.520]   hey, guess what?
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.240]   Dot back, it's so great.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.440]   And it's only going to cost you.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.960]   And then there's sort of silence or this intake of breath.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.960]   Which is a journalist.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.600]   As a journalist, you get that tonality better.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.320]   You get the tonality and it's like, oh, OK.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.600]   So this isn't really going over.
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.440]   But you wouldn't get that from the feed.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.040]   Because you're Apple--
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.400]   they dub in the applause track.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.000]   I'm not trying to be like Mr. Hip here.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.800]   I do not begrudge anybody the desire to be here.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.000]   Because it's an exciting event.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.200]   It's totally cool.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.880]   But there's just so much hype around so many things nowadays
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.960]   that it's just--
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.480]   God, I mean, you can only take so much.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.040]   And then, of course, everything just goes away.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.680]   And then, a week later, it's not a big deal anymore.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.760]   Because everybody knows it.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:41.760]   I don't know.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.360]   I'm probably being a little bit of a--
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.560]   Scott, Scott, how about you?
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.320]   Are you going to be in line at 4 AM, 7 AM,
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.800]   watching an un-gadgeter at home, watching "Leave It to Beaver?"
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.480]   If I don't have the ticket, I'm more than likely--
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.320]   unless I think it's an iPhone type announcement,
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.440]   I'm more than likely just going to watch it online
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.760]   through one of the--
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.480]   I think we're all pretty much in agreement.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.360]   Because Chris Brain, who's the guy who says
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.600]   you want to be there for the feel, the vibe.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.440]   Yeah, I like the feel factor.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.600]   If you can't get into the keynote,
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.720]   look for the girls' gongy.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.240]   They're wandering around having a--
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.960]   you couldn't get into the keynote party.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.840]   Really?
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.440]   Yeah, they're going to-- like, on the street,
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.840]   they're going to say, we're just all
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.440]   going to hang out together and commiserate
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.040]   for those who couldn't get in.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:23.800]   I think that's nice.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.240]   That's the real people.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.520]   Yeah, so I guess, finally, I've been delaying it
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.720]   because I just saving the best for last.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.640]   What the hell is he going to say?
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.640]   Mm.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.120]   Ah!
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.600]   We've talked about this like on @infiniteum.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.240]   And I think we're--
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.400]   remember last Mac break weekly, eight years ago,
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.040]   we talked about the fact that there probably
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.880]   would be an updated iPhone, HSDPA.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.560]   That's probably that's something's in the air banner.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.320]   That 16 gigs probably.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.400]   That's no big deal.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.880]   Everybody knows about that.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.920]   AT&T already announced it.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.880]   Pre-announced it.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.080]   There's some-- now we debated.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.280]   Andy and Akko said he thought there would be a tablet device.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:05.400]   Others are-- like Merlin are hoping for a ultra lightweight
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.600]   MacBook.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.120]   Now here's the thing I found interesting.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.760]   Last week's announcement of the Mac Pros just slipped right out.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.960]   Now that'd be a-- that'd be a--
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.080]   fine, a decent-- a certainly acceptable Mac world keynote
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.400]   announcement, especially since they're
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.080]   eight-way, the most powerful servers ever made,
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.800]   the most powerful desktops ever made.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.240]   You know, he could get some mileage out of that.
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.720]   And yet they-- they actually shoved it aside a week ago.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.440]   Sounds to me like he might have something big up his sleeve.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.200]   Did I tell you I got Leo'd?
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.360]   No, what happened?
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.920]   You bought him-- you bought him-- you bought-- no.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:39.720]   You bought him?
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.560]   I bought a four-prock on Monday.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.040]   Aw.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:42.880]   Why?
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.360]   Oh, man.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.160]   Because I had given up.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.320]   I had given up-- well, here's the problem.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.840]   I have a presentation next week that I have--
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.760]   I needed an Intel tower.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.560]   And I've been waiting for the new boards.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.560]   And so I was waiting for the boards
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.480]   and waiting for the boards.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.600]   And I had to do the presentation.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.080]   I needed one Intel tower.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.000]   And so I finally was like, you know,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.520]   even if they released one next week,
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.880]   I just need-- I need the computer.
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:02.800]   And so I bought it on one day.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.840]   And of course, Tuesday came out.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.320]   No, of course--
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:04.920]   You could exchange it.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.200]   I mean--
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:05.720]   I did.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.160]   I did.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.320]   So I have the A-prock now.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.320]   And it is--
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.320]   How is that?
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.320]   Is it fast?
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:10.320]   Wow.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.320]   You could tell?
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:11.320]   Wow.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.160]   That meant even doing every other normal--
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.040]   every day normal things you can't tell, no.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.800]   No, I mean, I don't do everyday normal things on it.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.040]   I mean, you know, I'm doing 3D and we're doing live captures.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:19.840]   I mean, the thing is--
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:19.840]   I like to see--
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.200]   I like to see--
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.000]   He doesn't do everyday normal things.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.280]   Well, that's what laptops are for, not towers.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.120]   And so the-- so the--
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.000]   I just all I have to say is that I put three cheap drives
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.440]   into the extra three bays and the software raids area.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.080]   And it's the little disk utility.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.400]   Getting like 230 megabytes a second.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:36.920]   Wow.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.920]   And the A-procks-- you know, if you use iStat--
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.640]   one of my favorite little things, iStat menus, you can see all
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.520]   the little A-procks and their little feedback.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.000]   And it's really fun to watch them all turn on.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.360]   Well, Randy--
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:52.360]   Do you agree with me that it's odd that they announced that?
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.880]   Not at all for Macworld.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.360]   No, Macworld is a consumer show.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.760]   They need to get those products out.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.600]   The products are ready.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.840]   They can't like not sell them.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.760]   They were long on their two.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.920]   But here's my theory.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.960]   If you don't have a lot of stuff to announce at Macworld Expo,
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.160]   you save that.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:06.680]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.240]   So he probably has things he wants to talk about.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.120]   But I think he also doesn't want to have a schizophrenic--
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.200]   a schizophrenic--
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.160]   Yeah, no, traditionally, they don't announce the high-end stuff,
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.640]   the pro stuff at Macworld Expo.
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.480]   I understand that.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.400]   I would like to announce a very small, but significant change
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.840]   of heart.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.480]   I have a weird feeling that we're going
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.880]   to see something that we never would have guessed.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.000]   I mean, I know what happens every year to a certain extent.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.360]   There's so much focus right now on the little subcompact
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.960]   and on this idea of the iTunes Reynolds, which it sounds like
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.800]   is a pretty good bet.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.280]   And that might all be included.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.760]   But I got to tell you, the last--
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.280]   actually, Scott, since we did the Apple phone show together,
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.720]   I've been thinking more about this.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.840]   And I just-- I got a weird feeling about this.
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.000]   I got a weird feeling there's going to be something like--
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:51.920]   I'm there.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.760]   Really?
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.160]   Again, we talked about this a little bit last time.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.600]   If we could cast our mind about for the one thing,
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.960]   what is the thing we would never see coming without being
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.680]   goofy and glib?
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.880]   It's not going to be a microwave.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.200]   But unless it's a microwave.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.200]   But you know what I mean?
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.960]   Like, there's something-- there's some part of me that goes,
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.280]   you know what?
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.040]   There's going to be a thinner MacBook.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.800]   Yeah, maybe they'll announce the side-teens thing,
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.240]   especially to show their competing with Netflix.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.480]   But like, what-- something in me wonders
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.520]   if there's going to be a complete out-of-left field
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.280]   you never would have guessed announcement.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.120]   You guys agree?
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:29.040]   What do you guys think of the rumor of YMAX?
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.440]   Have you seen that?
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.080]   What's the rumor?
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.840]   The rumor is that they're going to talk about an integrated
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.640]   YMAX into possibly the laptops and other things.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.560]   That's a yawn.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:40.880]   Where are you getting YMAX from?
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.440]   Yeah, who's offering YMAX?
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.760]   Sprint will in the spring?
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.600]   Yeah, big deal.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.360]   That's just another thing.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.720]   I think that's not consumer focused enough
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.360]   for the average person.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.360]   It's another 3G, I don't--
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.360]   I'm thinking like, though.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.120]   I mean, so--
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:53.960]   I'm with you, Merlin.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.680]   I'm getting a weird vibe.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.680]   And I'm not even thinking of--
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.440]   I'm not necessarily even thinking of hardware,
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.560]   although it could be hardware.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.960]   Hardware, the thing is, if he needed--
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.360]   I don't know.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.080]   He might feel like he needs big hardware announcement.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.280]   But it could be really interesting
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.920]   if he comes up with some completely out of nowhere
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.800]   business relationship that catches everybody off guard.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.280]   It's one.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.200]   Chris, one to keep in mind.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.400]   Chris Breen, what do you think?
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.840]   I'm really pushing content on this one.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.960]   I think this rental deal is important.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.880]   And I think people have written off the Apple TV.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.200]   I think the Apple TV is going to be a huge business
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.640]   for Apple.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.120]   So that in a year's time, we're going to look back on this
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.840]   and say, oh, it wasn't a hobby after all.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.880]   But this was really a key part of getting Apple
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.640]   into the living room.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.840]   Because I think, yes, Apple can do this sub notebook.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.160]   And I think they will.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.080]   But what kind of market do they really have?
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.920]   That's not that innovative right now.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.440]   So no, it's just another piece of--
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.400]   I really want that.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.320]   But it's not innovative.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:50.680]   Right.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.720]   But look at the landscape of television.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:52.920]   Right.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.120]   That is huge.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.720]   I video into "Man is Killer."
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.040]   So--
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.920]   So IPTV play.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.160]   I mean, so I think really--
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.760]   I need to-- I can easily see Apple TV 2
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.760]   and then make Apple TV compatible
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.360]   so that it does a lot of this new stuff.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.840]   But Apple TV 2 that does things that not our DVR.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.560]   We don't need that.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.760]   Other people do that.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:11.840]   Announce it on the same day.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.160]   Announce it on the same day that you
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.040]   announced the relationships that enable you
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.320]   to rent movies on iTunes.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.040]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.040]   That you have to go.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.240]   All of a sudden, Apple TV's should look a lot more interesting.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.160]   Well, and I think more importantly,
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.960]   it allows you to rent from the Apple TV.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.320]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.600]   Is that I don't want to go--
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.240]   that was one of the deciding factors
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.880]   of why my TV at home was hooked to a Mac mini instead
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.120]   of an Apple TV is because I wanted the whole thing
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:32.760]   in one computer.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.600]   Yeah, you have to be able to rent from or--
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.280]   and then have the option to purchase later.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.840]   You want to be able to control the interface
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.200]   with your iPod touch or your iPhone.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.320]   You want it to be able to-- you want to be out and about
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.600]   and you're on your iPhone and go, OK, oh, good.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:45.760]   I want to rent this now.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.600]   And it automatically starts and time like that.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.200]   Dropping it to your Apple TV as well as--
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:49.720]   It's still--
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.120]   --bring it to your iPod.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.800]   Like a series 3T vote where you'd be able to say,
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:53.360]   oh, I forgot.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:53.860]   Yeah.
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:54.680]   You know, there's this thing that I like.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:54.780]   Exactly.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:55.600]   In your hand.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.520]   I like that.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.520]   And that video goes wherever you want.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:04.320]   I'm starting to think that it might be a revamped Apple TV.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.960]   Otherwise, Apple TV is kind of dead.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.880]   So sort of revamped Apple TV would be a big deal,
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.040]   especially tied, like you say, to the-- we all kind of anticipate
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.200]   they're going to announce the rental.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.160]   So tying that strongly to that, that could be a pretty big deal.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.160]   But my prediction also is, like Merlins,
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.240]   is that it'll be something out of the left field.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.080]   And I'm going to do something that's crazy.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.440]   I'm going to call it-- it's a digital camera.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.640]   I said that before.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.640]   It's the Apple digital camera.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.760]   It's not unheard of.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.680]   They've done it before.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.240]   Yeah, the quick take.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.680]   It could be a little point and shoot camera along the lines
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.680]   of the iPhone.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.640]   Hey, you got to pick something out of left field.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.600]   It's left field.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.440]   I don't think they want to get in that business.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.080]   I got to point out-- you guys may disagree with me.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.120]   But iTunes Music Store is under major assault.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.040]   None of the record labels now are basically saying,
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.440]   we're going to sell DRM-free music.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.760]   Tony just did this.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.640]   Universal's done it.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.800]   AMI is the only one selling it on iTunes.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:05.280]   The rest are offering it through Amazon and not through iTunes.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.960]   And I think that the record companies are basically saying,
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:12.280]   we're going to make sure that iTunes Music Store is castrated
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:12.640]   here.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.640]   Well, the real question to those is that do we
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.680]   see Jay Z on stage tomorrow?
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.880]   I see Paul McCartney on stage.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.080]   And that's right, finally.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.320]   A yellow iPod.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.920]   I'm not going to say anything about that,
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.680]   but I do see Paul McCartney on stage.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.360]   I've since before.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.160]   We talked about this on Scott's show the other day.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.080]   And as I say, I'm not much of a forecaster with this stuff.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.120]   But I do think it's really interesting
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.560]   to look at how much of Apple's stuff
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.600]   is moving toward not being a desktop computer
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.280]   and not being tied to the US on your desktop.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.920]   And so that's why I keep-- now, oh, by the way,
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.920]   just from a couple episodes ago, I did install that remote control
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:55.040]   app that I talked about for running your Mac from your iPhone.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:55.800]   It's insane.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.880]   It's so cool.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.280]   It's sort of like the thing Alcord put together in Google
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.720]   code, but kind of more sophisticated.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.960]   There's all these hooks into different applications.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.320]   And just getting a flavor of that,
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.440]   of being able to go and control different applications
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.920]   from my iPhone, presumably remotely,
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.840]   if you've got your router setup.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.000]   I mean, I just think that is such a fascinating area.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.160]   And that is-- I don't know.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.160]   I guess it's not that innovative.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.000]   You can do this kind of stuff with PCs, I suppose.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.120]   But I just see them moving more and more into this,
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.960]   like your mobile lifestyle is Apple.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.160]   Like, we're going to take your stuff on the go,
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.600]   and we're going to help you make it easy.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.960]   So this is where I think that laptop does kind of fit in.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.760]   And I think actually Chris talked about this on.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:39.600]   I think somebody from Macworld was on Morning Edition this morning,
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.400]   when you guys?
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.240]   Not right.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.000]   Jason Snowy was talking about how this laptop potentially
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.880]   becomes the thing that lets you kind of take it on the go.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.680]   It becomes a tricked out iPhone.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.560]   So--
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.080]   I love it.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.880]   I love it that they're going on Morning Edition
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:58.320]   speculating about a product that hasn't been announced.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.480]   This is what this is going to do.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.960]   Well, let's see if they do it first.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.600]   Where are you turned?
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.040]   It's true.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.440]   They get incredible amounts of PR.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.440]   Africa is so much VR.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.720]   It's unbelievable.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.600]   And that's why that's the answer.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.000]   I posed the question once.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Are they too secret?
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.520]   Now I've decided no, because look what it does for them.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.640]   I think Apple's also long in the tooth.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.320]   And we haven't seen new applications for a while.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.320]   Well, we know we're not going to see a new iLife Suite.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.840]   We just got one a few months ago.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.800]   I don't know if we'll see an iLife Suite,
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.400]   but I bet you they're cooking some new toys up for us.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.000]   Yeah, a whole new app we just didn't expect maybe.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.960]   You mean for like a desktop, like an OS 10 Apple app?
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.720]   Yeah, I think something's other.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.880]   I have no idea what it would be.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.000]   I just feel like we're at a map world.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:37.600]   We sure how that helps.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.520]   We're at a map world and nothing.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.920]   We haven't seen one of those for a while.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.440]   Ladies and gentlemen, Andy Inako,
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.680]   fresh from getting walked on by a small Japanese lady.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.680]   Hello, Andy.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.120]   Oh, maybe he's still getting walked on.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.040]   Andy, are you there?
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.800]   Andy's been replaced by a car horn.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:59.960]   Part of Andy Inako tonight will be played by a Chevy car horn.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.880]   Andy, there he is.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.520]   Pinky.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.360]   No.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.000]   He's been pinging me saying that--
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:04.800]   I know.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.040]   He's on, but he doesn't know he's on.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.360]   Maybe if we keep listening, we'll hear.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.080]   Things do a different audio input.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.320]   He's changing to a different audio input as we speak.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:12.840]   All right.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.120]   OK, is this working now?
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.240]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.640]   OK.
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.160]   Yeah, so unfortunately I'm using a Macintosh for this Skype.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.520]   And you know, you know, unreliable, those things are--
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.200]   damn them.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.000]   Are you using a Bluetooth headset of some kind?
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.920]   No, I'm now using the built-in microphone on my MacBook.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.400]   Oh, all right.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.400]   Well, that's--
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.760]   Because the USB microphone that I used to have,
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.320]   apparently, sucks so well.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.120]   Hey, welcome, Andy.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.920]   How has it been in San Francisco?
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.880]   You got in when last night?
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.480]   Actually, I got in like around midnight,
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:47.160]   or let's call 1201 AM on Sunday morning.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.600]   I'm a sleeper service on American Airlines.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.520]   They have a sleeper service now?
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.960]   I made it into a sleeper service by virtue of the fact
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.760]   that I kicked out the child that was supposed to be in the ILC
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.720]   so I could stretch out.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.160]   There you go.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.080]   These should have a little curtain.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.640]   I wish they had like in the old trains,
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.160]   or you have the little curtain you get up in the bed
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.080]   and you close the curtain.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.720]   Harpo Mox marks would be below you.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.480]   It'd be so much fun, they have to do it.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.600]   It'd be more fun if it were like the sleeper service
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.680]   in some like a hot where like around 2 AM,
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.680]   they're like 30 show girls inside your ear.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.280]   I'd love it when that happens.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.360]   Now, if that were on Delta, you'd
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.760]   have the Ritz brothers below you instead.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:20.960]   Uh oh.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.800]   Wait a minute, let me put a little mark next to that.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.080]   I mean it's--
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.080]   Below you!
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.400]   Oh, below you!
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.640]   Below you.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.840]   Oh, you dirty--
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.360]   The Ritz brothers heard was the Ritz brothers blow you,
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.240]   and I thought, well, I don't know if that's really
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.520]   where I want to go this year.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.640]   They never work dirty.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.640]   They never work dirty.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.400]   But I can't say that, which is more than I could say
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.440]   for the Mac break weekly crew.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.400]   Anyway, welcome, Andy.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.360]   We've just been speculating.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.800]   And of course, what the big announcement will be.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.040]   And most recently talking about it
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.120]   isn't an amazing, the kind of publicity Apple
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.280]   manages to get by doing absolutely nothing.
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.040]   Yeah, that's been my goal in life.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.720]   So I can't help but admire Apple for pursuing this goal
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.240]   to its logical conclusion.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.320]   Now, don't announce anything.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.680]   Keep it top secret, and you'll get
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.520]   Macworld Magazine editors on NPR telling the world
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.280]   how exciting this is.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:16.680]   Yeah, I myself-- see, I've been going to every single keynote
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.840]   for at least since the jobs era.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.600]   And it's not that it's boring for me.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:26.400]   It's just that it's a really good keynote by a CEO trying
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.400]   to get me interested in what they're doing for the year.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.040]   But it's a keynote from a CEO trying
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.640]   to get me to write about their stuff.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.000]   And so in various public--
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.120]   --feed on my Twitter feed, I have been getting all kind
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.080]   of emails from people, contact from people saying, my god,
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.680]   you get to go to the keynote.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.320]   You get a special pass.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.640]   What's it like to write a line?
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.960]   And it's what-- I'm sure this is where my first keynote.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:51.960]   I'd be just excited.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.560]   But it's kind of a challenge to my--
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.480]   the excitement of other people means
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.800]   that I need to build up my own excitement level quite a bit.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.280]   I got a friend of mine who was like a senior vice president
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.440]   at a major media corporation needed some advice
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.640]   on getting into the keynote.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.160]   I told him, I want to talk to this person
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.760]   that he can credential you if you need to be credentialed.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.320]   And he's just so over the moon about getting to see
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.440]   Steve Jobs' keynote that I'm trying to--
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.640]   I'm wondering if I need to reevaluate
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:24.200]   my own karma level or charisma level.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:28.560]   I don't know what the world of Warcraft or D&D equivalent
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.160]   would be for the global on the side I need to be experiencing.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:32.800]   Manna.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.560]   You need more manna?
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.480]   More manna?
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.000]   I don't know.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.760]   Nothing's going to help.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.720]   So I don't know.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.920]   I've lost all interest now on this entire topic.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:48.920]   Yeah, isn't it just me or is it just--
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:49.960]   Who said the great--
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.240]   The great malaise has settled over in that great place.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.560]   Like the Lord.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.560]   Have we finally--
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:58.240]   We have a good excuse because I'm from the East Coast.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.760]   I'm still not used to being on San Francisco time.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:05.440]   Realize that back home, this is like 4.30 in the afternoon.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.320]   I'm not really awake yet.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.680]   San Francisco, it's 1975.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.360]   So it takes a while to get used to it.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.320]   Well, also, I did walk through Golden Gate Park
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:19.080]   with turns into apparently one giant bong on Sunday afternoon.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.960]   So I'm still feeling certain effects.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.360]   That's for your convenience, actually.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:22.840]   We do that.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.840]   You should ask--
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.080]   It's like those hand sanitizers on cruise ships.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.440]   Just in case you didn't bring your own,
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.680]   just make sure that you will be stoned by virtue of being
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:31.840]   inside the city on a Sunday.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:32.840]   OK.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.880]   I'm curious what Andy's--
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.080]   I'm curious to hear what Andy's crazy.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.440]   Andy, earlier we were talking about our ideas for Woe.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.360]   The totally crazy left field thing we'd never
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.720]   expected in a million years to be announced.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:48.360]   Merlin has the feeling-- as do I.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.440]   We can't put our fingers on it, but there's
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.560]   something that is going to be something really surprising.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:57.160]   I just don't-- the biggest surprise
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.720]   would be a big surprise to me, honestly.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.480]   I think that if they were to start selling windows
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.360]   in the Apple Store, that would probably
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.760]   be the biggest credible surprise that I can think of.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.560]   I would love to see new hardware.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.040]   We spent so much of the last Mac break weekly
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:20.480]   about my speculation about how an Apple tablet would go.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.680]   I would love to see that.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.440]   But that would be sort of an outgrowth of something
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.760]   that I'm actually expecting.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:30.040]   I'm actually expecting him to talk a lot about the iPhone
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:32.960]   software development kit, but not so much as a development
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.680]   kit for the iPhone, so much as a development kit
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.720]   for this brand new platform that they're growing,
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.600]   starting with the iPhone, starting with the iPod touch.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:45.800]   Just like the first Mac 128 had some limited features
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.080]   and some limited functionality, but clearly was just
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:53.800]   the first hardware wrapper to go around this new operating
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.080]   system and this new idea of interface.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.840]   I do think that we're going to see Steve really try
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.360]   to land that point that more and bigger stuff is going
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.680]   to happen with this touch interface.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.080]   [SOUND]
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.120]   Regarding your malaise, which is quite powerful,
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.200]   maybe it's just because I've got it cold, but I have--
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.680]   >> Well, you know part of it also is, you know,
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:18.560]   even if you don't follow this stuff religiously,
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.600]   I mean, it's kind of easy to get a little bit burn out
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.600]   on all the speculation.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:22.100]   >> Thank you.
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.560]   >> I mean, you know what, we're going to find out what he says
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.440]   when he says it.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:24.800]   >> Right.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.320]   >> And the amount of speculation about this,
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.960]   just from my own here, becomes really tiresome.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.920]   It's an easy way to get traffic.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.440]   It's an easy way to get people all excited.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.520]   And really, nobody knows what the hell they're talking about.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.720]   People are out there, as I think,
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.080]   Groober just pointed this out the other day.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.880]   I mean, you know, if you want to keep your job--
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.280]   I think I'm quoting Groober here.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.880]   If you want to keep your job as an Apple engineer,
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.080]   you shut the hell up.
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.520]   And they have pulled off some unbelievable announcements
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.680]   like the iPhone by virtue of the fact that those folks don't
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:50.960]   talk.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.600]   It's all speculation.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.760]   You know, people are just, you know, looking at splatters
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.920]   on the sidewalk and trying to turn it into this kind of
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.560]   guesswork and it's like, there's no point.
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.240]   I mean, the man's going to stand up there and tell you
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:01.880]   tomorrow.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.440]   It's going to say something.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:04.120]   You know, it's not--
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.760]   We're having this show full of speculation today.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.240]   I didn't want to-- you made me do it.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:09.800]   Hey--
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.240]   Wait a minute.
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:13.000]   We haven't talked about this air thing very much, Leo.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.120]   What air thing?
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.280]   OK, now, you know, those of us in San Francisco,
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.760]   I walked by Moscone yesterday.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.800]   They got the banners up that say there's something
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.040]   in the air or something to that again.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.840]   That's the 3G cell phone, I think.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.720]   No, no, no.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.520]   Now, according to every rumor site I read this morning,
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.880]   they're like, oh, see?
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:28.600]   That's proof.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.400]   It's going to be a really thin MacBook notebook
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.560]   because it's kind of like lighter than air.
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.120]   Oh, please.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.240]   It's going to be a hover book.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.240]   If they come up with a floating computer,
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.040]   I think that would be a big story, yes.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.880]   I swear to like, Mac rumors and a bunch of sites today
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.800]   are saying that's proof of the sub notebook.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.480]   I read that it's called air because it will have a built-in
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.480]   bidet that will help blow you dry.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.240]   I bought one of those at your Pantown Mall yesterday.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.080]   Very good.
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.440]   The robot comes down at the second of the distance.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.440]   Hey.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.840]   If you're forgetting about one of the greatest
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.000]   unproduced Apple products of the 1990s, the Hover Car,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.040]   that was sketched out on the cocktail napkin,
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.800]   and using Apple's wonderful presentation
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.920]   and visualization tools was turned into a winning
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.200]   hover car proposal, they've finally done it.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.040]   Seriously.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.720]   Well, at the end of the keynote, we'll all be asked
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.760]   to check under our seats.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.040]   We'll have our own little special Apple Hover propeller
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.880]   beanies, and we'll-- our feet will not
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.720]   touch the ground for the whole remainder of the week.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:24.440]   I love that.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.080]   I'll be in New World.
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.480]   Well, I tell you, I--
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.080]   by the way, the Fred Vogelstein article in Wired Magazine
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.320]   on how the iPhone got born was a very--
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.080]   I thought a very thoughtful, very good, obviously well
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.120]   informed piece.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.160]   And I highly recommend that anybody
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.560]   wants to see how well Apple can keep a secret.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.480]   Pretty impressive.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.320]   And one thing we haven't talked about,
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.120]   we haven't talked about the Netflix announcement.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:50.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.280]   The name Netflix said, and there's
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.760]   no limit on what you can watch online, right?
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:56.080]   I believe that's what they said.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.480]   So if you're doing the online download stuff from Netflix,
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:02.440]   assuming you have a PC, you can--
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.440]   I guess it's pretty much all you can eat now.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:08.080]   Do you think that, as long as we're looking at splatters
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:13.480]   on the sidewalk, do you think that Harbinger's the iTunes thing?
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:13.980]   I don't know.
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:16.920]   It really is ugly to watch that stuff.
[00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.440]   How do you get it on a mobile device?
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.120]   Can you do that?
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.360]   Can you get that stuff?
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.680]   Are you stuck watching it on a-- I mean, how does that work?
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.480]   Can you put it onto an iPod?
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.680]   It's a good question because I don't--
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.760]   no, you certainly can't put it on an iPod.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.680]   If you could put it on a mobile device,
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:31.280]   that's the only way--
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.880]   But that's like coming up with a GPS device that only
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.000]   works in your garage.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   You know?
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.200]   Yeah, that's where all this stuff falls apart.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.360]   It's when you're tied to your computer, it doesn't work.
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:40.800]   Who wants to--
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.200]   And that's what's completely wrong with it.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.080]   Well, I got to disagree slightly,
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:48.880]   because I want my media to play on every single device I have.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.280]   But nonetheless, when I pack for a trip,
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.160]   one of the last things I do is to grab movies off
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.880]   of my home server and put it onto my MacBook here.
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.360]   So I don't have to travel with the wall full of DVDs.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:03.080]   Given that I'm in a hotel that has two good channels,
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:06.760]   plus ESPN and the other channel in four different languages,
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.440]   it's good to travel with your own media.
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:13.560]   I don't think it's quite useless to have movies on a laptop.
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.960]   No, I'm not saying it's useless, but the idea
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.760]   that the only way you can enjoy your media
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.680]   is because it's tied to your computer is useless.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.600]   Mom and pop are not going to sit in front of their laptop
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.960]   and enjoy the latest journey, man, or something.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:27.560]   Yeah, in turn.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:31.000]   Well, but the basic model is exactly how
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.440]   Netflix wants to sell this.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:36.000]   They're not really particularly interested in selling movies
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.400]   to people to carry around in their cell phone.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.800]   They want to sell movies or movie rentals to people
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.520]   who can touch a button on a remote control
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.120]   and watch it on their TV set.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:46.800]   And if you consider the home computer the laptop
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.040]   as just a computer that's connected to a big screen,
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.160]   that's exactly the sort of thing they want to get into.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.400]   They want to get into T-Bos.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.320]   They want to get into set-top boxes.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.680]   They want to sell pay-per-view movies to anybody
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.440]   on any cable channel, at any cable system,
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.760]   regardless of geographical location.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.400]   I think it's very interesting, the idea
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:09.040]   that I could pay $17 a month and be able to just watch videos.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.680]   You just watch any--
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:11.880]   like all you can eat from Netflix.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.400]   I mean, they're not carrying all 60,000 titles
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.080]   or whatever right now.
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:15.680]   But--
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.480]   It's good.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.160]   It's not-- I mean, I hate to pull the innovation card here,
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.240]   but to me, that's like making a smaller 8-track.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.760]   It's not tapping into this much huger market
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.760]   where all the expansion is.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.240]   Yeah, sure, everybody's got to go buy a digital TV now.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.720]   But ultimately, the gr-- isn't the huge growth
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.240]   going to be in mobile devices?
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.320]   It's not going to be in people sitting in front of their TV,
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:34.760]   right?
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:35.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.120]   It's so--
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:36.280]   Wow.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.440]   --that it's the end in front of a TV.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.080]   You think that people that want to watch shows
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.840]   on four-inch screens, you think they want to watch shows
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:45.200]   with headphones plugged into their ears?
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.360]   It's always going to be the living room.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.920]   It's the difference between this mom and pop shop selling,
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.440]   you know, selling homemade brownies
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.560]   about the side of the road and wanting
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.520]   to sell them in every single supermarket.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.960]   That's a straw-- it's a straw man,
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.920]   because what I'm not-- what I'm saying
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.640]   is not that they should sell four-inch vertically
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.280]   or four-inch diagonal movies.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.560]   I'm saying that what they have to do,
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.880]   if you're-- in order for that to be something that really
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:10.720]   gets Netflix a jump ahead rather than just a little half
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.400]   step ahead, is going to be something that plays
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.120]   in multiple places along with the lines of what we had been
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:15.920]   predicting.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.040]   Well, I think Apple could do that.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:17.600]   Oh, it could do.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.360]   Which I think Apple absolutely can do.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.200]   Maybe Netflix, you know, I don't know.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.640]   I imagine that would do them for a couple of years.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.400]   But I mean, you can be glib about what people are doing
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.520]   with their iPod to not want to watch a small screen.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:32.360]   But I think the numbers are going to be disagreeing with you
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:32.920]   over there.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:33.920]   Well, I think--
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:39.440]   What I was reacting to was what I interpreted as your--
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:42.840]   your statement that handheld devices
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:47.080]   was the important vector for this sort of a movie service.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:50.240]   And I absolutely believe that that's a good way
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.320]   to get saturation.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.800]   That's a good way to get market share.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.520]   And that's going to be a desired feature of anybody
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:59.320]   who is either currently under the age of 25 or somewhat
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.160]   over the age of 25 like us, but reasonably hip.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.760]   But the meat of this business is--
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.880]   the meat of-- the unit of consumption of video content
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:13.200]   is always going to be the sofa and the nice big plasma,
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.280]   the nice big flat screen LCD spring.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.400]   Well, I love--
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.480]   I love wandering around with my--
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.520]   being able to play my stuff on my iPhone and everything else.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.320]   But you're looking at 250 or 300 million TVs
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.400]   in the United States and 5 or 10 million iPods.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.640]   What if you said that about DVDs a few years ago?
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.200]   I mean, you can't put a VHS in your pocket.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.440]   I mean, nobody-- I don't think anybody
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.040]   could have guessed the way that DVDs, how quickly DVDs,
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.400]   would become something that everybody's using.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.440]   I mean, it's extraordinary how fast that change happened
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.400]   compared to VHS, at least in my estimation.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.800]   I'm trying to say here, I'm not talking about it either,
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:44.880]   or here, by the way.
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.760]   I'm not talking about, like, oh, all you get is four inches
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.520]   diagonally.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.840]   I'm just saying that, like, to really get into the area
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:53.000]   where I imagine huge growth is going to be,
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.600]   you want to be able for that same unit
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.800]   to work for this notional idiot parent people who
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.440]   sit in front of their TV, as well as the folks who've
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:01.600]   got the iPods.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.720]   In order to really jump forward, I mean, again,
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:05.360]   and again, who is--
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.800]   OK, but my question is, are you willing to--
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.520]   you're the head of Netflix.
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.480]   Are you willing to invest the huge amount of money
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.920]   that would be required to get this deployed on a subset
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:20.200]   of devices that represent something like 18%, 19%
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:20.920]   of the market?
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.680]   Because you can knock on Steve Jobs's door as much as you want.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.080]   You're not going to get into the class of devices
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.120]   that own currently about 80% of the market.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.120]   So if you buy movies off the iTunes store,
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.440]   you can watch it on a PC, right?
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.640]   You can watch it on an Apple branded piece of software
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.280]   running on the PC, yes.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.560]   Well, that would be an interesting relationship.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:45.400]   Actually, if Apple and Netflix work together, that's probably--
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:46.360]   That would be interesting.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.600]   That would be anything that Steve Jobs would do, though.
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.240]   I remember that the Netflix thing is all designed
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.360]   around streaming so that you don't have any control or way
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.000]   of saving it or anything like that.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.880]   You're right, Andy, in the sense that that's
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.160]   where there's lots of installed days right now.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.680]   I absolutely agree on that.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.840]   But I mean, I just keep looking at think about--
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.600]   do you remember first telling people
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.400]   about Netflix a few years ago?
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.960]   I mean, everybody outside this bubble
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.080]   that we're constantly minimizing the size of,
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.200]   when I told them about Netflix.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:11.920]   They're like, you're crazy.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.360]   You're going to get movies in the mail.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:14.000]   That's nuts.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.280]   If you're just telling them about a Tivo,
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.920]   they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't understand.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.200]   I'm just learning my VCR.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.280]   What I'm trying to say is that these bubbles get bigger
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.920]   a lot faster these days.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.600]   And people are picking up this technology
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.200]   in pretty remarkable ways.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:26.840]   And I don't know.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.840]   I think it's a couple more Christmases
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.240]   before a lot more people who we think of as sitting
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.600]   in front of a TV are also going to have phones and iPods
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.320]   that play movies.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.520]   Well, the other thing I should point out
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.560]   is this Netflix thing is really designed for people
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.360]   running Windows Media Centers that are hooked up
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:41.200]   to their TVs.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.520]   I mean, that's who's doing this.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:47.240]   Oh, and I think that also you're looking at a very scared MPAA.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.800]   I mean, they obviously know they need to go this direction.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.160]   But I think a lot of the constraints over what you can do
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:52.520]   with it.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.720]   I mean, I think if Netflix could do it,
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:55.360]   if they had their druthers, of course,
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.960]   you'd be able to put it on portable thing, portable,
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.360]   whatever, you'd bounce around.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.840]   That'd be fine for Netflix.
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.040]   It's the movie companies that are more concerned
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.480]   about that process.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.960]   But maybe this isn't so bad if it's running on a Windows Media
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:08.320]   Center.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.320]   I mean, I just started the Italian job.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.000]   It took me about three seconds.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.080]   It starts playing almost right away.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.720]   You have a pretty good selection.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.440]   You're sitting on your lion in bed.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.600]   You got your big screen TV at the foot of your bed.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.640]   You navigate to Netflix and you start playing the movie.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:25.720]   Now, admittedly, the quality's not great, but it's not awful.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:26.320]   And you're at least--
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:27.960]   What's the resolution?
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:31.840]   Well, it'll run full screen.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.200]   It's more like a compression issue.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.320]   It's highly compressed.
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.240]   It's like cinema now.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.400]   They're all the same.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.120]   I mean, that's the whole problem with streaming in general,
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.720]   is that the server can't really--
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.000]   the whole reason that Progressive makes way more sense,
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.440]   especially as we look at--
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.480]   right now, the backbone of the internet
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.440]   isn't being stressed very hard, but it's going to be.
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:53.000]   And the problem is that streaming becomes less and less
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.080]   efficient and less usable as that happens.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:00.560]   And I think that that's why the Progressive download still
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.080]   makes sense.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:04.760]   It's just a matter of figuring out how to, I guess, de-arrim it.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.240]   I don't want to get too far a field here
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.160]   because we could turn this into this week in media.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.880]   But there's plenty to talk about in this week in media
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:15.400]   later, which will be at Macworld Expo tomorrow.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.240]   What time?
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.320]   I'll see now I put the schedule down.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.280]   Oh, hold on a second.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.640]   You know, I just showed up.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.120]   I'm going to leave it open.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:27.440]   We got a Mac break tech as it is at four.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:31.040]   And this week in media is at two o'clock.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.320]   Yep, Mac break weekly will be at 11.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.040]   That'll be our keynote wrap up.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.760]   The following day, we're doing jumping monkeys.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:37.720]   We're doing floss.
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.280]   We're going to do Twitter on Friday.
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.840]   Another Mac Mac weekly on Thursday.
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:44.600]   I mean, there's a lot going on in between lots of information
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:49.000]   about podcasting, videos, picking a camera for production,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.880]   lighting, all the stuff that Alex does so well with Pixel
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:53.640]   Course.
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:55.280]   And if you're in the conference, of course,
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:58.280]   Podango is going to be doing a whole whole other set
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:47:59.400]   of tutorials.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.280]   Yeah, that'll be fantastic.
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:06.120]   Now there's total 18 presenters in our segment.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.160]   And where is that, and when?
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.920]   That's all day Friday.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.120]   And it's where you get to the signs
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.280]   and look for the podcasting symposium.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.440]   And you'll need to find those signs, Leo, since we're
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.840]   counting on you coming by and speaking.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.680]   What time am I speaking on that?
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.280]   Well, we have you down for 11.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:22.520]   We can change it if we need to.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.240]   I just need to know.
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.560]   And there's lots of other events going on.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:30.440]   It's going to be a big party all week long
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:33.240]   as the Mac faithful gather in San Francisco
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:36.280]   for the big Mac world expo, the yearly gathering
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.080]   of the cult of Mac.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.080]   And I don't think you've come to any conclusion at all
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:42.520]   about what Steve might say tomorrow,
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.320]   except that it's going to be worth seeing.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.360]   I really think it's going to be more of--
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:51.480]   I think it's going to be mostly a business sort of keynote
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:54.400]   where Apple really lays out the fact that we've
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.360]   got the iPhone.
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:55.920]   It's big.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.040]   It's only going to get bigger.
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:58.240]   We've got the iTunes store.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:58.800]   It's big.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.440]   It's only going to get bigger.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.440]   We've got the Mac line.
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:06.680]   We've got a huge insanely good quarter, last quarter.
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:07.960]   This is Sparta.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:09.560]   And then they'll kick a whole bunch of people
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:13.760]   into a very, very, possibly long Marvel line shaft.
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.240]   Do we think that there's going to be any talk of business
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:16.960]   applications?
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:20.160]   Because I mean, it sounds like the real thing that's
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:21.360]   starting to build up is a lot of people
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.760]   that get enterprises.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.600]   A lot of enterprise stuff is picking up speed.
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:25.840]   God, I hope not.
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:27.680]   Well, I mean, just more like a build out more
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.320]   of the office tools and stuff like that.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:33.320]   Because numbers--
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:35.720]   I could tell everybody's all excited about that.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:36.640]   I am.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.200]   Here's the worst part is I hated Excel.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.440]   I hated Excel.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.680]   And now I'm just looking for budgets to make.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:44.040]   Because I'm playing with numbers.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.360]   I actually was very-- I was way let down by numbers the other day.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.160]   I was trying to do a simple spreadsheet.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.240]   Numbers doesn't do the simplest thing in the world.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.840]   At any good spreadsheet, going back to Lotus 123
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.480]   and even Visicuck will do.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:56.880]   It's allow you to lock part of the spreadsheet
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.320]   so you could scroll through the numbers
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.040]   and still know what you're looking at.
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.880]   And at that point, I said, guys, you've
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.320]   got a long way to go if you can't even figure that out.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:08.000]   That's from Visicuck.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.320]   You may think so if what you need to do is done by numbers,
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:14.320]   but I could tell you right now, no serious spreadsheet users
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:15.080]   using numbers yet.
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:15.840]   They've got a lot of--
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.240]   Well, no, I think it's-- but it's also version one.
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:18.880]   But it's way prettier.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:19.880]   OK.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:20.680]   Say I like pretty.
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:22.720]   Look at the pretty puzzle.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:27.640]   Anyway, 6.45 if you want to get in line early.
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:29.600]   We will see you at 11 o'clock.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:31.400]   Everybody will be doing another Mac break weekly.
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.160]   We'll give you a summary of what's happening.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:34.280]   I have still undecided.
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:38.640]   You know, if Merlin's right, if there's a big gasp awaiting us
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.120]   from Steve Jobs, I'm going to be there.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.120]   But on the other hand, if Alex is right,
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.560]   and let me tell you a little more about the enterprise
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:45.720]   strategy for Apple.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.320]   They got most day in bed.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.320]   I haven't decided yet.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:52.920]   By the way--
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:55.360]   You always worry about that section in which there
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.320]   are a whole bunch of numbers being thrown at you
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:00.080]   and in the audience who are thinking, oh, they just
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:03.520]   added a new feature to the Steve Jobs-only version of Keynote
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:04.880]   and they need to test it out.
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:05.400]   OK.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.880]   This is why we're seeing that stack holographic aid
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.720]   color charge because they want to make sure
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.080]   that they can generate it on the fly.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.040]   OK.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.120]   Andy and Aka, what are you doing in Macworld Expo?
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:17.600]   Any plugs you want to give out?
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:22.040]   I'm going to be doing two sessions on Thursday.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:25.840]   First, I'm going to be doing my demonstration of stuff
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:29.160]   from my iPod fully loaded and iPhone fully loaded session.
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:32.000]   So it's going to be all about converting DVDs, converting
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.680]   podcasts, converting anything you've
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.040]   got in your life into a format that can work on your iPhone
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:37.040]   or iPod.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.600]   And then I'm going to be giving away fabulous prices
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:40.440]   in the afternoon.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:42.920]   I've got a feature presentation which
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.560]   is going to be a little quick show that come together that we
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:49.120]   will find out exactly how much people know or how much I can
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:53.440]   sort of help people to figure out the size that we actually
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:53.720]   actually have.
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:54.720]   I'm looking forward to that.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.000]   Where will that be?
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.320]   Do you know yet?
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.560]   I believe that's going to be one of the main stages.
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:00.880]   That's the stage.
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:01.160]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:02.400]   We'll find you.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:02.880]   We'll find you.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:03.960]   We'll find you.
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:06.520]   Look for the parade of people with--
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:09.120]   I got the same prize coordinator as works in the prizes.
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:09.400]   Right.
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:13.400]   So there's going to be a lot of pontoon boats, a lot of stuff
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.720]   where you'll be dual deck riding more.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:18.440]   It's the sort of thing that 78-year-old ladies will be
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:21.520]   excited to win, but then realize, oh, actually, I live in Iowa.
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:22.200]   There are no big ones.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.440]   We're going to do it with Edge.
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:26.600]   Are you doing any signings either at any of the--
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.760]   I'm going to be in the wily booth.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.520]   I believe it's 3 p.m. on Wednesday.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.800]   Definitely check the booth to make sure that's the right time.
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.120]   But I'm going to be there for an hour.
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.840]   As usual, talking about stuff that I'm doing and talk about
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:40.600]   stuff that I plan to do.
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.000]   But probably we'll never be able to fall through on because I
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.120]   don't have a commercial pilot's license.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:45.560]   There you go.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.560]   Look for the guy in the hat in the mutton shops.
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:50.080]   He'll be everywhere you want to be.
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:53.400]   Chris Breen is a Mac world going to do the usual--
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.600]   I know you'll have a big booth where you do the same shows
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.480]   that you've done last in years past.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:58.880]   No, we're not doing the stage this year.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:01.560]   We've got our own little podcasting area.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:04.520]   So we'll be producing our own podcasts.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.760]   Can you watch that?
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.120]   No, these are private.
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:08.560]   Private.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:09.640]   You have to listen to them.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:12.800]   We call them podcasts rather than stage shows.
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.400]   And then the rest of the week, I'm
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:18.360]   doing the iPhone Super Session with Ben Long, every Tuesday,
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:21.120]   Wednesday, Thursday, 1.3.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:24.400]   And so we'll talk lots and lots and lots of stuff about iPhones.
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:26.840]   Should I bring my iPhone so I can follow along?
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:27.680]   Yes, please do.
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:31.520]   We are encouraging people to please turn on your cell phone.
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:32.920]   Oh, good.
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:35.720]   And then Friday I'll be at the Peach Bit booth at noon
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:38.600]   to talk about iPhones and iPhones.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:39.100]   Excellent.
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.080]   And of course, we'll be counting on you at 11 o'clock tomorrow,
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.560]   right after the keynote.
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:44.680]   I may be dashing in a little late,
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:47.040]   but I will do my best to start.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:48.640]   Make an appearance of any kind.
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:50.600]   They're going to be so many people.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.760]   I mean, we're hoping to get everybody to come by.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:53.160]   So--
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.360]   Well, I'll just send the hair if the rest of me can't make it.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.360]   We'll look for your hair.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.040]   Scott, born, you've got to be busy, too.
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:01.400]   You've got that whole Padango session going.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:02.080]   Well, yeah.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:04.400]   And I've got a conference session
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:09.120]   on how to go from zero to podcasting in two hours, which
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:12.400]   is basically my talk on GarageBand in the user conference.
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.440]   Cool.
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:16.080]   And then I've got a Birds of a Feather, they call it,
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.960]   at IDG Wednesday night at 6.30, which is just anybody who
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:23.400]   wants to come hang out and talk about podcasting.
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.360]   A bunch of people will already be there.
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:28.840]   And then I'm doing the photography thing
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:29.960]   they've got going on this year.
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:33.320]   I'm presenting on the stage over there for a couple hours.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.840]   And then I got an all day Friday in Padango.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.960]   Merlin Mann is on the faculty.
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:39.280]   That's what it says.
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.600]   I'll be in the lounge smoking cigarettes
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:41.560]   if this is for Buffalo.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:44.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.240]   That is damn good.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:48.760]   You can't do nothing today.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.360]   So what are you going to be-- I presume you're
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.120]   teaching productivity.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.720]   Yeah, I see it's the 16th, which is Wednesday.
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:56.240]   All right.
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:56.740]   Wow.
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:59.400]   Apparently, in a couple days, I'm giving a talk.
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:01.720]   Wednesday, yeah, at 4.15, it's called--
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:03.360]   I don't remember coming up with this title.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:04.640]   I think they came up with this.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:05.600]   But it's called Living with Data.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:08.080]   And it's about how to deal with the time burglars in your life,
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:09.360]   as Bart Simpson would say.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:12.400]   And how to wrestle-- rest back your time and attention
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.200]   to the places that you'd like them to be.
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:15.840]   It's a bunch of little bit of hand waving
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:16.800]   and a whole lot of tricks.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:17.200]   Cool.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.120]   And I'm sure we'll be looking for you with a camera crew,
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:21.320]   also, all over the show floor.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.800]   You know, we had a really good time last year.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:23.680]   It was fun, yeah.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:24.520]   That was really cool.
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:29.640]   So if I can leave my poor wife with the baby
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:30.840]   for yet another day during that--
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:31.760]   Oh, come on.
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.240]   She loves it.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.280]   It's a lot of work.
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.160]   Yeah, I know.
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:36.080]   Tell me about it.
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:38.200]   Yeah, so anyway, that's the 16th of 4.15.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:40.560]   Also, this is-- I try not to plug myself,
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:41.120]   because it's--
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:42.520]   Oh, please plug yourself.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:43.320]   It's unseemly.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.880]   But my favorite-- what are you?
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:48.080]   Probably my favorite podcast, The Sound of Young America
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.760]   by a guy named Jesse Thorne does that.
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:51.960]   He's in town tonight.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:54.120]   And so he'll be interviewing folks,
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:58.560]   including me, live on stage, live Sound of Young America.
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:55:59.080]   And--
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:01.040]   Are you young America?
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:02.200]   Oh, no.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:06.520]   I think he's speaking more generously about his listeners.
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:10.440]   And then the people who are actually on the show.
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:12.560]   I bought tickets to that, Maroon.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:13.280]   You what?
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.240]   I paid for tickets to that.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.040]   Really?
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.080]   10 bucks a piece.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.000]   Are you coming?
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:19.040]   Is that--
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:19.520]   You're coming?
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.400]   Where is that Great American Music Hall?
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:23.040]   It's at-- I think the Eureka Theater.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:23.560]   Eureka.
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:24.640]   That's a great little theater.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:25.120]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.480]   It's not at the Great American Music Hall
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:29.440]   next to Mitchell Brothers.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.760]   The cover charge is a good deal more expensive there, I'm told.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.560]   OK.
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:34.280]   No, but anyway--
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.040]   So the Mitchell Brothers know the Ritz Brothers,
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:37.880]   or is it just a coincidence?
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.040]   I think they did some work together for a while.
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:40.520]   But--
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.360]   I think they were in the birth above, wasn't that?
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.120]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:44.800]   Birth above?
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:45.520]   I barely know her.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:50.880]   Alex Lindsey, if you do see a film crew around,
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:54.800]   it'll probably be with Alex running it around like crazy.
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.440]   You're going to be doing all sorts of coverage of--
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:59.440]   Yeah, we're hoping we're going to try to-- if they let us,
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.040]   we're going to try to wander around tonight and show
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:03.000]   people what it looks like before the doors open.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:03.560]   That'd be neat.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:06.080]   So we're going to throw that into the Macbreak feed,
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.040]   and then the video feed.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.480]   And then we're going to try also tomorrow morning,
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:12.200]   if we can get up early enough to go talk to some of those
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.120]   people in line.
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.760]   And to see what they think is going to happen tomorrow.
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:18.960]   And then after that, as I said, we're
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:25.040]   going to be shooting as many as six to eight episodes a day.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.960]   So it's going to be of all--
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:31.120]   we have a ton of great hosts that have been doing research
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:32.480]   and a great crew.
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:35.080]   And they're going to be shooting, editing, and posting
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.640]   as fast as they possibly can.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:38.640]   Kids, I'd like to ask you a favor, if you will.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:41.240]   Go to your iTunes, click that podcast link,
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:43.840]   and make sure there are no little gray exclamation marks.
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:46.200]   Next to any of the Twitch shows-- yes,
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:47.720]   it's been a while since we've been on the air.
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:50.120]   And iTunes may have decided to stop subscribing.
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:51.080]   You don't want to stop now.
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:54.320]   We've got Macbreak weeklies, all week long, Macbreak,
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:55.440]   all week long.
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:57.160]   All the other Twitch podcasts are back, too.
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:59.480]   So there's a lot to listen to.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:02.960]   You want the best coverage of Macworld Expo.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:06.400]   It all starts right there in your iTunes.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.800]   The Macbreak section there.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:12.560]   Thank you, Andy, Scott, Merlin, Chris, and Alex.
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:16.200]   We'll see you all bright and early tomorrow morning
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:18.200]   for Mr. Steve Jobs.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.840]   You think he's a little nervous right now?
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:21.880]   Little shaky.
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:22.560]   No.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:23.400]   No.
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:24.360]   He's feeling good.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:25.400]   Feeling confident.
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:28.040]   I think a lot of people around him are very shaky right now.
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:30.540]   Yeah.
[00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:32.240]   I think right now he's running just
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:33.880]   fire a few people to unwind a little.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:34.880]   Yeah, that makes you--
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.000]   it's a good way to loosen up.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:41.160]   He's watching episodes of the Apprentice to sort of limber up.
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.440]   All right, we'll see you all tomorrow.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:44.120]   Another Macbreak is broke.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:50.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:54.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
