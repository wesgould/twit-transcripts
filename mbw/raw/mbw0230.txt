[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.120]   Hey, everybody.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.320]   Welcome to MacBreak Weekly.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.360]   This is-- it's not really Leo, is it?
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.800]   I don't think I could fool him.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.360]   I was going to try.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.360]   I was going to try to go down this path in person named Leo,
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.400]   and then everyone would make fun of me, including Leo.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.200]   And so I decided not to.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.160]   This is Alex.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.600]   Leo, of course, is at Regis and Kelly doing his thing.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.120]   And you can check that out online.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.600]   But I am going to be helming for today.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.160]   And in the studio, we have the illustrious--
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.880]   Tom Anderson.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.880]   Hey, Tom.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.380]   Hi.
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.880]   Hi.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.120]   And coming in from his remote studio in Boston,
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.320]   or out somewhere near Boston is Andy Anotko, Andy.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.920]   That's right.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.440]   I'm broadcasting today from the This Week in Tech Party van.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.640]   If you can guess where I am and come by and say the phrase
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.040]   that pays, well, what do you know?
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.880]   You'll get a free t-shirt or a free set of winter gloves
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.440]   that I use to knock the ice off of my car.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.280]   Or you're going to get whatever we have in the lane
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.840]   around in the car.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.880]   What else do you have there, Andy?
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.360]   What do you have for people here?
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.040]   Well, let's see.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.440]   I got scotch tape, alkaline batteries.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.840]   I've got a Beatles tape that my friend John sent me a while
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.680]   back.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.440]   I don't have a tape deck H. Papermate marker.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.520]   Or the case that the cassette came in.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.160]   So all of this-- I'm going to put this back
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.120]   into the prize treasure trap.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.760]   And I'm walking the prize treasure chest.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.840]   And that key is only going to be openable by the person who
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.200]   has the phrase that pays.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   So by all means, I am the heart parolic of internet radio
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.120]   promotion here.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.200]   For those of you just tuning in over those of you listening,
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.760]   we had some connectivity issues, but we've gotten it working
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.960]   now.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.400]   And Andy is coming in via Skype on the iPhone.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.040]   So this is working.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.920]   And it's looking remarkably stable.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.760]   What are you using to attach your iPhone?
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.720]   I can't show you because I haven't disconnected it.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.320]   This is the-- OK, this is my favorite car mount for anything.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.960]   This is the Ram Mount system.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.000]   I don't know if you can see that.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.200]   There you go.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.800]   This is cool.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.880]   I'm actually-- I'm using my rear view mirror to see the image.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.120]   This is the next one.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.800]   So yes, this is the Ram Mount system
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.120]   that I absolutely swear about.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.680]   So does that just have sticky backing?
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.920]   Is that like a sticky backing?
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.920]   Well, this right here is my own little modification.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.000]   It's just the standard mounting pad with some Velcro on top of it.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Ah.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.720]   But the thing is, it's completely modular.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.680]   So basically, this is component one.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.560]   The big suction cup with sticks to anything
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.640]   and absolutely will not let go.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.800]   The rocker arm right there.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.520]   And then there's-- you can basically buy anything you want
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.960]   to stick to the end of it.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.600]   Ideally, you would probably go and buy an actual holder
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.800]   that they've developed specifically for the car mount.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.520]   Probably for the iPhone 4.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.600]   But I tend to put so many things in and out of this thing
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.520]   that I just prefer to just put a pad of Velcro up there.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.160]   But this does very much look like the Christmas message
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.800]   from Apollo 8.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.400]   And now we've given you by moving the camera around,
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.040]   we've given you some more clues of where Andy might actually be.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.000]   So possibly later in the show, we'll
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.960]   show you a couple more examples.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.080]   And the question is, can you find Andy by the end of the show?
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.720]   Clue number one.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.640]   You can hear a bell from here, but there's not an e-mailer.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.280]   Think on that.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.680]   Let's hear some fog head.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.000]   All right.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.080]   So the question is, is that what--
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.880]   I don't know.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.400]   There wasn't a lot of news about Apple this week or yesterday.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.360]   I mean, it's been kind of a slow time.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.320]   So I guess we ought to go ahead and talk--
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.080]   because no one else is talking about it.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.640]   We might want to talk about the fact
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.680]   that Steve Jobs, again, is taking a leave of absence.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.120]   I mean, this is like the president
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.560]   decided he was going to take a vacation.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.000]   I mean, it was just everywhere yesterday.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.440]   Now, one of the things that Steve asked for a little bit
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.200]   of privacy-- and I'm going to actually respect that
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.040]   and not get into too much of the medical issues
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.440]   because we have no idea.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.040]   We've no idea.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.880]   I mean, first it was a pancreas, then it was a liver,
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.560]   then it was a-- we don't know if they were connected,
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.640]   and we don't know what it is.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.240]   And I think that it makes sense to just kind of let that go.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.760]   But what I think is important is how do we
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.960]   think this is going to affect Apple?
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.160]   And there's a couple things.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.960]   Of course, there's the next year.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.840]   But the next-- if he takes a lot of time off
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.160]   or decides that he needs to take the rest of the time off,
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.160]   how does this affect Apple?
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.800]   Andy, Andy, what are your thoughts
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.160]   as we kind of start going down this path?
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.440]   I really don't think it's going to affect Apple all that much.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.440]   It bears repeating that--
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.640]   it's not that Steve Jobs invents everything
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.640]   that goes on at Apple.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.000]   He's just the leader.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.520]   He's communicated a pretty clear path
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.080]   of where he thinks Apple should go.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.160]   They tend to hire people who don't disagree
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.880]   with that overall plan, the people who are up
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.320]   at the executive level, understand exactly what kind
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.880]   of company Apple is and where they want to go.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.760]   They've-- Mr. Interim Guy, I think that's
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.120]   his actual street handle.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.280]   Justin Cook has been in this position before.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.880]   He's written on that bus.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.200]   So I think that there is going to be the expected sort
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.560]   of stock market blip.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.600]   But I don't think that's really good.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.240]   I think it's not an accident that they
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.760]   made this announcement the day before Apple--
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.640]   I believe that Apple's going to give some extremely good news
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.040]   in their earnings report today.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.840]   And anybody who's stupid enough to sell at the first note of,
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.920]   oh, Mr. Jobs is taking a leather leave, a medical leave,
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.600]   is going to say, oh, I really wish I'd kept those stocks.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.480]   And they announced that they've made--
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.480]   they exceeded our earnings projections
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.040]   by $8.1 billion.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.080]   Ooh, probably a bad move there.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.880]   Well, and related to that, though, is--
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.000]   so Tom, the question for you is, as we start to go down
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.080]   this path, I mean, you're working with engineering
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.000]   and so on and so forth.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.360]   And there's a certain trajectory that is going on.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.320]   But when does his absence start to really affect Apple's
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.560]   trajectory, do you think?
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.640]   Well, when they release their first bad product
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.320]   is really what the problem is.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.320]   I mean, what Steve brings to you is the ability to say, no,
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.200]   this isn't ready.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.000]   Even though the schedule says it's ready,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.920]   and even though we have all these prototypes
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.400]   and they work as well as they do, I don't like it yet.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.320]   And so that's really-- the founder can do that because it's
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.440]   his money and his company.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.520]   And he's authorized to do that.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.080]   What you get is two, three, five, 10 years even down the road
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.280]   when you have somebody else in there who doesn't really feel
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.600]   like it's their call.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.360]   Well, the people at work forums call and they say it's ready,
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.680]   so it must be ready.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.640]   That's when you stumble.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.360]   Well, in some ways, isn't this what one of the challenges
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.760]   was when Steve was gone the first time?
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.320]   So we saw incredible products coming out of Apple.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.880]   And I'm talking about 1985, '86.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.440]   So we saw 10 years of Apple growing,
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.040]   and then Steve was gone for 10 years.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.400]   And what Apple slowly devolved into
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.960]   was it went from being this idealistic, very innovative
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.400]   company to one, trying to be like PCs that didn't really
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.920]   serve what they needed.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.560]   Is that a risk for Apple?
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.360]   Well, it's always a risk.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.640]   Can a company survive without its founders?
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.920]   And there's plenty of examples of companies
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.840]   that were doing just great.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.480]   And then the founders left, and then they did much less well.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.880]   And--
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.960]   Well, I mean, some would argue that Redmond
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.160]   is a good example of that issue.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.600]   Well, yeah, Hewlett Packard is another example.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.520]   There's plenty of examples.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.880]   Wendy's, it's all throughout.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.520]   And probably if you look at the stock market price,
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.960]   it's really just discounting that possibility
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.840]   that they will have problems years from now.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.360]   Because it's not that they took a 50% hit,
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.320]   or they think that the company isn't going to grow anymore.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.600]   It's just that, well, everything is up into the right.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.120]   One of the founders at the helm, and there is some risk,
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.160]   and half a dozen years from now.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:40.720]   Right.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.480]   Andy, is there an issue when you get into the Steve
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.320]   distortion field that he's able to make deals that
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.000]   is very difficult?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.640]   And this is really the situation with CEOs,
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.960]   is beyond the engineering, beyond saying that Apple will
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.560]   continue to make great products.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.720]   Can they continue to make these crazy deals that have been
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.240]   part of what's required to kind of move these ideas forward?
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.200]   Is there someone behind him?
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.720]   Is Tim Cook the guy that can do that?
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:13.640]   Every report that I've heard and every report that I've read
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.480]   about says that Tim is absolutely capable, guided.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.400]   His face with that sort of thing and doesn't flinch
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.000]   is the time that the president is going to be set.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.720]   It's been pretty much Steve pretty much firmly
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.120]   defined the fact.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.400]   Oh, I'm really understanding.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.760]   So this might be a challenge that we get into here.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.560]   As I said, Andy's connecting to us,
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.400]   Mobally, we had some issues earlier,
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.520]   and so we'll try to bring him back here in a second.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.560]   Tom, while I bring him back, when do you think--
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.840]   we talked about this a little bit--
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.840]   the next year, it would probably
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.720]   wouldn't matter whether Steve was there or not.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.240]   Oh, they can coast.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.040]   And it also makes a really big difference
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.840]   if Steve is maybe not there day to day,
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.920]   but they feel his watchful eye over their shoulder.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.320]   Because to a large extent, you can just say to yourself,
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.600]   well, what would Steve do?
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.000]   And really understand that.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.280]   And he's there to correct you, although maybe not
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.960]   in real time, if there really is a problem.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.040]   And so I think that--
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.160]   well, for example, I always look at Apple products.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:35.080]   And I think about what Steve calls lickability.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.360]   So is the product lickable?
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.600]   Well, I think he actually means that literally.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.520]   So I think he means that you should
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.800]   be able to pick up an Apple product.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.560]   And there shouldn't be any spots on it
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.120]   where you would say, if my tongue got in there,
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.040]   would that hurt?
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.120]   And so I think he means it literally.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.600]   And you can decide for yourself, OK, well,
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.120]   there's this one little connector on the bottom here.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.480]   Well, I don't think my tongue would hurt too much
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.280]   if I were to get it in there.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.240]   And you can look around any Apple product,
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.040]   and they'll have this characteristic.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.640]   And so as long as he's around, at least in there,
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.560]   hearts and minds, that's fine.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.880]   When you get somebody new in there
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.360]   who has new ideas of, well, I want
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.920]   to take the company in a different direction,
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.200]   that's your real problem.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.400]   Right.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.400]   So--
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.440]   [PHONE RINGING]
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.360]   Hello, Andy.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.680]   Are you there?
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.240]   Hello.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.680]   OK, we heard a little-- we had a little pop there.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.160]   So it seems to right now, obviously,
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.320]   we just don't know what's happening here.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.000]   I mean, we don't know whether it's going to be a long stay.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Now, Andy, do you read anything into the fact
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.840]   that the last time he took a leave of absence,
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.760]   he said he was going to be back in June,
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.840]   this time he's not saying when he's going to come back?
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.680]   Not particularly.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.360]   Again, that's reading so far into the statement that I don't think
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.520]   that I want to talk about that.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.440]   I do also just want to make sure it's also understood
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.280]   that the last time since we brought it up,
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.240]   the last time that Steve took a leave of absence,
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.160]   it's not as though he went away for six months
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.720]   and then came back.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.840]   He was just not that hands-on into the office every day,
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.000]   having face-to-face meetings.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.200]   He was still-- remember, this is the time
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.080]   when, like the iPad, was a lot of the key decisions
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.480]   were being made about this.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.560]   And so the iPad is still very much something
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.360]   that-- something from the lack of a better word,
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.000]   from the Steve Jobs era.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.760]   So it goes a bit too far to assume
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.720]   that Steve is going to be out of the picture
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.880]   for the indefinite future.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.320]   And now, all the kids are trying to run the summer camp
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.880]   about any of the counselors, because they're very good at what
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.560]   they do.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.400]   Plus, if there's stuff that needs Steve's input
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:44.160]   or Steve's approval, or just as likely, Steve's giant size
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.280]   13 iron boot to come down on the heel of somebody who says,
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.880]   yeah, well, we will let you put this on our network
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.280]   so long as we can put our own version of our nav app
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.280]   on your device.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.320]   Yeah, you need that.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.120]   That's when Steve comes into the conference call
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.760]   and says, you said what?
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.960]   You're asking for what?
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.120]   So it's not something that I think
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.640]   that we should be really reading into.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.120]   Very good.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:05.800]   All right.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.040]   So we'll see how this goes.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.720]   And obviously, we had to track it a little bit.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.520]   I mean, this is Macbreak, and this is Apple.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.360]   And I don't think that there's any reason
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.200]   to dig into it any deeper, because I don't think we have--
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.720]   I think we've talked about as much as we can talk
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.720]   with the information that we have.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.160]   And we hope that Steve gets better.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.840]   I think that's the bottom line is
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.960]   is that we all want Steve to do well and come back
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.040]   and visit us soon.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.320]   So from Steve World.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.720]   And so hopefully that comes into it.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.600]   Now, next in the news, Verizon, of course,
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.800]   we saw the announcement last week.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.960]   And everyone was excited that finally Verizon
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.280]   is supporting the iPhone.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.920]   It's coming out February 10th.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.480]   If you don't already have Verizon,
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.640]   I believe February 3rd, if you already
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.880]   have a Verizon account.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.640]   So you get a little bit of a head start there.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.000]   Now, of course, after we've all looked at it
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.920]   and said this is just the same, people
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.000]   are starting to dig into whether they should actually--
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.680]   they've got a little time to think about this.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:03.160]   And they're wondering, is this the time for me to get an iPhone?
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.680]   I've been waiting.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.440]   Should I jump from AT&T?
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.120]   And we were kind of covering all of that live
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.360]   and giving our input.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.720]   But now that we've had a week to think about it,
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.840]   Andy, do you think that there is a certain people that should
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.200]   or shouldn't get the new iPhone?
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.480]   I really don't think that it's locked into--
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.280]   I don't think it's locked into anything
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.680]   that's clear right now.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.080]   I think that if you're already on a Verizon plan,
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.040]   particularly if a lot of your family members
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.760]   are on a Verizon plan, big upside
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.840]   to switching to buying either a Verizon phone
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.800]   when the time becomes when you're off a contract
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.240]   or if you've been waiting for it to come off a contract.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.160]   I think that the real decision is not
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.520]   going to come until about a month or maybe even two months
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.680]   after the Verizon iPhone has been on the market,
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.400]   where we can really do lots and lots of tests
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.320]   and crunch a lot of numbers about what
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.680]   the real actual performances of the Verizon phones
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.200]   compare to the AT&T phones.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.000]   Because for now, it's just been urban legend
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.440]   that AT&T is an inferior network and it's a terrible--
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.120]   that AT&T is--
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.280]   OK, I shouldn't be talking about how good or bad
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.040]   the AT&T network is while using Skype over the AT&T network.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.240]   But I'm saying--
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.520]   There's some guy in there just going,
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.480]   you know, I'm just going to flip that switch right now.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.400]   You know, you know.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.160]   I was like, would it be great if we suddenly
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.480]   gave them like 4G coverage on the iPhone?
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.560]   We're planning on giving away a couple of months.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.240]   Well, all I'm saying is that right now it's just been,
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.760]   you know, urban legend that, of course, if my iPhone
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.400]   were on the Verizon network, it'd be eight times as fast
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.840]   and 40 times as reliable because all the problems we've
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.280]   been having with connectivity have all been associated
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.480]   with AT&T.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.680]   And in a way, Verizon's worst nightmare has come true.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.160]   Now they have to actually put up or shut up.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.280]   They're going to have iPhone hardware running
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.600]   on the Verizon network.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.560]   And it could be that two months from now, when we have
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.520]   millions of things in the field and it's
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.720]   possible to do a true Apple to Apple's oranges to oranges
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.320]   side by side test between the two hardware,
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.320]   we'll find out that there really isn't much of an advantage
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.840]   to being on the Verizon network.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.320]   And then it's just going to come down to who's offering you
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.880]   the better deal.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.160]   I've been an AT&T subscriber for several years.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.840]   I've never felt as though I've really
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:22.000]   been at the butt end of a rifle with their service plans.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.400]   I've also been a Verizon customer.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.200]   I've come up to customer and I've often
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.000]   been reading a bill and saying, that must be a clerical error.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.120]   There's no way they're charging me for that.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.240]   I must be just stupid.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.960]   I'm not reading it.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.400]   But for now, the only decision you can make
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.480]   is that if you travel internationally,
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.520]   the AT&T phone is obviously going to be better
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.240]   because it's GSM based.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.120]   If you have need for a 3G mobile hotspot,
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.560]   then obviously the Verizon phone will
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.760]   have a feature that the AT&T phone lacks.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.760]   Unless it turns out to be a sneak peek of a feature
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.560]   where all will be getting in 4.3.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.200]   So as I said, there's no need to go out and rush.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.120]   If it were me and if I were unhappy with AT&T
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.640]   and if I did not already have a grandfather
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.200]   in unlimited data plan on my iPhone,
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.040]   I would be waiting a few months just to see
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.760]   what these things are really like out in the field.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.400]   Also, one of the things that people have started to say
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.440]   and some of the press has been talking about the fact
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.520]   that this is where Apple may lose its ability
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.920]   to just blame AT&T for coverage issues.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.760]   And so on one side, they're basically saying,
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.600]   if there's coverage issues, if Verizon,
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.120]   the one that has the best coverage out there,
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.920]   is the one, it's having trouble in drop calls.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.240]   Maybe this is the iPhone.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.400]   Conversely though, the problem with that, of course,
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.960]   is that they've changed the antenna.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.880]   So we now we don't know whether it's not,
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.240]   there's not going to be an Apple's to Apple's comparison
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.800]   between the Verizon iPhone and the AT&T iPhone
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.040]   because they're two different phones.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.400]   I mean, they have two different antennas.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.040]   - Well, close enough.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.840]   All people are interested in is,
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.560]   if I buy a Verizon phone,
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.240]   will my connection be more reliable than it is
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.720]   on the AT&T network?
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.840]   Will I get more coverage in more areas?
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.040]   And will I get faster data speeds?
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.800]   They don't really care if it's a different,
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.440]   if it's a differently tuned antenna or not.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.880]   - Well, I don't think they care, but I think AT&T cares.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.600]   I think AT&T is gonna, if suddenly everyone gets good bandwidth,
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.920]   you might hear AT&T going, well, you know,
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.280]   they have a better antenna than we did.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.960]   Apple didn't have a good antenna for there.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.080]   And they've improved it for Verizon.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.960]   Now on the, you know, that might be, you know,
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.000]   part of that argument there.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.640]   And also, you know, people could say,
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.480]   if they have bad coverage, it could be the,
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.440]   saying that the iPhone users are using this more heavily.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.000]   You know, they're starting to pound.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.840]   Now, Tom, do you think that there's going to be
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.080]   a solid argument one way or the other as far as,
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.560]   you know, coverage?
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.840]   - Yeah, I think that the CBMA modulation format
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.600]   is really a lot better than GSM for phone calls.
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.080]   So the drop calls, I think,
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.080]   aren't gonna be nearly as much of a problem,
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.720]   particularly when you're moving.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.360]   If you just have bad coverage and you're in a dead spot,
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.840]   then it just depends on where the towers are relative.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.320]   But the handoffs in GSM are much more difficult to do
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.160]   than CDMA.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.560]   The CDMA phone broadcasts all the time
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.520]   and all the towers that are in range can hear you.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.480]   And they're all listening and choosing the best signal.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.920]   Whereas in GSM, you're in a little cell
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.160]   and you've got your little time slice.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.080]   And then when you move to the next cell,
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.520]   your little time slice follows you to the next cell.
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.560]   And if the next cell is full, then you drop the call.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.160]   - Well, and this is one of the secrets behind Verizon's
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.400]   choice of CDMA, isn't it?
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.520]   I mean, that you need half as many cell towers
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.320]   to cover the same amount of area.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.840]   - Well, yeah, there's, let me have advantages of CDMA
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.240]   and there's also the disadvantage of battery life
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.920]   because the radio is on all the time
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.800]   instead of being pulsed, it costs them in battery life.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:51.800]   So it's a trade off between talk time and reliability.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.840]   So if you talk a little bit, or that is not for hours
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.640]   and you really care about not having dropped calls
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.360]   and you're on the move, then CDMA, I think,
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.440]   and the Verizon or the clear choice.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.200]   - Now, Andy, one of the other things, of course,
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.320]   and we're gonna talk about this in a minute,
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.040]   is there's a lot of rumors now starting to come out
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:14.000]   about the iPhone 5, and the iPad.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.040]   The other big question here is, does it make sense,
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.480]   is this a stop gap?
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.320]   Does it make sense?
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.280]   It really does look like we're gonna get that update
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.160]   in the summer.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.360]   Does it make sense to buy anything right now?
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.440]   - No, absolutely not.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.960]   I can't understand how anybody would have a bug
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.680]   up there, but so big that they have to get
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.680]   the Verizon phone today, today, today,
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.760]   especially when every single year,
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.160]   Apple has announced a new phone in the summer.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.840]   So that's just yet another checkbox in the decision
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.000]   to wait until the summer, wait until the iPhone 5.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.680]   Apple, Apple, I promise you, makes more than 300
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.320]   of these every year.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.320]   So I assure you that if you have money to thrust
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.920]   into the face of an Apple store employee,
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:58.000]   they'll be more than happy to swap that filthy looker
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.920]   for a shiny new iPhone 5 on the network of your choice.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.080]   - Yeah, so it'll be, so I think that that,
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.640]   as we start to look at it, I have to admit,
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.000]   like a couple of people have asked me,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   and my response has been mostly that if you don't care
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.840]   about updates, like for instance,
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.320]   if you really held out for a long time
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.440]   and you were then ready to switch to the CDMA
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.480]   and you don't care about having the newest phone
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.280]   or care about having those pieces
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.000]   and you really just want to finally just move on
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.760]   and get your iPhone, it makes sense.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.760]   If you're not trying to keep up with all the new technologies,
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.520]   but it seems like to me, if you do care about
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.680]   whatever extra features, I mean, in this example,
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.680]   is like my wife, her AT&T ends in,
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.960]   her AT&T contract ends in February.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.960]   So it's almost exactly when this is all going over.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.320]   And I'm going to get her an iPhone 4.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.400]   And the reason I'm going to get her an iPhone 4 is because
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:49.200]   she only went to the 3GS because I gave her one.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.040]   (laughs)
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.920]   She was in 3G, she was in 3G,
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.280]   she was very happy in 3G World,
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.840]   and then I moved her to 3GS,
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.040]   and she has the one page that came with her camera,
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.720]   I mean with her iPhone,
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:05.720]   and then like two other little apps that I put on her iPhone.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.320]   So there's this whole thing about,
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.240]   she just doesn't use it that heavily,
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.120]   and she uses a couple of little things,
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:12.960]   and every once in a while she goes,
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.840]   "Oh, this is kind of cool,"
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.240]   and she kind of likes using the calendar.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.800]   But so for her, moving her to the iPhone 4 right now,
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.600]   and if you're someone that's looking at that,
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.200]   then that would make sense.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.080]   And I wanted to have one because I want fate.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:28.000]   I just FaceTime and interaction, all that stuff.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.880]   And also if I get stuck using her phone,
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.800]   which occasionally happens,
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.040]   I get frustrated if it isn't an iPhone 4.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.400]   So anyway,
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.080]   so I think that for those kind of people, my mom,
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.680]   who is still using her, she's on Verizon,
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.600]   or even my dad, they're not gonna notice
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.880]   if there's all these new graphics
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.760]   and everything else, what we're gonna say, Andy?
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.880]   - I was just gonna say,
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.120]   but I just keep coming back to the statement,
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.240]   what advantage does this person gain
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.240]   by getting it now instead of in three or four months?
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.440]   Especially if you wanna toss in the idea that,
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.480]   "Well, they don't need these extra features,"
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.800]   you can also toss in the feature,
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.840]   the suggestion that maybe in the summer,
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.920]   the $200 iPhone 4 is gonna become the $99 iPhone 4,
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.640]   and the iPhone 5 is gonna be the $199 model.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.760]   Right, just, it's, and it doesn't make sense.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.600]   - And it doesn't make sense.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.480]   - Psychology 101, this thing called delayed gratification.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.680]   I can, you can have this whole bag of M&Ms in one hour,
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.600]   or you can have these five M&Ms right now.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.880]   Which one do you take?
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.240]   - Can I get the both worlds?
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.040]   Best of both worlds, can I just gazelle it
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.880]   when the new one comes out?
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.560]   - Look at that, look at that.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.640]   - He's, he's seen me, I'm sitting there fiddling around
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.960]   with gazelle, and of course Tom just threw it right in there,
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.080]   and passed me on to gazelle,
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.640]   and of course gazelle is one of our sponsors,
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.800]   we wanna thank them.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.720]   And, you know, we have a great,
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.880]   if you guys haven't heard of gazelle,
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.080]   you know, you should.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.680]   It is a great, great service,
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.240]   and the bottom line is, is a lot of us, like me,
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.840]   accumulate lots of electronics,
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.800]   and then we need to get rid of them,
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.160]   because we've got new electronics.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:06.200]   And that's the, you know, we go from a, you know,
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.560]   from our old electronics to new electronics,
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.680]   and most of the time that just go,
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.880]   that goes, I have a big box,
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.920]   full of that stuff that I'm kind of now getting ready.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.160]   We did this a little bit at the office,
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.080]   but the, but now I'm really kind of focused on building
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.680]   my little box that's gonna go to gazelle,
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.040]   because I just gotta get rid of this stuff.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.080]   I mean, it's old stuff.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.040]   You keep on thinking that I'm gonna go back and use it,
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.400]   but you're not going to.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.480]   - So, so you get more if you have the box
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.720]   and the manuals and all that?
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.560]   - You do.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.280]   - You keep, who knew, who knew?
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.840]   When I threw those away, saying,
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.880]   "I don't need these manuals."
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.160]   So you get, I don't know if the box and the manual,
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.000]   I don't know how much,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.360]   but you definitely get more for it having it
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.000]   in good condition as well as having it be a, you know,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.720]   getting the power cords and all the,
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.360]   all the little accessories and everything else.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.080]   The more you get back to the complete piece,
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.000]   the more you're gonna get for the, you know,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.040]   for your buyout.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.240]   Now, the great thing is,
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.520]   is that you don't have to figure that out.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.240]   You can go up to the webpage and simply select,
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.000]   you know, just say, "This is what I got."
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.880]   You know, so I can, you know, go up here
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.880]   and let's see if I can pop up to Gazelle real quickly here.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.520]   But, let's see.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.640]   - I like to save the boxes and all the packaging,
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.160]   particularly the Apple stuff
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.200]   because they have such beautiful packaging.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.760]   - You know, I think about doing that and then I,
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.840]   and then I don't.
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.120]   (laughs)
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.920]   You know, I, the,
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.520]   so here's Gazelle and so I can go in here and say,
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.720]   "I have an iPhone 3DS."
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.080]   - 3DS.
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:31.240]   - And let's say a 32 gig.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.280]   All right.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.760]   And is it, I have normal wear and tear,
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.360]   I have normal wear and tear, let's say.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.400]   Slight wear, such as faint scratches,
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.600]   'cause I put it in my pocket,
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.840]   'cause that's what you do with phones.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.340]   I have the AC adapter, I have the original cables.
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:52.520]   And yes, it's free of water damage.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.000]   I think, I think.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.360]   So my offer's $199.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.240]   So that's actually, you know,
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.440]   if I'm going into a new,
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.840]   if I'm looking at it, I can, for $190, I can get that.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.560]   I can immediately get a new iPhone if I wanted to.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.600]   But that's the, you know,
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.840]   that's the kind of thing you can decide
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.320]   as you're starting to figure out if you want to upgrade,
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.160]   if I want to get rid of it,
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.280]   if you want to get rid of it and this stuff,
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.600]   if you decide you're not using it.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.080]   And the thing is, if you really decide
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.600]   you're not using it, the best time to get rid of it
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.640]   is as soon as you decide that.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.400]   Not a year after you've decided it and it sat in a box.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.440]   And so, you know, you're gonna get more money for it,
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.720]   but they're gonna figure that all out.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.720]   They'll let you, you know, you can,
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.840]   they'll send you a little box, you put it in,
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.480]   you send it to them and it all works out.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.600]   So if you've got these things,
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.600]   and these are Xbox's, PlayStations,
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.280]   Weeez, GPS devices, all these things that you,
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.640]   you know, there's tons of categories,
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.600]   over 200,000 unique items that you could have
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.480]   to make that work, go to GoToGazelle.com.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.160]   And now you're gonna get 5% more
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.160]   if you use Macbreak as the coupon code.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.600]   So, so if you, so make sure to go and use Macbreak
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.680]   as the coupon code and you'll get 5% more
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.760]   when you're doing it.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.040]   But if you've decided that, you know,
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.840]   you experimented with something, it didn't really work
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.320]   and now you can't send back, you've had it for a while
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.680]   and now you're replacing it, you know, the payment method,
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.200]   you can decide whatever payment method you want.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:09.200]   You can have PayPal check or an Amazon or Walmart gift card.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.400]   All of those things are possible.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.040]   And it's just a great way to keep stuff out
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.640]   of the recycling bin 'cause that's where it's gonna go
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.600]   for many of us.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.880]   So anyway, definitely check it out.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:21.240]   Once again, gazelle.com and make sure to use Macbreak
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.640]   as your coupon code so that you can get your extra 5% on that
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.040]   and you know, start recycling, you know, important.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.280]   - So how do they sell it?
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:35.000]   - I think it's in a land of not our problem.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.320]   (laughing)
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.640]   - Well, what if I wanted to buy a phone from gazelle
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.480]   and some of the-- - I think that, you know,
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.880]   I think that they're supplying, you know,
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.840]   a whole lot of areas and that's a good question
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.320]   that I don't have the answer to.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.040]   - Okay. - But it is, you know,
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.520]   they find out where they're gonna go.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.200]   I mean, a lot of stuff like iPhones and stuff like that,
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.720]   I think you can send them overseas,
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.920]   you can do a lot of other things with them.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.720]   So I think that that's kind of how that process works,
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.960]   but what I'm really glad about is it's just not here.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.720]   You know, like I don't know where it is,
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.360]   but it's not in front of me.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.840]   So now that we've said that, the one thing that,
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.080]   the caveat that I will say is that,
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.760]   especially as the rumors that we're about
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.600]   to start talking about right now, I'm a big fan of,
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.960]   even though I talked about, you know,
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.000]   people getting excited and buying this new Verizon,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.200]   I strongly believe that we should,
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.640]   that it would be prudent to wait until the summer.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.920]   At least until June to buy a new phone.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.200]   I think that we wanna see the network sort itself out
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.200]   and see how well the network does.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.280]   I think we don't wanna put too much pressure
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.240]   on the network at first.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.560]   And then I also think that, you know,
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.440]   I think as you guys have both said as well,
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.240]   is that it's just, you know, there's no good reason.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:39.560]   The iPhone, you know, here's the thing,
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.200]   I constantly am looking at like,
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.840]   what would I else would I want with my iPhone?
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.200]   Or what else would I want for my iPad?
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.200]   And I just don't think I'm like,
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.720]   I don't know if I'm gonna upgrade this year.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.920]   And then the rumors begin.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.800]   And then I find myself going from,
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.240]   I don't really need that to, oh, well,
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.120]   that would be kind of nice to,
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.520]   I think I'm gonna need to start saving up money.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.040]   So here are some of the rumors
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.360]   that we're starting to see right now.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.560]   These are what they're saying,
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.600]   or what some people are saying,
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:12.600]   SGX 543 graphics into the iPad 2 and the iPhone 5,
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:17.200]   dual core.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.880]   So the, and this would be required if,
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.520]   I mean, one of the other things that we're starting to see
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.160]   is, you know, HDMI out, or possibly HDMI out,
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:29.280]   as well as these dual multiple ARM Cortex A9 cores,
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.880]   as well as a, the resolution on the iPad,
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.760]   I have to say, according to the rumors,
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:39.520]   is 2048 by 1536, which Andy,
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.640]   it sounds a little in the land of insanity.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.840]   What?
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.800]   - Yeah, the usual explanation is that they have to
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.520]   make, if they, up the resolution,
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.360]   they can't just pick any resolution,
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.520]   they have to pick one that's gonna be compatible
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.960]   with the current user interface
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.000]   and the current library of apps.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.360]   I don't think it's, that's on,
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.960]   that's definitely on my, I'll believe it when I see it list,
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.800]   only because there's one feature that Apple absolutely
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.560]   has to achieve with the iPad 2,
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.160]   and that is 499.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.400]   It has to still be a $499 tablet,
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.840]   or at least there's has to be something in the price range,
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.000]   that's $499.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.360]   And I don't know how they can build a device that cheaply,
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.440]   that will have that kind of a high resolution display.
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:29.440]   So I don't, I also don't know how Apple would sell that
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.600]   as a big design, a big reason to go for the iPad,
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.200]   instead of an Android tablet that competes with it.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.720]   None of the devices that were shown at CES this month
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.920]   have anything like that kind of resolution.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.640]   So I don't know why that anybody inside an Apple
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.120]   would be saying, we're gonna go for this really, really
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.400]   much more expensive, much higher power component,
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.160]   just so that we can say that where numbers are bigger
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.000]   than the other guys' numbers.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.760]   - Well, how high does it have to be,
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.360]   how high does it have to be to be called a retin display?
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.160]   Like that's what they're gonna wanna do.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.080]   - To call it, if they wanna be consistent,
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.400]   they'd have to make sure that it is magazine print quality.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.080]   They have to be able to say that this is,
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.680]   the resolution of this display is higher
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.640]   than what the human eye can resolve.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.240]   - Okay, and Tom, what resolution do you think that would be?
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:21.000]   - Well, with my eyes, it's pretty easy.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.960]   - Yeah, that's it.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.080]   - I mean, I think that most of the other things
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.320]   that we've seen here look like they're pretty much
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.440]   what we would expect.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:31.200]   So we would see the front facing camera,
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.320]   the both two cameras on it, the high resolution,
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.720]   I think we're all expecting some increase in resolution.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.480]   - The only time I notice the resolution is when I'm
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.480]   trying to exactly position a pixel in Angry Birds,
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.560]   for that exact launch point.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.200]   I think really that's the key.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.120]   And I think these two processors may fix
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.960]   the stuttering problem in Angry Birds also.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.960]   You know, I'm over Angry Birds.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.560]   We talked about this before the show.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.400]   - Mover it.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.360]   - Mover Angry Birds, 'cause it's dead to you.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.200]   - What?
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.480]   - It's dead to me. - It's DTM.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.680]   - It's DTM, dead to me, 'cause the,
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.760]   I started playing it and I finally just said
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:07.680]   I just can't do this anymore.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.160]   I can't keep on playing,
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.160]   'cause it screws up the, you know, when you get
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.160]   these really fine, you know, things where you have to get
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.400]   the right, just the right pixel,
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.200]   and then you have to hit it just right to get it to blow up
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.920]   or to split the little little birds out.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.680]   And I can't do that now because it's starting to
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.520]   at the same time.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:25.240]   - So the iPhone 5?
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.080]   - Maybe.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:26.920]   - Maybe.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:27.760]   - I'm just glad that I'm not addicted to me right now.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.280]   - One processor for the physics engine
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.640]   and one for the graphics.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.480]   - Yeah.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.320]   - Which worked perfectly the first time.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.040]   - Now there, you know, so.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.480]   - I could see, I just wanted to say that.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.360]   I could see them increasing the resolution high enough
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:44.000]   that they can boast that the iPad 2 can display true
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.840]   a 720 PhD video, 'cause that's something
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.040]   we'll let them also advertise.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.080]   And we've, and who has the greatest library
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.720]   of 720 PhD streaming, downloadable titles?
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.480]   Why, the iTunes store, of course.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.280]   - Well, and that's the thing is that
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.720]   do they need to really go to 1920 by 1080
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:00.920]   to pull that off?
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.880]   'Cause 1920 by 1080 is a big jump.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.200]   And the other thing is, is it would have to be elongated.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:09.120]   So it would be 1920 by 1080 or 1920 by 1200
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.040]   to go closer to, actually, you know,
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.040]   now you're getting closer.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.560]   - I don't see them ever.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.320]   - Well, I don't see them ever going to
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.800]   that widescreen aspect ratio for the physical hardware.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.680]   Because that's, there, at this point,
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:25.920]   I've used tablets that have that sort of widescreen
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:29.720]   form factor that's 16 by nine HD, like just form factor.
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:33.080]   And I've used the iPad and it's hard to explain why,
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.720]   but that slightly fatter screen just fits better
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.280]   as a tablet than that elongated kind.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.560]   It's into the globe, there's more wasted space.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:45.960]   It's perfectly suited for watching a HD video,
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.360]   but it's not perfectly suited for really dealing
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.600]   with any other kinds of content.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.960]   - Well, the other issue is expense, right?
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.600]   I mean, you know, you go from the 1024 by 768
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.920]   as we got started, is that that 1024 by 768
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.680]   is a much less expensive screen to produce,
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.400]   although that now that once you start ordering them
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.120]   in units of 10 million, I bet you.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:09.120]   - Oh, well, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.200]   I didn't hear part of what you were saying earlier.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.080]   I think I don't think they can,
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:18.080]   they have to necessarily have to go the full width of 720 HD.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.960]   I think that it's good enough for them.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.520]   If they can simply say that, well,
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.880]   if you really want HD, we've got a screen
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.720]   that's 720 pixels tall.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.200]   We will cut off the sides of it, but you'll get full,
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.640]   you'll get 720p resolution.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.280]   And of course, if you really feel as though
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.280]   the left and the right side of Jimmy Kimmel Live
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.000]   are that important to the story telling you
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.960]   that he's trying to accomplish in his monologue,
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.800]   then of course we will let you zoom out a little bit
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.000]   and get the full width of screen.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.800]   I think that if they were to do HD,
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.480]   they would do 720 with some window boxing.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.240]   I'm not sure that they would do full,
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.240]   wide screen with that kind of aspect ratio.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.880]   - It doesn't seem like it doesn't seem
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.720]   like more than 1280 by 720 would be really necessary
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.160]   on a screen that size.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.080]   - I mean, that's the, you know, I'm watching 1280
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:06.760]   by 720 on a 50 inch at home and it looks fine.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.920]   In fact, you know, I mean, that's the reality
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.280]   is that unless you get close enough to it,
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.920]   you know, the question is, are we really gonna resolve it?
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.680]   And that would only be a small update.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.040]   Now, one of the other things that they're rumoring
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.880]   is that using the new Qualcomm, or not new,
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.840]   but the Qualcomm chip to allow them to do CDMA and GSM
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.360]   at the same time, Tom, do you think that that's likely?
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.240]   - Well, the chip exists and it looks like a fine chip.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.160]   I don't think that you'd be able to do
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.280]   a single phone call about CDMA and GSM,
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.880]   hand off from one cell to another,
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.480]   although that would be cool.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:44.040]   I think it's more about being compatible
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.200]   for international calls and that sort of thing.
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.760]   - And also being able to buy one phone and work anywhere.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.080]   - Well, sure, and only have one to provision
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.480]   and one to maintain in all of their supply chain.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.800]   That helps quite a bit and can pay for quite a bit of silicon.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.360]   - Is there, Andy, do you think that that's a probability
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:03.480]   to see that?
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:08.160]   - I do like the idea of them having a dual chip phone
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.120]   just for the simplicity of saying we can have one factor
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:15.840]   returning out 10 million, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 million copies
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.640]   of the same thing instead of having to keep
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.680]   the supply channel packed with two different kinds of phones.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.840]   - So here's the-- - Go ahead.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.160]   - I'm just saying it might actually cost less money
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.760]   for Apple to design one phone that goes on all networks
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:33.440]   than to maintain one team maintaining the CDMA phone
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.560]   and one team maintaining the GSM phone.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.560]   - Now here's the question I have for you, Andy.
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:41.320]   So Apple has done this what I feel is kind of a rushed job
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.680]   on putting out, going onto the Verizon network.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.560]   One possibility as you start looking at the iPhone 5
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.200]   and having a CDMA/GSM phone is that this could work
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.040]   on any network.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.200]   Do you see a possibility that they gave Verizon
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.280]   an opportunity to jump in early and get some early sales?
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.960]   Because when the iPhone 5 comes out,
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.160]   they're gonna announce that they're available now
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:04.160]   on T-Mobile and Sprint and Verizon and AT&T
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.800]   and they're going out for everybody starting in July
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:11.240]   and the Verizon deal, while they get a better deal,
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.840]   greatly improves Apple's hand dealing with other
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:15.800]   cell providers.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:21.040]   - I think that Verizon was a very important get for them.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.320]   - No, they remember that there are other GSM-based networks
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.560]   in the country and so if they really just wanted
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.360]   to broaden the map of coverage and give people
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.880]   an alternative to AT&T, they could have done deals
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:31.880]   with just about anybody.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.400]   Verizon was with a Tiffany get for them.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.000]   If they have the Verizon network,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.080]   they have now they have the two biggest
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:42.280]   and most serious mobile networks in the country.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:45.600]   So after they've gotten that the relationship
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.920]   with Verizon customers up and running,
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.920]   they might actually look at their numbers
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.960]   and decide that it's not even necessary
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.240]   for them to cut deals with other carriers right now.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.680]   They'll also I think get some information
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:59.200]   about what it's like dealing with a network
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.680]   that doesn't owe the company their lives.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.720]   It's hard to remember right now,
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.320]   but a few years ago AT&T was not the,
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.680]   it's not like it was the Montel Williams Show
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.680]   of networks compared to Oprah,
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.880]   but it was definitely, they needed something
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.880]   as big and important as the iPhone to really compete
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.440]   and be head and shoulders alongside Verizon
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.440]   in the coming three or four or five years.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:25.120]   So Apple was able to kind of slap AT&T
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.520]   around as much as they wanted.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.680]   Now they're dealing with a carrier
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.520]   that has more expectations from Apple
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.880]   than Apple has of them.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.800]   And so that might be a new set of how to win friends
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.600]   and influence people lessons for Apple.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.040]   - No Tom, do you think that to answer your question,
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.680]   I don't think necessarily gonna see more carriers
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:40.800]   in the summer.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.440]   - Tom, do you think that the Android
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.960]   is forcing Apple to continue to open this
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.520]   to make sure that they're not leaving any
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:50.240]   of the table available or as little of the table available?
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.600]   'Cause an Android is selling more.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.600]   I mean, there are more androids now selling
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:58.600]   than from that platform perspective than iPhones.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.480]   Does Apple, do you think Apple is still risking
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:04.360]   having the next windows?
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.400]   - Well certainly if you're a Verizon customer
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.800]   and you want a smartphone,
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:11.680]   if you are only choice as an Android,
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:12.720]   you're gonna get an Android.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.240]   And if you have the choice of an iPhone,
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.200]   you'll probably get an iPhone.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.440]   'Cause their brand is so powerful.
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.920]   I would expect them to do probably the same percentage
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:26.920]   of iPhones sales on Verizon that they do on AT&T
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.200]   on other networks.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:33.200]   So it's probably 20 million phones this year on Verizon
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:38.680]   and that'll probably ramp up to 60 million customers over time.
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:43.520]   So yeah, I think they're gonna have huge numbers
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.280]   and you're gonna see people pull in their phones out
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.400]   and comparing who has coverage.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:53.400]   And I think that the Verizon is gonna sell a lot that way.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.120]   - Right, right.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.760]   So it'll be interesting to see how this all works.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:01.400]   - Now Verizon, now comparing it to an Android,
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:05.520]   the AB cell phone comparison tests are always interesting
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.320]   because as we found with the iPhone,
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:10.920]   even I have five bars and you have one bar in the same phone.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.400]   - Right, yeah.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.480]   And I still think that there are a lot of reasons
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.960]   that I wanna have an Android.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.800]   I haven't committed to one yet,
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.560]   but there are a lot of customizations and so on and so forth.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.040]   - Right, I wanna write code for it
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.480]   not have to deal with Apple.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.960]   - Yeah, and I think that's the big thing.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.480]   And I still think that for the folks
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.960]   that are a little bit more techy and before,
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.760]   but I think that there were people who wanted a smartphone
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.640]   that didn't want AT&T enough,
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.040]   that Apple was giving up a lot of sales in that area.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.840]   And I think giving up important ground
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.440]   as far as development.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.640]   The thing is is that it's not just how many sales
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.880]   and leaving money on the table.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.880]   It's also, as you have more users,
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.800]   it means more developers are developing for it
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.000]   and so on and so forth.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.160]   And so that changes Apple's structure.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.600]   So I think that that's one of the things
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.600]   that they have to think about.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.080]   So anyway, so we'll see how that goes.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.040]   Now before we, we've got some stuff to talk about
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.680]   with the iOS and the Mac app store
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:00.720]   and a couple other things here.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.040]   And they're coming up right after this.
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:05.440]   But first I wanna thank Ford.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.240]   Ford of course is a, has been a sponsor
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.720]   for quite some time with Twit at this point
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.160]   and a Mac break.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:15.840]   And Ford, I have to admit,
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:17.160]   I'm getting pretty darn excited
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.640]   about the Ford Focus Electric.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.200]   I have committed myself, I think I've talked about this,
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.560]   that I'm not buying another gas Tesla.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.400]   I'm buying it.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.720]   I'm not buying it.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.400]   And I've decided that that's pretty much
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:30.240]   the direction that I'm going.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.040]   I'm waiting, I was looking at the leaf.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.400]   I don't want anything that has a gas tank in it.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.240]   Like that's kind of my whole thing is I don't want,
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.400]   it's not just that I want an electric car,
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.760]   I don't want a gas tank in it.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.120]   I don't like the smell.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.320]   I just don't like the stuff.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.920]   I don't wanna have to stop randomly.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.960]   And I'm very good at managing batteries.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.680]   So, you know, like I'm very good at charging
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:52.400]   and I'm just really, really excited about the 2012 Ford
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.400]   Focus Electric.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.640]   And of course it has the voice activated sink
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.600]   and with my touch that all these Ford vehicles
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.760]   are coming out with.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.320]   It's powered by a lithium ion battery,
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:06.120]   high voltage capacity, 120 volt or 240 volt,
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.880]   240 volt upgrade that you can get.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.800]   And so you can have that installed
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.520]   to speed up the charge.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.840]   And it's gonna, you know, we think that it's gonna offer
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.040]   more miles per charge and be very competitive
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:20.640]   with any of the electric cars that are out there.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.680]   So it's gonna be interesting.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:27.040]   And of course as gas becomes more expensive and it will.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:29.640]   And as electricity, you know, continues to centralize,
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.720]   I think that it's gonna be less expensive to run this.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:34.040]   I'm not, as I said, for me, it's mostly just knowing
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.160]   that I've got something clean and I can control.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.640]   I don't have to leave the house to get it ready to go.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.240]   I don't, you know, most people, I think when you think about it,
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.120]   you go, oh, I don't wanna be caught without it.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.800]   And I'm not, I think in the next 10 years,
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.960]   we wanna have a, I think in the next 10 years,
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.640]   you're gonna wanna have a gas car available.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.040]   So it's not like my only car would be a necessary electric.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.240]   But the, but as I look at new cars, you know,
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.560]   for the long trips I might go out there,
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:02.200]   but most of the time, I thought about the last month,
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:06.760]   how many times have I driven more than 80 miles?
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.040]   You know, round trip.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.360]   And it was once.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.400]   You know, so that, you know, that's when I started
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.480]   really thinking about it, just that I don't use it that way.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.040]   And so, of course, with the Ford Sync,
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.480]   you get battery management, entertainment,
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:21.120]   climate control, phone and navigation.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.840]   You can easily make calls, you can, you know, play music,
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:25.280]   you can see where your battery's at.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.120]   You can do all of those things
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.320]   that understands 10,000 voice commands total.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.520]   So you can really keep track of everything
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.880]   and keep your hands on the wheel,
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:33.920]   keep your eyes on the road,
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.600]   and still do the things that we all wanna do
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.160]   while we're driving, but shouldn't.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.480]   So definitely check that out.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:41.800]   We wanna also thank Ford, of course, for supporting
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.160]   the special coverage of CES 2011,
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:47.000]   which was turned out very, very well.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.400]   And definitely check out Ford Focus.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:50.800]   If you wanna go, if you wanna see,
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.040]   find out more about the Ford Focus, go to Ford,
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:57.240]   I'm sorry, go to FocusElectricPower.com.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.400]   I think this is going to be something
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.920]   that we're going to see happen dramatically
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.120]   over the next 10 years is moving to electric.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.400]   So this is what we're starting to see a lot more of.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.720]   And, but you wanna definitely check it out,
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.880]   whether it's this one immediately or not,
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.160]   you definitely wanna check out
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.400]   FordFocusElectricPower.com.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:21.520]   It makes a huge difference from a energy security perspective
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.960]   as well as just the fact that it's cleaner,
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.560]   because you know, you really,
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.320]   as we start to centralize our power,
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.520]   it makes it easier for us to make changes.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.680]   You know, so we're not, you know,
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.200]   as long as it's hydrogen or gas or whatever,
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.200]   it's always gonna be how do we change 10 million gas stations
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.720]   rather than how do we change a much fewer number
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.200]   of power stations.
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.720]   So once again, check it out, Ford Electric,
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:47.440]   I'm sorry, FocusElectricPower.com.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:51.200]   So anyway, now here's a crazy thing.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:53.160]   We call it iTunes.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.000]   So, you know, we have, you know,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.160]   of course it's called iTunes,
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:00.200]   but we are moving towards a future,
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.600]   a future coming up very, very quickly,
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:05.240]   where the app store, the app store is selling more.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.800]   I mean, they're selling more applications
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.840]   than they are music on, you know,
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.560]   from within iTunes or from the app store,
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:14.560]   you know, from the app store within your,
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:16.160]   within your iPhone on the iOS.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.520]   So Andy, Andy, do you think we can keep on calling it iTunes
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.720]   if we're selling mostly applications?
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:26.040]   I think that there's a change that's gonna come.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.320]   If as soon as Apple figures out,
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:33.160]   it's sort of the reason why the iPod was originally called
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.720]   the iPod and not the iPlay,
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:37.640]   because I think there was always gonna be
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.640]   that long range plan that it's gonna be things
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.760]   for other than just music.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.000]   And I think we're gonna see a similar sort of name change
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   for iTunes later on.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.800]   I think it's, unless Apple is okay with the idea
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:52.560]   of having the app store and the iOS app store
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.840]   and the music store and the iTunes book,
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.520]   the and the iBook store,
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.320]   I think that Apple is hurriedly,
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.240]   I think the one of the top projects
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.440]   for Apple's team of lawyers is to get the rights
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:06.040]   of the name iStore once and for all.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:06.880]   - Who has iStore?
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.640]   - From the, I have no idea.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.680]   I have a feeling that whoever has it,
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.440]   whoever just like this,
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.560]   whoever, whatever college student in 1996 decided
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.360]   that he's just gonna, you go for broke,
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.920]   spend $80 registering 10 domains.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:24.000]   If he registered iStore, he's gonna be a very wealthy man
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.720]   sometime in the next 18 months.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:28.120]   - Just some numbers here.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.560]   Apple, it took 67 months.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:35.240]   So just over five years to get to 10 billion songs.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:39.840]   It has taken the app store to get to the same mark, 31 months.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:44.720]   So faster than twice as fast to get to the same number.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:48.600]   So it is moving very quickly down that path.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:51.560]   The, you know, as we look at this,
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:54.360]   I remember back when we were talking about Apple needs to
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.520]   make sure that they let third party developers develop apps
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.360]   in the first place.
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:00.600]   Do you think that this was always the plan, Tom?
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.960]   - I don't know.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.840]   - Do you think that they accidentally kind of fell into it?
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.920]   - Well, I think they accidentally fell into apps.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.240]   They started off with a web browser
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:14.320]   and then found that they couldn't really deliver
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:18.120]   the experience that people wanted with it.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:21.560]   And so now selling apps, I think,
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:24.480]   well, it's been so successful that why wouldn't you
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.040]   reproduce that in every other area of your business
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.880]   where it could apply?
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.920]   - So I have a question for you actually.
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:35.920]   So Andy, with the, I find myself now as I have more,
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.720]   I mean, I have hundreds of apps now.
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:39.760]   I mean, I buy them like little chiclets.
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.880]   Oh, that looks kind of cool.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:44.280]   And they're cheap and they're easy and they're fun to use.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:46.400]   The question is, is that now though I see apps
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.240]   and if they do a lot of different things,
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:51.640]   so like this kind of, you know, whole toolbox of apps,
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.880]   I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.840]   like you're thinking about too many things here.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.200]   I just want a little app that does this with my photos
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.480]   or I just want a little app that does this communication.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:04.120]   Are we changing the way that we think about what we buy?
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:06.440]   Do we want them to be more simple as we keep on going down
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.480]   this kind of iOS path?
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:13.200]   - That's definitely gonna be a complaint.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.000]   There's a conversation that I keep having
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   with iOS developers and it's starting to slop over
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   a little bit into desktop apps where they ask me,
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.160]   they'll show me something they're working on
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.440]   and they'll tentatively ask,
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.880]   well, how much do you think that someone
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:30.320]   would be willing to pay for this?
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.680]   And I always have to say, I won't tell you
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:34.160]   what your app is worth.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:37.320]   I'll tell you what people will be willing to pay for it.
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:41.680]   And it's over the phone, but I can hear their face go
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:45.840]   "Ashford" when I say $9.99 because people are just not
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:49.480]   programmed to spend $50 for an app that's worth $80.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:53.400]   It's not that they're cheap, it's not that they're irrational.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.600]   It's just that they've been sort of conditioned to,
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:00.080]   they're more safeguards against that click purchase
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.400]   when you get above $9.99.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:05.280]   They're willing to spend $40 for a good productivity app,
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:06.740]   a good getting things done app.
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:08.680]   But at that point, they're not gonna simply say,
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.520]   oh, what the hell?
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.660]   It's worth a try out there, try and see if it lie like it.
[00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:14.560]   That's the point of which they dump out of the iTunes store
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.120]   and start looking for recommendations,
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.800]   start looking for videos and stuff like that.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:23.200]   It's appropriate for iOS apps to be unitaskers by nature
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:28.000]   because by their very nature, the iPad here and the iPhone,
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.080]   they're not designed to be multi-paid,
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:33.400]   keep four tasks going at the same time sort of things.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:37.440]   The best apps are the ones that if they do 100 things,
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:40.240]   they have at least, they change an awareness
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.980]   of where you are in the process
[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:45.100]   and what you need to do and what you don't need to see.
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:49.180]   However, one of the risks that I've been a little bit thinking
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.700]   about with the migration to the app store
[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.820]   is if that sort of mentality,
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:56.260]   both the pricing structure and the unit asking
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:59.020]   sort of philosophy were to suddenly start
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:00.380]   to infect the desktops.
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:04.220]   And there's no reason for, there's always a good reason
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:05.940]   to have well-designed streamlined apps,
[00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:09.100]   but I don't necessarily need to have a word processor
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:10.940]   that never has more than three buttons on it
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.460]   and anyone given time.
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:15.160]   I don't want to necessarily have to launch a separate app
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.000]   to print something.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.520]   That's kind of a nasty thing, back to this for me.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:22.600]   - Didn't we see a lot of this in the early development
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:25.000]   for like Rhapsody?
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.480]   You know, back in the day, there was a lot of talk about,
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:31.840]   you know, docking a whole bunch of little applets together
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:34.780]   to form an experience rather than--
[00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:37.740]   - That was mostly, I think you're talking
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:40.020]   about the OpenDoc model where they thought that
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:41.940]   you essentially have something that was sort of
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:44.220]   a precursor to a web browser that would be a container
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:45.580]   for live objects.
[00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:48.620]   Unfortunately, people like to have a curated experience.
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.660]   People like to have someone who's smarter than they
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:52.560]   are at application development, tell them,
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:55.660]   here is how you should have a photo app running.
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:58.020]   Not, it's freedom is a nice thing,
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.020]   but I don't, I want to have the freedom
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:02.180]   to let somebody else do that work for me.
[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:05.780]   I just want to get these pictures off my camera
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.740]   and then onto a website and up to my,
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.220]   up to my Aunt Rudy.
[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:12.300]   I don't have, I want to have to build that myself.
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:15.220]   - So, yeah, I just find interesting 'cause I,
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:17.620]   I just noticed that myself becoming more sensitive.
[00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:19.820]   I know that my pain number is about
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:22.700]   between $3.99 and $4.99.
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:25.380]   That somewhere in that range, I start going,
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.580]   like if someone sends me something
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:29.220]   that I'm remotely interested in, you know,
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.900]   I get a lot of email, I'm about to get a lot more email
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:34.540]   now that I just said this, but like if someone sends me
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:36.300]   a thing like, hey, I just created a new app
[00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:37.860]   and everything else and I'm remotely interested in it.
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:40.900]   I tend not to use the coupon code.
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:43.300]   Like if it's 99 cents or buck 99,
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:45.820]   and it's in the vicinity of something
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:46.980]   that I think would be interesting,
[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:48.740]   like, I'll just get that and it's just,
[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:49.620]   you know, I'll just kind of run through it.
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:51.340]   If it gets more than that, I go,
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:52.420]   I think someone's gonna, you know,
[00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:56.100]   I'm not so sure whether I'm ready to just jump onto this.
[00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:58.300]   And once we get to $9.99, it better be,
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.580]   like I get kind of bitter.
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:03.420]   I think that's the difference is that at $3.99 and below,
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:04.740]   I'm in this thing, I buy it.
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:06.780]   It was a price of a cup of coffee.
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:09.220]   If it doesn't work, I guess kind of go, eh,
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:10.860]   you know, and I move on and I make sure
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:14.020]   that it doesn't sync with any of my other devices anymore.
[00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:17.220]   But at $9.99, I find that I,
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:20.260]   if it doesn't work, I get kind of, I get salty.
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:21.180]   Tom?
[00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:22.020]   - Yeah.
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:24.260]   Somewhere between 10 and $20 for me,
[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:27.540]   I start researching things carefully.
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:34.100]   And sometimes it's more based on how well I want it to work.
[00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:36.940]   You know, if it looks like a really good idea
[00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:38.780]   and I just want it to be successful,
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:41.700]   so maybe they will continue to improve it,
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.540]   then I've had really good luck.
[00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:45.380]   - Right.
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:46.300]   And there's some things that have been more expensive,
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:47.300]   like for instance, elements,
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.940]   is because someone was just asking on the forums
[00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:51.140]   about elements, Hermes.
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:54.660]   And I got elements, I don't really use it,
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:57.220]   but it's great to show, I got my $14.99
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:58.060]   'cause everyone says,
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:59.580]   "What can you do with an iPad?"
[00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:01.140]   I was like, "Well, look what it's gonna do with education."
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:03.460]   And I pop this thing open and I spin some stuff around
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:05.140]   and everyone goes, "Ooh, on."
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:08.460]   I've done that, you know, for the 8,000th time.
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.940]   It, you know, it proves the point.
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:14.180]   But now, Andy, where's your pain point?
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:17.740]   - I wouldn't call it a pain point.
[00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:20.100]   I will buy almost anything that seems interesting.
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:23.220]   It has good screenshots for less than five bucks.
[00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:26.740]   At $9.99, if I flip through them
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:31.740]   and see a good video of its features, for $9.99,
[00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:35.540]   if it's something that I can really get use out of,
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:38.020]   then maybe I'll still pull the trigger.
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:40.660]   Above $9.99, I don't think that's too much
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:43.140]   to ask for a professional app,
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:45.820]   but I suddenly start to evaluate it
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:47.340]   as a professional app.
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:49.340]   I will have very high expectations.
[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:53.140]   I'm not going to be in the front row of the middle.
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:57.820]   We all have these experiences and three of us together about,
[00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:00.620]   "Oh, you worked so hard on it."
[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:02.860]   I can see you tried really hard,
[00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:05.020]   Deaf's who's being taken to Baskin Robbins
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.620]   after the performance tonight.
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:09.540]   And that's sometimes what I do when there's a $2.99 app
[00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:12.540]   that adds a little bit ropey, but it works okay.
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:14.980]   I just like it and I want to see it continue to be developed.
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:19.380]   But once an app is like $25, $30, $40,
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:22.100]   wow, you really have to convince me
[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:23.460]   that this is a great app.
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:27.260]   Given that I probably can't download a demo version of it,
[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:30.460]   given that I can't get a refund
[00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:32.100]   if it doesn't really work out,
[00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:33.460]   that's honestly, that's the reason
[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:35.340]   why a lot of these getting things done apps,
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:39.540]   so these personal productivity apps are untested by me,
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:43.580]   because I just can't spend $50 on an app
[00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:46.140]   that comes with an entire philosophy behind it,
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:49.060]   that according to four out of 10 comments
[00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:51.180]   I may or may not get.
[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.060]   I just can't take that kind of risk,
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:55.140]   especially in the terms that the app store offers you.
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:56.380]   - Do you think the free versions work?
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:59.460]   I mean, there's like a free version and a pro version.
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:03.460]   Do you think that is as close to demo as you need to be?
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:06.740]   - I think that it's a necessity.
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:09.100]   You need to be able to expose some of the functions
[00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:12.620]   of the program to somebody for zero or 99 cents
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:14.540]   or just close to free.
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:15.940]   If you're not gonna do that,
[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:18.900]   you really have to budget a lot of your development time
[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:21.980]   to here is the two hours a day I'm going to spend
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:26.660]   building videos that clearly walk people through a task
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:27.500]   with this app.
[00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:28.820]   It doesn't matter if it's a photo editing app,
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:30.260]   it doesn't matter if it's a word processor,
[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:32.300]   it doesn't matter if it's a simple printing app.
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:34.860]   I need to see something living and breathing
[00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:37.100]   in front of me before I'm gonna pull the trigger
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:39.460]   on a $15, $20, $30 purchase.
[00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:40.660]   - Well, and that also affects a lot of,
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:42.580]   I think a lot of times when we see reviews of apps
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:45.900]   on the iPhone store, on the app store,
[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:49.300]   is that the more you charge for the rougher people
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:51.020]   get about your, about,
[00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:52.980]   and to me, there seems to be like a no man's land
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:54.780]   between $5 and $30.
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:56.380]   So when you charge more than $30,
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:59.340]   we're assuming that you put a lot of work into it
[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:01.580]   and it's also a much more vertical market.
[00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:04.580]   So it's a market that is, they tend to understand
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:07.820]   that this is for my industry and it's not really for
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:10.460]   everybody and it really works well.
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.100]   And then if it's below $5, they're like,
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:14.660]   well, he tried hard, we'll take it to Baskin-Roberts.
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:19.660]   And the, but in between that is this kind of uncomfortable
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:20.700]   thing.
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:21.540]   I think the other thing that's interesting
[00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:22.900]   about the culture though in the app store is the,
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:25.940]   is the fact that I, how many free apps do we get?
[00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:27.740]   If it's not a big company putting out a free app
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:29.940]   where I understand where they're coming from,
[00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:33.420]   a lot of times I kind of look sideways at the completely
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:36.260]   free apps, afraid that they're not,
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:37.460]   you know, there's just not enough put into them
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:40.260]   that they're gonna work unless they're part of a pro version
[00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:42.580]   or they're part of a big company that you know
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:44.180]   is doing promotion.
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:46.460]   - Yeah, there's something about a free app.
[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:47.660]   I'm sorry Tom, go ahead.
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:50.260]   - Oh free is great when it has a pro version
[00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:54.060]   because what I've noticed is the free apps tend to have ads
[00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:56.780]   and I'm sensitive to that sort of thing.
[00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:59.140]   I don't wanna see an ad when I'm trying to do something.
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:02.020]   So I wanna see a pro version that has no ads
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:04.700]   and then the free version is a great way to decide
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:06.260]   if I wanna buy that.
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.420]   - Right, right.
[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:08.260]   And yeah.
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:10.500]   - I just get, I just get a little,
[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:14.220]   this is the world that we live in today.
[00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:16.820]   I get a little bit suspicious if someone offers me
[00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:19.860]   what looks like a very free, very good and useful app
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:21.020]   and it's free.
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:25.460]   I look at it and I think you're making money off of this
[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:26.740]   somehow.
[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:29.900]   What kind of data are you transmitting to God knows
[00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:32.460]   where, to sell it to God knows whom,
[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:34.980]   just so that I can find, I can calculate the hyper focal
[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:36.380]   distance for my camera.
[00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:38.060]   Yikes.
[00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:38.900]   - Yeah.
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:41.460]   - And another thing we might be fighting here is that
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:47.460]   the iPhone certainly and the iPad maybe,
[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:50.220]   they're not like notebook computers.
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:52.220]   See, they're not designed so that you're gonna
[00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:56.260]   plonk down on the table and spend four or five hours
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:58.220]   working on a project on your iPad.
[00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:00.900]   It's designed to be something you dip into
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:04.820]   and it certainly can help you spend two or three hours
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:06.500]   writing an article or doing something like that
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:07.740]   but it's not designed for that.
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:11.300]   So it tends to resist those kinds of massive,
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:14.260]   massive apps that are designed to be the best work
[00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:17.500]   processor in the world or the best financial analysis
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:18.420]   program in the world.
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:21.020]   They are designed to give you these wonderful 10 to 30
[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:22.140]   minute experiences.
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:24.340]   I think that's what developers are fighting against
[00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:28.060]   when they try to charge $30 for an app that,
[00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:30.500]   as they keep saying, might even be worth $50.
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.620]   It's hard to say that this is the 10,
[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:36.140]   this is only gonna be used 10 minutes at a time but boy,
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:38.780]   will you be able to get a lot done in those 10 minutes.
[00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:40.140]   - Now, speaking of app stores,
[00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:42.020]   of course we have a Mac app store now.
[00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:44.700]   And one of the things that,
[00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:48.180]   and I can't, I haven't gotten clearance to say who,
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:49.980]   but I've been talking to a couple of developers
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:53.420]   and the numbers I'm hearing are 25,
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:57.900]   40% increases, up to 80% increases in sales
[00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:58.940]   since the Mac app store.
[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:01.980]   Now, these are all apps that were less than $50
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:05.860]   and they're just seeing huge spikes in purchasing
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:09.660]   based on, as the Mac app store came out,
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:13.020]   suddenly they're just seeing all these purchases.
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:15.180]   Is this just people experimenting with the thing
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:18.420]   or is it an easier way to buy,
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:20.740]   well, it turns out it's a really easy way to buy apps
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:22.060]   whether you like it or not, right Tom?
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.860]   - It's a little too easy to buy apps, it turns out.
[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:27.020]   If you go and download a free app,
[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:30.460]   you need to put in your password to do that.
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.460]   And you get the bill from the Apple store
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:34.500]   for $0 and $0.
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:37.260]   But once you have your password in until it expires,
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:40.020]   it turns out that if you just accidentally click
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.660]   on any of the prices in the store,
[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:44.580]   and there are a lot of price tags in that store,
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:47.060]   the little app jumps right out of the app store
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.540]   and it jumps onto your dock and a beautiful--
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:50.380]   - And there you have it.
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:54.700]   - Parabolic swoop and you just spent $40,
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:57.580]   which you have, which I did last night.
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.940]   - Not that you're bitter, well.
[01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:02.260]   - So then I looked into, well,
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:04.300]   how do you get your money back from the app store?
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:07.940]   And it turns out there's a trick to that.
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:10.740]   You file a complaint and they get back to you.
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:13.060]   And so I'm waiting to hear back,
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.780]   they say it may take up to five days
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:18.780]   to figure out whether or not I get my $39.99 back
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:22.540]   for an app that I accidentally bought that I already own.
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:23.380]   - Yeah.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:24.900]   (laughing)
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:26.540]   Well, and it's interesting, you know,
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:30.260]   I think that that is a, I accidentally bought an app.
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.900]   It turned out to be free, but when I clicked on it,
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:33.500]   it was like, boom, it was like, whoa.
[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:34.340]   'Cause it used to with the iPhone.
[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:35.420]   - So you can click on the trigger.
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.660]   - I actually, so I used to complain a lot
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.860]   about the iPhone always requiring me,
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:43.140]   every time I bought something,
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:45.940]   requiring me to put in my passcode.
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.260]   You know, like I had to always put them,
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:48.940]   I was like, oh my, oh, oh.
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:51.300]   And I was like, why can't, once I do it,
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.300]   why can't they just get it?
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:53.300]   And I think this is what they've done.
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:55.180]   So people like me were complaining and saying,
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:56.100]   you should just be able to order it.
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:59.420]   But when my son has my iPhone or my,
[01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:01.020]   you know, my three year old son
[01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:02.540]   is running around with my iPhone or my iPad.
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.620]   He's gotten really good at getting to the App Store.
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:05.900]   Now he's really good at getting to YouTube.
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:07.180]   He's really good at getting to the App Store.
[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:11.380]   And you can, I've seen him many times run into that wall
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:13.940]   of, you know, wait for your passcode.
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.220]   And fortunately he hasn't figured out the hash
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:17.580]   that I'm using for him.
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:19.900]   My older daughter has, like I thought,
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:21.220]   I was like, oh, that's a hash, you'll never get it.
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:22.260]   And then she told me what it was.
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:24.300]   And I was like, okay, nevermind.
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:25.980]   So anyway, so I had to change it.
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:28.220]   So, Andy, do you think that this is a problem
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:29.540]   that Apple needs to address?
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:32.300]   - Yeah, definitely.
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:33.500]   I don't think they're gonna address it
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.260]   until it becomes a big enough issue,
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:38.980]   until they get enough calm, rational internet people,
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:44.540]   painting a simple and non adversarial picture
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:47.260]   of how they quite innocently and accidentally
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:48.980]   made purchase they didn't intend.
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:50.060]   'Cause that is a problem.
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:53.620]   That is a big kick in the gut when you realize that,
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:56.860]   especially those of us who have are on MacBooks,
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:00.300]   we've turned, tapped a click on our trackpad.
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.860]   That is a, believe me, I never, ever moused so carefully
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:06.420]   as I do as when I'm inside the App Store app.
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:09.540]   So I do not like accidentally spending two or three dollars
[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:10.380]   now.
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:12.660]   I mean, now we're talking about apps that cost real money.
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:14.460]   - Yeah, so I think that by the end of the year,
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.180]   we're gonna see some sort of solution.
[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:20.540]   Like maybe, I don't know how they would do it though.
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:23.100]   And I don't know how they would do it
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.420]   without seriously changing the infrastructure
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:26.900]   of how apps get installed.
[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:30.020]   Because it takes all of what, 20 seconds
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.980]   for an app to download and get installed.
[01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:34.780]   How does the App Store manager successfully,
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:37.340]   if it gives you a 30 minute grace period to say,
[01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:39.340]   oops, I didn't mean to do that.
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:42.220]   That's something that people are merely gonna abuse.
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:44.540]   Even if you just give people a two minute window,
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:48.340]   we'll give them a little moment to realize what they've just
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:51.220]   done and then holy crap, that's actually a $50 app
[01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:52.380]   or $100 app.
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:54.100]   What does that, I need to undo that.
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:56.740]   That's a two minute window which no good next
[01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:58.100]   and figure out, I bet there's a way
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.380]   that I can keep a copy of this app.
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:02.900]   I'll just make it back up of this receipt or I'll write a script.
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:04.740]   It simply looks in the receipts folder to make sure
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:08.020]   that before the App Store deletes it and undoes my purchase,
[01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:08.860]   I'll get that back.
[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:11.380]   - Well, isn't it, but aren't you an initiative,
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.940]   for me, it would just be enough to say,
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:13.780]   are you sure you really,
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:14.900]   I just need another button that says,
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:16.900]   are you sure you really wanna buy this app?
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:18.460]   Like that's the whole thing is that they're just no,
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.620]   it's just automatically running to the app
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:22.740]   and I get the one click experience.
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:26.460]   But to me, all I need is just when I accidentally click
[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:29.980]   on something going, you're gonna about to spend $49.99,
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:32.180]   are you sure you wanna do this?
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:33.580]   - Yeah, I thought Amazon had a patent
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:35.260]   on one click purchasing.
[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:36.900]   - I think Apple is actually paying them for it.
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:38.020]   - Oh, okay. - I think that that was part
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.500]   of the, I think Apple pays Amazon.
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.020]   - Now that they have to get their money sort of?
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:42.300]   - I think they're getting their money's worth out of it.
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:44.300]   Yeah, Apple, I think--
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.420]   - I want two click purchasing.
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:49.020]   - I actually, you know, and I've never turned that on
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:50.020]   in Amazon.
[01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:51.060]   - I haven't either.
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:53.780]   - 'Cause I'm terrified that I'll order the wrong thing.
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.140]   And I order lots of things.
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:56.500]   - Go ahead.
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.980]   - I'll admit that your idea is a lot easier to implement
[01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:00.540]   than mine, can't I?
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:02.460]   I think at least an option,
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:05.500]   just so there's so much of the, even in the iTunes store,
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.220]   where it will say, okay, you're about to purchase this iOS app,
[01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:09.700]   are you sure you wanna make this purchase?
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:10.580]   And then there's a checkbox,
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:13.020]   I don't have warmie about such things ever again.
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.340]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:15.740]   - I think that's all I would need to do to make--
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:16.580]   - I think we'll do that real soon.
[01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:17.420]   - To make us all happy.
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:19.060]   Finally, we're about to get to our picks of the week
[01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.540]   and we're about to get to our Audible pick of the week
[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:22.020]   that Annie's gonna share with us.
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.900]   One more little piece of news that we probably should
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.180]   have talked about earlier, but it's been bouncing back up
[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:28.820]   because of course we're talking about financials with Apple,
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:31.380]   is Apple's cash stockpile.
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:35.660]   So Apple is sitting on 50 billion,
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:38.500]   not million, billion of dollars.
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:42.420]   And there's a lot of argument there,
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:45.180]   their investors are arguing that
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:47.180]   that they should be giving that back to the investors.
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:48.780]   And because the investors evidently have not been
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:50.700]   getting a very good return from their Apple stock,
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:53.100]   'cause the problem is that Apple stock has been,
[01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:55.980]   has really just been flat, but very flat.
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:57.500]   I mean, it just doesn't make a lot of, no.
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:58.980]   The thing is, it's going up pretty fast,
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:00.740]   but of course everyone's concerned that
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:02.660]   what if Apple doesn't continue to grow the way
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:03.500]   that it's growing?
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:06.420]   Is this gonna be, we wanna get our money now?
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:09.540]   And Andy, do you think that they have a valid point
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:10.380]   as investors?
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:15.380]   - Not really, 'cause Apple's not the sort of company
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:20.060]   that just gives, the sort of company that returns profits
[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:24.740]   by making sure they don't have lots of cash on hand.
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:28.420]   They make profits by not only funding a lot of projects
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:33.020]   that go nowhere for now, but also by seeing a great solution
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:35.780]   in a small company out there and just buying that company
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:38.060]   and absorbing all that talent and all those patents.
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:42.060]   So they're a company that really needs a fat war chest.
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:47.060]   And I, remember that this was an investment community
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:49.140]   that would say, we set a target,
[01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:52.260]   we set a target of Apple of $1,000 per share
[01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:55.780]   and it underperformed by $550.
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:56.860]   This sucks.
[01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:57.700]   - Yeah, it's true.
[01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.020]   - It's a matter of how profitable they are.
[01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:00.420]   - In a lot of companies, Apple-sized,
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:02.980]   I mean, Microsoft was pushed into this earlier
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:05.140]   and I don't think it necessarily to their advantage.
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:08.180]   They were pushed into the idea of sharing a big chunk
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:10.580]   of their billions with their investors.
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:12.580]   Tom, do you think that Apple's gonna cave?
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:15.820]   - No, I don't think so.
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:18.780]   They need to have a pretty big pile of cash around
[01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:21.180]   just because they're such a big hardware company.
[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:23.140]   - You say you want money?
[01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:23.980]   - You want to make one.
[01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:24.820]   - You want to make 10 million of something
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:28.380]   and you figure out the part cost is $100 or something.
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:30.900]   It turns out you need a $10 billion
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:33.020]   lying around just to do a production ramp.
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:36.180]   And so they have a legitimate need for it.
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:37.940]   The concern, of course, of the investors
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:40.140]   is that it makes you a takeover target
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:43.140]   because somebody will figure out how to borrow
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:46.660]   enough money to buy all that stock
[01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:50.060]   and then they just have to pay the interest on that money
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:51.660]   and they'll pay it with the cash
[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:52.940]   that you have in your company.
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:55.260]   And so that's what you try to avoid.
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:56.100]   - That's what you're trying to avoid.
[01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:58.220]   And currently though, the problem is the second most
[01:07:58.220 --> 01:07:59.500]   expensive company in the world.
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:03.740]   - Right, and I don't really see Apple as a takeover target.
[01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:05.580]   And so not so much.
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:07.500]   I don't think they have that concern.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:11.220]   So I think the investors are not gonna get their money today.
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:14.060]   - So I just think it's absurd.
[01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:15.500]   That's all, I'm not gonna say anything else.
[01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.100]   I don't think I need to say anything else about it.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:18.860]   It's kind of like if you want your return
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:19.860]   then sell your stock.
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:23.100]   You know, I mean, you know, just and move on.
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:28.100]   I, every time I see this, all I can say is what a bunch.
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:32.220]   Wait, here we go, a Boiners.
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:33.060]   (laughs)
[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:34.740]   - I had to cut right to the, what a bunch of Boiners.
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:36.220]   You know, anyways, so that's all.
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:38.300]   I mean, the thing is, I think that they're saving up
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:40.820]   to buy the US government, which I think is going
[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:42.740]   to actually be a lot cheaper soon.
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:45.380]   So I think that, you know, then we could just have
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:46.220]   Apple everywhere.
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:48.740]   I mean, I think that that, I think that is a great
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:51.300]   expenditure for Apple to really be thinking about.
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:53.540]   For, I bet you Apple wasn't thinking that angle,
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.140]   but I'm telling you.
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:56.660]   - Or maybe a smaller country.
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:58.500]   - A smaller, ah, smaller country, maybe.
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:08:59.340]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:00.620]   I mean, you could afford, there's a lot.
[01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:03.420]   It turns out that, that $50 billion could buy you
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:05.500]   like two thirds of the countries in the world.
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.820]   You know, so I mean, you know, if they were for sale,
[01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:10.180]   I mean, you'd be able to, like bigger than the gross
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:13.020]   domestic product for most of these countries.
[01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:15.580]   So anyway, yeah, the Chinese I don't think
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:17.340]   they're going to sell, but you know, possibly,
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:19.140]   I'm not going to, if I start throwing out countries,
[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:20.420]   then we're going to get lots of complaints.
[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:23.700]   So a possible takeover targets by Apple.
[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:25.500]   - You want a very pretty one.
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:26.860]   - I think it would be important.
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:28.380]   If you're going to get one, it has to be very shiny,
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:30.100]   pretty like, if Apple was going to buy one,
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:31.860]   I would say like Luxembourg or.
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:33.060]   - That's just what I was thinking.
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:34.140]   - Were you thinking Luxembourg?
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:34.980]   - I was thinking Luxembourg.
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:36.300]   - That would be one, I bet you they could afford.
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:38.180]   You know, Switzerland might be a little close,
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:40.420]   but it would be very, you know, very clean.
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:42.580]   I think that that would be a really good addition
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:45.540]   to the Apple, you know, group of products.
[01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:48.340]   You could, you know, and then if you owned an iPhone,
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:51.380]   you could just visit that country for free.
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:52.820]   - It'd be a citizen automatically.
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:53.740]   - No, they'd probably charge you.
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:56.180]   But they're, but the hotels and the,
[01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:58.140]   and you could just go, they'd be an app for everything.
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:09:59.140]   - Oh, currency.
[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:01.460]   The currency would be all managed through the phone.
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:02.300]   - Exactly.
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:03.140]   - We could do that in the US too.
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:03.980]   - Of course, that's probably coming too.
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:05.180]   - Of course, that's already done in Japan, right?
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:06.300]   You buy things with the phone.
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:07.140]   - Right.
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:09.700]   - Well, anyway, so now that we've ended our absurdity
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:12.740]   related to that, we answered absurdity with absurdity.
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:14.380]   We'd like to thank Audible, of course.
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:18.180]   Audible is the, you know, it's Audible.
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:22.260]   It is the best way to read a book, in my opinion.
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:25.180]   Don't bother, I mean, I, we've talked about this.
[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:28.020]   You know, my, I watch fiction.
[01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:31.300]   I download Kindle apps actually most of the time
[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:34.460]   for technical manuals that I wanna go through.
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:36.860]   And I, but I listen to everything else.
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:38.900]   You know, that's pretty much, and I listen to it on Audible.
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:41.140]   And I mean, I have, I just have, I know what I love
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.860]   is I have a huge library sitting on my iPhone.
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:46.420]   So whatever I'm in the mood for, I've listened through,
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:47.700]   you know, I can, I can listen to it.
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:51.180]   It is, you know, they have more than 75,000 downloads.
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.020]   So it doesn't matter.
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:54.220]   I mean, you know, whatever you're interested in,
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:56.460]   there's gonna be this, you know, it's gonna be available.
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:59.140]   And, and so you definitely wanna check it out.
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:02.660]   Audible.com, and of course the,
[01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:04.300]   it's Audible.com/Macbreak by the way.
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:07.700]   Go to audible.com/Macbreak and you can get a free book.
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:10.060]   And if you're thinking about a free book,
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:13.100]   usually about this part of the show, Andy, you know,
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:15.700]   might possibly have a suggestion.
[01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:21.340]   - Yes, well, this is part of my plan of why I chose
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:24.900]   to do Macbreak from my car for this exact,
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:28.340]   for this exact audible pick because usually where,
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:31.220]   usually I go through a lot of audible books
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:34.420]   and because I do a lot of driving.
[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:38.940]   And so this is where I burned through most of my audio books,
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:42.260]   right here with the car, with the iPhone and the car mode.
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:47.260]   And back when I was doing the three hours of driving
[01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:50.540]   for five times a week, believe me,
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:53.060]   it takes, I was on the gold plan and boy,
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:55.420]   it doesn't take long to get through a 12 hour audio book.
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:58.900]   And boy, are you grateful for that kind of entertainment.
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:01.180]   - My pick of the week is the latest book
[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:03.540]   I just downloaded about three days ago.
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:06.260]   I realized that I'm not necessarily in a rut
[01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:09.700]   by always picking historical books and nonfiction,
[01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:12.540]   but it's been a while since I picked a novel.
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.260]   So I decided to split the difference.
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:16.260]   So my pick of the week is sideways,
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:20.740]   which is the novel that the movie with Paul Giamatti
[01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:24.140]   was based on a few years ago.
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:27.340]   And some of my favorite audible books
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:30.260]   are these books that later on became movies
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:32.420]   because it is just like,
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:37.140]   it's not terribly legal to watch movies while you're driving.
[01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:40.220]   However, when you listen to the audio book version
[01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:42.500]   of that book, you actually get a lot of the same experience,
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.740]   especially if you listened to that movie before.
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:47.460]   And also because the movie was,
[01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:51.780]   the movie is 110, 120 page screenplay adapted
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:54.020]   from a 400 to 500 page novel.
[01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:57.220]   And so it's lots of extra texture, lots of extra moments,
[01:12:57.220 --> 01:13:01.060]   lots of extra explanation for what made a character tick
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:03.620]   and why they were in a certain situation.
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:06.140]   And that's exactly the situation with sideways.
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:07.260]   Have you seen the movie before?
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:10.380]   It's all told by the,
[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:12.700]   it's all told in the first person,
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:16.260]   it's all from the perspective of a Giamatti's character.
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:19.700]   And you really do find out exactly how screwed up this guy is
[01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:22.180]   'cause you see exactly, you hear everything he's thinking
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:23.500]   and everything that he's about to say
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:27.020]   and everything he doesn't say at any given moment.
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:31.300]   It's been a while since I've mentioned the running length
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:32.300]   of my picks.
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:35.100]   Remember that especially if you're trying to get your free book,
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:37.100]   you do wanna stick it to the man by selecting
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:39.140]   longer unabridged audio books.
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:43.540]   This is unabridged at 11 hours and 17 minutes.
[01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:46.180]   A lot of books out there are only six or seven hours.
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:48.740]   So believe me, you will be bringing the dogs
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:52.380]   of the old Darky down to their craven knees
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:54.540]   by taking, put out your free book,
[01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:57.460]   an 11 hour and 17 minute title.
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:00.740]   I'm only about two or three chapters through it right now,
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:03.540]   but the narrator is good, it's a great book.
[01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:07.020]   And I'm glad to say that all the carbon,
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:11.260]   all the damage to the environment that you're not doing
[01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:15.140]   by promoting clean energy efficient and electric vehicles,
[01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:18.260]   I am burning up by keeping my old car
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:21.300]   and doing like, unnecessary laps around the neighborhood
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:23.180]   because I'm nearly at the end of the chapter.
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:25.420]   I just have to find out what happens next.
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:27.900]   So we'll get that one of each other out really nicely.
[01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:30.780]   - You know, and Audible is all part of my scheme this year.
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:33.780]   This year, there's certain things that I'm working on.
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:36.260]   One is getting rid of paper, beyond paper.
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:38.380]   Like, none.
[01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:40.820]   And I pick actually is connected to that later,
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:44.980]   but I don't wanna buy any more paper.
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:47.740]   So anyway, go to audible.com/macbreak
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:49.820]   to get your free book if you haven't already.
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:50.900]   Definitely check that out.
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:53.780]   Of course, Audible is the leading provider of audiobooks
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:55.740]   with more than 75,000 titles.
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:57.220]   You can get, you know, whether it's fiction,
[01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:58.500]   nonfiction or periodicals,
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:00.740]   this is the place to check it out.
[01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:05.740]   So, and again, get your free one going to audible.com/macbreak
[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:08.700]   and now without further ado,
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:10.660]   it's time for our picks of the week.
[01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:12.580]   Tom, we'll let you go first.
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:15.940]   - All right, my pick of the week is called Base
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:18.180]   and it's from the Mac App Store.
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.100]   And it's the kind of application I'd really like
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:20.940]   to see more of.
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:24.220]   And that is you take your basic open source application.
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:26.140]   In this case, it's SQ Lite.
[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:29.500]   You put a bit of a friendly user interface on it.
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:32.740]   Nothing exotic, but just expose the basic functionality
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:36.220]   of the tool and you slap it into the App Store
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:37.700]   and you maintain it for people.
[01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:40.820]   Because there's all this great open source software out there
[01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:42.620]   that you can download it from source forage
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:44.660]   or the project websites or that sort of thing.
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:45.900]   But it's a pain to maintain.
[01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:48.380]   And if you wanna show it to somebody and they say,
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:50.380]   "Well, that's really cool, where do I get that?"
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:51.860]   And you say, "Well, you got a source forage
[01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:53.700]   and then you look through the project
[01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:54.900]   and then you go to the download section."
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:56.540]   It's pretty complicated.
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:58.900]   So what I'd really like is to just say,
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:01.740]   you go to the App Store and it's only a few dollars
[01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:06.380]   and you install it on your machine and it's maintained.
[01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:07.460]   - It is nice.
[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:09.740]   I had my first update on with Twitter.
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:10.580]   And it was just like,
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:11.420]   would you like to update?
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:13.300]   There's an app that needs to be updated, boom.
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:14.140]   - Yeah.
[01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:16.420]   - It's really a good experience, I think,
[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:21.020]   at least potentially, and I really use SQ Lite a lot.
[01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:25.620]   And so I'm looking forward to using base on the Mac.
[01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:26.460]   - Great.
[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:27.300]   So that is base.
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:30.260]   Andy, what is your pick for the week?
[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:34.300]   - I'm going to, I had a different pick of the week.
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:37.100]   I'm gonna change it because of--
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:38.380]   - People in an audible.
[01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:42.100]   - I'm calling an audible.
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:44.300]   And so I did mention it earlier,
[01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:45.660]   but I'm gonna mention it again.
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:48.780]   I just absolutely love the Ram Mount system
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:51.620]   for putting devices in your car.
[01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:55.020]   If you go to ramrm-mount.com,
[01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:57.860]   you'll see the company site,
[01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:00.060]   you'll see exactly the full range
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:02.220]   of mounting devices that they have there.
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:06.060]   Now, if all you want is a device for mounting your iPhone
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:09.420]   into your car, this is the one you want
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:13.140]   because it doesn't matter how you want it mounted,
[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:14.980]   they have a solution for you.
[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:17.580]   My personal, for my car right now,
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:19.860]   'cause I don't really want to take apart my dash
[01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:23.060]   and drill holes in it, I want a good suction cup mount.
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:25.380]   But the idea is that even in cold weather,
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:27.580]   this thing sticks like the devil.
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:30.660]   And this double ball jump, this is a machined metal.
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:34.060]   And once you tighten up that screw right there,
[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:36.700]   this thing does not wobble, it does not bend,
[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:39.580]   it does not, it's like the thing is welded
[01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:40.820]   to your car frame.
[01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:44.780]   I hate these, you'll find all these plastic
[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:47.100]   mounts that cost even more money than this
[01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:51.060]   and this mount system would cost about 20, 25 dollars a year.
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:53.860]   I've seen plastic ones that cost $35, $40
[01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:55.940]   which is bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:57.220]   as you drive along.
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:59.780]   None of that with this, it's absolute rock solid.
[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:02.460]   And the thing is you can customize it however you want.
[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:05.260]   I mentioned that I don't like to take apart my dash,
[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:06.980]   probably cause the way my car is designed,
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:08.100]   it's kind of hard to do.
[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.420]   If you do want to do that, well,
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:11.140]   instead of buying the suction cup part of it,
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:13.500]   buy the actual hard mount version of it,
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:15.900]   the rest of it will be exactly the same.
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:20.420]   When you switch from your iPhone 4 to your iPhone 5,
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:22.380]   you don't have to buy an entirely new mount system.
[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:25.060]   All you have to do is buy a different head for this.
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:27.060]   Now this is a bad example because I just,
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:28.820]   like I said, I test so many things,
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:30.100]   it's just simpler for me to just have
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:31.500]   a little Velcro pad there.
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:34.940]   But you can buy custom cradles for every model of phone,
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:36.660]   every model of GPS.
[01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:39.860]   There's even a camera mount that I often use,
[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:42.220]   that I use all the time.
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:46.780]   It's a lot of fun when I just need to have a travel tripod
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:49.220]   just for my regular photo camera.
[01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:51.300]   Oddly enough, this suction cup rig
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:54.340]   works a lot better than a lot of portable tripods I've used
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:57.500]   because there's a good chance I'll be able to find
[01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:58.820]   something with a smooth surface
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:01.180]   that this will stick to just quite nicely.
[01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:03.940]   And as we saw last week, it turned out to be exactly,
[01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:06.420]   and even this week, this was the perfect solution
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:08.900]   for when you need to shoot talking head video,
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:10.820]   you're just in the field, you need to stand up
[01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:12.540]   in front of a good light source,
[01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:15.380]   record you explaining something.
[01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:17.980]   You can either get this tripod with legs
[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:20.500]   that will extend to about five and a half, six feet,
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.220]   so you get a good angle on yourself
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:26.220]   and somehow find a way to get that in your backpack.
[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:28.140]   Or you just get the suction cup mount
[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:31.700]   with the camera mount head on the top of it.
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.340]   And then you just simply stick it to any window,
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:35.340]   you'll have light and you'll have the right height.
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:38.620]   So on top of everything else, like I said,
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:40.220]   it's really, really inexpensive.
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:45.220]   This is, I can't believe that it costs as little as it does.
[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:48.020]   It's a good solution for today,
[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:49.300]   it's a good solution for the future,
[01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:52.540]   and you can easily get in and out of any solution
[01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:54.020]   you want for less than 30 bucks.
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:57.180]   So rammount.com, absolutely the best system
[01:19:57.180 --> 01:19:58.420]   you can invest in.
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:00.980]   - Fantastic, that's a great, great pick.
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:04.780]   And my pick is related to, both are related to drawing,
[01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:06.700]   and I don't believe, there's one of them
[01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:08.020]   that I might have recommended earlier,
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:10.420]   but so the first one that I wanna recommend
[01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:13.900]   is Sketchbook Express.
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:16.660]   So this is in the iApp Store and this is brand new.
[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:20.100]   I guess I asked someone, and they said it wasn't actually,
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:26.740]   it was available before the i, or the App Store came out,
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:31.420]   but it is now available and it's easier to download.
[01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:34.700]   And it's Sketchbook Express, it's free, it's from Autodesk.
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:38.300]   And you can get it, so this is a zero, a zero Alex,
[01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:41.540]   I'm very proud of myself, not running you too hard
[01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:44.260]   on the cost structure.
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:47.780]   Now there's a Sketchbook Pro, which is only $30 or $40 now,
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:50.140]   and it's actually a little expensive now, I think,
[01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:51.980]   than it was previously.
[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:54.060]   But Sketchbook Express is a great way
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:56.260]   if you just want a simple drawing application
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:21:00.100]   that you can throw together and it's just,
[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:03.300]   anyway, I just got it,
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:07.380]   and what I was looking for actually was a,
[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:10.340]   what I was looking for here was to be able to have
[01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:12.580]   something that I could do a whiteboard.
[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:16.320]   So specifically, here you can see some examples done with it.
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:20.300]   I can't do that yet.
[01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:23.660]   So, but anyway, but the issue is you have a lot
[01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:25.540]   of the basic tools that you need,
[01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:28.460]   and it is so well laid out, and so here's what I use it for,
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:31.820]   as I'm actually using this as I want a whiteboard
[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:34.980]   that you can just, so I can cut to it
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:36.820]   when I'm doing streams and drawing it,
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:38.580]   or when I'm doing training and I want to draw something,
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:39.860]   then I can capture it with QuickTime,
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:42.620]   or I can capture it with Camtasia.
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:45.980]   And so, what I want to be able to do is be able to
[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:48.700]   just quickly draw something, and I wanted something
[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:50.060]   that I could turn the whole interface off.
[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:51.860]   So even though you're seeing a bunch of dialogues here,
[01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:55.380]   you can actually turn the interface all but a little button
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:59.820]   on one side and have it be a very, very clean interface,
[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:01.260]   and simply have this big whiteboard
[01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:03.180]   that you can sit there and draw on and talk about it,
[01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:06.500]   and it's free, and the responsiveness on
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:09.940]   whether you're using a bamboo or a whack-um tablet,
[01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:12.940]   both of them are just really, really good.
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:15.380]   So it's super responsive.
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:20.380]   It responds to pressure as well as just being very fast
[01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:22.900]   as far as drawing goes, and so it is just a kill,
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:24.220]   there's no reason not to have this.
[01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:27.540]   If you've got a Mac, you got to download Sketchbook Express
[01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:31.660]   because it's super easy and it's definitely,
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:34.020]   it's free, it's free, there's no good excuse not to have it.
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.820]   So definitely check that out.
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:39.140]   I just love this app especially for the price.
[01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:41.300]   And it's just if you want to use a whiteboard
[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:44.220]   for things like your GoToMeeting,
[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:46.500]   who's not a sponsor this time, but GoToMeeting,
[01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:50.140]   or your webinars, your seminars, your meetings,
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:53.780]   screen captures, as well as just having fun drawing,
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:55.100]   these are all things that you can do with it.
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:56.180]   So definitely check that out.
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:58.100]   The other one that's kind of connected to that,
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:22:59.860]   and I don't have a good example of it here
[01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:01.460]   to show you is penultimate.
[01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:03.540]   Have you seen penultimate, Andy?
[01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:05.580]   Have you seen penultimate?
[01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:07.060]   - No, I'm a big pen of Sketchbook though.
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:10.140]   - Okay, yeah, so penultimate is an iPad app.
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:13.100]   And what penultimate does is it's probably,
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:15.420]   and I just don't think I have the overhead camera,
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:17.060]   Leo's overhead camera working.
[01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:19.220]   Hold on, let me see if I can get it working here.
[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:21.460]   (mumbles)
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:25.180]   See if I, do I have the overhead here?
[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:26.020]   No, I do.
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:28.860]   So I'm gonna, this will just take a second as it.
[01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:30.820]   So what penultimate does is it's a little Sketchbook
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:35.460]   that allows you to essentially draw,
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:37.260]   and really have that kind of,
[01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:42.820]   let me see, let's turn this off, and pop this up.
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:44.500]   Let me see if I can make this all work here.
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:47.500]   Okay, so here's my iPad here,
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:50.020]   and I'm not as good as Leo is at doing this,
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:55.020]   but if we go into here and go to,
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:58.740]   let me see if I can find it quickly, my mini apps here.
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:04.420]   So here's your Sketch here,
[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:06.100]   and what you can do is,
[01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:08.260]   let me just see if I get the angle just right here.
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:10.900]   I can simply draw on it, of course, with my finger,
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:15.180]   so I can, and I can, you know, this is a test.
[01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:17.260]   And I just love the quality of the,
[01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:20.060]   not the quality of my handwriting, which is really bad,
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:23.420]   but I really like the quality of, you know, of the,
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:26.220]   it's basically, it's not just doing, like,
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:27.420]   a bunch of little hard lines,
[01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:29.380]   it's actually smoothing those lines out,
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:31.020]   and making it look really organic,
[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:33.260]   and really nice to look at.
[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:35.460]   And it's great, you just, you wanna get rid of it,
[01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:36.820]   you can clear the page real quickly,
[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:38.260]   if you wanna, if you draw something,
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:41.380]   and you wanna send it, you can send it by email,
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:44.060]   you can save the page to photos, you can do, you know,
[01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:46.260]   so, you know, a lot of times,
[01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:47.740]   I'll be sitting in meetings and go, okay,
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:51.580]   it's like we were working on our Mac world booth,
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:55.700]   and so you have, you know, I could draw it out here
[01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:58.140]   and say, okay, well, we're gonna have Mac break here,
[01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:01.260]   and we need some lights, and we're gonna have the cameras here,
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:02.660]   and so we're sitting there talking about, you know,
[01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:03.780]   where all these things are gonna go,
[01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:05.660]   and what's over here, and what's over here,
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:07.700]   and then we can figure all that stuff out real quickly
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:08.540]   and throw it out.
[01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:10.820]   Now, I use a Pogo stick with it, you know,
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:11.900]   I don't have it with me right now,
[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:13.980]   but I have a little Pogo stick, so you can draw on it,
[01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:16.700]   and it's great for being meetings and sketching stuff.
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:19.900]   I mean, this, this happens the one that really broke me
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:22.580]   from feeling like I needed a paper,
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:24.900]   you know, when I was explaining stuff to people,
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:26.500]   and I don't know how much it is,
[01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:28.500]   I think I moved too quickly on that,
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:31.060]   but it's not very expensive, and so penultimate,
[01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:32.620]   it's the best one that I've played with so far
[01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:36.140]   on the iPad for doing this sketchbook,
[01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:38.820]   is of course available on the iPad too.
[01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:40.260]   This one for what I was doing,
[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:42.420]   nice clear interface and kind of set up for that,
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:43.780]   worked out really well for me,
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:46.980]   so definitely, definitely check that out,
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:51.540]   and those are my two picks for today.
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:53.660]   Andy, where can people find you?
[01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:56.220]   - If you can spell my last name,
[01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:59.900]   you can just type in octo.com to get my blog,
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:04.620]   or you can type cwob.com that has links to my blog,
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:06.500]   my email, all that other cool stuff,
[01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.420]   I'm on Twitter at an octo.
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:11.420]   Really, a lot of this is key to the ability
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:13.060]   of people to spell the word in octo,
[01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:14.380]   which is not something I was able to do
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:15.620]   until I was age seven or eight,
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:17.860]   so good luck to everybody out there.
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:21.380]   - Right, and Tom, where can people find you?
[01:26:21.380 --> 01:26:25.020]   - Well, you could follow Toma Corp on Twitter.
[01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:26.060]   - Do you Twitter much?
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:26.900]   Do you tweet much?
[01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:27.740]   - No, I don't Twitter much.
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:28.580]   - See, now here's the pressure.
[01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:29.420]   - I don't tweet much.
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:30.540]   - Now here's the pressure, now you're gonna have to.
[01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:31.540]   - Oh, well that could be,
[01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:33.660]   or you might appreciate having somebody
[01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:37.020]   who only writes something when they have something to say.
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:37.860]   - Yeah, something.
[01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:41.980]   I just, I write stuff when something crazy pops
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:43.860]   into my head, and sometimes I shouldn't.
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:45.380]   Penultimate, by the way, is 99 cents,
[01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:46.940]   so for those of you listening.
[01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:47.780]   - Wow, look at that.
[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:49.700]   - So it's super cheap and super easy.
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:52.300]   - Yeah, so Toma Corp.
[01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:54.540]   - Tomacorp.com is
[01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:57.780]   and Quatronics.com.
[01:26:57.780 --> 01:26:58.700]   - Fantastic.
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:01.340]   And just a reminder to everyone who is watching
[01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:04.940]   that we are going to be streaming from Mac world next week,
[01:27:04.940 --> 01:27:06.340]   and we're gonna be doing tons of coverage,
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:09.020]   and tons of gathering, you definitely wanna go down there.
[01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:10.980]   We're gonna be at the Pixel Corp booth,
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:12.780]   which is gonna be, I believe, in the West Hall.
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:14.100]   And we're gonna be trying to shoot.
[01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:15.460]   We're gonna be streaming live,
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:18.500]   and we're getting a 3D camera.
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:21.620]   So we're gonna actually be attempting to stream in 3D.
[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:25.180]   Oh, Tom's got an example of what you need to do this.
[01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:26.060]   So here we go.
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:26.900]   So there it is.
[01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:28.340]   It's hard to see on the screen there.
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:29.740]   It looks just like sunglasses here.
[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:31.300]   Just get it up a little closer so we can see the light.
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:32.140]   There we go.
[01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:33.940]   So these little red blue glasses.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:36.700]   And so, by the way, I posted that you need
[01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:39.100]   this Hannah Montana, there you go.
[01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:41.740]   You'll be the utmost of fashion.
[01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:42.620]   That you need Hannah Montana.
[01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:44.580]   The reason that I said Hannah Montana red blue glasses
[01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:48.020]   is because they don't say Hannah Montana on them.
[01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:48.940]   There's nothing about them.
[01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:51.980]   It's just that those are the ones that are Amazon Prime,
[01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:53.460]   which I'm a little sensitive to,
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:57.140]   because I tend to buy stuff in Amazon.
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:27:58.540]   I go to there and see if it's on Amazon Prime,
[01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:01.380]   and it's not, then I'll look around a little bit more.
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:03.860]   But that's why those are the red blue glasses
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:06.140]   that you can get there, but they're like $2.
[01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:07.900]   And if you wanna play with 3D,
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:11.420]   I'm also gonna be streaming tomorrow at 9 a.m.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:15.340]   Pacific Standard Time on pixacore.com/live.
[01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:17.620]   Doing some early 3D tests and talking about 3D
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:19.700]   and talking about a bunch of stuff related to that.
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:21.740]   So if you wanna get a preview of all of that,
[01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:26.740]   you can go to pixacore.com/live tomorrow morning at 9 a.m.
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:30.460]   And we'll be showing you a little bit of that.
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:33.500]   But then you'll see the full blown craziness
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:36.020]   next week at Macworld.
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:39.940]   So anyway, definitely check that stuff out.
[01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:43.540]   And until then, break time is over.
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:44.380]   Get back to work.
[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:46.980]   (upbeat music)
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:49.560]   (upbeat music)
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:52.140]   (upbeat music)
[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:54.880]   (dramatic music)
