[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.240]   Wow.
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.940]   Whoo.
[00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.540]   Ha.
[00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.340]   We just got off a very hot keynote at WWDC.
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.780]   A lot of new stuff from Apple.
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.880]   Fortunately, we've got the Kings of Apple analysts
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.540]   here in studio with us.

[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.680]   Renee Richie from iMore.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.480]   Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Court.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.280]   We're going to talk about everything Apple announced today.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.820]   Next, a Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.420]   Netcast, you love.

[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.520]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, a very special Mac Break
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.120]   Edition, a day early because Apple started WWDC on Monday.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.720]   And look at this.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.280]   It's brought in all the folks.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.080]   Andy Anako is here.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.520]   It's great to see you, Andy.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.800]   Great to be breathing that beautiful pettilum air.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.240]   They rode up in a stretch limousine today.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.360]   Like, style.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.840]   Again, well, see, we said, are you
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.560]   here to pick us up from WWDC?
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.360]   He said yes.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.920]   And then, 10 minutes from the trip, it was clear,
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.000]   he was actually waiting for Dre.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.960]   But he was already both, so he made his move.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.000]   He forgot about Dre.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.600]   That's Rene Ritchie from I'm More, also in studio.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.360]   Nice to have you.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.720]   Nice to be-- Leo, they had a Ferrari
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.960]   and they had a tiny little smart car in Moscone,
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.240]   but the limo was in between.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.520]   I like the stretch.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.960]   You look good getting out of it.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.760]   You really did.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.120]   Actually, we thought there'd be more people.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.320]   I think that's what we said in a stretch.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.320]   But that's all right.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.000]   It worked out fine.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.040]   And Alex Lindsey, who was here earlier this morning,
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.120]   is doing a long day.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.920]   I think you got a question in.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.160]   I think one of the most active question engines
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.920]   I think we've ever had.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.420]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.760]   We've got 250 people over 200 questions already.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.440]   What is the URL if people want to ask?
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:51.320]   It is bit.ly/mbw-405 because someone keeps on stealing our URLs.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.040]   Mbw-405, admittedly.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.640]   And Andy, they're saying your Skype is particularly
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.640]   clear today, so that's nice.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.680]   For once in a while, we didn't really--
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.720]   It's going to be so weird not to have Skype
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.440]   to blame for my misjudgments.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.680]   I love the media badge.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.280]   These two-- actually, you left yours off for now.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.680]   It's all right.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.160]   You can wear it.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.080]   It's-- show off a little bit.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.800]   Show that you got invited to the event.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.480]   Yeah, it's right.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.040]   Where was my invite?
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.720]   Moscone West this morning, a couple of thousand people.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.920]   Tim Cook took the stage sharp at 10 a.m., got off by noon,
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.720]   and they had a heck of a lot to say.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.840]   None of it, though, will tip our hands.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.680]   None of it having to do with hardware.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.240]   No hardware is zero.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.720]   Zero.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.120]   No Phil Schiller, which I thought was a little odd.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.280]   He's hardware.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.480]   OK, that's why.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.360]   But this is-- and Harry McCracken had a good article
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.720]   in "Tecnologize" you're saying, hey,
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.280]   don't get it all hot.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.320]   It had bothered about hardware because this is a developer's
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.520]   show.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.920]   You shouldn't expect more than that.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.680]   Yeah, and I mean, the other things you wouldn't see,
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.880]   we didn't see, hey, and also, here's the exotic world city.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.760]   We're rebuilding in a wonderful new Apple store.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.240]   And we'd like to show that to you now.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.080]   I was pleased to see that.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.640]   But none of that-- none of that--
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.200]   no boasting about financials.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.840]   There's absolutely not five inches worth of space
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.480]   inside this place to talk about anything,
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.520]   but developing stuff, developing stuff, new features,
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.120]   new ideas, new ideas, new ideas.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.400]   That's not always been the case.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.360]   I mean, Apple has an ask new hardware at WWDC.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.600]   Well, no, this was 4,000 new APIs,
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.360]   a host of new functionality.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.520]   There was a lot to say.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.600]   You're programming language?
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.400]   New language.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.960]   When a new feature set for Siri gets one slide
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.880]   that they don't fully explain, that's
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.760]   how much content they had to put into this thing.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.400]   And I think it was one of the biggest WWDC
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.360]   you know, as they've ever done it.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.480]   I was going to say, I think it was the densest keynote
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.560]   I can remember.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.920]   Not only that, but so much great stuff.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.000]   Exactly.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.200]   We'll talk about this later on.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.120]   But I feel as though a lot of things
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.560]   that I thought were core Apple philosophies about,
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.000]   here is how we define iOS.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.480]   Here is what we're willing to let people do,
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.120]   what we're not willing to let people do,
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.480]   what we think developers should do,
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.880]   what they think they shouldn't do.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.920]   A lot of that stuff got rolled back today.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.760]   It's exciting.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.160]   So at the beginning, Tim Cook divided it
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.200]   into three distinct sections.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.680]   There was OS X, there was iOS, and then a kind of
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.520]   monad thing that said dev.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.600]   We'll get to all three, one after the other.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.560]   But let's start with OS X 10.10.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.760]   Those pictures of El Capitan confirmed.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.520]   It is not called OS X Half Dome.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.800]   OS X Weed.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.760]   I thought it--
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.480]   I thought of OS X Weed, it's smoking.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.040]   Or a tip of the hat to dry, straight out of Compton,
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.000]   would have been fun too.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.840]   But no, they decided to call it Yosemite,
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.080]   which is a great name, actually.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.600]   I think that makes a lot of sense.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.680]   10.10 will be free, they announced, available this fall.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.240]   Developers got seed copies.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.600]   So let's talk about what's new in 10.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.400]   It is a much bigger change than Mavericks was.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.360]   I'd say so.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.880]   And at least our first worry got set aside,
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.320]   because we all heard about, OK, they're
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.280]   going to make the interface a lot more iOS-like.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.680]   They're going to make this part of this new mandate of where
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.480]   everyone's developing the exact same thing.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.840]   I thought it was very, very subtle what they did.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.200]   They added translucency to not content areas,
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.520]   but to tool areas and window areas that actually integrates
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.920]   the screen a lot better that I think that works on iOS.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.760]   Because iOS, you're always in one app anyway.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.120]   It's when you have multiple apps open in the same place
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.600]   that you really want to feel as though you're using the same thing.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.320]   New system font, which is sort of like when your boyfriend
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.640]   or girlfriend, husband or wife,
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.320]   changes their hairstyle after 10 years,
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.320]   still the same person, just a little bit of twist
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.320]   that you have used to.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.040]   It's a shave and a haircut.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.440]   I'm trying to describe it.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.200]   It's kind of-- it's a sans serif again, but it's thinner.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.480]   It looks like kind of--
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.360]   It's a little rounder.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.200]   Is it apple sauce?
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.680]   I couldn't tell.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.520]   I don't know.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.240]   I'm not a type one, because they're people--
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.720]   I'm sure they're blogging to talk about exactly the advantages
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.480]   of these things.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.120]   It was an interesting challenge, though, because at least when
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.880]   they change the system font for iOS,
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.120]   they know that all of these things are going on retina devices.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.200]   Whereas they know that they have to deal with people who are
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.760]   probably still using old VGA monitors, CRTs.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.920]   I think it's very clean.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.160]   It's very, very pretty.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.240]   I didn't notice-- I was not distracted at all.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.320]   You can get a-- I think a close up now, if it's so people
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.240]   at least be able to see that menu.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.440]   It follows the same core concepts,
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.120]   the deference, the depth, and the clarity
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.440]   that iOS introduced last year.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.600]   But it does it in a way as very authentic to the Mac.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.520]   What I'm thrilled about is they did not
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.520]   emphasize full screen apps.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.880]   They didn't even show any full screen apps.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.520]   Clearly, they understand that desktop computing is still
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:15.720]   window.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.080]   There's still drop shadows, Leo.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.880]   Yeah, they still have drop shadows around the windows.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.520]   Wow.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.720]   But I think in many ways, though, I think the drop shadows
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.720]   is an important communicative tool, which what's in front
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.560]   and what's behind.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.400]   And I think without those, it'd be more difficult.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:28.840]   I'm pleased.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.640]   I didn't want it to be iOSified.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.880]   It is flatter, though, for instance, the calendar app.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.800]   That looks like iOS 7, absolutely.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.720]   It looks great, though.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.960]   I think it's beautiful.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.720]   They did say that it will pick up--
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.200]   and I don't know, is this translucency?
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.280]   I didn't really see it in the stream, the background.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:45.780]   Yeah.
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.280]   So what's it going to do?
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.960]   Toolbars are translucent, so they'll
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.520]   show through to your wallpaper, which gives it
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.720]   that hint of color you get from iOS.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.680]   But like Andy said, the content area doesn't change.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.680]   It's just the--
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.880]   Yeah, and the doc changes.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.720]   The doc now will pick up the desktop wallpaper.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.920]   It's just another communication of here's
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.800]   where your attention should be as you're winking away through
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.320]   the app.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.560]   Like I said, I do think it's a lot more effectively used
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.480]   in Mac OS than it is in iOS.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.840]   The big difference, though, of course, is under the hood.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.800]   It's not so much how it looks, although there is a great new look.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.760]   But it's not too-- I like this font.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.520]   And black theme.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.520]   You can get a black theme.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.360]   You can get dark.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:19.880]   Dark theme.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.000]   That's the tip of the head to photographers
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   who don't like the bright light theme.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.400]   Lightroom, for instance, is dark in that--
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.120]   I mean, I wanted to see a black theme all the way through.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.320]   I mean, with all the interface.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.320]   You can have glue, or you can have graphite.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.320]   Yeah, right.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.160]   Isn't it interesting, though, that even letting people
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.760]   have that choice over the overall look?
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.160]   The Apple typical theory was like we're designing this,
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.480]   because we know how to design things.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.560]   And you're not going to improve on what we did.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.840]   The fact that we're going to give you an option means that either
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.480]   they're really putting a note towards photographers
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.760]   and videographers, or they really do appreciate that it
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.000]   doesn't hurt us to let people have one option on the look and feel.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.280]   We've heard several times that Craig Federica skews geekier
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.440]   than his predecessors did.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.360]   And I think we're getting to enjoy a little bit of--
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.320]   I like the icons.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.400]   The new Apple.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.720]   We've now brought you both vanilla and chocolate.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.680]   You know what I like about this?
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.600]   You're definitely starting to see the supposed Steve team assert
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.240]   itself.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.600]   It's not 180 degrees.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.880]   It's not about facing.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.960]   But they're expressing themselves in this slightly different.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.800]   And I think it's more modern, frankly.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.640]   I don't know.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.600]   It's hard to guess where things are coming from inside of Apple.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.640]   I do think that over the past couple of years,
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.800]   there's a lot more cohesiveness among the Apple team
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.800]   with people who are able to talk to each other
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.080]   a lot more effectively without realizing that, no, we
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.160]   can't climb over this wall.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.400]   Some of those barriers are broken down.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.000]   Johnny and I have now charged of all looks and feel
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.400]   across the board, things like that.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.960]   And they have-- the development teams
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.640]   can talk to each other, like Andy said.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.160]   And Andy and I were talking on the way down here.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.760]   What a performance by Craig Federicki.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.240]   Yes.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.920]   He was a marathon, wasn't it?
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.920]   He did an Iron Man.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:49.120]   He was funny.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:49.960]   He was engaged.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.120]   He was quick-witted.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.400]   He was doing-- how long did they rehearse?
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.480]   They did a little behind the scene piece of a piece of comedy
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.240]   where for one of the chat demos, he's backstage,
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.160]   and he has a bad hair day.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.520]   They must have had someone standing by to freak up his hair.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.960]   And then they had a chainsaw.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.960]   Or something.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.320]   And then quickly to put it back into place for, you know,
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.320]   ready for party time.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.360]   It could have been taped ahead of time.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.760]   It could have been taped ahead of time.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.920]   But I was still-- you have--
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.880]   can you imagine someone on the Apple team from eight years
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.920]   ago saying, I'm going to look like an idiot with a bat--
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.360]   because I'm going to look with really silly hair.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.200]   Never would it happen.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.440]   Would it have been a stop put on that small suit?
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.560]   Joss, I will do a duck face selfie.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.840]   In general, I'd say there was a lot more humor in this
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.800]   than we've seen in the past all the way across the board,
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.560]   whether it was Tim Cook taking digs at Windows and Android
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.400]   or other things.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.920]   And not so much joke humor, but good humor.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.720]   I feel like everybody was fairly in a good mood
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.160]   and was cheerful.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.760]   And it was not heavy handed.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.080]   It wasn't-- let me tell a joke.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.440]   You remember Bertrand was like, Redman,
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.760]   start your photo copiers.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.760]   And he could get that across.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.600]   Like his personality, he could sell that kind of humor.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.440]   And this Craig could do that same thing.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.840]   Scott never had that kind of--
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.120]   No.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.960]   Nor Phil, frankly.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.480]   No.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.160]   I think Tim did a really good job.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.280]   Tim Cook did a really good job.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.240]   But panning it off to Craig Federighi was a smart move.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.080]   And some of the bit parts were important, too.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.400]   We'll get to those in just a little bit.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.480]   But let's talk a little bit about OS 10, 10.10.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.800]   To me, the biggest feature is the new spotlight,
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.360]   the new integration into the OS.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.680]   In a way, they've Sherlocked Quicksilver and Alfred,
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.280]   all of the--
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.080]   Napkin?
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.000]   Napkin, too, right.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.640]   Napkin's the annotation program.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.280]   So with a single keystroke, you launch Spotlight
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.800]   not on the upper right hand corner,
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.720]   but in the middle of the screen, just like Quicksilver,
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.200]   you could type your search.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.320]   But it's much more interactive than these other tools.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.120]   And Bing, I think, got the license there, which was--
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.840]   Well, now, did they talk about that?
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.800]   But that's interesting.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.280]   For instance, you do a Google-style search in this spotlight.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.640]   You'll get a Wikipedia, entry, or movie times.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.520]   But not from Google.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.640]   So is it from--
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.280]   Well, no, say--
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.880]   Well, there's two things that are really interesting here.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.320]   It's sort of what they started with Siri, which
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.720]   is disintermediating Google.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.120]   They just get them out of the chain.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.320]   And Google survives on data.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.280]   They want all that data from iOS devices.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.040]   When you go to Siri first, all they see is Apple IP hits.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.960]   And now with this, you're doing that search directly
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.400]   from Apple.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.440]   You're not hitting Google first.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.200]   And a lot of the results they mentioned on stage
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.600]   were Bing results.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.640]   So they're aggregating not just from any Wikipedia, or Bing,
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.240]   or Google.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.360]   They may be all of the above.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.880]   But the point is, you don't appear to those--
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.380]   Yes.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.560]   They're in the middle hold desk.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.240]   And that's hugely valuable data that they're not
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.840]   being given access to.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.400]   And I do think, as we talked about in the actual event,
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.020]   I think that Apple, the long term,
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.480]   is Apple builds its own search functions.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.280]   I think that it's not going to leave something so integral
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.440]   to what they're doing.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.640]   I don't think it's going to happen tomorrow.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.640]   But I think in the year or two, I
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.440]   think we're going to see Apple do its own thing.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.120]   Because it's just such a-- it's like maps.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.240]   It's like this huge part of what everyone does.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.600]   And it's not part of their ecosystem.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.600]   And I just don't see them leaving that out.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.200]   It's just that maps--
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.040]   search is so hard to crack.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.960]   Even Bing, with the resources of Microsoft,
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.600]   and how much they've bought into that system,
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.520]   and also how much they were created
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.520]   since they bought the people that they bought,
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.600]   that would be such a--
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.640]   it's the one thing where if people do not
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.880]   get good results on page one, that's the last time they use it.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.840]   I'm interested to see what other features I'm
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.160]   sure we're going to talk about.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.240]   If Google says, oh, so Safari is now
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.520]   accessible by third parties, make an extent.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.720]   We'll extend your non-chrome browser
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.040]   so that it works exactly like Google.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.040]   I think Apple.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.560]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.080]   What a great idea.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.280]   I think Apple's doing a couple of interesting things.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.600]   They're making the ecosystem a higher premium.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.720]   It's really much more valuable.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.120]   But in some ways, they're opening it, too, which I think is--
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:22.640]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.960]   --it's an interesting one hand--
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.680]   on the other hand.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.240]   We'll talk about the moment we get to iOS.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:26.600]   But yeah.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.880]   That's really where you see it.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.080]   Continuity is the feature that I absolutely love.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.600]   This is an OS X and iOS feature.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:33.840]   Go ahead.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.840]   Tell us what happens.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.040]   The basic idea is that now your iPad
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.760]   can be aware that you have a Mac
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.480]   and that you have an iPhone that they're both
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.640]   in the same house together.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.960]   Is it using Bonjour, Ibek and Do We Know?
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.320]   They haven't elaborated yet.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.320]   At least they didn't on stage.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.160]   I'm not even going to go.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.360]   Somehow, you have to be on the same network I gathered.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.400]   Yes, I don't think it works.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.120]   Well, you didn't say that.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.600]   They said it had to be with the proximity.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.920]   But it wouldn't make sense if it
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.680]   works off of a pressing internet.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.840]   The whole idea is that--
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.320]   Well, it has to send the data over to customers.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.560]   I guess it's because the whole idea is that I'm here
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.280]   and I'm working on pages and something that I need to do.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.120]   And so, OK, I really got to leave the house right now
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.840]   because I'm going to miss my train.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.040]   I grabbed my iPad and my iPad is aware that I was using pages.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.120]   I was on this document.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.720]   My editing point was right here.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.040]   And so when I activate pages--
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.440]   excuse me, I don't even have to activate it.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.160]   On my iPad, I didn't see the user interface specifically.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.400]   But there's a little dingus that appears on the iPad.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.400]   This is-- if you just swipe up from here,
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.680]   we will make this look exactly like that.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.280]   That's amazing.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.480]   And you will simply be able to go
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.640]   again to the cabinet and start working.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.000]   Yeah, it makes sense if you're using iWork.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.600]   And that's one of the reasons they unified the iWork platform.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.840]   Well, they said it was iCloud base, which is a nice thing
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.600]   for Apple because a lot of their stuff depends on iCloud
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.640]   in order to get in the Mac app.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.480]   You have to be in the Mac app store to use iCloud.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.360]   There's a whole bunch of things that tie you to Apple
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.320]   when you use it.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.040]   My guess would be that it's Bluetooth LE.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.200]   And then once it detects the connection,
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.640]   does a Wi-Fi direct--
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.400]   not the name brand Wi-Fi direct, but a direct ad hoc Wi-Fi
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.600]   connection to the data.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.160]   So you get the data transfer, of course.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.400]   But the Bluetooth LE or iBeacon in effect.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.800]   But it's hugely secure, which is a nice thing too.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.440]   They did use an example specifically of your iPhone rings,
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.640]   but it's in your bedroom upstairs, and it's charging.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.080]   But you're downstairs in your iPad.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.200]   The phone call can go through your iPad.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.280]   You'll get a notification.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.040]   You can answer it and actually talk through iPad.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.040]   You can talk through iPad.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.120]   You can talk through iPad.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.320]   They talked to Dre through that device.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.840]   So to me, that indicates they might
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.920]   want to be using a transport that's a little bit further
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.200]   throw than Bluetooth LE.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.600]   Yeah, I'm sure that there's a secret sauce, but--
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.360]   I'm not sure.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.360]   Bluetooth LE to decide where you are,
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.120]   and then using other protocols to move the actually.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.480]   Well, if you're plugged-- because they did mention plugged in
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.280]   if you're further away.
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.760]   So maybe the Wi-Fi goes on all the time when you're plugged in.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.880]   Like it does for the Wi-Fi thing.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.720]   But it's not as zero config.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.880]   The user doesn't have to say, that's my iPad.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.040]   That's my iPhone.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.080]   It sees you're in the same space and allows you to--
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.520]   Because you certainly wouldn't want to be in an office.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.840]   Yeah, well, we've got an office building.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.600]   We might be in an office building and say, well,
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.800]   thank you for interrupting my meeting
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.560]   to tell me that I have a phone call,
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.240]   because I don't really care that I have a phone call
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.240]   and I have my computer.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.240]   You don't have to share an iCloud.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.720]   It's Apple ID based.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.720]   I think it's Apple ID based.
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.240]   Like, iMessage only goes to your devices.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.640]   So I won't see Sarah Lane's iPage.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.080]   Unless you're part of family sharing.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:05.600]   Right.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.760]   You know, you want to take the relationships that level?
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.560]   I want to show my family sharing plan.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.440]   You do know that we can't have more than six people
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.480]   in our family anymore.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.480]   OK, sorry about that.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.520]   But the family sharing is--
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.920]   Another nod to the Chinese market.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.280]   Very, very important.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.000]   It is a nice feature for-- especially for people who have--
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.720]   Like I did.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.360]   I mean, we had one Apple ID.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.000]   Everybody in the family used it.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.440]   I have rap music, French Bistro songs.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.800]   Your genius selections are amazing.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.520]   Yeah, it's crazy, because both Henry and Abby used it.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.760]   That doesn't have to happen anymore.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.640]   They can have their own accounts, but we can share dates.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.880]   As long as it's all tied to the exact same credit card,
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.040]   it's considered--
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.240]   So it's a different account but same credit card.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.400]   You have separate IDs.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.320]   They did mention that so long as it's all connected
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.480]   to the same credit card.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.000]   But because that's why some of these features actually work.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.240]   This really great feature where you can allow your kids
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.080]   to make purchases off of the account.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.120]   But you can set it up so that when they try to make a purchase,
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.400]   you get an alert saying, hi, your son wants to buy this.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.680]   Is that OK?
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.280]   Can I tell you--
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.560]   If it works with any purchases--
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.800]   Huge, this is.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.720]   Because about every month, I'll get about 30 iTunes bills
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.680]   for in-app purchases.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:09.680]   Donut.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.560]   For donut, it's not for me.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.320]   And we'll have to go Michael.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.400]   Did you buy a lot of stuff today?
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.720]   And he goes, no.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.080]   But now we'll say-- and you can put--
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.800]   So button says not now or OK.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.000]   You can even say dismissed now.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.760]   It's huge.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.760]   Let's see, like after iOS ships in the fall,
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.600]   let's take a look with a January keynote event
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.720]   where the revenue curve goes after people
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.160]   can no longer buy more donuts.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.400]   Well, remember, Apple did get a class action lawsuit
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.680]   over this in-app purchase thing.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.280]   They did lose.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.600]   They had to give everybody some money.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.040]   Oh, they could--
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.040]   So either way out of anything.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.760]   Like Bill Murray at the end of Kingpin.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.600]   And I think that one of the things
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.680]   that we saw over and over and over again throughout the keynote
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.760]   is that Apple is truly playing their strong cards.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.160]   They're not-- obviously, they're
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.360]   pulling in a bunch of other things.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.680]   But they're really playing this We Own and Ecosystem.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.040]   And we're the only ones that have a complete ecosystem.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.960]   And so we're going to just keep on tying all these things
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.680]   together and show you how we're going to tie them all together.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:04.560]   Well, I had a slap to both Google Drive and to Dropbox
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.360]   because iCloud Drive, if it works-- and that's a big if.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.320]   Because Apple does not have a lot of success in this sphere.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.360]   But if it works, it's less expensive than Dropbox,
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.440]   about the same price as Google Drive,
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.360]   allows you to attach six gigabyte attachments in your email
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.560]   without actually attaching it.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.240]   Mail drop, yeah.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.080]   Allows you to store any kind of file on there
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.200]   and have access to it on any device.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.160]   Documenting with your iOS.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.920]   And for developers, they basically
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.240]   done Google's App Engine or Amazon's EC3.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.280]   So app developers can use for free the basic services.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:38.800]   Cloudkit.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.640]   So this is a whole new iCloud.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.280]   This must be the North Carolina data center online.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.080]   Possibly, yes.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.080]   Possibly several.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.080]   Yeah, several.
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:51.240]   It's-- although that was one of the most exciting parts
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.080]   of the keynote, keynote full of exciting things.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.560]   So for me, it solves a big problem
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.120]   that I've always had with iPad.
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.440]   This is one of the reasons why I kind of foresuck iCloud
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.160]   a year ago and went exclusively to Dropbox.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.680]   The fact that I'm putting this into iCloud jail,
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.760]   and that's going to cause problems for me.
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:07.260]   So why--
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.600]   Well, this is a hard sell to developers.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.160]   Because developers have effectively
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.200]   been screwed by this all along.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.840]   This is one thing that was supposed to work years ago.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.400]   Never worked with documents.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.280]   We saw OmniSync.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.080]   We saw Vespersink.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.960]   We saw developers rolling their own solutions.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:21.880]   Yeah, right.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.920]   And do you remember what it was like
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.120]   when you're talking to developers?
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.640]   And every one of them is saying, we have worked one whole year
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.680]   trying to get this to work.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.160]   It's really trying.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.160]   We are giving up and building something for an hour.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.320]   So are they once burned twice shy?
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.840]   Or are they going to-- what was the feeling?
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.400]   Well, this is more.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.440]   This is stuff that you can do in the cloud.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.600]   It's not just sync.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.080]   I know, but the sync was a failure.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.360]   So I'm saying our developers are going to buy this?
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.720]   Well, it's not a question of developers
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.400]   by they will buy it into it if the user is buy into it.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.480]   And the fact that they're now giving away
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.960]   so much iPhoto storage and video storage, essentially for free.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.800]   And if you want to expand that up to a terabyte,
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.280]   the terms for expanding that storage are really attractive.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:03.280]   So good that I want to disguise my word docs as dot jpegs.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.080]   But if it turns out that users start
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.880]   to rely on iCloud for that sort of stuff
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.200]   and they start to buy that storage,
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.280]   they're going to ask for their-- they're
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.640]   going to stop switching to Dropbox
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.560]   or Microsoft's cloud systems.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.560]   But I think that Apple-- they were limited before
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.400]   and I think that--
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:17.920]   Listen to that.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.600]   --all a terabyte.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.200]   But while a terabyte seems like a lot,
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.080]   there's a lot--
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.720]   once you start shooting videos and everything else--
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.120]   Get this free from Flickr, right?
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.120]   But I'm just saying I don't understand why Apple doesn't say,
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.640]   OK, and then if you want to buy five terabytes or 10 terabytes,
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.480]   this is how much it costs.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.640]   As a user, as a power user, I'm fine with saying--
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.840]   because my app--
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.280]   It's the next step, Alex.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.720]   My library is too terabytes.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.480]   I'm just not sure that people who
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.240]   are going to be using the iCloud service are shooting--
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.440]   are really interested in shooting bigger--
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.760]   They're going to let you be a pro and use some other service.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.240]   I know.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.760]   But again, I think that this is--
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.440]   but what I don't understand is why they don't--
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.080]   I think it's great.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.280]   I love-- you see the camera that I have.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.080]   I love photography.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.720]   But most of the people I talk to,
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.320]   they use not only their iPhone as a camera,
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.320]   but also as their storage devices, their presentation device.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.280]   And so that's the mindset that they're in.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.520]   And it works just great for them.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.360]   But I think that the issue is that it creates this thing.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.440]   They get excited about it.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.880]   What people will do is get excited about it.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.240]   They'll start uploading everything to it.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.240]   They'll want it all there.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.680]   They'll want the home movies.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.200]   Everything up there.
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.640]   And then they'll hit that ceiling.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.080]   And now they're trapped.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:21.600]   Because now they--
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.760]   The time for their announcement, though, they could,
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.520]   like next year, say, we've seen how you're using it.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.720]   And we think that we're going to go to--
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.000]   But it's really frustrating for those people in between.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   It's just that they should create--
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.680]   It's just a sort of waiting to see what the adoption curve is,
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.000]   if they can support everybody.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.160]   And they don't want the--
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:39.280]   I saw data on the-- even data on the largest--
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.480]   on the typical HD film that people
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.880]   are shooting on their devices.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.720]   And it makes me think that they would take a long, long,
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.760]   long time to hit a terabyte.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.040]   You're talking about two-minute clips.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.320]   They're talking about they left the phone on.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.200]   They shot for six minutes.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.200]   And they don't tend to edit things together
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.080]   to tell a longer story.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.200]   It really is, hey, look at little trial
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:58.540]   faz.
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.080]   He's doing his little trick right now.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.840]   And then they hold it 10 seconds too long.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.560]   And then that's really the 68 seconds
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.160]   that they actually wanted.
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.600]   And it's mitigated now because you can all
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.760]   have separate accounts and because all
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.080]   new stuff and messages and photos,
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.640]   you can just share that stuff so they'll all show up
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.880]   in the same stream without having to have shared accounts
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.280]   anymore.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.320]   Let's finish continuity.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.480]   So continuity is the idea that everything
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.160]   in the Apple ecosystem in your house
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.360]   all talks to one another.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.240]   You mentioned phone calls.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.760]   A lot of air drop, a lot of excitement
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.560]   over instant hotspot.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.320]   I was surprised.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.880]   But people went, whoa, that's great.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.400]   It's such a natural point.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.720]   It's like you've got internet on one of these devices,
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.800]   and now you want to connect your Wi-Fi only iPad to it.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.680]   Instead of rising-- right now, the system
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.920]   is that the iPad is treated like it's a Kindle,
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.120]   like it's an Android device.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.600]   The Mac doesn't do anything special to make it easier.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.880]   Right now, these two-- again, they
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.160]   are aware of their proximity.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.800]   So now all you have to do is go into the Wi-Fi dropdown.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.880]   They'll see, oh, here's your iPad.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.760]   Do you want to share the Wi-Fi connection to this guy?
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.880]   So here's-- absolutely.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.840]   And now you have Wi-Fi.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.360]   Does this bypass AT&T's requirements on your phone
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.040]   to make-- so if you're one of the old--
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:22:59.960]   No, of course not.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.960]   Yeah, that's on the carrier profile on your phone.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.240]   Yeah, that doesn't go away.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.600]   What I'm saying is this--
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.200]   Does this--
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.000]   It'll tell you no faster if you don't have the plan.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.280]   It doesn't-- it doesn't--
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.400]   I doubt very much they bypass it.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.200]   One other thing I wanted to ask you guys about is--
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.440]   and I know I'm splitting hairs here,
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.120]   but every time they mention iTunes,
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.080]   like the search will show you iTunes results,
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.800]   and it'll show you existing results in iTunes,
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.280]   they kept saying stream.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.040]   And iTunes now doesn't do that on devices.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.120]   It has progressive downloads.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.440]   They're not allowed to stream.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.120]   I don't know if I'm cutting words or--
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.080]   They bought-- they bought beets.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.360]   They have streams movies.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.800]   Oh, it's movies.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:31.760]   Maybe Jimmy I'll be--
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.400]   That's more stuff you don't have to keep on your device.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.120]   Because right now, I watch a movie.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.520]   It takes up four gigs on my device.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.240]   It was clearly an issue.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.160]   If you have more than 1,000 photos,
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.440]   and you're going to sync it between all your devices,
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.800]   I can't put that on my iPhone.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.520]   So they had to respond to that.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.760]   Did they say it would stream any kind of content, or just--
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:49.480]   They mentioned photos.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.080]   They mentioned videos, but they didn't get into details.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:51.680]   I don't know.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.800]   We may-- there may be more.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.440]   The devil may be in the details on this.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.560]   How about messages?
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.000]   Because that's kind of a pain point.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.520]   Let's put it that way.
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.240]   The new messages now will allow you
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:08.360]   to receive iMessage and SMS messages on your Mac.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.760]   You can record conversations.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.160]   You can record--
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.080]   Well, one of the--
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.320]   They solved the other problem.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.080]   You mean that toxic health stu called Android?
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:16.580]   No, no.
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:17.720]   One thing is that people were complaining
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.520]   that they couldn't get SMS.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.800]   Did they solve the Android problem?
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.400]   I want to see that.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.640]   I want to see if now you get the SMS instead of the iMessage.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.240]   Somebody-- there's got to be at least one engineer
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.160]   in a closet working on that right now.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.160]   But didn't want you to report--
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:28.680]   I can't talk about it.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.200]   --out of your clips.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.240]   By the way, the founder of WhatsApp, Jan Koom, said,
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.920]   well, they'd stolen it all from--
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.200]   you got your $16 billion, Jan.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.240]   Just relax.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.480]   But this is WhatsApp function.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.400]   And there was--
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.840]   It was PBM before WhatsApp.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:42.840]   And he knows that very well.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.480]   Because he basically built BBM cross-platform.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.000]   But did it do audio?
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.500]   Yeah.
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.800]   Well, if you have audio video groups, all that stuff.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.880]   Not the best there-- best there, better button butter.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.400]   The ability to silence certain groups,
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.000]   silence certain people, find things,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.520]   not in your master timeline of all of your text messages.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.280]   But I want to talk about this conversation.
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.480]   I have one person who grabbed this photo out of it.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.080]   We're talking about Apple's announcements today at the WWDC.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.440]   And we're focusing first on Yosemite, iOS 10, 10.10.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.960]   Go ahead.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:12.880]   You said also.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.920]   Another cool little tidbit, which I don't think we've
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.280]   seen some of them might correct me in operation on an iPhone.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.880]   Awareness of the position of the phone and what it's doing.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:26.840]   It has always had the ability to say, OK, am I being held up
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.240]   to a face because I've got the proximity
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.120]   sense of the light sensor--
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:29.640]   I love that.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.440]   --you get a message.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.360]   You hold it up to your face in a place, the audio.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.120]   But not exactly.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.040]   If you get an audio message, you don't have to click
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:35.840]   and then go through this.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.400]   If you just simply pick it up and go like that,
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.280]   it'll say, OK, I'll play this to the handset right now.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:39.800]   Siri, go to that.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.920]   I mean, when you pick it up--
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.480]   Siri raised a speech head that for a while.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.560]   Similarly, if you want to record a voice message yourself,
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.720]   you lift it up, record it.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.960]   Then when you put it down, it says, OK, he's done.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.400]   I'm going to turn it into text right now,
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.400]   and then send it as a message.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.920]   I found that was hit and miss with Siri.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.000]   I don't know how much better we'll work with these.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.240]   It was contextual awareness, and that's
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.880]   Apple's nest-big move is to make all these sensors understand
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.400]   things better.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.600]   And we've got that in sevens.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.520]   This is the end set.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.960]   It hasn't been used as much as we thought it would by now.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.600]   This is that processor in the iPhone.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:06.880]   As long as there were just--
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.400]   And looks and sees what's going on.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.960]   Just all I got to say is just try to use go to meeting
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.360]   and put it up to your thing to talk into go to meeting
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.120]   and watch what Siri does.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.200]   Every time you put it up-- so the thing is, while it works,
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.280]   it turns off--
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.320]   You have to turn it off.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.760]   Mine is off all the time.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:28.360]   Mail has been enhanced to include sketch capabilities.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.400]   So thank you, Sketch.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.240]   We won't be needing you anymore.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.760]   You can annotate documents.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.240]   They had a loop, which was fascinating.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.120]   Fill out forms in the email messages.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.760]   I presume all of this stuff is Mac specific.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.480]   Yeah, they showed the Mac, and they showed the iPad.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.760]   I don't think they showed iPhone mail.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.520]   Safari been completely updated.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.040]   And by the way, private mode browsing
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:55.400]   and Safari, according to Ben, uses duck.go instead of Google.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.280]   Like privately.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.480]   That's by the way, the selling point that Apple has--
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:05.200]   this reminded me of last night's Silicon Valley season
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:09.280]   ender, where if you can provide all of these services
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.720]   and do it in a way that is private,
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.160]   you've got Google OneBeb.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.880]   That's all you have to say about that a lot during the show
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.960]   is a privacy and security.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.240]   Security first, privacy first.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.600]   Now we're giving you these features,
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.040]   and we're keeping it secure.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.600]   Like with the new keyboard features,
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.920]   that they made a very big point of not only does it--
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.560]   nothing we'll get into when we talk about iOS,
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.920]   but we will learn this keyboard.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.800]   We'll learn how you type so it can predict better.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.520]   But all of that stuff is kept on the device.
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:31.560]   It is never shared.
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.680]   Right.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.920]   We're going to get to iOS 8 in just a second.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.280]   Let's just finish up on 10.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:36.960]   Anything else?
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.680]   Yeah, I saw a giant smiley face from Don Milton
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.560]   when the Safari stuff was announced, which is nice.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.440]   In his web kit.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.960]   He's curated and he handed it off.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.560]   So it looks like the kids did well with it.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.440]   All right.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:45.960]   Good man.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.920]   That's interesting too, that now spotlights search results
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.440]   are also integrated into the address bar
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.080]   when you do a search.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.200]   It's not just a Google search.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.840]   It will also find you documents.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.400]   It will also find you calendar events.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.760]   This is something that actually Microsoft
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.800]   put into Windows 8.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.160]   It was a little bit controversial when they did it.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.920]   This being everywhere.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.160]   But I think people got used to it, and in fact like it.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.880]   Once you're used to it, the idea that, hey,
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.680]   I want this search to go everywhere.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.560]   Well, I think also part of it is-- and I hope I'm not
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:09.520]   reading too much into it--
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:13.960]   I really think it is partly to try to train Mac users to your first
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.640]   go-to solution is I'll do a spotlight.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.120]   I'm sure spotlight will give me the document I want.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.720]   It will give me the person I want the calendar.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:25.000]   Realize it now that when you search for a keynote,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.760]   it will find you the app and find you files that have that name.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.280]   But we'll also say, oh, maybe he wants
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.920]   to look at recent documents he's created or used with keynote.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.240]   So in addition to the results, I'll
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.120]   give him a little launcher doc of the stuff
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.280]   that he's recently worked with.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.160]   So I really think they're trying to make spotlight
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.320]   and to put it more into the center of the user interface.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.640]   Now, of course, somebody in the chat room
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.800]   is inevitably pointing out.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.040]   Look at none of this is new.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.520]   Various bits and pieces are on other operating systems.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.760]   They've been around previews.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.440]   Had some of this capability they're putting in.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.760]   No key invented in 1812.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.800]   No key invented in 1812, BlackBerry, BBM invented it.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.200]   It's not that there is anything so unique and innovative.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.920]   It's the ecosystem that makes this unique.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.160]   The fact that this is an Apple can work across the entire Apple
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:05.680]   ecosystem.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.960]   It's implementation and packaging.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.320]   And that is-- and in some ways, for instance, the way
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.600]   notifications work, yes, a lot of that.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.360]   For instance, now they have the today view
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.280]   that they had in iOS.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.040]   Widgets in order to get there.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:18.720]   Widgets.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.320]   But that's a huge deal because that means third parties
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.920]   can put widgets in notifications.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.280]   And it's not on the desktop.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.480]   It's not a desktop destination.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.400]   It's something that you can pull down when you want it.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.160]   So again, we're getting closer to this push interface concept
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.520]   where the stuff finds you.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.840]   It seems better, frankly.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.400]   I never used the widgets in the dashboard.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.520]   I zoomed dashboards there.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.920]   Well, do you ever Vista had the sidebar?
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.480]   Right.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:37.960]   Yeah, right.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.400]   But that's-- actually, I use the sidebar, but nobody else.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.360]   It's part of--
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.160]   Our isn't computing in general moving
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.160]   towards away from the idea of big operating systems
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.120]   and big functions and to the idea of,
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.080]   I want to enable you to dip into this
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.640]   to get the one piece of information
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.640]   or the one function you want right now without having
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:56.920]   to launch a tip calculator or having to launch a big search
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.920]   engine to get something.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.960]   So I will take that whatever little control
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.080]   and whatever little data viewer will give you your answer
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.400]   and make you just interact with that.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.840]   Well, and I think one of the things
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:09.720]   is that we're so many electronic devices between our little
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.400]   fitness that watches in our phones and everything else
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.800]   and are soon to be our refrigerators and our dryers
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.200]   and washers, the issue is that it's
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.720]   going to become more and more of a problem.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.040]   Is this idea that it's going to be easy to use all these?
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.000]   And I'm not going to spend half of my day trying to figure out
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.160]   how they all integrate together.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.440]   And I think Apple is taking huge steps in this idea
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.880]   that we're just going to make it easy for you to do many
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.800]   of these things and tie all these things in in a way
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.320]   that only they can do.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.200]   And I think that's what they're continuing to extend.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.040]   Remember the market.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.800]   The market isn't going, well, Android had that or Nokia had
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:40.000]   that.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.600]   The market's saying, make my life better.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.440]   I got life easier.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.280]   My workflow work.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.640]   Can you do this?
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.640]   And if you can do this, that's a very compelling argument.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.800]   Apple doesn't do barbed features.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.120]   I've talked about where I got a $20 barbed
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.360]   that I can do a notification that has an active thing inside.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:54.760]   OK, great.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:55.600]   Get your $20.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.040]   You've also built something that's not very useful.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.600]   But you won your $20 barbed.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.080]   They're willing to simply say, we have
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.640]   to integrate into the entire experience
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.760]   so that your first go-to thought will be,
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:04.960]   I won't even launch an app for this.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.800]   I will go to Spotlight for this.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:07.560]   I'll cross the board.
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.280]   Everything you talk about.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.320]   We'll have to relearn habits.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.520]   And that's part of the problem with stuff like this.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.440]   If you don't relearn, they want to mission control
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.560]   and dashboard failed.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.200]   Not because they weren't great, but because it
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.760]   was a different thing that we had to do.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.560]   But we're willing to do that so long as it gives us--
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.240]   it's more efficient and more natural.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.480]   It's like when Spotlight had the ability to do math,
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.680]   I had to, quote, learn how to do things.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.760]   But now, why would I launch a calculator wrap
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.680]   and then click on the individual buttons?
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.200]   I can just simply say, oh, yeah.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.720]   It's like it's not learning when you figure out
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.400]   this is the natural way to do things.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.160]   Why didn't they do this all?
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:38.960]   You're a smarter rapper.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.960]   And for somebody who just uses Safari and Word,
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.200]   they will never open notifications.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.680]   They'll never be bothered by a widget.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.240]   All of that will be completely disappearing.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.680]   And that's the way to do that.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.200]   If you don't look for it, it's not there.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.720]   If you look for it, you'll find it really easily.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.400]   It is a challenge.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.520]   And this is the challenge Microsoft had with Windows 8
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.080]   was there is hidden stuff.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.600]   There is discoverable stuff, which nobody discovered.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.600]   And Apple had that problem.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.440]   I mean, dashboard was, I think, fundamentally undiscovered.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:04.920]   I wish I had the full background story on dashboard,
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.480]   because that's the Christmas present
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.440]   that the kids inside Apple were so eager to get.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.440]   And they were so happy to play with it on Christmas Day.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.440]   But on the 27th, they forgot it existed completely.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.280]   I can't think of another feature where they just--
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.880]   they pulled the AC power cord.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.760]   They didn't take the body out of the sitting room.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.080]   It just like Norman Bates's mother just got smaller and smaller.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:25.760]   It's like a small--
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:26.280]   It's like a few weeks.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.800]   And then it got-- everyone suddenly
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.960]   went gaga for the widgets after a confabulator had this.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.160]   Confabulator was the thing.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.400]   And I remember talking to the creator of Confabulator,
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.960]   who was one of the early Sherlockys.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.960]   A lot of companies got Sherlock today.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.400]   And we're going to talk more about it.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.800]   One good piece of news there is going to be a beta program.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.440]   Did they say whether this is the public beta
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.840]   that they did with 1093?
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.800]   So you can go right now to Apple's seed.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.800]   Don't go right now.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:50.680]   And Tim Cook is on it.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.720]   He wanted us all to know that he's on the beta program.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.240]   Is he?
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.120]   So don't expect him to reply to your email.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.200]   He'll probably have restarted his new--
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.280]   Is he end the aid?
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.920]   So you're suggesting people not do this?
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.240]   I never, ever recommend betas for anybody
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.360]   who doesn't need to test new software.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.800]   Second computer-- like it's your second computer.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:06.440]   It's something else.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:06.880]   It's a hard drive.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.880]   It's not a hard drive.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.880]   It's not a hard drive.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:09.880]   It's not something.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.880]   It wouldn't even say a second computer.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.040]   Microsoft did their public betas.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.480]   And they seem to have gone.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.480]   But that's different.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.040]   It's a very good way to do it.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.640]   Well, Microsoft's plan has always been-- we're going to show you.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.640]   We know that this is going to be a jarring change for you,
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.080]   so we want to get you used to it.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.800]   And then, what are the differences
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:27.840]   between Windows 8, between the first developer preview
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.560]   and the actual shipping product?
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.400]   I don't think Apple is the kind of company that will say,
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.160]   gee, everybody seems to want less translucency,
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.320]   so we'll back off on that.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.720]   I think that they know what they want to do.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.240]   I think this is more about bug testing
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.120]   and getting crash reports than anything else.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.680]   Well, it will make the font thicker if they need to.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.240]   It's fun.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.680]   I mean, I'm going to put iOS 8 certainly on my devices
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.880]   as early as I can.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.520]   But I would not use it on anything that I need to work.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.280]   Don't delay.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.160]   Only available to the first million applicants.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:55.960]   And I just signed up.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.200]   It says, thanks for signing up for the oldest in beta program.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.920]   We'll email you when OS 10 Yosemite beta is available for download.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.400]   And Andy says, don't do it.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.600]   And if you're a registered developer,
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.480]   you can just pay your money.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:06.400]   You can do it right now.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.080]   And I actually am.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.560]   But I don't know what--
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.960]   I guess I could get it faster.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.440]   I downloaded Xcode 6 right away.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.480]   We'll talk about that.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.840]   And Home and a whole lot more.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.320]   There is a ton to talk about today.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.440]   It was an amazing WWDC.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.440]   And I think the consensus of this panel anyway
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.200]   is there's some very, very interesting--
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.520]   There was some talk before the show
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.760]   that it was going to be the biggest announcement since iOS 2.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.440]   But it was hard to tell what they meant.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.680]   And they really meant that.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:32.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.040]   I mean, I got-- the conversations that I
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.360]   have been having for three days before it really
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.640]   got my interest up doubled almost every 18 hours.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.920]   And you're not disappointed?
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.560]   Not at all.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.840]   I mean, it's-- we'll talk about iOS and other things
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.360]   like that later.
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.440]   But so many things I've always wanted iOS to do,
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.440]   they're committing to.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.800]   So many things that I've thought of,
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.520]   why doesn't Apple do this with a Mac?
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.480]   They're doing it now.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.120]   And everything that I was really afraid about,
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:59.280]   and mostly we're talking about the new user interface for Yosemite,
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.440]   was like, wow, I shouldn't have been worried at all.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.320]   Because it doesn't look like a new Mac OS interface.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.520]   It looks like the next version of the Mac interface,
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.520]   which is all I wanted.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.880]   So I'm just going to a happy, happy person right now.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.440]   Isn't it exciting?
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:15.880]   Remember Google I/O is coming up less than a month from now.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.440]   I imagine Google will have a response to all of this.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.520]   They have to bring out some more of those driverless cars
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.040]   to sort of take the edge off of the interface.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.240]   Do you feel like there's a kind of a red target on Larry
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:24.960]   Page's back?
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.520]   I mean--
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.520]   Well, the thing that-- and I saw a couple people mention this,
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.160]   too, is that iOS has been secure,
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.360]   and Android has been flexible.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:33.720]   And now iOS is finding ways to stay secure and be flexible.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.160]   And it's easier to do that than it is
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.800]   to try to fix security afterwards.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:37.600]   Very interesting.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.200]   And I think that Google's other challenges,
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.120]   I mean, is the forking.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.440]   Between Amazon and doing their own version,
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.840]   but more importantly, Samsung doing its own operating system.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:50.760]   I think that-- and the fact that you have a hard time getting
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.600]   the phone companies to let everything upgrade,
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.760]   I think that these are challenges that Google has to sort out
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.040]   as Apple continues to go down.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.720]   I don't think it's-- what I think is great for us
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.800]   is I think it stays even.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.920]   I don't think-- I don't think either one has a great advantage.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.640]   But I think that those are challenges that Google really
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.400]   has to figure out how they're going to address.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.880]   Well, looking into a 20-minute distraction,
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.440]   I think that it's not always an Apple's and Apple sort
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.880]   of comparison between what Google needs to do with Android
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.360]   and what Apple has to do with iOS,
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.760]   because Android has to serve every phone user out there.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.600]   And they're people who will never in a million years
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.120]   buy an iPhone for economic, social, or usage reasons.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.040]   And those are the people who are buying Android devices.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:27.520]   And the fact that if Android is forked between a Kindle
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:31.200]   fire and an X7 tablet, that's OK,
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.800]   because a Kindle fire, if you're ever
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.920]   aware of any operating system whatsoever,
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.080]   that's a failure of design given what the fire is supposed to do.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.200]   So it's a complicated sort of math there.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.200]   Question from Twitter from our W Hewitt.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.280]   Maybe this is for you, Renee.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.800]   Will I have to upgrade to Maverick
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.680]   before I can upgrade to Yosemite?
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.160]   Do we know?
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.840]   The last time they did a massive amount of upgrade--
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:52.960]   you could upgrade from, I think,
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.520]   all the way back to Snowlep early to Maverick.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.400]   I'm imagining they can probably figure that out again.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:58.280]   And it will be free.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.840]   It will be in the app store probably as--
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.120]   It's free and perpetuity, I think,
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.120]   as far as our last announcement.
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.840]   We might as well say that now on.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.760]   And the public beta.
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.400]   That's the first time they've done that for a major release.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.720]   They seem really, really proud when Tim looked at that.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.520]   The only pie charts we saw today
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.120]   were A, how bad Android is as protecting people from malware.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.240]   But also here is how the percentage of Mac users that
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.640]   are now using the latest version of the operating system.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.960]   And there's a tiny, tiny little sliver of people
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.880]   that maybe forgot that they put their Mac mini in a closet
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.400]   three years ago and haven't booted up since.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.920]   It's like everybody's using--
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.840]   And again, in a developer conference, that is huge.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.000]   Because it is so much easier to develop
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.800]   for the same for one operating system.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.240]   But that was also the message when they're talking about malware,
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:37.760]   too.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.720]   They're making the statement to developers
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.200]   that the reason-- one of the failures of Android
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:44.600]   and is a genuine failure is that if everybody is not
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.480]   on the same version of KitKat, that means
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.760]   that it's not just a new interface.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.760]   It's all these great new APIs and features
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:54.000]   that now, if you write a piece of software that
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.760]   targets the Android marketplace,
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.640]   and it uses KitKat features, then that
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.200]   means that you are now targeting 11% of the user base.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.880]   Rest, if you write an iOS 7 app and now an iOS 8 app,
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.440]   you will have-- what was the number?
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:04.640]   80?
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.480]   Was it 89 or 90?
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.160]   Yeah, 89% of everybody.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.800]   Which is a huge number.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.760]   And it means a lot before those security patches
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.640]   that keep your phone safe for app compatibility
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.000]   for developers.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.960]   We're going to switch to iOS 8.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.400]   There's going to be some overlap here with all of these things.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:18.920]   Condi--
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:19.840]   We'll be continuity.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.200]   We'll be continuity.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.800]   Are you installing iOS 8 now?
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.360]   I have installed.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.120]   I know nothing.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.280]   I signed no agreement.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.120]   But first, we're really thrilled to have you all here.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.400]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.920]   Renee Ritchie from iMourd.com and Alex Lindsey
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.240]   from Pixelcore.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.440]   Mac Break Weekly discussing what was a very, very interesting
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.080]   morning at WWDC.
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.840]   For a little program note, of course,
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.760]   we don't normally do Mac Break Weekly on Mondays.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.960]   We won't be doing it tomorrow.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.160]   Instead, we're going to flip-flop iPad today.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.960]   We'll be on in our spot tomorrow.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.320]   And Triangulation will be coming up later today,
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.440]   or maybe tomorrow, I don't know.
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:57.120]   At this point, the schedule's kind of all up in the air.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.120]   If you're tuning in for this week in Enterprise Tech,
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.520]   normally at this time, that will be after T&2
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:07.560]   Tech News tonight, about 430 Pacific, 730 Eastern time on Twitter.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.640]   Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.800]   Not a law firm.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.560]   LegalZoom provides self-help services
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.040]   at your specific direction.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.480]   In my mind, for a lot of the things you might want to do,
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.200]   LegalZoom is better than a law firm.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.880]   It's certainly a lot more affordable.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.640]   A lot of the legal work that you want to do
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.920]   really doesn't require an attorney.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.560]   Just requires answering some questions.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.520]   And LegalZoom will do that.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:31.920]   They'll walk you through the questions, generate the documents
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:36.800]   you need to file for incorporation, chapter S or C or LLC.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.640]   And it'll do that for 99 bucks plus the state filing fees.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.720]   That is very affordable.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.840]   If you have a business and you don't have a trademark
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.440]   on your company name or your logo,
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.000]   you probably ought to get one, also very affordable.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.800]   And this is not the kind of thing you really
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.920]   need to hire a $350 an hour lawyer for.
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:58.160]   You can do yourself for $199 for a trademark.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.840]   All sorts of things for starting a business.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:03.520]   But also for your home and your life,
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.480]   last will and testament.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.200]   Last will and testament starting at $69.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.840]   A living trust, a living will, a health care power of attorney,
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:13.520]   even a pet protection agreement.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.400]   You can do all of these online at LegalZoom.com.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.040]   Now sometimes it does happen that you need an attorney.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:23.840]   LegalZoom also has pre negotiated, flat rate attorneys
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.040]   in every state.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.160]   You can read their profiles plus unedited customer reviews,
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.040]   get an idea of who you're hiring and the price is really
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.040]   right on this.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.040]   So if you have some questions, you can get those questions
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.240]   answered.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:40.440]   This is a great time to join the innovators of the world.
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.800]   The people like Thomas Edison and Henry Ford,
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:46.080]   who changed the world, inventors and entrepreneurs,
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.640]   are all around us now.
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:50.560]   It's a booming area, but you've got
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:54.000]   to use the protections built into law, the corporations,
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.400]   the trademarks, the patents to protect yourself.
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.800]   Right now, if you go to LegalZoom to celebrate innovation,
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.640]   you'll get a special price on trademark, copyright,
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.080]   or provisional patent applications

[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.320]   Again, not a law firm, something a lot better.

[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:46.680]   All right, we move on to iOS 8.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.400]   Lots of leaks about iOS 8.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.840]   We heard about health book.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.000]   We heard about what else?
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:53.840]   Health book.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:54.640]   Yeah, well, it ends up--
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.000]   We'll end up making health and health care.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.320]   And it's called Health and Health Kit.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.680]   There's no health book.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.920]   What else is new in iOS 8?
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.480]   I mean, there was so much stuff.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.800]   When you double click the home button now,
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.960]   as well as multitasking, you get all your contacts,
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.080]   your frequent contacts at the top.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:09.920]   The favorites, in effect.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.240]   Favorites, absolutely.
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.480]   It's not just features.
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.640]   It's also philosophy.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.480]   The ability that it is now largely extensible,
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.320]   that if you take a picture with the camera and you decide,
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:24.520]   hey, that would look really good in waterlog, you don't have
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.520]   to save it out, leave this app, go into launch waterlog.
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.680]   There's waterlog can present itself in the form of a photo
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:30.400]   filter.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.560]   Tap that and we'll--
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.280]   Our waterlog will do its magic and then return you right back
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:34.880]   to iPhoto.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.240]   They call this extensibility.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.520]   Or extensibility.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:38.720]   And it's so deep.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.600]   It's like so many of the problems that I've been--
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.360]   I had been having with iOS.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.280]   They look like if they're not already solved,
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.600]   they're released on their way.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.320]   Again, it's a philosophical change where it's not just that.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.680]   But when the problems I was having with pages was the fact
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:55.000]   that if I want to use cloud storage, of course,
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.280]   if I use iCloud, that's perfectly fine with Apple.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.160]   And it's very, very easy.
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.720]   If I want to use something else, it's a nightmare to do it.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.960]   Now Dropbox can add itself into pages.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.000]   And all these other cloud storage places can say,
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.560]   can serve files to pages or any other app.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:09.440]   You called this Renee.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.760]   You said last week, you expected to see this kind of extensibility.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.160]   This is something Android's done for a while.
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.960]   But it looks like it's much more tightly integrated in iOS
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.560]   and much more capable.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.360]   Of course, we have to wait and see what developers do with it.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:22.920]   I don't know if it'll be as capable because it is a security
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:23.640]   model.
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.080]   And they stress that numerous times.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.240]   Is that you can do a lot of things
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.560]   if you don't care about the stuff that Steve Gibson spoke about,
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.600]   that base level of trust no one's security.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.080]   But it looks like they're maintaining that,
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.560]   which is really, really interesting.
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:34.840]   They're doing a couple things.
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:35.240]   Because--
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.040]   It is more than just the handoff that we've had up.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:37.540]   Yeah.
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.040]   Right.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.040]   It's not open in.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.740]   One of the demonstrations they had
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:43.940]   was the extendability of Safari using Pinterest plugins.
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.260]   And they made a point of you're not launching Pinterest.
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:47.800]   It was Pinterest.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.720]   Their developers have designed a little user interface that
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.700]   comes up in Safari when you want to share something on Pinterest.
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:56.760]   So there's a certain amount of depth to it that goes beyond simply
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.240]   a little box of an error.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:58.760]   Like Windows has an error.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.380]   Contracts and extensions and extensions declare functionality
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:02.540]   that can then be surfaced.
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:03.100]   It's that whole thing.
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:05.100]   And a couple years ago, they created--
[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:07.300]   they ported XPC over to iOS.
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:09.100]   They split springboard into springboard and backboard.
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:10.340]   So you can have headless apps.
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:12.380]   So these apps are these little bits of interface
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:13.220]   that can just pop up.
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:15.820]   And the really nice thing is we didn't get default apps.
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.620]   You still can't reset your default apps.
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:19.220]   But you can do all these other things
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.180]   that people want to do, like any moving waterlog
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.780]   documents back and forth.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:23.920]   Or could one--
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.660]   I don't know, could one password make away from me
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.060]   to fill in my pages?
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.140]   Could they make a keyboard that lets me fill in--
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:31.700]   That in and of itself was another huge one.
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.260]   The ability to say you don't like your keyboard?
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:33.760]   Fine.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:34.580]   Use the third party one.
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:35.420]   We're cool with that now.
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:37.300]   One question I have is--
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.020]   and I assume that this is the case--
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:41.340]   these connections between these apps has to be explicit.
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.820]   So is it that app leaving a hook that
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.780]   says anybody that develops an image filter can fit in here?
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:50.020]   Or does waterlog need to set up agreements with everybody
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:50.740]   that's going to use this?
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:51.820]   Waterlog has to present functionality.
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:53.940]   And then the other apps could just pull that functionality.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:55.620]   So you can do-- you can basically say it--
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:56.620]   Oh, it's level support.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:56.820]   Yeah.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.100]   I have the ability to serve files off of a cloud service.
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.060]   So if you're an app that deals with files,
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:01.580]   I'm right here.
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:02.700]   That's where it's going.
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.500]   I think in the camera, this is huge.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:07.260]   This is something that a Windows phone does very nicely,
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.420]   where you have a number.
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:09.380]   They call them lenses.
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:10.860]   They're really standalone apps that
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:13.420]   can be embedded in the camera application.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.020]   I'll tell you a little bit of stor--
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:16.420]   I'm tweeting as I'm taking notes.
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:19.420]   And I said, I made a jerk earlier on that just in case--
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:21.300]   someone asked, did you take a Xanax before this in case
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:21.940]   it's too exciting?
[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.500]   And I said, no, but I did put astronaut diapers on underneath
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:25.900]   my pants just in case.
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:29.220]   And whatever the previous announcement was,
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.100]   OK, the astronaut diapers are now at 97%.
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.780]   And then that's when they said, oh, by the way,
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.020]   we're also introducing APIs that allow third party apps
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.380]   to have full manual control of the camera.
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:40.900]   And I said, OK, now they're overflowing.
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.100]   Sorry, I meant Steph.
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:43.860]   No, but that's a big deal because it
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:47.940]   means you can have Instagram in your iOS app.
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:49.460]   And vice versa.
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:52.340]   The new Photos app allows you to put filters in any other--
[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:54.500]   The app can declare their filters to any photo editor.
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:55.500]   Yeah.
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:56.460]   And they didn't really get in.
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:57.980]   They said there was new SDKs for the camera,
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:59.620]   but they just kind of said--
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:00.700]   Manual controls.
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.140]   So that's all they had said.
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:03.780]   And again, they didn't waffle.
[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:05.540]   It says full manual control of the camera.
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:07.420]   Why does that get your diapers full?
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:11.820]   But that's huge because Apple has equally one
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:14.140]   of the two greatest cameras you can get on any mobile device.
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:16.260]   But the shame of the thing is that you can't simply say,
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.540]   look, camera.
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:18.020]   You do this.
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:18.860]   It's my kid.
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:19.860]   He's running around.
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.460]   If you use a long-- I don't care why you want
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:22.660]   to use a long shutter speed.
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:24.180]   If you do, you will screw up the photo.
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.300]   Please don't do that.
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:26.900]   So now you can just simply--
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:29.420]   I'm thinking more about a third party app that simply says,
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:31.100]   you are now in active kid mode.
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:32.460]   I will make all these smart decisions
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.020]   to make sure there's a slow shutter speed.
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:35.300]   And then there are people who are really
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.300]   using iPhones for serious photography.
[00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.540]   They're not using it to shoot a wedding,
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:41.220]   but they are people who like photos somewhere inside their house.
[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:42.420]   They've got a really nice camera.
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:43.940]   They just want to happen to have it with them.
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:46.620]   And they know that the problem with-- the things
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:50.140]   that separate phone cameras from real cameras right now
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:51.940]   is the thing that there is still that randomness.
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.660]   There is still the thing is where you hold it up
[00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:55.300]   and you know that either you will get a photo
[00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:56.380]   or you will not get a photo.
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.180]   If you don't get the photo, why try a third time?
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:00.860]   Because this is a situation in which a phone cannot
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:02.540]   take a good picture.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:04.260]   It's usually because of the firmware or the software.
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.980]   It's not because of the lens and the imager.
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:08.860]   So if Apple simply says that we are willing to elect humans
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.300]   who have smarter brains or more interest
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:14.540]   in developing an alternative imaging to create a solution
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:16.020]   for this, we'll let them do that now.
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.260]   You don't have to give up now with an iPhone.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.740]   There's always going to be another answer available to you.
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:22.100]   You mix that with that nice gnocchi engineer
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.340]   they brought over a couple of weeks ago
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.140]   and suddenly you have a lot of really pretty numerous stuff.
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:26.380]   Pretty interesting.
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:28.700]   I think some people are listening to some other people
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:29.140]   inside there.
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:30.260]   I don't know.
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.700]   Siri, you could say, hey, Siri.
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:34.300]   It's funny because I always do that anyway.
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:35.980]   But now it actually does something.
[00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:38.060]   This is the M7 again listening.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:38.980]   I don't know if it's the M7.
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:40.500]   The M7 just does motion co-processing.
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:43.740]   But it's obviously some form of low power listening.
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:47.020]   And Siri, good night, turns off all your stuff.
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:48.660]   You say Siri, hey Siri, good night?
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:51.300]   Yeah, the demo with the home kit.
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.420]   You can set up all your devices,
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:54.580]   the automated device on your home.
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:56.780]   And then does the phone stop ringing until the 7 a.m.?
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.300]   The good night thing just turns off your lights.
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:59.980]   It makes sure your garage door is closed.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:01.260]   Does the phone stop ringing?
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:04.220]   Oh, no, there's no bedside over there.
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:04.900]   We're not animals.
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.740]   Oh, minor detail, OK.
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.100]   She's an Amps song recognition.
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:10.780]   You can purchase iTunes content, streaming voice recognition.
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:11.660]   Well, all by voice.
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:12.580]   All by voice.
[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.140]   Hey, Siri, what is this song?
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:14.900]   And it will tell you.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:15.340]   Right.
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.420]   Well, and I think that I think when we look at the home
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.900]   automation, when we look at a lot of those things coming down
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:23.980]   and eventually upgrades to Apple TV, other things like that,
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:25.500]   I think the idea that you're in your house
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.900]   and you're making all these calls without having any--
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:29.340]   I mean, this is just setting us up,
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.300]   whether it's a watch or an Apple TV or whatever.
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.740]   And I don't mean the screen TV, just even just a little one,
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:36.500]   where we're going to be able to interact with our house
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.180]   at a whole different level than we have in the past.
[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:41.860]   And Apple is really one of the only companies, not the only
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:43.140]   company, but one of the only companies
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:45.940]   that could pull all this stuff together and make it work.
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:47.980]   Now, they've laid down the gauntlet.
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:49.780]   They have to perform in the next year,
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.220]   because everyone now is going to try to figure out
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:53.380]   that process, because they'll lose it.
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:56.460]   If people don't get it in the next 24 months,
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:59.180]   people don't move very quickly.
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:00.420]   Apple will own this space.
[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.860]   Well, headless apps, if you can take a phone call on your Mac,
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.260]   you could take your phone call anywhere.
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:06.260]   Once you can start moving stuff anywhere in your house.
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:07.860]   Well, not just devices, but anything
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:09.500]   that may not have an interface on it.
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:10.620]   It's a small device.
[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:12.580]   And it underscores the longstanding impression
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.380]   of Siri as a mini application platform, not just simply
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:17.060]   a way to not have to use a keyboard.
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:19.580]   And imagine being anywhere in your house and just say,
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:20.580]   call Leo.
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:22.140]   Hey, Siri, call Leo.
[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:23.260]   Then you have to run to your lamp,
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:24.940]   because that's where the microphone is.
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:27.140]   But the amazing thing is, we've had interfaces replaced
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:29.420]   before that we went from the punch cards to the command line
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:30.260]   to the GUI.
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:31.660]   Now we're getting parallel interfaces,
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:33.380]   because Siri doesn't replace the UI.
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:34.540]   It just sits next to it.
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:35.780]   Spotlight doesn't replace UI.
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.540]   It's just another way of interfacing with the computer.
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.540]   Yeah.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:41.500]   I was thinking on the way over here again
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.460]   that that was another indication of how much
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:44.820]   meat there was in this presentation.
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:47.300]   The fact that they added all these really nice features
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:50.780]   to Siri, and it was one slide, and it may be emitted on it
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:52.580]   before motoring on to something else.
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:54.860]   Incidentally, the keynote is up on Apple's site
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:56.700]   if you want to watch it again.
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.820]   We also have a special special 202,
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:02.660]   where you can watch it with us talking over it.
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:07.060]   My shellkin, Alex Lindsey, Sarah Lainen, myself.
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:07.980]   You get your choice.
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.380]   You can watch it either way.
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:11.820]   But I think it was pretty clear as we watched.
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:13.620]   We were very excited about what was going on.
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:15.540]   And it was clear also that the developers in the audience
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:16.060]   were excited.
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.300]   It's a little different, by the way.
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:19.340]   It looked like Apple did not stack its own staff
[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:20.580]   in the first few rows.
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:21.980]   They were scattered throughout the auditorium.
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:23.220]   But that was my impression on the stream.
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:24.260]   Was it actually the case?
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:24.780]   I don't know.
[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:26.420]   I was only aware of it when they did the traditional.
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.980]   Everybody who works for Apple would stand up.
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.380]   It was all over.
[00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:29.380]   It was all over.
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:30.460]   I think they came in with the press,
[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:32.100]   because they were all looking for seats at the same time.
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:32.900]   Interesting.
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.500]   Yeah, as usual, the press were off to--
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:35.460]   had a section to the left.
[00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:37.060]   The middle section was employees.
[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:39.300]   NVIPs were just employees in VIPs, I think.
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.500]   All right.
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.140]   And it was like someone said clearly,
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:45.740]   this was a developers keynote at a developers' conference
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:47.740]   for developers, which hasn't happened in a long time.
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:49.740]   Let's say that again and again and again.
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.980]   Yeah.
[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.820]   Notifications.
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:55.500]   You can respond directly to notifications
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.260]   in the notifications for you on lock screen.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:57.780]   Hallelujah.
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:58.780]   Interhallelujah.
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:50:59.780]   Interhallelujah.
[00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:00.780]   That's something--
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:03.060]   And not just-- like they had SMS, they showed off Facebook.
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.060]   They showed-- and I don't know if they have a plug-in architecture,
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:06.300]   but they showed off quite a few different apps.
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:08.220]   You can bid on eBay items.
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:08.780]   Yeah.
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:10.700]   It'll give you that alert that you have the ability.
[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.140]   It's an actionable--
[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:12.660]   actionable--
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:14.060]   Add third party widgets.
[00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:14.620]   Yeah.
[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:15.620]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.420]   You can broadcast new functionality inside it
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:18.420]   if you're a developer.
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:19.580]   I could be wrong.
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:20.940]   This is one of the things I need to go back on.
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.860]   But I got the impression from the spotlight demonstrations
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:25.380]   that they're saying that if a developer wants
[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:27.660]   to write an app whose chief functionality is
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:30.220]   to exist inside Spotlight and persistently tell you
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:31.780]   what the stock prices or whatever are,
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:32.660]   people are free to do that.
[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:34.420]   They don't necessarily have to write a big stock app
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:35.820]   and then simply wait for people to notice.
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:36.820]   Well, that was a big question.
[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.220]   And Groomer was talking about that after the show.
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:39.540]   It was like, yeah, in keyboards,
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:41.100]   how are we going to be delivered keyboards?
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:41.740]   Did they get an app?
[00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:43.340]   Because people were used to deleting an app.
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:44.700]   Do they end up being a settings panel?
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.060]   These are, again, headless apps now,
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:47.460]   which is the interesting thing.
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:48.980]   Well, I'm sure we'll find out.
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:49.900]   Keyboard is great.
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:54.540]   Of course, they did not change the messed up uppercase keyboard.
[00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:57.020]   However, they at least allow you to install swipe.
[00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:59.660]   You know, my entire attitude and that subject
[00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:02.740]   is so different right now because it used to be like these--
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:03.460]   No choice.
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:05.500]   Well, no, I'm saying my problems with the keyboard
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:08.260]   were a death by 1,000 cuts where I can talk about, oh, man,
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:09.540]   you won't even show me--
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:11.420]   it's not even clear that uppercase is locked up
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:14.300]   because I'm also complaining that there's no auto complete.
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:14.940]   There's no swipe.
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:15.460]   There's no this.
[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:16.220]   There's no that.
[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:18.820]   Now it's like that is the least thing I can complain about.
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:20.140]   Now that they've done so many things.
[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:22.940]   And prediction, not merely a T9 style single word
[00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:24.580]   by prediction, but it's phrase prediction.
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:26.260]   You didn't remind you of iOS 2, iOS 8,
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:28.740]   where first all went up there and went, done, done, done,
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:29.740]   done, making a throwing card.
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:30.620]   Check the stuff off.
[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:31.100]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:32.420]   And I really want to--
[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:35.060]   I'm sure that there are a lot of people saying, oh, that's
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:38.140]   a nice feature that I've had on my Android phone for two years.
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:39.260]   Well, that's true.
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:39.780]   That's true.
[00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:43.100]   It's technically true, but really, this is a stew of--
[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:45.100]   I don't feel like they're just simply checking off things
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:46.660]   but on the whiteboard for a long time.
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:49.100]   I really feel as though they've added ingredients to a stew.
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.900]   It really feels like part of a total new thing,
[00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:54.460]   as opposed to, OK, fine winers will give you this thing
[00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:55.340]   that we don't feel like--
[00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:57.140]   Yeah, like a whole acoustic system.
[00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:57.460]   Right.
[00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:58.460]   Not just tacked on.
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:00.020]   And it is true.
[00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:02.460]   It's a great feature that we've waited too long to get.
[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:06.300]   But now that we have it based solely on having watched
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.580]   a live demo of it, I need to stress,
[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:11.500]   it looks like I don't have any worries about this going
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.100]   into actually going hands-on with the demo.
[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:14.380]   Well, we should have that score, of course.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:16.900]   All of this is promised.
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.860]   We don't know what will be delivered, the quality of it,
[00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:21.820]   or even if these features will be delivered at all.
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:23.140]   But that was really good at that there.
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:23.740]   It was pretty good.
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:26.180]   I thought it was really the only feature
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:28.860]   that I think they've ever announced where they absolutely
[00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:31.580]   just kicked themselves in their own heads with it.
[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:33.980]   So I'm willing to say that's an aberration.
[00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:35.620]   I really have high hopes for what I was saying.
[00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:39.660]   And I will give you, Andy, that it's hard not to say, well,
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:42.820]   gosh, I've had swipe on Android for years.
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:45.980]   It feels more like this is not merely adding that feature,
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:48.140]   but an entire rethinking of how.
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:51.460]   iOS treats third parties in a way that's
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:53.260]   secure and yet extensible.
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:55.260]   And then we're rumors that this was going to happen last year
[00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:57.140]   and it just didn't show up in the keynote.
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:58.980]   So who knows how long it takes to get this stuff right
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:53:59.980]   according to that?
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:03.540]   I really have to say something that's this out there.
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:06.220]   If Apple comes out with a large screen iPhone,
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:10.780]   I am at a loss for why I want to stick with Android.
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:12.900]   Because I feel as though they have--
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:15.820]   I feel as survey says.
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:18.940]   Because really, I mean, I was thinking to myself,
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:22.380]   I tweeted this out that it's almost the subtext of this keynote
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:24.300]   is Andy, please switch back to iOS.
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:24.940]   I'm home, Andy.
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:26.700]   We read what you wrote last year.
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:28.260]   We've basically given you everything
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:29.940]   that you wish that iOS happened.
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:31.140]   I'm actually with you.
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:33.100]   And it comes back to this whole ecosystem,
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:35.300]   promise the idea of home automation, which we're going to--
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.300]   I'm a little bit about it.
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:37.100]   I don't care about that.
[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:38.300]   But all of it goes together.
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:39.260]   That's a Samsung feature.
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:41.900]   Continuity, home automation, all of it
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:45.980]   goes together if the iPhone 6 has a bigger screen.
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:48.140]   Oh, and let's not forget we're going to get to this too,
[00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:49.620]   fingerprint.
[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:54.500]   If my bank is using fingerprint recognition for authentication,
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:57.220]   all of this does push you back into the Apple ecosystem.
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:58.780]   If you're only using a part of it,
[00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:01.060]   as I am, the Macintosh and the iPad,
[00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:03.420]   it really pushes you back into it,
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.380]   the beauty of a full ecosystem.
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:06.340]   Because you get so much more.
[00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:07.420]   I want to give you a great experience.
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:08.900]   I want to give you a great experience.
[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.020]   Let's talk about health kit.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.940]   I almost call it Heathkit.
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:14.420]   This is what we call the health book.
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:17.420]   It's a great pressure cuff, but you have to assemble it yourself.
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.260]   You got a soldering iron in 152 minutes?
[00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:22.740]   So this is an app for tracking personal health,
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:24.860]   but also aggregating fitness data from a variety
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:28.700]   of other devices and apps.
[00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.460]   They had a nice semi-demonstration quote
[00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:33.660]   from the Mayo Clinic.
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:35.700]   Basically, talking about a scenario in which you have someone
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.380]   who has ongoing health issues, who's
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:40.540]   been simply told that we want to take your blood pressure twice
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:43.380]   a day, because the health kit has the ability
[00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:45.900]   to assess all of this information at once,
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:49.060]   it can basically let the Mayo Clinic know or a doctor
[00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:51.900]   know that, yeah, this person is not sick right now,
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:53.780]   but they're on a bad trend, so we need a call
[00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:55.140]   and have her come in for an appointment right now.
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:58.300]   It's interesting that there wasn't even the slightest hint
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:01.380]   of, and we may have some devices that will work with this
[00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:02.060]   down the road.
[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:03.220]   There was nothing like that.
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:05.020]   Well, that's already something I'm sure they want
[00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:06.300]   no part of that either.
[00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:09.180]   There's also why things I think makes a blood pressure.
[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:09.700]   Well, there's lots of them.
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:11.540]   They showed RunKeeper, they showed Nike Plus.
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:13.180]   I mean, of course, there's lots of those,
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:14.180]   but I think that when you talk about--
[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:15.340]   There was a Fitbit picture there, right?
[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:16.540]   But when you talk about the tough ones--
[00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:17.340]   Not a Nike--
[00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:18.340]   Well, yeah, well, Nike stopped--
[00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:19.940]   I think they're stopping making the field back.
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:22.260]   That's a disputed fact.
[00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:24.740]   We don't know, yeah, Nike says not.
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:26.420]   But then, of course, we shouldn't forget
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:29.300]   Tim Cooks on the Nike board, but they did show a Fitbit
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:30.580]   Flex, didn't they?
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:32.100]   I wonder-- I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:33.340]   I was just going to say that I think
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:36.780]   that I think this does create an explosion for those kinds
[00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:40.620]   of features, like whether it's a blood pressure or other things.
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:44.100]   If there are things that I choose to share with my doctor,
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:46.380]   and I have a health problem of constantly being
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:48.980]   able to test those things, my weight, my blood pressure--
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:51.300]   My doctor wants me to take my blood pressure twice a day
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:54.020]   and write it down and email it to him.
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:55.860]   And in this case, you just do it.
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:56.940]   You just do it.
[00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:57.940]   And then you--
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:56:58.540]   They showed--
[00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:00.620]   Not merely male clinic, but a number of other hospitals
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:01.620]   signing up.
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:03.540]   One of the big attractions is that it makes things--
[00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:06.860]   it makes this product so much easier for companies to build,
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:09.340]   where, OK, great, you've built a digital pressure
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.740]   cuff that's very, very easy to use.
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:12.780]   Now you have to write contract out a piece of software
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:13.540]   for people to use it.
[00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:14.980]   Then I have to contract an interface.
[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:17.620]   Now, all they have to do is simply say, here's a kit.
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:18.500]   Here's a live phone.
[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:18.500]   Great.
[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:19.500]   We're done.
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:20.100]   Ship it.
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:23.540]   And we see if we see this category flourish where people can--
[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:25.900]   it's every single doctor you talk to, every single researcher
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:28.700]   you talk to, says that if you can catch a cancer,
[00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:32.740]   if you can catch a longstanding disease in the first stages of it,
[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:33.860]   it becomes a come on in.
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:34.540]   We'll give you a shot.
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:35.540]   We'll cut--
[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:38.700]   And with the growing market at 55 and above--
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:39.540]   It's not being facetious.
[00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:40.260]   It's not being marketed.
[00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:40.780]   That's nice.
[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:42.660]   But the ability to say that we're
[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:45.700]   going to really tell you to change your diet this way,
[00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:47.860]   and that will avoid three years from now having to come in
[00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:50.100]   and sign some whole bunch of papers and then go into the night.
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:50.860]   What answers that question?
[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:52.020]   Why should I get an iPhone?
[00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:54.140]   And you can give someone a real answer to that with a lot
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:55.380]   of stuff they announced today.
[00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:57.260]   Bigger screen solves problem.
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:59.500]   I'm concerned with saving your life, honey.
[00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:01.300]   That's why I bought myself that new iPad
[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:02.540]   and let you have my iPad rate.
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:03.140]   That's for you.
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:04.340]   I'm doing it for you.
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:05.820]   If you were taken for me, I don't even want to get
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:06.180]   through that.
[00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:07.620]   Let's just buy it.
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:09.940]   Home automation.
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:12.260]   There were a lot of questions raised.
[00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:14.340]   And not a lot of answers provided.
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:17.700]   They said they implied there would be a unique Apple protocol.
[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:19.740]   How this would interoperate with existing, I don't know.
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:21.020]   Yeah, there wasn't much information yet.
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:22.420]   But it's called house kit, which means it's
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:23.620]   a developer-facing thing.
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:25.700]   And that's good because if it was just made for iPhone
[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:28.780]   program, then it might just be a chip that says, oh, or a seal.
[00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:30.860]   It says, yes, you made this and you passed our tests.
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:32.740]   But it sounds like they're giving developers tools that
[00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:34.140]   will make the stuff all work better.
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:36.040]   And my favorite thing was when they said you could pick up
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:38.460]   Siri and say, good night and it will close your garage
[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:40.620]   or turn off your lights, turn off your music.
[00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:44.260]   One of the interesting things about it is that if you're
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:46.540]   creating a kit that the developers can write to
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:48.500]   and the hardware manufacturers can write to,
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:51.500]   it means that I can write something that will eventually
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:53.860]   work with a whirlpool, x, y, and z.
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:56.340]   So there can be multiple apps that can--
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:57.540]   so there's a lot of creativity.
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:58:58.060]   I can be--
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:58:59.500]   I can spoil it.
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:00.740]   I didn't want to mention that.
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:02.060]   But I think that would be great.
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.540]   I don't want Siri on a toilet.
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:04.860]   I don't have a conversation with them.
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:08.500]   I already have a controller for the toilet, but it's not my
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:10.100]   phone, which I often times have one.
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.180]   I have one as a television.
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:13.220]   I'm left with a ghost like this.
[00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:14.860]   Siri, B.A.
[00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:15.660]   Exactly.
[00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:16.620]   Siri, a little bit to the left.
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:18.500]   There you go.
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:19.420]   We're taking a weird error.
[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:21.700]   Call Siri.
[00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:26.820]   So anyway, but I think that allowing the opportunity here
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:27.660]   is to create a safe way.
[00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:28.860]   So the manufacturers don't have to--
[00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:30.620]   you don't have to develop a developer relationship with
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:34.060]   Whirlpool or Panasonic or whatever that's building the
[00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:35.540]   pieces or Philips.
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:39.980]   You're developing an app that has the calls, and that hardware
[00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:41.100]   is coming back that has those calls.
[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:44.620]   And I think you end up with all kinds of opportunities for
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:47.660]   developers and opportunity for hardware manufacturers, because
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:49.580]   the hardware manufacturers over and over and over are going
[00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:51.900]   to be improving that they are incapable of building interfaces
[00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:54.140]   that are useful at all.
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:56.380]   And so the thing is, just forget it.
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:57.300]   Just leave it blank.
[00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:00.660]   All right, I'm going to now put a little dark cloud over you,
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:02.780]   because we've been very excited and positive.
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:05.220]   Can Apple-- this is all promise.
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:07.980]   This is all pie in the sky at this point.
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:10.060]   Well, the beta came out today, though.
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:11.260]   But can Apple make this work?
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.260]   And will people adopt it?
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.940]   I mean, can it really happen, or is this just yet another
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.900]   exciting feature that never gets it?
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.380]   I think we can say that there are two different categories
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:20.780]   of things that were announced today.
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:23.380]   One are things that are completely within Apple's control,
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:25.300]   and Apple is a master of their own destiny.
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.780]   When it comes to the idea of this kind of app sharing, when
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:30.900]   it comes to the idea of iCloud Drive, they own it, they
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.020]   manage it, they control it.
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:33.700]   I think they can absolutely deliver on that.
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:36.540]   There are the other categories of things like HealthKit, of
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:39.420]   things like Health, where clearly they're not saying that
[01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:41.420]   this is our move towards the health market.
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.980]   They're simply saying, we're going to create this
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:43.980]   possibility.
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:46.180]   It costs us very, very little to maintain this.
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.780]   And so if people use it, that's fine.
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:48.540]   People don't use it.
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:49.660]   We haven't lost anything at all.
[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:51.660]   Ibeacon is an example.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:52.300]   Well, there's that also.
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:52.940]   Is that latter?
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:53.460]   No?
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:54.900]   No, but Ibeacon is moving quickly.
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:55.980]   I mean, it's quiet.
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.820]   It's not Apple's fully Apple's to control.
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:00:59.980]   Well, Apple--
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:02.180]   That's the Ibeacon upon the waters.
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:05.860]   I think Apple is a little bit more involved in promoting Ibeacon
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:08.620]   because they know that this is a way to project the iPhone's
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:10.460]   influence into the real world.
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:13.900]   I wrote 2,000 words about this on the plane on Sunday.
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:16.220]   I think part of Apple's future strategy, or excuse me,
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:19.100]   the future desires for itself is to make sure that you are
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:21.740]   always walking inside a world of Apple.
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.380]   And if you have an iPhone, all these things that are in the
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:27.100]   world are exposed to you because now you're near Ibeacons.
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.260]   Now you're using this-- now you're stove that was working
[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:30.220]   perfectly fine.
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:32.380]   Hey, by the way, this is a really cool sous vide interface,
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:34.740]   or sous vide style interface that will maintain a cooking
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:37.180]   temperature, and that only is available.
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:39.020]   It's like they live with those glasses only.
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:41.220]   So I'm seeing skull-faced aliens you're seeing.
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:42.820]   I heard a developer talk about Ibeacon--
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:44.300]   Because a lot of the developers are only just getting
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.060]   their hands on them now.
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:46.740]   They were announced last year, but they're just getting them
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:47.620]   and working with them.
[01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:49.700]   And the stuff that they're talking about it, even half of
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:50.340]   it becomes true.
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:52.020]   We're going to be living in an entirely different world of
[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:52.420]   mobile devices.
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:55.860]   Yeah, some developer was talking to me about this app that
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:58.060]   he wrote that he just puts the tag on his luggage.
[01:01:58.060 --> 01:01:59.540]   And he doesn't-- he can just go get a soda.
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:01.900]   But now this phone tells, oh, by the way, your luggage is now
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:04.700]   on the luggage-- on the luggage carousel, go and get it.
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:07.820]   Well, yeah, I hate to cast myself in this role, but I'm
[01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:11.140]   going to have to start becoming the negative--
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:12.860]   The curmudgeon, a say, or the curmudgeon here.
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:15.020]   I feel like there's a little irrational exuberance here.
[01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:17.260]   I too am carried away by this.
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:20.180]   But none of this is actually happening again.
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:21.180]   Well, there's still questions, though, too.
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.100]   They're like, hey, Siri, how does that work?
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:23.460]   Because that's--
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:24.380]   It's a complete the battery.
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:26.300]   Well, no, but they said when you go in your car and plug it
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:28.100]   in, you can say, hey, Siri.
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:30.020]   So does that mean it only works on a car when your plug is
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:31.340]   only when you're plugged in?
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:34.180]   Is it always listening the way an Xbox One is always listening?
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:36.580]   I have tons of questions about that kind of stuff.
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:39.100]   Like Andy said, stuff was on that screen for a book
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:40.100]   for it.
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:40.620]   Right.
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:43.940]   Including compatibility of iOS 8 with the devices, it's like--
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:47.340]   It only takes me maybe one second to lift up my--
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:49.140]   especially at the end of the keynote.
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.620]   You're seeing things that have lots and lots of text on them.
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:53.460]   So I take a picture of them so I can refer them later
[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:54.620]   like I'm doing right now.
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:56.100]   And so, OK, here's a compatibility list.
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.980]   By the time I had my camera up, it was gone.
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:02.100]   And so I was talking to people later on who said that, OK, I
[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:03.420]   saw iPad 2 on that list.
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:05.340]   I did not see iPad 3 on that list.
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:07.500]   The earliest iPhone I saw was iPhone 4S.
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.340]   And I'm going to have to go to the video table.
[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:10.020]   In fact, you're right.
[01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:11.580]   It didn't go past iPhone 4S.
[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:12.660]   Did show the iPad 2.
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:14.740]   I did not see iPad 3 that doesn't mean it wasn't there.
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:15.260]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:16.260]   But it did go back.
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.580]   But it's like, again, it's like, boom, they couldn't--
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:20.060]   It was quick.
[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:21.580]   Either either they were--
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.500]   It wasn't the last 15 or 20 minutes.
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.140]   So maybe they were realized we really
[01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:26.380]   have to cut this off at noon.
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:27.540]   So we're not going to linger.
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:29.060]   But then again, it was--
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:29.980]   Well, here from--
[01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:31.220]   Yes, I have permission to be here.
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:31.900]   Here's my card.
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:34.420]   Thanks, I mean, for running on the Verge 8 features
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:36.020]   in iOS Apple didn't talk about it.
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:36.820]   The bait is now out.
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:38.900]   So people are starting to look at this.
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:42.860]   Wi-Fi calling, apparently, is now built into iOS 8.
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:44.740]   Carriers that want to support it, like T-Mobile,
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:46.140]   will be able to turn that bomb.
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.180]   Battery shaming, apparently, is in iOS.
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.060]   Battery shaming.
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:52.020]   You can look app by app and see which app is killing your battery.
[01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:52.820]   Hello, Skype.
[01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:53.980]   Oh, man.
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.540]   And by the way, Andy, the slide that you were talking about--
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:58.900]   this is a good example of that slide.
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:00.940]   This is from Bradley Chambers.
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:03.260]   If you just kind of try to read that,
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:04.740]   you're going to have about three seconds
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.620]   to see everything that's in there.
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:10.260]   That's every feature, just so you know.
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:13.260]   Speak screen, Shazam with Siri FaceTime call waiting.
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:14.580]   FaceTime call waiting.
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:15.580]   That's an interesting idea.
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:17.020]   So you're on a FaceTime call.
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.180]   And it goes, yeah, I would still love FaceTime conference
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:20.060]   calling on an iPad.
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:20.580]   That would be awesome.
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:22.420]   That's interesting.
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:24.260]   Travel time notifications.
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.180]   This is something that Google now does.
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:28.180]   But we didn't see maps come to think of it.
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.260]   They map no transit.
[01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:31.780]   They did have as part of an early demonstration
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.420]   of something else on the desktop.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:34.460]   As they're showing off the interface,
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:35.940]   I think they also, again, have to go back
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:36.860]   to the videotape to check it.
[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:38.460]   But I remember thinking, oh, that's new.
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:39.660]   That's not something I've seen before.
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:41.380]   We know we have many blind listeners.
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:43.260]   They will be very happy to know that there's
[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:47.180]   a Braille keyboard in iOS 8 with DirectX 6.input.
[01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:47.660]   I'm not sure.
[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:48.580]   I don't know what that means.
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:49.780]   But apparently, that's very important.
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:52.740]   And it will be a big improvement for blind listeners.
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:56.260]   iOS has always been really great for vision-impaired users.
[01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:58.860]   But this has not been there before.
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:04:59.900]   That's another great thing.
[01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:01.860]   Apple doesn't get enough press for how they've made a--
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:03.660]   They've made a device that if you--
[01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:07.460]   No matter what problems you have in terms of your vision,
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:09.180]   your hearing, your cognitive abilities,
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:11.740]   this is the most capable device for everybody out there.
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:15.260]   They did announce a new Photos app on iOS,
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:19.020]   but also a new Photos app on desktop.
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:21.300]   And it did sound like this is to replace iPhoto
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:24.260]   will be available next year, not with Mavericks--
[01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:26.020]   or, I'm sorry, Yosemite.
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:28.860]   I think it's part of consistency across all platforms,
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:30.740]   especially something with photos where you just
[01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:33.620]   want to show people your favorite photos from otherware.
[01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:35.020]   The other cool thing they were doing
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:37.420]   where they now have new image enhancement systems.
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:39.500]   So it's technically a brightness tool,
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.020]   but it's not just simply doing OK,
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:43.220]   add plus 10 to the brightness level of this image.
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:46.420]   It's making adjustments to the color, the saturation,
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:50.220]   the intensity levels to say, he wants it brighter,
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:51.340]   but he doesn't want to like crap.
[01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:52.460]   How do we do that?
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:55.660]   I have to say, just if they have a bigger screen and a keyboard--
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.820]   I can replace the keyboard.
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.020]   That's all it's going to take for me.
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:00.580]   Welcome, O'Holeo.
[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:04.780]   I might be back, especially-- and this was another announcement--
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:08.300]   they've opened up the fingerprint reader TouchID.
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:12.900]   And if they make that open and banks and Amazon and PayPal
[01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:16.340]   start using TouchID as maybe second factor authentication,
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:19.900]   this is huge and would be a very compelling reason
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:21.420]   to move back to iOS.
[01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:23.100]   That was a little bit surprising to me.
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:25.580]   We didn't see anything about TouchID on Macs.
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:27.660]   But if they did that, that would indicate a new hardware
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:28.180]   feature.
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:29.380]   So maybe they would--
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:30.820]   it would need some sort of secure enclave.
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:31.820]   It would need a lot of--
[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:35.380]   I would guess that when they release new laptops--
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:36.220]   new iPads, for sure.
[01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:39.220]   And new iPads and maybe even new desktops.
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:41.460]   There could be a keyboard or a new trackpad
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.420]   that has TouchID capability.
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.060]   Perhaps you touch the screen.
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:48.100]   But getting back to what we're talking about about continuity,
[01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:49.380]   it really does make--
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:52.300]   like make me want to rethink how they're positioning the iPad
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.300]   now.
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:55.460]   It's an emphatic underscoring of the idea
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:58.460]   that we believe that iPads are for one thing.
[01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:00.020]   Laptops are for another thing.
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:02.660]   We just want to make these two work as big as possible.
[01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:04.460]   But we don't want to blur the lines between those two.
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:04.960]   Right?
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.940]   And I think when you look at continuity and TouchID,
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.900]   the other option is you can just be sitting on your computer
[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:09.980]   and touch your phone.
[01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:11.460]   And it can ask--
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.860]   your desktop can ask your phone, please
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:13.940]   authenticate this user.
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:14.460]   Exactly.
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:15.060]   He's good.
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:15.780]   Go ahead.
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:16.820]   Bluetooth, trusted device.
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:17.460]   Awesome.
[01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:18.820]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:20.780]   When we come back, this was a developers conference.
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:24.180]   And there was some very big news for developers.
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:25.740]   4,000 new APIs.
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:26.140]   Anyone?
[01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:27.540]   Holy cow.
[01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:28.500]   So we'll talk about that.
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.820]   We've got picks of the week coming up.
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:31.820]   And the question engine.
[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:33.420]   Why don't we do some questions from the question engine?
[01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:33.740]   We should.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:35.740]   There's over 340 questions.
