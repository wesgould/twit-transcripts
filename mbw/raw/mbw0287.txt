[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.680]   I'm not I'm not allowed to use the noodle portion of the package and only eat that powder because that is the wish and the desire of apple and
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.160]   Cheese is it is it truly international pancake day today? Just we have to check
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:31.120]   It's true Tuesday. It is drove Tuesday. Oh, isn't it like fat Tuesday early day before the start of Lent is the day
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.040]   You're supposed to eat pancakes lots of pancakes
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.400]   Yeah
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.400]   I had I had I went to a diner this morning and had a pancakes lattice with real maple syrup and
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.160]   Although this was not my ecumenical duty. I did have bacon on the side
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.480]   I
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.360]   Am so pleased to learn this because now we can run out and get pancakes for everyone there you go
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.920]   But it pancake Tuesday is this is today happy pancake Tuesday
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.680]   The day preceding ash Wednesday the last the first day of Lent. So this is like is this like your last chance to have pancakes?
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.520]   Is that it?
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.160]   It's fat fat Tuesday
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.440]   So before you before you start making your lentin sacrifices, this is it this is this is the period in which like every McDonald's
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.840]   At least a New England will have the flavor fish sandwich on the on the specials board on Friday look at that
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.360]   in most traditions today is known for the eating of pancakes before the start of lent pancakes are eaten as they are made out of the
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.240]   main foods available sugar fat flour and eggs
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.880]   Whose consumption is traditionally restricted during the ritual fasting associated with lent so enjoy your sugar
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.200]   I believe that's that's in the New Testament the the letter from the Apostle Bubba
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.600]   To the waitress
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:48.920]   That is tomorrow you go to have more poor pancakes and I should have to ask for more butters out of the puzzle
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.200]   We have a special a special guest at studio. I'm really excited joining us Trey Radcliffe the
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.880]   esteemed world renowned
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.720]   photographer hey at from stuck in customs comms great to have you Trey
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.040]   Thanks. I am a hardcore Apple fan boy and a hardcore Apple user so I kind of had this
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.520]   Vin diagram 99% overlap
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.240]   I'll tell you how hardcore he is not only is there a Mac book in front of him and a big one at that
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.640]   He's got an iPad in his lap. Yes. Is that because I'm riding dirty down there? Okay? Never mind
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.040]   White nerdy that's what he said right he is
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.840]   At stuck in customs comm and in fact is gonna stick around and join us for Twitter photo. I'm glad about that
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.560]   Yeah, it's all day affair here and has really become
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.600]   If nothing else a master of social media for self promotion
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.280]   Well, that sounds a bit been glorious
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.040]   Salting is what it says well really I
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.880]   What I share everything I do right I share my photos. I share how I take them right I share how I blog give it all away
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.480]   I I just give all this stuff away, right and I end up just having nice things happen
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.200]   I should just say people come into my life
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.720]   You're the most generous man on the Internet is what I should say well
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.200]   I do give a ton of stuff away, but it's it's great, you know, and you're doing fine
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.320]   That's the beauty of it. Yeah, I wish the record companies pay attention to television company pay attention
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.720]   Yeah, no, there's you know
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.200]   There's a uproar about Pinterest and giving stuff away and copyrights and I say just just give it away
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.240]   Don't worry about the piracy to worry about any of that stuff. It is it's a new age
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.480]   You know that that pancake eater from zero BC said something very similar
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.040]   He said cast your bread upon the water and it will come back to you full of pancake syrup
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.320]   Or something like that. I've made not be the exact gospel. Yeah, you're off a little close somewhat
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.400]   Yeah, you got the gist of it. So we're gonna talk we have lots to talk about today
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   We good to have you. Thank you so much for being here really appreciate it
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.680]   But twice also the host of trades variety hour. I forgot to mention that which appears Monday 7 p.m. Pacific 10 p.m.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.640]   Eastern not only on Google Plus as a hangout but also on Twitter
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.720]   Yes on the network here on network. We're really thrilled to have it now. It's third week and it's just a great show. Thank you for doing it
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.500]   You had yesterday you did the space photography with the
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.760]   Astronaut we did we had a we had a very well-known
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.360]   NASA astronaut on named Ron grand and I don't know if you saw there was this time lapse that was done
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.240]   I know he did that he just kind of came up with the idea he goes no one's ever done a time lapse from space
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.320]   So he just hooked up a camera and they have Nikon D3's D3s is up there and he just shot it and released it
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.000]   And it became this huge viral thing. It was kind of his own little personal idea in in a way
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.400]   That is and I predict in the future will be as seminal as that famous big blue marble shot from Gemini
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.440]   I think it was many moons ago where it was really in some ways the first time we had seen the earth
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.560]   From outside the earth and it really I think for a lot of people was a very powerful
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.200]   Image that is often cited as you know, this is let's not forget. We're on a fragile blue planet
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.920]   This is the first, you know, this is the same thing, but but in video and it's just
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.600]   Amazing. He's scared out there. I think he's got like a he's got over a million followers on Google Plus and
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:08.480]   You know all photographers. We just dream of space. We dream of being an astronaut and this guy is like living the life
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:17.480]   This is this is actually from the ISS. So he he took stills and stitched them together and it I tell you when you get a
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:23.600]   Video like this is just an amazing look at the moon there. It's just incredible
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.960]   This is real this looks like a simulation. Yeah, this is actually
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.880]   Yeah, at the end of five and a half months anyway, I won't play the whole thing
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:38.200]   But it is it is on Vimeo and it's highly recommended time lapse from space the journey home by fragile oasis
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:44.200]   If you want to watch that so we have this is our first time gathering together
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.960]   Since Apple announced mountain lion
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.120]   Chris bring you got a briefing. I did not get a briefing, but I have been through it
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:08:00.440]   You've been to the mountain lion. I've been to the mountain lion and I've read lots of things as if we all by now
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.600]   You got a briefing though Andy didn't you?
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:10.040]   Yes, I did didn't get an advanced briefing, but like Tuesday Thursday morning. It was literally like I checked
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.960]   I woke up at 8 30 check my mail check to see what was on fire. Nothing's on fire went downstairs
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.600]   Microwaved a bowl of oatmeal came back upstairs 10 minutes later
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.720]   And I've got like 50 emails. I've got to be ready for an apple apple briefing and like 45 minutes
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:30.360]   I you know, I I was alerted on path by mg seagler saying I've been up since 5 a.m
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:37.880]   Writing about mountain lion, and I thought he was joking. I thought what no apple announced without any fanfare
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.400]   They week ahead they gave briefings to people like Walt Mossberg David pog
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.160]   John Gruber
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.740]   So they had an advanced preview and so they were able to at 6 a.m
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.520]   Eastern publish their reviews
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:09:00.000]   And then apple of course released the information there were no leaks at all it was a stunner. It was like what how that's why
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.560]   I was that's why I thought it was made up. I thought we would have heard some rumor
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.560]   Apple says now they're going to update OS 10
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.720]   Yearly this is part of a yearly cycle and it feels a little like the tiktok cycle
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.200]   They're doing with the iPhone and they did kind of with leopard snow leopard
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:21.200]   Snow leopard is a minor upgrade on leopard then lion big upgrade and this is mountain lion is kind of the snow leopard
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.640]   Would you say that's true Andy or is this a is this a full-blown OS upgrade?
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.840]   I'm not sure that I would call it really a full-blown upgrade
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.320]   There are certainly a lot new features
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.880]   But the most significant feature of them all is just the palpable shift in philosophy
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:45.920]   That if lion was a nod towards well, let's look let's turn our attention back to the mat back to the Mac OS
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.720]   Let's make sure that we're giving it exactly the same amount of features and the same amount of thought as we've been giving iOS
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.720]   Cuz we've been a little bit focused on that for a couple years
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:10:01.560]   This is much more of a nod towards no, we've decided that we need to bring the iOS experience to the desktop experience
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.040]   Not because not only not only do they do simple things like saying well
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.120]   Let's make sure that the address book and the the calendar have the exact same names for one app or the other that's simple
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:15.360]   Let's make sure let's bring the messages app from the Iowa from iOS to the Mac list
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.560]   Let's stop calling it. I chat and having separate apps or separate things
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.520]   That's also simple
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:26.320]   But when you take a look at the fact that when they brought the reminders app and the notes app from iOS to the desktop
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:34.200]   They didn't do any change whatsoever to the UI even though not only we talked about a desktop machine in which I've got a keyboard
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.840]   I've got a mouse. I've got a big screen
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.760]   But also the idea that when I'm at my desktop
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:44.040]   I'm sitting there for three or four hours working working working working working on huge projects on an iPad
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.160]   The reason why those interfaces are simple so simple
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.520]   I was not just just because it's a smaller screen and you've got the simple touch interface
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.840]   But because you're not sitting there for hours and hours
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.320]   You really are there just to get one of two things done and then move on
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.240]   So that's sort of an interesting move
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:03.200]   I thought that especially something like the to-do list of the reminders app that it's just simply one window list detail
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.120]   Boom done shipping so it sounds like you might disagree with this premise
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.400]   I'm not sure that I disagree if it's true again
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.000]   This is a speculation on my part if it's true that Apple is going to
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.240]   Bring most of the sensibility of iOS to the desktop
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:24.080]   And I would define that as make the user experience as clean and simple and reliable as possible
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:30.120]   Even if doing so means that you limit what this operating system can accomplish then yes
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.640]   I think that's a bad idea
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:36.920]   I think I think what I think when I said my in my piece on last week that
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:45.360]   The problem is that they didn't really decide how to make a version of these that these iOS apps that would maximize the experience
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.320]   Because the whole success of the iPad was based on yes
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:53.280]   We had a mail app that was that looked very very familiar to users of the existing Mac OS mail app
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:59.320]   But they really thought out well what what doesn't imply that people are accessing mail via a tablet device
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.800]   What do we have to what what mindset are they in so that's the reason why the iPad was so successful with Windows
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   They just decided what we'll take the exact same thing we have on Windows just make it into a new form factor
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:14.560]   That's why they failed so that's why I think they made some curious choices here that I don't fully understand
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.200]   I suspect that when the when the final thing really ships later this summer
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:26.080]   We'll see more of the puzzle emerge and in 2013 is when we'll really see as Apple full bore committed to
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:33.480]   For I won't I won't say dumbing down the Mac OS but at least focusing it towards the iOS sort of consumer market
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.400]   Let's just say it that way because there are benefits to the iOS approach. That's when we'll really figure out what they're up to here for now
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.640]   Lots of things I like about it
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.000]   But there's I might to do a list of things to worry about for the next three years
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.720]   Just got another couple items added to it. You agree Chris? I
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.600]   think what Apple is trying to present is a
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.320]   unified interface with the idea that
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:59.120]   Regardless of whether I'm looking at this device or this device or this device
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.880]   I'm seeing these are just Windows on my data, right?
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.840]   So when you and that's where they will succeed with iCloud
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.000]   I mean I think the iCloud integration is very important and that's that's the back end for what you just described
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.960]   Yeah, and that's ultimately what it is because you're looking into the cloud and and you're either looking on a small medium or large screen
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.960]   but I'm with Andy that the
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:23.480]   That each requires a somewhat different interface and that to unify the interface perhaps isn't the best window onto the iCloud
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:29.120]   I would I would agree with that as a longtime Mac user. I was speaking at a uses group this week
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.760]   Were different perhaps exactly because I was talking I was showing some people
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.160]   Launchpad the other day and I said I don't get the sense of this at all
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.320]   I understand lights on here, right? But I have no idea why they would put it on here
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.360]   Because there are so many better ways to use it every time I download an app from the Mac App Store
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.280]   It throws it in the launchpad
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.600]   It forces me to look at launchpad fortunately
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:55.320]   It's one keystroke away from disappearing, but I don't understand it well the difference is that I then somebody raised their hand
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.680]   And she said I love yeah launchpad. I said okay. Where did you start with this?
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.360]   Did you start with the iOS or did you start with I said I started with my iPhone and I love it that
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:10.720]   I know exactly what's gonna happen on my Mac because it's the same interface and I think that's where Apple's going and in true numbers
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.840]   There are far more iOS users than there are desktop. Indeed. They are I mean it we would in the past
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.640]   We would say oh well the iOS is the gateway drawn to the Mac and now it's just
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:26.160]   Everybody's on iOS and they go okay. Well this this Mac's thing seems pretty cool to an oh look
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.200]   I'm comfortable because yeah here I am how do you trade it?
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.840]   Have you played much with what's in Mountain?
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:37.240]   You probably haven't put it on your system because you actually do work. I've been I've been watching all the coverage of this thing
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:43.000]   Yeah, and well what's interesting to me just kind of taking the whole tech press meta thing looking at it
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.840]   You know we're such different people than normal user
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:51.160]   Yeah, but I so I went to tech meme and I started reading about oh what's what's coming in the new OS and I start I read
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.400]   10 minutes 15 minutes to the thought oh well
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:59.640]   I'll just go to the Apple website and then they had a full video there that shows exactly everything and then I thought okay
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.760]   Well, you know, why did I just waste 15 minutes?
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.920]   It's different now because it's almost like we don't need the press to know what Apple is doing
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:11.240]   I have like a direct relationship with Apple right I feel close to Apple I
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.440]   Love that idea by the way
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:19.080]   I go to their website and see what they have like like any tech company wants to disintermediate its message to the populace
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:23.360]   It would like to talk to right then what happens is like Andy's article whichever one should read it's great
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.760]   Andy and other tech writers they almost become
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:33.200]   It's almost like Apple is this super organism. That's that's spitting out these semi-sentient
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.040]   Devices right and he's like
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:43.240]   Analyzing them philosophically like Attenborough looking at birds and paradise like look how this thing behaves in the wild
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:48.840]   Let's let's analyze it in a certain way and so for a while becoming a very interesting for a minute
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.760]   I thought you were gonna call them a Dickey bird sitting a
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:58.120]   Sim by out sitting on the back of the apple rhinoceros pecking off parasites, but no no I like the rich in that burrow
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.680]   It's much better. I'm sure Andy prefers that as well. I'll be I'll be compared to that barrel
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:07.480]   We're glossing we're glossing what Apple is delivering well
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:13.440]   What I guess this is this is only came to me this morning as I was really thinking this over that if there's a mistake
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.760]   That's that Apple's making here
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:21.400]   It's in thinking that iOS is just as good at the job of being a computer as anything else is out there
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:28.560]   I liken it to having a two car garage and the my iPad is the electric the full-on plug electric car
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:34.840]   The other car in the garage is the as the admit is the hybrid the SUV vehicle that runs on gas
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:41.040]   It's I love the electric car. It's modern. It's wonderful. It's where things are going but it has a range of 70 miles period
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:47.320]   Which means that it's fine for lots of things, but I couldn't really use it as a practical car if I did not have a really
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.480]   gas a 400 mile
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.040]   Full capacity range car that I could rely on for the stuff when I really need
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:17:00.920]   Transportation like that. So I think that yes, there's a generation of people who are coming in to Mac OS from iOS
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:08.480]   But there's still the majority of computer uses that it's that defined a desktop computer to find a laptop as a machine with no limitations
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.480]   It's not a boutique operating system no matter what I want to do with this device
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.560]   I can get this project done in this computer
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:20.120]   So I would hate it if we thought we look back two years from now and Apple said no, we're okay with Mac OS being the
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:25.080]   Not being again the boutique operating system where if you really want to get stuff done
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.160]   Well, you're gonna have to go to Windows
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.080]   But if you're okay with a subset of things if you really only deal with maybe 10 or 20 files at a time
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:36.320]   If you never have to have more than two or three windows open at a time and you never own more than nine or ten apps
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.280]   That you really use on a day-to-day basis. I could have Mac. It's fine. It's only you're only paying $400 extra
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.000]   But it's fine. It's fine and I share I share exactly that concern in fact
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.160]   And I look at things and it's completely reading tea leaves or crumb on ology
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.960]   But I look at things like changing the about box on
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:56.000]   Mountain Lion from saying Mac OS 10 to OS 10
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.920]   That's how I that was my joke at the beginning of the show and that is the kind of thing that does worry me
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:07.840]   Because it's it just as Apple dropped the word computers from its cut corporate name. It is in a way a signal
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.880]   It's not certainly it has no functional purpose, but as a signal saying hey guys
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.920]   It isn't really Mac anymore. Are we are we gonna have to change our name to break weekly? I mean?
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:25.160]   Well, we forget that the iPhone 1.0 ran Mac ran OS 10. That's what they said. I still
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:30.840]   Question I've I've at the time I was talking to not only like executives at Apple, but also engineers
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:36.560]   It's it's OS 10 with everything that is irrelevant for phone ripped out and and new stuff
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:42.880]   That's still the case with iOS. What'd you say? I believe it's I have not heard or been told anything that would contradict that
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.920]   I mean now we're talking we're talking about a core kernel it
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:51.280]   We're talking about the the idea of two buildings being built on the same foundations
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.520]   You then turn one into a pool house you turn another into a four-story abode
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.920]   But the principal is basically the same so maybe all there's simply doing a saying well part of Apple's
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:06.520]   Personality and strength is that they always underscore the compatibility of all their devices that they're developing
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:12.920]   a big ball of to a ball of ideas a big ball of features that they can then articulate an implement and all kinds of different devices
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:18.120]   So it's very consistent on that basis for them to say let's underscore the fact that all of our devices are running the same
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:23.400]   Core operating system and then we build it out differently depending on what kind of device this user wants to use
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:29.120]   Well, let's go one by one if you don't mind through the new features
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:35.320]   So we could talk a little bit about it just and I know that everybody like Trey has already kind of looked at the Apple site and read all
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.320]   The articles so I don't want to I don't want to rehash anything
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:44.560]   But what I'd like to do is get your thoughts on these features. Let's start with gatekeeper, which is a significant feature
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.560]   This is a security update
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.560]   to OS 10
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:55.920]   That I think was is certainly going to put it way ahead of any other operating system in terms of pure security
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.800]   But does raise some questions
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.600]   So one of the features of gatekeeper is the user has three choices about apps
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:09.320]   You can you can actually there's a setting on the on the Mac that says I will only allow apps from the app store
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:15.680]   Right, there's a middle ground that says I will only allow apps that are signed by Apple whether from the app store or elsewhere
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.720]   And a third setting that is kind of the like come and get me hacker setting
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:24.160]   Which is anywhere anytime which is actually how it is right now on a Macintosh
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:29.760]   Is that a signal is that the first is that the camel's nose
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:35.440]   Under the tent beginning of Apple moving people away from third-party distribution
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.160]   And you know I'm a little concerned about it when I first heard about gatekeeper
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.160]   But then when I saw the flexibility
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:47.400]   That's built in and then also some reports from developers who've spoken with Apple and Apple has saying no
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.920]   No, really we we like third-party developers
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.160]   We want you to keep developing for us
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:58.360]   We don't need you to be in the app store because they're clearly things that can't be in there that talk to certain elements of the operating system
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:03.480]   That the app store won't allow and those utilities can't go away. We need them. They're finally you can't do third
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:08.040]   You can't do a demos you can't do betas right you can't do open source
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.160]   Some say because the license agreement is at odds with the GPL right?
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:17.040]   And so we certainly want those and they can't open source. I mean it would just be
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:23.880]   Tragic if I don't know where to just say I'm sorry. No open source for you anymore. You have to go to the app store
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:30.280]   It would upset a lot of long time now with the default setting will be when when mountain lion ships
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.240]   They have a set middle setting is it? Yeah, that's exactly right
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:41.040]   And that seems like a good setting actually because it will give you a lot of the security of only having in the app store because presumably a hacker is
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.640]   Not gonna take the trouble of going to Apple and saying hey, I'd like a certificate, please
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:52.200]   And if he does we'll get him I do think gatekeepers are really positive step especially because of this this middle setting that we're talking about
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:59.680]   Apple is giving developers. We will give you so much of the benefits that consumers want about being able to trust the absence they download
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:05.760]   And the idea that this certification is not even an app certification Apple will not even look at the content of this app
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:10.560]   So long as you've proven as a developer so long as you've proven your identity to Apple
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:14.760]   So that there's a way that we can trace back any nasty piece of software to the source
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:20.680]   That's all they care about and at that point you're free to do pretty much whatever you want now. There are a couple of technical
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.960]   interesting
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.640]   things bits
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:31.400]   Where one of the things that gatekeeper protect looks for is to make sure that the app as presented has not been modified in any way
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:37.060]   So that if let's say someone a third party comes in and decides to inject code into Microsoft Word so that it does
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.480]   Nasty things to protect against that that's very very sensible
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:44.880]   But some developers were talking to me about how they have certain features of their software the rely
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:52.440]   For instance on compiled Apple scripts to tell so that they're essentially they're modifying their own codes to to get certain features enabled
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:57.880]   And they don't know yet if those features will still work under under gatekeeper certification
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.880]   Or if they're gonna have to find another way around it or if they're gonna have to go without
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.840]   Certification of any kind but on the whole yeah, they've been talking to developers for a long time about this
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:10.000]   I really think this is a way to talk about the camels nose under the tent
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:17.680]   I really think this is a tent by Apple to get more developers into the tent because if you can't develop an app under the app store
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:26.360]   Guidelines Apple at least wants to give you certain features and certain enhancements that you can easily implement and can easily deal with so
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:34.760]   That's a good step. I think and and how is this tied Chris to the requirement Apple announced a few months ago that developers
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.920]   Permissions for their app and you know check those
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.120]   Boxes in the manifest saying well, I'm gonna need to be able to read read a file right of file
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:48.760]   Is that tied the gatekeeper or is that a separate? I believe that's a separate thing
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:54.400]   It's all part of their sandboxing effort. I think at one time Apple was saying, you know everything has to run like on the iOS
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.720]   It's own little container. You may not talk to other things and developers went nuts
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.600]   We can't we got it right to the file system right we have to go to the file system
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:09.560]   And we need to talk to other applications because clearly Apple your software does that so we should be allowed to do the same thing
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.040]   So I think this was apples after sale. Okay, tell us what you need and we'll
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:19.160]   Mark it off on the menu and we'll see about and presumably that sets up a structure for Apple to notify the user
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:24.120]   These are the permissions that this just as Android does right now apple does not do an iOS
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:28.080]   Right. This is what the application wants to do is that you should know
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.560]   Yeah, but I have to wonder why level they're gonna do that. I mean my mother if she gets a notice saying yeah
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:37.280]   Yeah, it wants to do this this this and this she's gonna go I have no idea what that is I also
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:43.120]   I'm a little concerned, you know, certainly this will make it much more secure
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.640]   There's no there's no question about that and sandboxing is a good thing
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.440]   But Apple has also built into mountain lion this new feature called sheets
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:56.920]   Which is very much like the sharing capability in iOS where you can't actually pass
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:02.920]   You can't save to the file system and then open an arbitrary program can open it from a file system
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:10.040]   So I use let's say pages to create a word processing document save it and then I open it with another application say preview
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:14.600]   You can't do that in iOS you have to open
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:20.220]   You know save into that app from the original app and that capability is going to be in mountain lion
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.960]   I I they're not enforcing it
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:27.120]   But I'm wondering if that's a first step towards eliminating a file system. Oh, I hope not
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.880]   I mean because they do it on iOS and you have to use it
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.600]   You know as somebody coming from the Mac I don't want to do that
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.400]   I would love it if I could have this app talk to that app and not have to say no
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.840]   No, actually I want you to open in over here
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.080]   There's some advantage a tray in your workflow for instance
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:50.160]   You use Photoshop and photomatics and the ability to say send this to Photoshop via you know that that's a nice workflow
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.120]   Well, but I think there's you use bridge for that reason right there's yeah
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.160]   That's why I use bridge and I use so many tools
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.560]   But I think there's you know so many different kinds of Apple users nowadays
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.280]   There's a lot of just consumers where these sheets are just fine
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.360]   I want you to represent the pro user because that's really what you are as a pro
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:10.280]   You someone that creates a lot not just a light creative person that occasionally does a document or something
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:15.240]   But like it's a serious creative person right you've got to have access to a massive file structure
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:19.320]   I don't see that going away because you have temporary files you have permanent files
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.320]   You have movie files over here
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.080]   You've got source files and you need to keep this orchestra of
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:32.880]   Digital files both in your head and on your computer because it's the creative person that then uses these tools to synthesize
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:37.600]   That's your power something final. That's your artist's palette right a little little cyan or you know
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.520]   That's my Bob Ross palette. Yeah, you know and I don't just want a little color picker
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:48.680]   I need the full palette is there anywhere in your brain a little tiny smidge and a fear that Apple doesn't really care about pro users
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.280]   I mean I look at what they're doing with final cut
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.000]   Which is essentially moving into the app store making it an app
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   I look at how they're treating pro users kind of in general
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.680]   Does there a smidgen of worry? No, not really because the people at Apple
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:09.240]   Themselves are very creative and they're also using a their profile structure. They're doing a lot of programming
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.560]   They're synthesizing many different digital files together
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:15.440]   So they understand the computer as a workhorse to create something big
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.760]   They understand the truck thing
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.360]   Yeah, and they are also want to build better trucks for themselves
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:27.160]   Because you know they don't want to use this, you know a little Macbook air to develop the next OS or to develop the next version of aperture
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:30.880]   Or you know, there's are you making fun of my air? No, I think it's very delicate
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:42.400]   This is interesting that the that the inside Apple there would be a rebellion if Apple abandoned the pro user
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.920]   I would agree with that
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.840]   Because yeah, they they eat their own dog food
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:53.520]   They use their own tools and they would never deny permissions to the outside world that they don't rely on themselves
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:28:00.200]   I know if one manager inside of Apple that has ensured the survivability of his product by making sure that he
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.400]   Not he cares he cares about the needs of the consumer
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:09.640]   But he also realizes that the more he can help co-workers at Apple rely and use his product every single day
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:14.320]   The harder it's going to be for any manager inside Apple to kill his product because no no no
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.840]   We can't we can't get we can't lose this product because I use it every day to get my schedules done and
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:24.240]   But really it is it is a question of how do you want to define a computer?
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:30.760]   I mean it's easy to say that it's okay to drop for instance the Mac Pro line because oh for God's sakes
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:35.840]   We got so much so much of what almost everybody would want a Mac Pro for is now a core feature the iMac
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.240]   We can lose that it's maybe almost everybody that makes me nervous that almost right well
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:47.920]   See also because it's not just the there's this mythical because we're almost as guardian as guardian user who has the golden shield and the
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.200]   Send the Uru hammer that that that moves mountains with their Mac
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.360]   But they're also the people who?
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:57.040]   80% of the time basic iOS features will work just fine
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:04.400]   But then there are these little instances instances in which they want to do something that they see happening every single day on windows
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:09.200]   But they can't do it here because that's been sandboxed out or because there's a limitation
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.720]   One of the things I singled out was sharing sheets as a really cool idea
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.960]   On on the desktop because it's so useful on on ios
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:22.960]   But I wish that it were as useful as windows 8 on the table that I have upstairs
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.400]   In that so many times like i'll do a screenshot or i'll
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.240]   Import an image that I want to edit in photoshop or any other app
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:34.480]   And I always have to do do a save as in this in this thing tab over to the new
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:38.640]   Open up or do a copy and paste and there are at least three or four steps to get that in
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.880]   Windows 8 I can simply be in my my camera capture app or my twitter app
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.360]   Or just i'm just looking at this picture and say please send this directly into photoshop express
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:51.840]   And then suddenly i have a new document in photoshop express where that thing is ready for editing. That's cool
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.920]   That's like two taps for things I want to do
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.680]   So I would hate to if it's if apple doesn't do that because they couldn't imagine it
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:04.800]   That's one thing if you can't do that on an apple on a mac because apple decided that community apps cannot communicate that way
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.600]   That's a pro feature that people are not really going to be interested in using
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.160]   Oh, man, that's bad. I'm gonna let me make a proposition to see what you guys think
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.640]   I think it is possible for apple to create and certainly apple's messaging is aimed at consumers
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.320]   It's aimed at the vast
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.760]   98 percent
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:26.080]   uh to create a desktop operating system that is as comfortable as easy as friendly as ios is
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:31.760]   Comports itself as ios so that it's a very easy move and still preserves
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:39.200]   All the unders you know, see i i know that i am in the 1% i like automator i like the services menu
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.120]   i like you know i like watch folders i you know and
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:50.800]   Is it possible it might be my proposition that apple in their messaging is not maybe they're going to wink and nudge at the pro user like tray
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.520]   But most of the time they're going to message consumers, but deep down
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:59.440]   They're going to continue to preserve those pro features forever and ever is that does that seem doable
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.720]   It doesn't seem to cost them anything more to keep those kind of features and there's a huge benefit to do so
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:13.120]   They can put a sheen over the top right people like you know, my parents who have awful messy desktops and can ever find a desktop
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:17.840]   It drives my jennifer crazy when i close everyone's in a while
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.960]   She's now using an ipad, but when she was still using a notebook
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:26.320]   I she'd have 40 windows open and never close an app and i closed all the apps in the windows
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.560]   She said what's that under there? I said well, that's the desktop. What are those those are icons?
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:35.120]   She doesn't want that she's much happier on ios and she's the 99
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.320]   Yeah, well, that's why i think that i'm sorry. I'm sorry
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:44.320]   Uh, that's just the big part of the market right they have to do that sweet spot too. It's a sweet spot and
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.960]   You know, I don't think they're going to abandon us. I have faith in in apple
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:55.520]   And i also think apple has a real advantage that no other company has i'm not just talking about the hundred billion dollars either
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:02.000]   Uh, the fact that they do if they were ever tempted to say well, we need to dumb down the macos because consumers want something simpler
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.600]   They still do have
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:10.080]   They can send a clear message that says that there are people who just wanted to attend to the five hours of computing and let's assume that
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:15.520]   Email in the web and office or on and photo editing and and uh chat
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.920]   All start with letter r i'm regretting that choice
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.320]   Almost the minute that i said that to start the sentence
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.920]   Uh, if people just want a basic machine that does just those those functions great
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.360]   We have this thing called ios. We have this thing called the ipad. It'll work just great
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.440]   We can even sell you a $50
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.640]   A $60 keyboard that will be just as good as the keyboard you type on every day
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.680]   You don't even need it
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:38.560]   We're asked if people who have a more conventional eight hour a day sitting at a desk getting stuff done
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.160]   Operation and this does not necessarily define the pro user
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.320]   Defines the people who just has a job has a job to do and just needs to get it done efficiently
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.760]   We have the macos so that's why I really hope that they were too
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.800]   Although it makes sense for them to cause some features to cross over
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.880]   It makes sense for them to be have a consistent interface from one to the other
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:04.480]   It's also just as useful and just as profitable to make sure there is that clear line between these two products
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.680]   You agree? I do I do I think that
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:13.360]   To pull out the rug from under pro users would be a horrendous mistake in it and it's andi I think
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.920]   Observes and tre as well
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:22.960]   The apple employees are pro users ideal with the people in the in the music area a lot with logic and
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:28.640]   You know, they can't take that stuff away. They have a serious investment in that technology
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.520]   A lot of people are using it now
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.760]   And the same with final cut even though a lot of the pro users are upset about
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.800]   Final cut pro x
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.840]   With given the improvements that they've made in the last iteration
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:47.520]   They're you can see that they're trying instead of just saying forget it. We're just not interested now
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.000]   It's prosumer and in fact, they've always had things like simple finder
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.920]   But the problem with simple finders you had either or you couldn't be a pro user and use simple finder
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.240]   So I kind of I hope that they can
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:01.920]   That they can do this and and give andi his his sheets and his file
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.520]   So I think what we would really like is and it will never ever happen
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:09.760]   But for the 1% they'd have a pro switch in system preferences
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:15.520]   Where you just know and you have to sign a note that says and and a certificate and register with them and say actually
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.960]   I do know what i'm doing
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.320]   Thank you very much flip it on and suddenly all this stuff comes back
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:26.880]   You lose that funky looking calendar interface and an address book and everything is in stark
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.040]   I hate that what do they call that?
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:34.160]   Curt neurocatonic or whatever it is that where you get stitching and all that cool. That's called tuck and roll
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.240]   I hate it
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:40.000]   But I guess we're gonna get it. Uh, you're right the pro switch should turn that off shouldn't it?
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.080]   It should really I mean what they want to do is you kind of bring it back down to like
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.560]   Skill morphic. Thank you radius
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:53.200]   Actually, I mean apple kind of already has that here if they could it wouldn't be so it seems thematically so easy to have
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.960]   uh
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.720]   Given that they're
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:00.080]   Highlighting the need to have full screen versions of apps
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.320]   What if they're a way to simply tell them back by the way i'm a low impact user
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:10.640]   Please buy default just uh boot up and give me into into launchpad when you launch apps put me in a full screen mode
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:16.000]   Uh to do as much as you can to remove as much clutter as can make that an option and not simply
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.480]   Not simply the way that you have to adjust adjust yourself for working with a mac
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.720]   Right because you can go back to
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.080]   You can turn off mostly settings and that was what apple was saying to
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:30.400]   Align users who were upset so now what you can just turn all these things off
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.760]   But then you have to spend half an hour finding out where they are to turn them off
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:38.720]   And it would be great to have just the big red switch. It's like there's an opportunity for a third party developer
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:44.320]   I think the next version of onyx should have a a pro button pro button and just flipping all this stuff
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:49.280]   Except except we just taught you we're just now we're talking about an app that talks and talks to and controls other apps
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.280]   Oh, yeah, not allowed
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:56.640]   Not allowed by the way. I do not like this new mountain lion logo. It reminds me of a vindictive old girlfriend
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:03.120]   She doesn't look happy. No, she's like install me. Yeah
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:09.760]   Now now I think we can recontextualize this for you a tray. I think that that is a sultry
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.480]   Cougar look she's a cougar
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.680]   She's saying hey big boy
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:20.560]   I like you. I hope you like mountain lions
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:32.080]   No, no, that didn't help no that made it more creepy. Come here. Trey. Look into my eyes
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.120]   To eat you
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.640]   That that that
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.120]   I didn't realize that you were living in such a desperate housewife
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:45.920]   Look Trey follow my eyes look into my eyes deep a tray deeper
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:51.680]   Come close a sick and tired of having all these housewives staring at but every time he does food shopping
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:56.640]   I tell you I could tell you it's not a piece. Not easy. Is it a time for an ad? Yes, it is
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.760]   Yeah, kitty kitty kitty. You've heard that there's a
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:03.440]   Thesis I think is brilliant before we go into this ad
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.240]   Who is it that's doing the research?
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:12.880]   Into this parasite that that is the cats that's toxoplasmosis comes from it. It comes from handling cat litter
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:20.080]   Uh, and it is a parasite that has a very interesting cycle. It is born into where it is carried by the cat
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:25.120]   Big cats and small but requires a host to breed
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.920]   And so what happens is the cats poop it out
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:31.920]   Something eats it and then the cat eats the thing that ate it
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:38.400]   So, uh, then this is gone on this is actually a fascinating parasitic story. There's a guy who has the thesis that
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:44.240]   These these parasites because they get into human brains from toxoplasmosis is a human
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.800]   We we can be carriers of this
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:51.760]   Parasite, uh, and that he believes that is the reason that some people are risk takers
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:58.480]   There is a whole behavioral change that occurs in the brain neurologically from the presence of this parasite
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.480]   I'll see if I can find this research. It's it's fascinating. It makes them think different
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.120]   It makes them think different and
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.960]   Um, are you saying that steve jobs ate cat poop?
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:14.640]   I don't know i'm just saying that from this tech you don't have to eat it if you keen if you clean a kitty litter
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.080]   You can get it and and it's actually it's a serious thing that people do have
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:22.880]   It's not a good thing to get it, but the thesis is that this is why there are cat ladies
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:30.560]   That this is why people take risks because the parasite in your brain has one goal to get you eaten by a cat
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.320]   Really because it cannot continue its cycle
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.680]   Ah
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.960]   And so in order for its breeding cycle to continue the cat has to poop it out
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.800]   You have to eat it it breeds in your brain and the cat has to eat you so that it can continue the cycle
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:46.160]   It did look at this parasite has been with us for millions of years
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:51.520]   It's working just got to say so you're saying that oh, s look at leaven is going to be
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:56.880]   Flat closer tray closer look into my eyes
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.520]   Hey
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:03.440]   Days i'm actually afraid to open my inbox to find out which of my friends have been eaten by cats today
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:11.920]   Well, it doesn't apparently no longer works, but uh, but the parasite doesn't know that because it's you know, it's just pure biology
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.240]   i'm gonna look this up while we talk a little bit about
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:19.520]   A brand new advertiser can i can i introduce you to somebody brand new and try you're gonna be interested in this

[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.760]   Or maybe a time lapse of the tokyo skyline. We we gotta have that
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.080]   Why not an aerial view of la
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:06.640]   Audio of a ticking bomb or a music background for your next viral video so you don't get pulled out off youtube
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.800]   um
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.760]   Images of palm trees penguins and pandas it's all there at pond five dot com
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:19.200]   So here's the deal for you if you're looking for media if you go to pond five
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.400]   And uh figure out what you want
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:26.800]   25 off your purchase this month when you use the twit code twit 25
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:31.440]   Not mac break. It's twit twit twit twit twit the number two and the number five 25
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.600]   off
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.880]   And for artists you might consider this you get to set your own price
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:43.200]   And receive industry leading royalties on every sale these you're going to make the best money ever from this
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.960]   And uh, and you set your own price. So you get to determine how much you make
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.680]   Uh, this is something for media makers. I think you should check out as well p o nd five
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:58.240]   These guys, um, I think are lesser known than some of the other like you were mentioning uh, the g word
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:03.040]   Geddy. Yeah, yeah, I'm not a fan. No, geddy. No, these guys
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.720]   By artists for artists and I think this is really certainly worth checking
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:10.240]   I have a nice selection there. They really do look at all the cassette labels you can get
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:15.840]   Pond five the world stock media marketplace brand new we welcome them to mac break weekly
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:20.560]   Uh, they came to you because they know you are creators and this is a great place for you as well
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:24.720]   License once used forever wherever whenever you never have to worry about
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:30.160]   Repeating royalties and don't forget to use the offer code twit 25 to save yourself 25
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:37.840]   Uh, let's talk about iCloud. That's the chat room is saying are you going to talk about iCloud? Are you going to talk about iCloud?
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:44.720]   Um, I think this is the biggest success at least in my mind of mountain lion is is finally the integration in die cloud
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.800]   Maybe make iCloud useful
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:51.120]   Yeah, well, buddy. Yeah putting documents there instead of having to
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.360]   And it's automatic. Yeah from the mac is is is a great idea because
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:02.400]   We thought that was going to happen in lion. It seemed like yeah, we're gonna get they said that didn't they they kind of said that and then it turns out
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.800]   you could do it by
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:10.240]   Messing around with with folders and things, but it never worked very well in apple said we don't officially support this
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:15.920]   So now the idea and again, I think that goes back to the single window into your data
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.640]   Is that when you open a save dialog box?
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.920]   You have the option now to go directly to iCloud is it just a checkmark?
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:28.240]   I think it I was it just I think it's part of a split screen that you could you say it's you can go local or you can go
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.240]   So I could choose one of the other
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:35.360]   The other thing I like is that if you modify that document now on your iPhone or iPad
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.440]   It's automatically updated
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:42.560]   Not just in the cloud, but even if you have like pages open on your desktop and then you work on the document here
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.200]   You can watch the changes happen on your desktop
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:53.680]   As you can with thing like photo stream and yeah, I mean that's what we've already seen this working in other places when it works properly
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:57.520]   And that's right notes and mail and that sort of thing, but now if it actually works with documents
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.960]   My concern is about the size of the documents is how
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.840]   Yes, you can do this. So you get five gigs
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:07.120]   How quickly do we go through five gigs? Is that the question?
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:12.320]   Yeah, because if you're if you're using something other than say a pages document or a numbers document
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:18.480]   I mean even keynote presentations if you really pack them with media can get pretty big
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:21.040]   Yeah, that's a good point five gigs
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:25.040]   It could be five speeches that I'd be done right and I mean that's fine
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:30.240]   If I want to work with I work all the time, but I use a lot of other applications and some of them produce large documents. So
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:37.360]   But I think this is this is one area in which apple specifically saying that this isn't for this isn't a feature for
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:42.400]   Every single document you ever use or your ever own it really is for the stuff that you're using this right now
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.160]   It's what I'm working on today. Yeah, and that's really I don't think that's a dumbing down of anything
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:51.040]   I just think that there's a way that you have you have to rationally manage a cloud storage system like this
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:57.920]   You can either have a system like dropbox where you are not improving it beyond just simply having a folder of attached network storage
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:03.440]   That's shared between multiple devices if you really want something that is as great as documents in the cloud
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:07.600]   And I'm with you guys it's when when I first when I first got it up and running last year
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.640]   I would just have no joke. I would have like the iPhone like a copy of
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:18.400]   Pages on little stand just so that as I'm typing and on the iPad when I take my hands off the keyboard
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:24.400]   I look over to the iPhone and I see this little dog here appear in the document on the iPhone. Oh, it's updating. It's updating. Yeah
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:29.760]   Well, here's a cool thing about it. Do you use photo stream tray at all or do you turn that off?
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:35.840]   I don't I don't use that but here's an unexpected thing about iCloud that we we discovered so I'm also a developer, right?
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:37.840]   We make apps and
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:42.720]   Stuck in customs app is incredible and you've got this new app on the iPad stuck on earth. Yes
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:46.240]   So I don't mind plugging that because it's a free app. Oh, it's no ads or anything. Love it
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.720]   So stuck on earth, this was interesting because it's an iPad app right now, right?
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:56.400]   And it got rejected last time we submitted because we used to you can make your own trips and you save trips
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:01.040]   We used to save them to the iPad and they rejected it said no you have to save stuff to the cloud now
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:04.080]   And I was a little bit annoyed. I thought oh, well, why does it matter?
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.520]   You know why but now that the iCloud is going everywhere
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:13.680]   We are taking our app and we're making a Mac version of it, right?
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:17.120]   And so now you're that sweet that you create on your iPad
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:21.040]   You can also pull it into the Mac app and the Mac app we could do so much more with right?
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.960]   So we have an iPhone iPad and Mac app and there's more and more functionality
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:29.200]   As you go up the food chain, but they have access to the same document layer
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:33.680]   And that's really really cool from a developer standpoint and from a user standpoint
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:37.280]   I think there was also an issue. I may be wrong on this but there because
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.680]   they
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:45.120]   Save to clean up on the iOS 5 to clean up they would clean up cash where people were saving data in the cash
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:48.880]   And you would lose date. I think I remember the people were starting to lose data
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:54.080]   Uh that they had thought they had saved on their iPad because there wasn't really a place to save it
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.600]   There's like two places
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:47:00.800]   There's a temporary place in a cash and and so I think that that's also a response to the fact that hey, by the way
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:06.240]   We're not going to guarantee your data stays so you better save it in the cloud because we're making room on the iPad now
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.240]   But I do I agree that's a great
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.560]   Now you've got round tripping kind of just yeah
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:15.440]   And it gives us a lot more ideas right because before you're just kind of dealing with this one
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.880]   Unit right and if you if you have a good app
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:24.960]   It's a good app on every device and it allowed developers to be very creative and add more and more functionality
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:30.960]   And it just makes sense right as you know apple puts things into place
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:36.320]   And then developers can get very creative about how to use these new tools and new capabilities
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:40.880]   And I think that this is just the beginning. We're going to see some really cool
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:44.880]   Developers do some awesome stuff interesting. That's a very interesting perspective
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:49.280]   Yeah, I cloud really is like an element that's in the atmosphere
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:54.160]   It's not a feature. It's just something that will cause certain organisms to grow in new and unexpected ways
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.000]   uh, and
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.360]   We touched a second about uh, the problems of sandboxing earlier
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:02.080]   And there are a lot of developers who are really up in air because
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.160]   Sandboxing really does define what a nap can do and how it can behave
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:11.040]   And that is a legitimate problem, especially when you're dealing with an app that's five or six seven
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:14.240]   Sometimes ten sometimes fifteen years old and it's always
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:21.040]   Trusted the ability to do pretty much whatever it wants or behave in a way that has always worked fine in previous versions of the macos
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:26.320]   But the flip side of that is that if you are just getting into mac development or ios development
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.720]   You're starting from zero. You're rewriting from scratch
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:33.600]   I mean trays right you have so many resources that really enable so many features that
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:38.560]   uh, just three years ago would have been well that that would be a cool idea to have just
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:46.080]   Esoteric syncing of anything across any platform, but we really don't want to spend eight months and god knows how much much how much money implementing this
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:51.840]   Now it's just simply okay. We'll just read this document that teaches us how to use iCloud and now we can pretty much do whatever we want
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.960]   Uh messages is here and you can use it
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:58.800]   Uh, if you are using lie and you have to be using lie and you can download the beta
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:04.800]   although if you uh others, I guess one of the max sites probably mac rumors has looked into the
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:11.600]   Strings and the resources and it does say you can't use this anymore because you haven't upgraded to yeah mountain line
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:17.440]   So you get the beta until mountain line comes out. I was told that explicitly. Yeah, okay. So we know
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:22.160]   Um, I like it. It's cross platform. It's kind of like icloud in the sense that
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:27.520]   You can have your messages delivered to all your devices ipad iphone and desktop
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:35.120]   Uh, it's and as people are now immediately by the way if you message me just be where your your phone number or email address will be seen on the screen
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:40.400]   You want me to show yours? I was worried about it. I don't think there's anything uh too personal here
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:44.640]   Okay, uh, I was just being thank you for being careful
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:48.400]   I don't know. I mean I just know you never know
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:54.960]   I was just gonna play a little but I like I actually uh, I kind of like this it has built in um, uh video
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:58.800]   So I can you know if for instance this person is a facetime user
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:03.360]   So I see a little camera showing up which means I can facetime him directly from the app
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:09.360]   Um, I think it's pretty cool. Now. I know you're a big google hangouts user tray and love google hangouts
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.560]   This is clearly aimed directly at google hangouts
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:19.280]   I would say you can't quite do the the casual asynchronous video chat
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:24.720]   Which really google hangouts brought to the world right because skype is always it's a sort of a it's one
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:31.680]   For if you say something you expect the other person to say something right google hangouts is the really the invention is it's the first
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:36.960]   Asynchronous video chat where it's just people sitting around a coffee table. So this doesn't quite get there
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:40.560]   All chat is asynchronous, but it doesn't get that then video
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:43.200]   Element quite yet, right? Yeah, right?
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:48.240]   So it's not a competition competitor. No, I don't think but it is clear that apple wants facetime
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:54.080]   To succeed and this is part of kind of an overall strategy promoting facetime. I think yeah
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:58.800]   Well, they like a lot of mountain lion. They're finally starting to put it in the proper place
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:06.080]   Yeah, I mean now we have notes in its own app and we have remind and to do's or in a in a proper place instead of sort of being sandwiched into mail
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:09.680]   And what I like about messages particularly is I know my wife
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.800]   Because of the way we get our cell reception or don't
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:20.080]   She can't message from the house right so she has to wait till she goes out and then there's this backlog of 20 messages that happened three days ago
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:23.920]   And now they don't they're not important anymore, but having that on her Mac where she can just
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.880]   Bang back and forth between her
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:33.600]   Her Mac and her friends is really helpful. I mean with that I chat you could do SMS messaging kind of sort of
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:39.200]   But have to actually have this built in now is is great plus it's gonna save money on on her message plan
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:48.000]   I actually I like that and I love the integration of SMS with a Wi-Fi based messaging system is is actually a great as a great way to do it
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.800]   I think yeah, well, I think this I'm not sure this is entirely the end of SMS, but
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:59.600]   It certainly is amazing. It's amazing that they got the carriers to agree to this because it really undermines their whole
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:04.720]   You know $1,500 a megabyte. Well, I think when you go to the carriers and say this could go away
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:09.280]   Okay, okay. Okay. We want it. No. No. No, don't take it away
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:13.040]   We are sorry to have offended your pricing structure
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:15.680]   You decide to never so offend you again
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:20.640]   I didn't mean it apple. I didn't mean it apple really good luck. Good luck selling those palm trees
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:27.200]   Uh, let's see what other features should I don't want to give a short shift to mountain lion
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:32.160]   But there are some other stories you so much who could do a five hour 10 hour show a mountain lion alone
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.320]   um
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:37.600]   Anything that we've left out. Uh, I think we've covered kind of most of
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:43.280]   Most of what mountain lion does. I I do like it that reminders now have their own. Oh
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:47.200]   Eileen is telling me that airplay mirroring is oh, right
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:52.000]   Actually, it's more than just that it's also gaming which is kind of cool now is all unified in
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.200]   Game center game center is there so you can play a game
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:53:01.680]   Against somebody on your mac against somebody on an ipad and and then put it up on your big screen tv using airplay mirroring
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:06.400]   Well, I think airplay mirroring is is particularly important. So we've had that in the ipad, right?
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.000]   We've had that in the ipad, right?
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.200]   But if you can do this with your mac and i'm doing a presentation with an apple tv on the desk and I can do that wirelessly
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:18.720]   Cool, that's very cool. So every business every business in the world is going to buy an apple tv for their conference
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:25.840]   Honestly, I think that they're going to sell a lot of apple tv's because of mountain lion or if the rumors are true since apparently they're not
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:30.800]   restocking apple tv's march 7th apple may announce a new ipad and
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:39.440]   Right, something either a new apple tv or an apple television which would be very interesting given given that air that the airplay from macOS
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.520]   Only works. I'm sorry on OS x
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:44.480]   It only works as 720p resolution
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:50.080]   I really think that's a pretty clear nod that we're getting a new version of the apple tv that supports full resolution
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:57.840]   1080p we need 1080 they would they would not be down sampling the mac experience or down sample the hypothetical rumored ipad 3 with its
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:02.240]   Large display unless they were going to be beefing up the apple tv's
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:05.680]   Do airplay
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:11.520]   Uh the next version will yeah secret version i have here does airplay because that's because i think every app now
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:17.680]   Just it has to have that and every desktop app. Yeah, it has to start building. I presume that's something you turn on in a desktop app
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:23.120]   Yeah, or is it operating system? Well, no, it's it's system wide. It's a little it's a little dingus inside the menu
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:25.520]   That's just like choosing a display
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:31.520]   Although it is interesting that given the granularity that certain apps have chosen for supporting airplay on the ipad
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:32.480]   uh
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:36.880]   If these content providers like provide like the hbo go web app
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:43.520]   If they're going to be really really happy that it's so easy to mirror a display from macOS to uh to the uh
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:46.560]   To a tv set and that they won't have it's a system wide thing
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:49.760]   They want to have control of either support in that feature or not supporting that feature
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:56.560]   Um, I was trying to figure out for instance whether or not dvd player would have a limitation where you're not allowed to stream via airplay
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:00.480]   But there seems to be no reason why it should well. Yes, there is
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:04.400]   Because the tv providers don't you know don't like that at all
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:09.920]   Right because classically it's the one one one counter example to so much of what apple does
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:14.160]   It is the one app for instance in which you can't use the built-in screen capture utility to grab
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:17.040]   124th of a second
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:20.320]   Any two-hour move because that's a copyright by launching
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:26.400]   Yeah, and that that has to do with like the license to get the to get a certified version of the code for the dvd player
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.560]   They have to agree that they're going to lock it down
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:35.360]   Although again, I have not seen anything to indicate that the dvd player would not work by airplay mirroring
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:38.480]   Although a lock an app in between now and september, right?
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:42.320]   Well, because they could lock down apps and as they have done
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:46.080]   I think hulu plus is is locked down on here. So you can't use airway with it
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:52.720]   HBO go you can't you can jailbreak and use display out to do it right but uh, so again again
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.720]   I can't I can't speak definitively
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:56:00.960]   I can only speak to people I've talked to who have worked a lot with this and things that I've seen in the way the technology works
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:07.120]   Whereas airplay is a feature that has to be supported by individual apps in ios with this
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:10.960]   With the way that apple seems to have implemented airplay here
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:15.840]   It's kind of like being able to say that no, you're not allowed to use hdmi out
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.240]   You're not allowed to use vga out on this device
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:25.200]   Uh, there again a lot of things can happen between now and then and again, I'm saying that I don't i'm not the the jedi master
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:27.920]   Of video out or this particular technology
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:31.680]   I'm saying that i've asked this question of people that are smarter than i am on this point
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:36.240]   And they've said that they've seen nothing that would precluded from working or at least as things are right now
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.400]   That would be great. So that which i thought was interesting
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:42.560]   I guess it was protected. I tuned content will work just fine. That's so that that's controlled by apple
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:44.160]   So that's that's a dead cert
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:51.840]   I guess it is worth underscoring that this is a pre-release version of mountain lion and things can change and we're looking at
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:55.200]   A beta. Yeah, basically for developers only are we
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:59.280]   I'm not gonna ask that question. That's gonna say is anybody violating an nda
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:04.960]   If you're a developer, right? Can we not talk about it? But you're impressed and so you were briefed
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:07.520]   So you could talk about it
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:12.160]   It's a quick boom mystery to me
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.240]   Yeah
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:20.320]   Nobody I signed nothing so i'm gonna scoot i'm just gonna repeat what others say i am not i'm not under a dia
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:25.200]   I'm the so i'm the subject so i can speak freely. We're gonna talk some more with there are other stories in fact
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:27.680]   I really want to talk about the next ipad, but I just wanted to show
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:32.240]   Uh, we're gonna take a break and as long as we're breaking can we show us stuck on earth?
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:38.160]   Sure now you have the special new version but give me the audio on this and turn up the audio on this auxiliary
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:44.720]   Okay, because trade told me that when I signed into stuck on earth with my name leo, right?
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:49.520]   Yes, but there would be a special message just for me. Well in a way. It's an easter egg
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:52.000]   Hello leo
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.800]   So she says thousands of people's names you don't really have a
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:58:00.480]   It was just me we kind of stuck it in there. So you mean my name wasn't in the top thousand so you gave me a name
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:06.800]   Yes, yes, we snuck you in there. So here's the question. Am I a daydreamer explorer photographer? I'm all three, baby
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:11.600]   So that will give me a there is so much to this world
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:14.240]   Our mind
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:20.640]   She looked like a father to discover maybe did you find out the world is yours to explore?
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:23.440]   Yeah, he's very good to whatever area you like
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:27.600]   Amazing places on earth to experience. Thank you
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.240]   You are now looking at the featured photos filter
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:35.440]   Which has millions of amazing pins as you zoom in now. Let me ask you a trick
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:39.760]   If the mountain lion sounded like that, would you feel threatened?
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:44.080]   Well, you maybe you could use it late at night
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:47.280]   I noticed
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:53.440]   Except for 11 p.m. You haven't been cleaning the kitty litter very often. Is there something you're afraid of?
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:56.960]   So this is fun. So you get images that tie into this
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:04.480]   Um boy, that's these are are they all yours? No, no, no, we have millions of images from around the world
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:10.400]   Everything is geo located so you can go find these amazing places like like I want to take that photo
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.560]   Where do you stand to take that photo?
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.680]   I like that idea. I like that idea and so
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:19.040]   How do I how do I get to be a good enough photographer to take that?
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:22.720]   That's your own personal aguapo you have to
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:26.240]   Yeah, nothing like that in there, huh?
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:29.440]   Yeah, this is gorgeous stuck on it and it's free
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:31.600]   It's free
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:34.160]   Why why tray why why I have to ask you?
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:39.040]   Well, we have a lot of other apps and the other apps are paid and they're doing very very well
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:43.680]   Uh, we have a great ipad app called 100 cameras in one love that and
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.720]   Uh, you know, they're they're all profitable and doing fine
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:51.760]   So this is kind of like my my gift back to the world to photographers to explorers to travelers
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:58.640]   Because you know, I I spend so much my time traveling and it's so hard to find the most awesome places to go
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:04.480]   Right, you can use a combination of websites and apps and this sort of stuff to find your way around
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:08.800]   But you just don't have much time, right? You don't want to go down to the local
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:13.200]   Postcard shop. This is the one your mother got mad at you for. Yeah, she she was
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.600]   Standing in traffic
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.040]   Right for how long too?
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:22.080]   I mean, that's not just like run out take a picture and leave you had to stand there for a little while and I
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:25.120]   Can tell it's not on a tripod. You're actually squatting down
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:30.000]   No, I was on a tripod, but very low a short tripod. Yeah, it's like a gorilla pod
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.160]   Had it collapsed and this is sort of an example of you know, you can of stupidity
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:41.440]   No, you can say you've been eating cat poop. I could tell you're taking risks. I might have that parasite. Yeah
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.080]   Yeah, so all this stuff
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.080]   Hello, Trey
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:53.840]   G-Tray you're looking mighty to eat. I did for handsome. Is that Karen today? Yeah, yeah, that's me. Look Karen. It's Karen
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.840]   Yeah
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:00.960]   I love these. I love these shots. Oh, that's one of my favorite spots. Oh, yes, sansu, please
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:06.880]   Yeah, there's a church on top of a church and that's the one underneath underneath. That's below the below church. Yeah
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:12.960]   Is that is that what I thought it is? Maybe that maybe it is it is sansa. Pelle. It's not shapelle. I mean, yeah, yeah
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.440]   It's not shapelle. Everybody goes to you know to Dom
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:20.160]   And and it's next door and they miss this one because it's inside right like the ministry of
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:23.600]   Yeah, silly walks and you have to go in there and you don't do it
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:28.800]   It's just one of the most beautiful churches in sort of a secret spot. Yeah, not that secret. Well
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:34.320]   But you know actually most people go to Paris. They don't even know about this ashapelle if you go to
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:37.120]   See Notre Dame two blocks away
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:41.920]   As much this is another secret spot right here. This is um, the coliseum's in Paris. Oh
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.400]   This is
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.440]   This is sort of this joules verne esque museum
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:52.720]   That's named in uh in Paris and it's the museum natural history, but it's it's beautiful
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.440]   That's great if you like science. I mean you could spend all day there
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:02.640]   The the app and everybody should download it because it's free is stuck on earth, but also get 1000 cameras in one
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:07.760]   That's a nice only 100 cameras in one. It's only 100. Yeah, you're gonna do 1000 someday that would be
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.360]   Good god
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.520]   Trey Radcliffe is it stuck at customs
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:20.000]   Dot com. That's his website any and that goes also here from the chicago tons at times and from macworld.com the mac data himself
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.680]   creator of the mac 911 columns to chris breen and the hair and body of breen are here today
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:32.960]   You have to maintain that bouffant, don't you know? I don't I mean that's the sickening thing about it is that it just is
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.560]   It just does this it just is no it's because I have such an oddly shaped head
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:40.480]   He tweets and up with his hair he tweets as hair of breen just in case anybody wants to
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.600]   Don't body of breen body of breen is somebody else somebody else's hair brain. I thought that was you no
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:51.360]   So somebody did hair of breen in response. You said i have your body of breen. Yeah, because somebody said oh you're really funny on twitter
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:55.760]   I'm not on twitter. That's not me baby. Yeah, that's that's my hair talking
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:01.280]   All right, we're gonna talk some more about uh mountain lion and i'm very excited about
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.240]   apparently the rumors are confirmed
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:10.400]   About the retina display and march 7th and I don't know there's
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.320]   There's are confirming rumors about the rumors that are confirming the rumors
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:22.400]   And what the hell is the a 5x we'll find out in a moment, but first a word from hover.com. I am a bad bad man
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.200]   I still have
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.880]   Some uh, I say I tell people all the time I moved all my sites to hover.com
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:33.280]   And that's true except that some got locked because I was on that other guy that doesn't want you to move
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.520]   and uh, and and I guess throughout my hands and dismay
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:42.160]   And uh, and I still haven't gotten back to it. I was so
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.480]   I should have used
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.520]   Hover's concierge service that I wouldn't have had the same issue
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:51.360]   Go to macbreak.hover.com. What am I talking about the simply
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.760]   Not that apparently
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.760]   Oh, they don't have mac break.hover.com
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:04.160]   Anymore, I guess. All right. Okay. Well hover.com is great. Oh, you know why I know why it was htps. Let me do it again mac break
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:08.560]   You will vouch for it. We use it. We love it. We use it for all our domains
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.440]   I can't believe we used to use these other messy sites before
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:16.480]   Horrible messy site in fact, it's all it's insulting these other sites how they try these upsells
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:20.720]   And it's 50 clicks before you combine it's infuriating and it's confusing
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.720]   I consider myself sort of a master
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:30.240]   Internet user and I'm able to avoid all these upsells right, but it gets confusing. I was just hover is clean
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:34.880]   It's an apple esque experience. I'm hovered. Yeah, that's a good way to
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:39.200]   put it. Yeah, one of the things that almost always you do want at least I always want
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:45.840]   And then I do check in the upsells if you can see is domain anonymity right where it doesn't go back to your home address
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:50.160]   That's built in it's automatic at hover.com. They don't even charge you extra for it
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:54.960]   So the stuff you want is here hover is domain name registration and management
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:05:00.480]   Made simple and it did work. I was I had htps. It's macbreak.hover.com
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:06.640]   Uh, that's the place to go, you know, pick a domain name. Um, let's say stuck in customs
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:10.800]   I wonder if anybody has stuck in customs.com. So I'm gonna search for it
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:15.120]   Uh, now of course somebody does have it the fabulous Trey rekcliff
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:20.160]   But what it'll do it'll suggest some alternatives some of which are currently owned by the way
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:25.360]   But they will have stars next to them. See like stuck in time.com somebody's got
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:27.920]   I can't get stuck in customs.me
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.080]   You might want to pick that up real quick. Just let's get on that curdets only $10
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.400]   Curtis
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:38.160]   That was a mistake you have that look there's quite a few actually info biz biz
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.480]   C-a-c-c
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:45.680]   Dashes no one wants dashes, but look some of this stuff is on sale and that's what's kind of interesting
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.880]   So somebody has stuck in top time. They call this a premium domain
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:55.120]   What they've done is to eliminate that thing where you call up and you say hey, I'm Trey rekcliff of stuck in customs.com
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.120]   I'd like to buy your domain that'll be a million dollars
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.560]   This is an anonymous thing. They've set the price ahead of time
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:04.880]   They call this premium domains. They also have a clunker trade in
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:10.960]   Policy so if you if you're if you're buying a new domain and you have domain names
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.840]   I do this too. We all do this. We register domain names. We might want
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:17.040]   I have for instance tunic time calm
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.760]   really, yes for but reason
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:24.640]   At one point jennifer made me register. We were actually at dinner
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:29.200]   She said I'm going to do a tunic business where I sell custom tunics
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:33.760]   This business did not needless to say happen. However
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:40.160]   I was able to register it on my phone on hover and that was one of the reasons I love hover because I didn't need all those clicks
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:43.760]   And now here's a beautiful part that is now officially a clunker domain name
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:50.640]   Hover when I buy a replacement will refund me everything i've spent at hover.com including the registration and the renewal fees
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:54.720]   I can trade in my clunker domain and get my money back
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:02.080]   I love that. I if you want a non premium domain name use the offer code mac break
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:08.320]   And you'll get 10 off. Uh, it's and and by the way renewals or transfers. I should say
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:11.520]   Uh are really great. They have a concierge service
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:14.800]   Just tell them when you when you just call this number here at the top of the screen
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:19.120]   And by the way, when you call during business hours, they promise not ever to put you on hold
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:22.080]   I don't know if you've recalled those other guys, but that's kind of a way of life
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:25.760]   They put you on holding they transfer you to you know the upsell specialist and all that
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.520]   Uh not hover
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:31.600]   Once you get somebody that person will hold on until your job the job is done
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:38.400]   Call them say hey, I heard leo say you'll transfer my domains for free and they will they'll give you that concierge domain service
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:43.840]   Normally $25 free all of your domains. They just move them over and here's the beauty part
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:47.680]   You only pay 10 dollars for domains you're transferring
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:52.960]   And that gives you an additional year automatically. So it is a it's quite a good deal
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.760]   If you've got domains you want to move over. I highly recommend it
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.120]   Uh
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:58.640]   Just go to hover
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.720]   Actually mac break dot hover.com
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:04.800]   If you're buying a new domain, make sure you get the 10 off by using the offer code
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.240]   Mac break
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.240]   Did you hear about it on on twit?
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:14.560]   I did I heard about it from you. Okay. And uh, I thought what is this thing because you know, you probably registered quite a few domains
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:19.520]   We do. Yeah, I won't go through them all but we have a lot of domains as you are
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:23.200]   Yeah, it's just you know part of it's you know proactive part of it's just for fun
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:28.400]   Yeah, it's like owning domains, right? Yeah. Yeah, it's fun to go there. Look at your list. You know
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.760]   Manage them. Yeah
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:37.680]   Mac break dot hover dot com nice people it's uh, you know, it's the two cast folks l8 nasa is a crew
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:41.920]   You say you're giving up tunic time, huh? Do you want it? How much?
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.040]   Well, let me set a prize right?
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:49.440]   I hear chris breen might be in the market. He's a daren fairs and stuff. I have a ton of them
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:53.120]   I should I should sign in my account. I have I'm actually embarrassed to show you
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.760]   Uh the domains I have I'm not gonna do it
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:02.800]   It's silly, but you know, you know, I think he's do that where every time I'm talking to dick d bar toe law and
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.640]   weekly daily giz was he registers a note he actually has a domain
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:12.320]   That's something like mary christmas from dick d bar toe lo mad's maddest writer
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.480]   Dot com
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:16.800]   That was available. That was available

[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:28.160]   I've got leo loport dot tv. That why don't even know I had that dot us? I should see I kick it leo loport dot com
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.640]   But maybe I should use leo loport dot us
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:38.160]   Rk eight t dot tv see we thought maybe we'd name the show arcade get it but see nobody gets it
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:45.360]   Shut up and play dot tv. Yeah, I have about six of these that after like a couple cocktails you think this would be a great
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:51.760]   And go to you at this time right you're drunk registering. Yeah, and before you know it you've got these wonderful names
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.160]   There it is tunic time dot com
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:56.720]   In case you want it. I've got my call signs
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:01.760]   Uh, 18 I have 18 domain names it so far just today
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:08.080]   And you see I always register for like I've got tunic time through 2022
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:11.200]   Oh, no, I'm sorry 2012. Thank god. Oh, it's coming up
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:16.960]   That will expire soon so you could just put a little watch on that one. All right. I did my kids names through 2020
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.600]   Because I I knew they didn't want them right now
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:22.880]   But I figured at some point
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:27.120]   They might you know want you want to pass them along some passing them. I registered the domains
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.120]   Did you do that with your kids?
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.240]   No, but my kids actually I worry about the whole naming thing of kids nowadays. You can't you know
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:37.120]   You cannot name somebody unless you check google first. Yeah
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.120]   Yeah, I'm like sure that it's unique ratcliffe is sort of a unique name and our kids have kind of unique names
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.960]   But you know I just get ready. I should have given him ip addresses or right
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:53.120]   I want 28 dot 0 dot 3 dot 4 ratcliffe. That's a good idea
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.320]   Yeah, kind of like a like a binaud might do it
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:01.280]   It's just gonna confuse people if he ever moves. Will it be ipv 6? You want you want indirect reference?
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.760]   Here you go. That's why exactly right?
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.480]   The middle one the one with the head
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:13.600]   They have great domain management too, but I don't want to get into that because we'll move on but uh
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:17.440]   hover.com. Thank you
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:22.320]   So do we cover everything we want to cover iCloud messages reminders?
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:28.000]   I like notes because now finally I could do a note on the iPhone and it actually goes somewhere
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.320]   Well, it used to go somewhere. It still does but it goes into mail mail. It was just the last place I don't know
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.960]   You'd look for it and now uh there no more stickies
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:40.240]   But you can take a note and thumbtack it to the desktop. Well, I believe stickies is still there
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:43.360]   Oh, I thought they were placing stickies. I think stickies is still there
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:46.720]   There so they're still still stickies. I was misinformed
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:50.720]   Still stickies and stuck stickies is but the sticky synch with notes
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:53.760]   So stickies doesn't sink with anything stinky stinky
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:57.680]   Notification center now the guy who wrote growl says that's okay
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:04.560]   It's a little growly. Yeah, I think that's generally what people say when apple is just eating your lunch and then first thing they say okay
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:09.120]   That's okay. That's okay. There are a lot of windows machines out there. That's okay
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:17.920]   We're pleased that apple has endorsed our product our products concept by incorporating it into their own. We didn't invent
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:21.120]   uh wooden bookshelves
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:26.480]   Share sheets we talked about that. Oh, I didn't mention twitter everywhere now. So this is interesting
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.960]   twitter and vimeo
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:30.960]   But not google and youtube
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:33.520]   not facebook
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:36.640]   We now i've seen some say oh, I can't wait till facebook is there
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:41.840]   Will there ever be that kind of integration twitter is integrated that you can tweet from any app, right?
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:45.520]   Yeah, this is a part of the sharing infrastructure
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:49.600]   It's a it's a system not only is the system wide resource, but it's also single authentication
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.760]   So if there is any other app that wants acts wants to give you access to twitter
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:59.600]   You'd never you don't have to separately authenticate and sign in it'll just simply use the existing credentials that you've already established
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.680]   So right that that is a pretty
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:04.800]   Damn strong endorsement from apple for twitter
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:11.280]   It's actually kind of just in time for twitter because I think twitter is starting to look a little bit like a commodity like it's a back-end
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:15.200]   Information system it's it's a server for links, right?
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:20.320]   And so I think this is good for very good for twitter not so good for facetime and google plus
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:23.760]   I wish I would love to see google plus and facebook and integrated yeah
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:30.240]   Well, it's google plus doesn't integrate with harley anything. They don't have an api. That's part of the problem. Yeah, and i think they're right api
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:37.280]   They were struggling with that because they're trying to figure out do you know we do we just want this automatic updates coming all the time google
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.280]   stop struggling
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.280]   because that's
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:47.040]   Stop it get to work. It's it's it's it's it's also a hell of a hell of a balanced changer because
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.280]   I i'm i'm looking up right now
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:54.320]   But the the notes on the amount of traffic that apple sent twitter's twitter's way
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.800]   Simply by integrating with ios is just
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:00.160]   profound. Yeah, it's a it's by factor of two or three or four
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:04.080]   Uh, and the endorsement of vimeo has always been sort of the boutique
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:05.280]   of
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:08.400]   video host service the one that gives some advantages to
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:16.560]   Presentation advantages organizational advantages and no stupid pop-up ads that have to be dismissed before someone can you know start looking at the actual video
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:25.280]   Uh, but if vimeo becomes the default way of people from macos sharing everything and if that actually even it starts to extend to ios in the future
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:34.080]   Vimeo the vimeo ceo just upgraded from the robo to the cabin cruiser. I think no I think yeah, you're absolutely
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:37.280]   And you know I prefer vimeo. I would love to see a competitor for youtube
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:42.240]   Uh, you know, you kind of have to use youtube right now even though it is a little down market feeling
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:45.840]   Uh because that's where everybody is but I hate the comments
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:52.320]   You know and I hate hate the fact that they pull half of videos down because they you know because of claimed copyright infringement things
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:56.160]   As as a matter of fact, I just posted like my first video in about a month
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.760]   Uh
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:02.720]   Yesterday and hated what youtube did to it so much that i'm like, you know what?
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:08.320]   I haven't used vimeo in a while i'm gonna post it on vimeo and i'm gonna include that as the link because I hate the fact that there's a caption
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:13.120]   The video starts with a caption to establish where we are and that immediately gets covered up with an ad for
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:19.680]   For god's sake there was some sort of high blood pressure medication and i'm clearly i'm looking at every word in the description that says
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:27.920]   What about model engineering and steam engines suggest that people will possibly interested in this video
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:34.800]   I agree. I don't know if it's like it's a highlight of golden girls clips and like matt lock. I get that. Okay, that's fine
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:38.400]   J lenno. Okay. Got it. You know, you know, you you want to go above
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.720]   You know the the prostate medication into
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:47.120]   Have you considered what your relatives i loved ones will be left behind with if you're sure to when you when you pass away
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:53.280]   But you trade he's ever used vimeo. Uh, yeah, a lot of artists use vimeo. I love it. It's gorgeous
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:59.600]   Um people like vinsla for a when he posted the first five d mark two videos. He didn't post him to youtube
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:03.840]   That would have been crazy. He put him on vimeo. Yeah, I think he went with smug mug two for the video
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.320]   That's right. Actually, you're right because they did it uncompressed or
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:12.080]   Compressed but actually I disagree with andy a little bit on youtube because I think it's gonna
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:16.960]   The same thing's gonna happen that did with ebay, right? Notice there's not like four auction companies
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:21.040]   There's only one ebay and the reason is is because if you have something to sell
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:24.720]   You're gonna go to where most people are buying and if you have something to buy
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:27.920]   You're gonna go to the place where most people are selling so at all
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.920]   You know
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.960]   Snowballs into one major site same thing's gonna happen with video
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:37.760]   If you have a video that you want people to see you're gonna put it on the website where most people are
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.800]   If you want to watch video, you're gonna go to the site that has the most videos on it
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:44.240]   So, you know, that's why we do youtube. I don't want to use youtube
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:47.360]   But that's where it is you can't turn off those ads if you want to if you're not that
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:52.080]   And you know unless you get to 50 or 100,000 views. It's not worth putting ads on there anyway
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:58.240]   It's just penny so keep it clean until you get something that's a hit and then you could throw on some some videos
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:02.880]   Colin, what do we make we have we have we made 34 dollars. I think we have a video with
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:06.320]   I think of 50,000 views 34 bucks. It's like okay
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:09.600]   Thanks
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:14.960]   It certainly ties into what apple thinks that people are going to be using the the video service for not for publishing a video
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:17.840]   That's going to be seen by 80,000 people but something that's good
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:24.560]   Quick sharing of hey look my dog. My dog has a has a candle up right on his head. He looks kind of like space man spiff. Yay
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:30.080]   But if they were I think you're absolutely right. I mean apple would never delete it from iMovie
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:32.080]   They would never delete youtube support to model it
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.160]   Exactly
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:38.400]   OS level integration could be a big kick in the butt for vimeo and it and
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:41.200]   It certainly will make me real
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.440]   rethink, you know my process
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:47.920]   It's it's certainly makes that it certainly makes vimeo more valuable
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:52.320]   If they're looking for again, they've been off of the margins. I think for quite a quite a while
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:56.960]   They've been sort of like the secret underground video video use videos host site
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:00.480]   But if now they can establish themselves a year after mountain lion that well
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:05.920]   This is where ordinary regular consumers come to share personal videos of their own lives
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:09.440]   That's something that they can then market really effectively to advertisers
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:15.440]   You know, I mean and within two years we can ruin vimeo and turn into exactly everything we have about youtube
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.680]   It's it's really clear that
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:22.000]   It's very clear that steve jobs
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.560]   I mean if you read the isexing book, you know just was so pissed off at google
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:32.240]   And it's not a surprise that google has been somewhat deprecated in all of apple's subsequent products
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.720]   Is this a permanent ban?
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:38.320]   And by the way, facetime they tried to put facetime in iTunes with ping
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.400]   And then we don't know what happened
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:45.280]   But it's pretty clear that there was some disconnect because they demonstrated it with ping and then ping wasn't there
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:48.880]   Yeah, they seem to have had some spat there was a following with facebook
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:54.400]   And but I do think that that now that steve's gone and tim is in there that he's starting to talk
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:59.760]   Openly about we're gonna start doing things a little differently without you know saying we're gonna abandon
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:06.240]   The legacy that is apple and and everything that steve wanted us to do. I I do think maybe we're gonna get a little
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:12.320]   More cooperative tone out of apple than we've seen in the past because from the user point of view
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:16.320]   I want it all I want I want it. I don't want just twitter and vimeo
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:20.320]   I want to share everywhere, you know, I want some way to do that and if it's integrated in the os
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:24.720]   That's fantastic. I love that. I love how it was integrated into i movie
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.680]   And i'd love to see more of that and i'd love and frankly
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:32.720]   I hate to admit it, but I use facebook more than anything else and I really think facebook integration is kind of
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:36.160]   Uh, is a big deal. That's what real people use
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:41.040]   Right. Yeah, well, absolutely. I I don't but everybody else knows exactly
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:45.040]   Hey, I'm I I abandoned facebook a year ago
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:48.560]   Remember I deleted my account and everything and I and I came back and i'm frankly more happy there
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:51.920]   Okay, because I followed suit. I I left as well and I haven't come back
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.400]   I I led you over the hill and you did you took me over the hill and said yes, yes sucker
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:59.120]   Whoa, what happened here
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:03.600]   How is it over there chris lonely very very lonely
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:09.760]   Um, interesting wrinkle, isn't it? I mean everybody in our group and not only is talking about like journalists and commentators
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:13.840]   But everybody at a certain level of geekness. We don't use facebook
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:18.880]   We hit not only that but we act we're we're one of those people who says and let me tell you why I don't use facebook
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:24.160]   Either either they'll talk about the privacy problems or they'll be like on my side of the fence was I just think it's a stupid
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:27.840]   Service that doesn't work for anything. I want to do it for but meanwhile
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:33.600]   Just today I just I was looking at my facebook notifications and yep
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:39.760]   So my sister's friend just tagged me in a photo that got paid. Okay. So this is where this is where the humans hang out
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:44.480]   I want to learn more about the humans so that can exploit them commercially. I should probably be exactly right
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:46.720]   It's exactly it's where the humans are
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.960]   um
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:55.680]   Baffling species. I might be surprised they last another 300 years. You have to say that more like Spock a baffling species
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:58.640]   Um
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:04.480]   It was one other thing. I I forgotten what it was. I was going to mention an amount in line and a covered mountain line in great detail
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:11.120]   Obsessive detail as is I thought I thought it's kind of interesting how they made an entire section of both
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:17.840]   Of the presentation about well, here's what we're doing to make it localized for china now. Oh, yeah, that's right
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:23.680]   Where uh, not only do they have not long not only do they have new uh text input for for mac OS that
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:30.000]   exploits I had no idea that was so difficult to uh, uh to integrate pentagrams into a roman
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.160]   Text not only not only is a case of they when you want to enter a pictogram
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:37.840]   You spell it using a roman keyboard phonetically the way it's pronounced
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:43.520]   And because people will pronounce different symbols different ways this has to be a very dynamic resource
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:47.040]   So as I've seen if the word comes out that no, they're using it with like sort of a hard
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:52.160]   Oh instead of a soft. Oh, okay, so we gotta cover the use of the letter. Oh we used the letter
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:57.120]   Oh you uh and all that kind of junk and then the the flips the flip side of that is the idea that
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:03.440]   We realize that the the chinese government likes to censor pretty much everything and so
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:10.160]   When you translate wherever you see the word vimeo and youtube please substitute these local governments
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:15.600]   These local alternatives instead of twitter please substitute this word that we're that we're now supporting
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:21.520]   All these localized services that are home grown and know how to integrate themselves into
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:29.040]   The great firewall of china censorship system. So I just thought it was significant that that was not usually internationalization is
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:33.600]   They'll sort of group everything together and say well here is what we're doing to make sure it's make it more broad for
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:37.360]   For a worldwide audience. No, this was like as big a banner
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:43.200]   Banner part of the of the story as was sharing sheets almost as was airplay
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:48.400]   Yeah, who and who is that aimed at it's probably aimed at the shareholders. I mean
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:53.680]   a lot of their china's are bigger and bigger and bigger market and not only not only that
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:58.080]   But it's a very peculiar market where there's so many basic things that are just you can just
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:01.760]   Put it put a put a college student on the problem for about two weeks to
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:04.640]   Frenchify the mac or mac operating system
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:10.480]   But china you almost have to create a brand new version of the product to deal with all the idiosyncrasies of
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:17.120]   Mac, these are all things you had to share sheets, you know as yoku and todo or video sharing sites and
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:24.080]   A web o which is of blogging. I mean, these are all have to be you know, this is non trivial. You're right. It's not just localizing
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.800]   Uh the language is changing at all
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.600]   All right, let's talk about the iPad
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:33.120]   Confirmed confirmed rumor confirmed
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:37.440]   Uh some some sites. I think mac rumor is saying yes, we've confirmed it. It's a retina display
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:43.040]   But n-apple did apples confirm it? No, just checking. Okay. No, it's a dumpster
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.120]   confirmed
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:49.200]   I have to say that uh caris swisher from all things d was on twitter on sunday
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:54.160]   And she was I have never seen her more adamant. No, it is march 7th. She's very confident
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:24:00.640]   Uh john pakowski. There has a good resources apparently and she's very confident march 7th. You agree? I agree
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:06.080]   There have been enough of the people that you can count on that apple has told directly are saying march 7th
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:12.160]   Yeah, nobody's gotten invitations yet now andy you will get i'm sure an invitation and we will cover this march 7th
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:18.480]   And andy will be there wherever it will be that i don't i i don't it's not an entitlement
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:22.400]   I don't i'm i'm being invited, but I don't i don't feel as though I have
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:28.320]   I that uh, I feel as though if there is a list of people they're considering inviting this event that I would do be on that list
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:31.600]   I believe by the soap to be on that list of people they would consider inviting
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:34.320]   I it is confirmed. I am not on the list
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:36.800]   hahaha
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:41.120]   Trey have you do you ever go to apple events? Have you ever been invited? You would be a logical person. No, no, I
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:47.120]   Well, we we do uh develop a lot of apps. We know we never we've never been to those things because uh, you get
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:51.760]   Almost all the information you don't eat off the web and have you seen this new developer guide? They released
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:56.880]   That is really interesting for iOS. Yeah, it doesn't have the nitty gritty
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:01.120]   But it is a beautiful guide for people who have never developed
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:06.400]   For iOS well in fact if you look at like steps six and seven in there
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:11.040]   They start to get into computer science. He type stuff and design patterns and that's true
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.480]   Right
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:16.960]   And uh, it's a very robust thing. Let me see. Android hasn't done all that. Let me see if I could find this
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:22.960]   Um, let me tell you why you're looking apple apple made one hell of a great hire last year
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:29.600]   They hired away uh, the head of all of the of Pearson education's whole tech book a mac tech book division
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:34.560]   The guy who was responsible for all of those really great iOS and macOS development folks that
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:38.000]   Pearson published over the past couple of years and so now he is essentially
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:45.760]   Reinventing developer publications for apple. He is a he is he he has his own hires people
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:49.920]   He brought in himself. I haven't spoken to him about this particular document
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:55.040]   But I would not be shocked if this was one of the this is the first thing that came out under his
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:58.800]   Guidelines under his regime under his tutelage fantastic
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:03.360]   I don't want to pop it was mentioned by name because I haven't talked to him about mentioning them by name one on the show
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:05.680]   But I've worked with them in a couple of books
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:10.320]   Fantastic to work with one step. You know that the sort of guy who not only helps you do your best work
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:13.040]   But helps you to see ways you can improve your best work. So
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.080]   That's neat. That's uh, that's great
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.840]   um
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:23.440]   There is uh, there is uh, something similar I think for uh, android they have some pretty good docs
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:25.440]   But it's clear that you have to make it
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:31.600]   There's a cell a little bit of a cell involved in getting developers. You know, I mean actually shouldn't have to sell uh, iOS, but
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:38.800]   you know, uh, android is is tough. We have you done some if you looked I know you're carrying a google nexus galaxy
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:42.640]   Yeah, I do like this. I do like this galaxy in hexes and I love my ipad too
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:47.760]   But yeah, we we also make android apps, but it is harder. It is honest. You got it is harder in
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:51.440]   Um, but I find here's one of the secrets I figured out by accident
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:53.760]   Is that if you make a really good?
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:55.920]   iOS app
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:02.480]   Big companies will come to you and offer to pay you to convert it to like so samson
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:08.240]   I did something with us where they pay sure they want to own the phones you bet but they're done
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:12.640]   Well, okay. They're dumb. It's a road to conversion
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:17.680]   No, that's only it only goes into the samson store like exclusively for six months
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:21.680]   And so I don't know why samson is making their own android store. It's absurd
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:27.840]   Um, but we well, I know but I mean come on. It should be one ring to rule the mall
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:30.400]   Yeah, same reason amazon makes their own app store
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.440]   They're selling hardware. Yes
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:38.800]   And it's an exclusive to the world though. Actually the amazon app stores on every could be on every phone. Yeah, so yeah
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:42.720]   I'm not so worried about the amazon store. I the samson stores this other
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:48.720]   I don't like it because it fragments it so now I have two stores to update through and and then so i'm saying that's a third and I
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:51.280]   Yeah, I don't like it either. But google fragment of themselves
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:55.040]   I mean, I really think that that I really think that these companies
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:28:02.400]   Problem the thought that they're put into a position where in order to build apps that take advantage of the features of their phones that stay on the message
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:09.040]   That they're creating the general scrum of the android marketplace is no good for that sort of thing that samson wants to have its own
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:16.160]   Police force and its own concierges and its own editors that make sure that the apps their apps to experience serves all of their products and all of their users
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:19.600]   So, I mean just I have a couple of interesting android devices
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:23.120]   In the house now they arrived a couple days ago that i'm like, okay
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:29.760]   No, let's find something that takes advantage of these cool features. Oh, no, that's not not only is it a problem of finding apps that take advantage of those specific features
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:32.720]   It's so difficult now to get the actual app that
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:36.640]   I actually want to see because there's so much ghosting going on
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:42.960]   About, oh, okay, I I spelled the letter I spelled this app with a lowercase h instead of an uppercase h
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:47.120]   Which means i'm getting this russian clone that that is only good for the first two screens
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:49.760]   Then after that it stops working and just simply takes my credit card number
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:57.040]   Right, so I really think that the prolyphoration of alternative app stores points to a failure on google's part to do
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:00.320]   Take the rocks out of their own field. All right back to the ipad
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.640]   Right now display
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:05.040]   I'm whether on the show we're finally talking about the ipad
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:13.600]   Nothing but mac mac mac mac mac all the time look at that confirmed ipad 3 has 20 48 by 1536 retina display
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:20.720]   You know it says confirmed as you can get until march 7th, right? Well, they got a ruler though. Come on. They got a ruler
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:23.440]   I mean come on that's science right there
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:28.960]   Confirmation right there. It's got a it was a cool. It was a cool. It was a cool story
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:34.320]   I think that they probably are regretting the for the word confirmed because that's not the way that most this word confirmed
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.320]   I don't think it means what you think it means
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:43.280]   But for their story is we have a device that is the exact same dimensions as an ipad the exact same size as an ipad screen
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:47.760]   It is exactly twice the pixel-dimensional pixel density of an ipad screen
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:51.520]   Unless some other and some other developer of a tablet is ordering
[01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:55.840]   Billions and billions and billions of these for a brand new device. We haven't even heard theorized yet
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:02.240]   We believe this to be the screen of the ipad 3. Yeah, but but but but what about this the picture of the a5
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.600]   My ipad just broke
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:10.960]   Confirmed confirmed. I need a new ipad. It's a self-ejecting ipad
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:14.960]   At broke sensing danger
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:23.760]   Leaps into the bush the leak and lame ipad one is left for the snow leopard I consume at its leisure
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:29.120]   This is the picture claims to be the logic board of an ipad 3
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:35.440]   We do know that the a5 chip is the current chip in the ipad 2 and a 5x as opposed to a 6
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:40.240]   We don't know what that means though. Does that mean is quad core? I would guess here's what I'm gonna guess
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:44.160]   It's still dual core. I don't see a real advantage of quad core, but a much upgraded GPU
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:47.920]   How about that? Yeah, no, I think it's good and I think really
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.960]   So many people are walking into these stories
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:55.280]   Stating the obvious right but whenever there's an upgrade to this it's going to be faster
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:31:00.640]   It's going to be have a better camera. It's going to have maybe more storage better better than a worse camera
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:04.640]   Right. Yeah, no, I could it might have a better camera
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:10.880]   No, I think it is because it's just then it gives people something to write about right because they take all the obvious things that it
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:17.680]   Absolutely must have and they say well yes confirmed and it's got this and what is with that picture? I mean do they
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:24.080]   It's from a chinese. Let me let me back up a little bit to my cameras in china that it's a forum
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:26.080]   close to the chinese site y phone
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:34.240]   Yeah, it you know it doesn't it's not obviously photoshopped and there are some things if you zoom in the part number here
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:41.360]   Uh is one step above the part number in the i current iPad. It's not I mean it could be photoshopped
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:48.160]   It could be fake, but it's not too obviously fake. My only difficulty is that I I find it hard for me to
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:55.520]   convince myself that this is useful information of any kind okay, you know that it's it's more like okay
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:59.840]   There is a part that may or may not be genuine looks pretty good, but it may or may not be genuine
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:01.840]   It may or may not be going into a new ipad
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:07.280]   We're gonna find out for a fact where all the specs are it's just that all of the information all this information
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:14.480]   Two weeks to two months before the release of this device is of no use to anybody. It's it's cool. It's trivia
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:16.720]   it is news, but
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:19.760]   Yeah, again, what what are you gonna do with this information right?
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:26.800]   Do we want to talk about I don't want to talk about but I'll I'll mention it google circumventing the
[01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:29.200]   iOS safaris
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:32.640]   Third party cookie protection. This is what I think
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:35.120]   but a bunch of
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:39.520]   Serious the conversation starts with what a bunch of shirts
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:41.520]   We don't know how high up this decision came
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:45.920]   But the fact that this actually went into a live code says oh my disagree
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.800]   That's humiliatingly bad. I disagree, but anyway go ahead
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:52.560]   So this is the way I kind of look at facebook and it at google
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:55.600]   it's like they're in a prison cell and
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:00.240]   During the day they've got this poster a ferafosset on the wall
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:03.920]   And then at night they peel that back and with a spoon
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:07.680]   They're digging away at the wall that is our privacy
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:12.880]   And then and then every so often a senator comes by with the billy club and kind of goes
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:17.920]   Across the bars and which point they're back in the bunk and the poster's back in place
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:23.920]   The senator leaves and then they're back again with the spoon just but but really did they interfere with your privacy?
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:28.000]   All they did was put code in there that allowed them to put a plus one button
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.520]   Which wouldn't mean anything unless you were logged into google at the time
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:34.800]   Yeah, but I think this is so much of they already know you're logged into google
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:37.920]   So much of it is about the spirit of this which they ignore
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:41.920]   And what they do is they look at their contract or they look at whatever the specs are they said well
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:46.000]   Technically we didn't do anything wrong because we're not collecting your personal data
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.760]   We're just doing this but if you look at the spirit of it
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:52.080]   Which is basically would you please get out of my business?
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:59.120]   And I think both facebook and google do whatever they can to get in your business to me is it's even simpler than that
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:01.440]   It is I really just want to
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:05.120]   Shake them by the throat and say this is not a freaking game
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:10.640]   If there is a user setting that says I desire this level of privacy
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:17.120]   And you do something to specifically circumvent that setting you are a bunch of jerks
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:21.920]   Just like if I have specifically I can specifically tell any advertiser
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:25.920]   I do not respond to pop up advertising on websites. I hate it. I never use it
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:28.080]   I just don't like it at all
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:32.880]   I have voted and indicated that preference by installing software that defeats these things
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.680]   If you then put in code that tries to get around that saying oh well
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:40.640]   I bet that I bet that he would respond to my ad that's because he hasn't been targeted effectively
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:47.440]   Or as I really believe is the case with some of these decisions that I really believe there's a sense of arrogance in which they're saying
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:52.160]   Screw him. That's not his decision. If we can get this cookie installed
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:58.640]   We will install this cookie how dare he do something to stop us from our god given moral right
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:05.600]   To collect as much information as we can this will fix his wagon screw and you not go screw chris brain
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:09.520]   Screw all those users. We are entitled to every piece of information we get
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:12.800]   I would buy that that's what gets me that's what gets me really really upset
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.000]   I would buy that if
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:20.720]   Apple had I mean this was a default setting to block third party cookies apple says sites
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:25.760]   Allow cookies only from sites you have visited that is the default setting apple
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:27.840]   Does say something about it on the desktop?
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:35.120]   But does not say anything about it on iOS so it really was no iphone user necessarily has chosen that apples chosen that for them
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:42.800]   Well on by the same token they've also not chosen to upload to google every photo that I have on my heart
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:45.920]   chosen okay, I mean
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:48.400]   I think it's not so clear because I think in a sense in a sense well
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:56.720]   I really do think it's clear anytime you make that conscious decision as a developer that says here is a protection against this thing that i'm trying to do
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:00.560]   I'm going to exploit a bug or a weakness to get around that protection
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:06.960]   You suddenly you're not a criminal, but now you've taken one step more into the direction towards being a criminal
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:12.480]   What about the contention here's here's my contention. I believe apple set that not to protect my privacy
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:17.520]   Uh, I believe apple set that to protect iads what they would like to do is say hey
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:20.240]   Nobody can have any information about our customers except us
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:27.280]   Uh, and so as a result they are very careful to quote protect my privacy except when it comes to iads
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:33.680]   Apple's not interested in privacy. They're interested in market protection and google isn't google
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:37.200]   Didn't even do this in such a way to impose on my
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:41.440]   privacy merely to put a plus one button
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:43.680]   on ads on
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:50.320]   On on on sites that somebody who has signed into google has already said I want a plus one button in effect
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:55.200]   Um, so what google's doing is saying to apple. Hey, no in fact
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:58.560]   Our customers are telling us they want to be signed into google
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:05.120]   They want a plus one button and you're blocking it as market protection not as privacy. How about that argument?
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:10.640]   Okay. Well turn your iphone over what logo is there. It's not a google logo. It's an apple logo
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:15.520]   Well, that's why i don't use an iphone anti, but i don't think that apple is on the side of the angel sphere
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:18.560]   I think that's a mistake to assume. Okay. Well, I can't i'm not gonna
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:24.000]   I'm not gonna speculate as to the reasons why that the default settings for this far browser are the way they are
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:29.600]   It's possible that what you're saying is correct that this is a long range strategic sort of thing where they don't want competition from the iads
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:34.480]   It's possible though that they are truly saying what is what would the user want in this situation?
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:39.200]   Would they want a stronger browser that protects their privacy or they want a weaker browser that protects our privacy?
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:42.720]   We can't speculate or would they want to browse with the breaks google
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:48.000]   See, I don't think apple. I think apple wants to break it breaks. It breaks all the boats in the harbor
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.320]   They they don't think of the same rate
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:54.400]   But it's it really is a philosophical thing. It's like if there is a locked door
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:59.360]   I really think you have to you can get but through that lock because oh jesus actually look at four pin lock
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:05.200]   I can I got a paper clip of me. I can easily get past that but there is a principle that says that this person locked this door for a reason
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:09.200]   It's not the door. He didn't do it to bar me from from getting access to things i've arrived to
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:09.920]   It's not as though
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:13.840]   There's a public bathroom that everyone's supposed to use and he locked it so that he could have it for himself
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:18.720]   This is a little private door with a private lock as soon as you try to open that lock
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:21.520]   Without anybody's permission or without anybody's knowledge
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:26.160]   You have taken a step away from the angels and towards the the point you picked for sort of guy
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:29.040]   And I agree we cannot know apples intention here
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:31.040]   So i'm not going to impute apples intention
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:38.800]   But uh, they did not the the choice to lock the door was in fact not the user's choice was apples choice and apple did not publicize it
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:46.000]   Uh, so okay. Let's let's let me put this if I go to a site where I expect a plus one button because i'm logged on to google
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:50.000]   And I don't get it. Uh, I may not know why i'm not getting the plus one button
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.200]   I may not know enough to go in there and change that setting maybe I want that button
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:56.480]   I want to I want to put it this way. Let's say that a developer
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:00.960]   releases an app that decides well the default setting for gatekeeper on
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:04.560]   On mount line is to not allow labs that have not been signed
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:11.200]   I'm not sure the user really wants that so i'm going to exploit this loophole to allow this piece of code to install and execute
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:15.760]   Even though it hasn't been signed by everybody. Are you still that's ender? I agree
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:20.240]   No, I agree and I think you can make the case google is is malicious here
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:27.360]   Um, I'm not sure it's as I bring up this alternative point of view to point out that it's not a hundred percent clear
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:31.280]   I I think that if I think that if google's now, this is my prejudices
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:37.280]   If I believe that if this could if this nameless company who is due to this work around this end run against
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:44.000]   Safari security features if they were really on the side of the angels what they would do is be able to sense. Oh, I'm
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:48.480]   Why why can't I set this cookie? Oh, let's do an ID check. Oh, it's a safari browser
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:51.760]   We'll just throw up a little notices. Oh, by the way, we would like to enable this
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:54.960]   But we can't because your security settings are that's not the right thing to do
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:40:01.760]   I agree. Yeah, that is that would be I believe that my prejudice is that I believe that someone whose instincts are to do no harm
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:05.440]   Would choose that option not great must be a way we can get around this somehow
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:11.360]   That would be a good way to do that actually and I I do wish google had done that does facebook go around it with a like button also
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:18.000]   Yeah, they're they're also they're also semi tracking people that haven't if they whether you signed it or not
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.160]   It would break the like button. Yeah
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:25.600]   So anytime in order for so the this whole issue third party cooks by the way
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:31.680]   We talk about third party cookies a lot on security now. I have the same debate with steve, which is I don't it doesn't bother me
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:35.840]   Uh third party cookies in general and third party cookies in particular. Don't bother me
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:39.680]   I like it that there's a setting so that if it bothers somebody they can turn it off
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:46.480]   Um, it is somewhat how the web works. However, uh, it is how ads are served
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:51.600]   Um, it is how the web pays for itself facebook is a for example is a free service
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:56.880]   Uh that monetizes with things like the like button now I I acknowledge that
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:03.040]   I think when you explain what the like button does to people they go what the hell you mean every side I go to with a like button
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:06.560]   Facebook knows I was there whether i'm logged in or not that upsets people
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:10.800]   But in fact if you get the full story, which is look you're getting a free service
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:18.800]   They're monetizing google's monetizing by advertising their goal is not to say I want to tell somebody what leo loports up to
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:23.600]   But in fact to get ads served to you that are of more interest to you than just generic ads
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:27.840]   I think that there's I my point is that is a larger argument
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:33.520]   I agree with you and it would be great and I hope that we're moving to a future where you are notified about all this stuff
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:37.760]   But then we've got the problem where you're you have notification fatigue, right?
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:44.400]   Which we once have seen before on windows, uh with uac on vista where people just start. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:51.440]   Um, so I guess I do agree with you that there is there does need to be a way so that people who run commercial sites can get
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:55.440]   Get paid for the content that they create that caught that actually does cost money
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:57.920]   It's not just some dude in his apartment sometimes it really is
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:02.000]   Journalism costs money. I mean I have to fly to these places to cover these events
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:07.200]   I guess the definitive the definitive change would be I'm thinking about ghostry for instance, which is that really great?
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:13.120]   That's a plug-in. It's one thing to not ask before you can deposit cookies
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:17.840]   It's another thing to simply say oh this ghostry involved ghostry has been installed. That's why I can't install it
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:23.680]   That's okay. I know a way around ghostry. I think that if someone has installed ghostry, they have you're right that they've really made their
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.200]   That's a clear signal
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:30.800]   So they're there. They're such a clear signal from ios because it was default and apple did not make a big deal saying
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:37.120]   Hey, by the way, we are disabling third party cookies on your behalf if they had said that then I then there would be no argument
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:41.760]   And if google had said hey by the way
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:45.840]   We can't put a plus button on here because apple has disabled third party cookies
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:49.360]   May would you like to re-enable this that would then there would be no argument?
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:55.040]   The problem is neither side is really explaining their point of view here and uh and for good reason because nobody wants to
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:56.320]   Hear it
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:02.400]   It's like more detail than most people want right right and what they do is they give you a very broad setting which is private browsing
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:04.640]   so you can flip that on and then
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:07.280]   You're pretty well set
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:11.760]   But you know then that disables everything so when you return to your favorite website you know
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:14.720]   I have to log in again because there's no cookie there
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:18.960]   Steve keeps telling me to put no script or script no on uh my brevary's browsers
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:22.400]   I turn it on for one day and I go this is a pain in the ass and I turn it right on
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:27.280]   You know the truth is javascript is a problem and if apple really wants to protect privacy
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:31.440]   What they should do is turn off javascript just as they turned off flash and safari then we'd all be safe
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:33.520]   But no sites would work that's it
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:38.240]   So I just I just I think that this important is conversation
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:41.120]   I I don't want to defend google because I agree with you andy
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:44.000]   It's sleazy to do something behind people's back
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.880]   Uh, but at the same time it's not a hundred percent black and white here
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:52.880]   Well, it just shows that it's difficult both from the different their end and our end as well
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:55.360]   That how do we configure?
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:58.640]   Privacy in such a way that we don't feel like somebody's messing with our business
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:02.240]   But the web functions for us we get a lot of free stuff
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:07.440]   I think people we there's a certain amount of entitlement sure that users get where hey, well
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:11.040]   I want my free stuff, but I don't want to give you anything for it right
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:15.840]   And it's not doesn't quite work that way. It's more complicated. It's all gray
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:18.320]   Life is gray
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:21.840]   Unless you're a big cat then it's pretty straightforward
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:26.000]   Come to me tray come to me look deep into my eyes
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.680]   tray
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:29.680]   We haven't talked lately
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:31.920]   tray
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:33.920]   All right, we're gonna take actually
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:37.600]   Well, it's we don't need to take a break. Let's get to our tip tool and the number or whatever it is
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:39.200]   We do on this show
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:42.240]   What is it? Uh, picks of the week picks of the week ios tips
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:45.040]   cougar tips
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:48.640]   Do you what you like normally Alex lindsey gives us an ios tip
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:55.520]   Is there anything that you think I know one go into safari on ios and take a look at your browser settings
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:57.280]   Take a look at those darn browser settings
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:03.440]   Yeah, there's you know there's an option in there for private browsing and you can it's more than private browsing
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:06.720]   It says uh, there's three settings you can have no cookies
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:11.520]   Right now see if apple had set no cookies it would break the web in in significant ways
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:15.760]   It would be on the side of privacy sure, but they don't dare do that
[01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:20.240]   So they've set it to be three settings there's no cookies all cookies and
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:23.120]   Only cookies from sites you visited that's in a sense
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:28.080]   No third party cookie right so you got never from visited right always right but
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:33.840]   Honestly, I just turn on private so there is a setting on private and if you turn that on what happens no cookies at all
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:37.920]   No cookies at all. It's you leave no traces. This is the kind of thing that
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:43.360]   Should you be visiting a porn setting no no no no no you're a foreign agent
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:51.120]   Oh, sorry and uh and uh somebody picks up your ipad and and sees that you are you were logged into the cia's website
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:57.040]   With private browsing on you quit out of safari and then when they come back in it's not going to
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:00.080]   Jump up there or automatically log into one of these sites
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:06.880]   So this is in the settings on ios and under safari not under safari right and it is privacy turn that on
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:11.200]   Would you like to close your existing tabs? Yes close everything. I want to start over
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:17.360]   Private by the way interestingly it does not turn off cookies. It just turns off third party cookies
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:21.360]   Yeah, what I want are an ipad and a laptop that's made out of cellulose
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:25.520]   So that I can actually at the end of the day just like one match it all goes off
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:28.720]   In about two seconds. I start again the next day
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:34.160]   I I have a big role like paper towels tear off a new computer start again with no with no tracks whatever
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:39.600]   Uh lion or you could do a mountain lion or cougar tip andi in aco
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:46.000]   I will do a quick deep class greatest hits style uh macOS tip
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.480]   Sometimes I go deep catalog
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:52.800]   This is this is a tip that I used a couple weeks ago and someone was surprised to
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:55.440]   Know that macOS could do this has been doing this for quite a while
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:59.120]   Uh, it actually if you go into the sharing tab of system preferences
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:01.840]   There is actually the ability to share your internet connection
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:06.320]   Uh, so that if you're I use this all the time like if i'm in a hotel and there's like wired internet
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:10.320]   I can simply plug in the ethernet into my macbook turn on
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:17.040]   Wireless internet sharing through my wi-fi port and now I have a wi-fi access point that I can use with my iPhone and my ipad
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:22.000]   Uh, so that saves me from having multiple connections going also in a hotel situation
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:28.560]   It can actually result in faster access because uh, the network gives one address to your macbook
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:34.240]   And then your macbook distributes more sub addresses to your sub devices instead of each one of these devices
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:38.480]   Even if there is in room wi-fi having to connect the hotel server and see if there's addresses available
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:40.800]   See if there's servers or or clog stuff like that
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:44.400]   So it's a very very easy way to share internet connections with with other places
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:48.400]   It's one of the reasons why I still have yet to get uh to activate
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:55.520]   Uh tethering mode on my iphone yet because it seems like every single circumstance in which I would want to have a network connection
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:48:02.240]   To a random device. I can actually serve it right from a different device just by simply sharing the connection very simple one click does the job
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:05.040]   Excellent
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:08.000]   Uh, let's see here. How about our picks of the weekend?
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.840]   I'm gonna start with you tray ratcliffe you can actually put it right where that is and we'll be able to see what you're showing us
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:20.240]   So I have two tastes one is hardware. That's expensive and one is software. Let's spend some money
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:27.120]   So in the Alex position this one has been exactly kind of life-changing. I've dumped all my drobos
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:29.440]   I've had I had four drobos
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:32.880]   And now I use this thunderbolt pegasus drive
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:36.800]   Oh, you are using a thunderbolt drive. In fact, I have two of them
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:39.520]   Uh, they were not given to me. I paid full money
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:43.040]   For these things even though I probably should have been given them
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:46.320]   Now that you're plugging it like that you should you should get them free
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:49.200]   So I bought this is from promise. Yeah from the promise pegasus
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:54.400]   I bought two of the 12 terabyte drives and it connects via thunderbolt and you can
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:57.280]   You can get as many as you want are you doing the raid version?
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:59.840]   Yeah, the raid version and it is so fast
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:06.400]   It is it is as fast as my internal SSD as it should be as an SSD
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:10.560]   It feels like now. I know there's regular old hard drives in there
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:13.280]   But but because they're raid six
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:17.600]   Perhaps it's so fast. I mean I run my light room library off of there
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:21.120]   Um, because you couldn't run your light room library
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:25.520]   You couldn't actually use your drobos as like working drives that you pre-file off of it
[01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:29.120]   You know why usb it was too slow. It was too slow even the firewire was slow
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:36.000]   Yeah, but these these 12 terabyte drive they are amazing. Yeah. Whoa. God. They ought to be at that price
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.520]   Well, the other pricey now you don't have to go for the full 12 terabyte drives
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:44.480]   Man, they they are great. Um, so there's the six drive
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:49.280]   Uh with terabyte populate with terabytes is 1799
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:57.200]   So if I take out 600 bucks for the drives themselves about right, that's a 1299 for the case
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:00.880]   At the apple store. Yeah, it's a great great product
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:08.000]   Um, and then here's my much less expensive thick. This is this new to-do list. I do want this by the way
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.520]   But I just man is great. I'm just saying I want those are just expensive
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:15.680]   So this is oh, yes, please called clear. Yes, okay
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:22.000]   And it's a very simple to-do list now you're on an iPad, but this is an iPhone only. Yeah, so I got the little two
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.320]   Looks pretty nice. I mean it it scales. Just I guess we'll have this 2x on the new iPad too, right?
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:28.960]   Now. Yeah
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:33.440]   Yeah, that's right. So anyway, uh, it's very simple elegant nice little um
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:38.000]   Sound effects and everything and it's got this touch interface. Let's plug in right?
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:43.360]   Let's plug this in so we can hear the sound effects. You have a you have a hole that I can put this in
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:47.040]   Give a show title
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:52.080]   All right, so we're good moving on. Um, are we here?
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:56.240]   We're here in it. That's what we're hearing. I don't know if you're here or not. So you go to your personal list
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:51:00.480]   I think it's because you have a rubber on it's better if the hole doesn't have the right
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:06.240]   We have a show title. Okay. Let's just take off your uh, I don't know where you've been. There we go
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:11.760]   I'm just calling it like yeah, see it. Didn't you go overseas during the war?
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:17.280]   Is this do you have a you have a like a plastic on your uh, no, no, that's just glass. Yeah, just glass
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:22.160]   It I don't feel it. It's not okay. Okay. It's a little lack of sensation
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:29.600]   All right, so anyway, so sorry for the children in the audience
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:32.320]   Uh, please ask your parents what Leo's talking about
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:36.320]   You can have multiple lists like a personal list a work list you go into it
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:40.400]   If you want to create something new you can pinch and pull it apart and this thing unfolds. Isn't that cool
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:46.960]   Niko blob. This is philip ryu who does all that amazing tap tap tap stuff. He's a very good
[01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:52.080]   What you're done with it. You just knock it off. It's got pretty little sound effects simple elegant apolisk
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:58.880]   It's and it's a buck. It's yeah, it's 99 cent. Yeah, it's a couple bucks. You know the I love it
[01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:00.080]   I use
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:05.520]   Unfortunately, I'm using like this most elaborate to do list that has integration with the you know the cloud
[01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:11.200]   I'm me focus. I'm me focus. Yeah, actually something called astrid, which is both android and iOS
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:16.240]   And it knows where I am so when I walk in here. It says, oh, don't forget you were supposed to do this and all that stuff
[01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:21.680]   And I wish it had an interface like clear. That's just gorgeous. It's just beautiful really nicely done
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:27.840]   Uh, how about you mr. Breen? I see you have something there a little cool. I brought a toy. Yeah, yeah
[01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:34.640]   It's and it's more than a toy. This is uh apogees mic. It's actually a mind blower. It's kind of a mind blower. Yeah
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:42.560]   It's uh, it's a $200 mic and it works not only with your macintosh or your windows machine
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:47.680]   But it also comes with a cable that will plug directly into your ipad 2
[01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:52.160]   Or into your 4 or 4s. It's a 41
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:55.200]   Or a 48 kilohertz
[01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:57.680]   Uh supports that and 24 bit audio
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:02.080]   It's I didn't know that so if you have to use special software to do that
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:04.800]   No, it just works. It just works. Yeah
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:09.520]   Is and it's a condenser in there. It's a condenser mic inside. It's side loaded. So you're talking to that
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:10.560]   Right part, right?
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:13.680]   Right. I found it popped a lot but other than that if you don't talk right into it
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:16.720]   It's fun. Yeah, well you've got a gain switch on the on the back. So you love that
[01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:19.600]   Yeah, you want it or on the side you could just have to have it far enough away
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:23.920]   And it really produces some some terrific sound. I was very impressed
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:26.960]   We did a review on before you buy and I was blown away by the quality
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:29.520]   Yeah, I really like what they've done with this thing and it's uh
[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:34.400]   And I like the versatility of it in that you can use it with both the Mac and with an iOS device
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:36.960]   So I think that's uh, it's a it's a terrific little device
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:43.840]   So again not cheap at 200 bucks, you know a good mic's gonna set you back at least that much. Yeah, it will so um
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:49.040]   And really portable. So you just throw in your bag if you're doing podcasting if you're doing field recording
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:52.400]   Particularly with an iPhone. This makes a really nice setup
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:57.760]   I use this uh we reviewed it up before you buy and I use this to uh do record a little audio boo on
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:54:01.600]   That's on my website. Should I play it just you hear the each year? This is me pumping up my ball
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:04.240]   Can you can you give me some audio from my
[01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:10.560]   Hear how clear that is that sound is uh actually the pumping
[01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:13.360]   Oh, yeah, I heard the close of it
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:20.160]   This actually the quality I was blown away and that mic is not is not real close to uh, it's got very clear
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:24.720]   New microphone from apo. I would say it sounds as good as our high up here
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:27.440]   I think don't tell pop high. I said
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:32.080]   30 pin connectors. So there it is. I agree with you at uh 200 bucks
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:36.880]   And uh that's from apogee. There's another one I want to review that chris mark art had
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:40.240]   Which is the square little mic or something like little square mic lsm
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:43.520]   And I want to try that as well, but it's similar form factor
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:47.520]   You know, I've been looking for a long time for a good mic to use in my iphone
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:49.840]   And this is it. Yeah, amazing
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:53.440]   Yeah, well an apogee has a the kind of relationship with apple where they can
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:55:00.240]   Design devices that will work with a dock connector and not every manufacturer does some of them have to go in a different way
[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:05.200]   Right or you have to use a usb hub and i'm thinking they don't have analog out of that 30 pin anymore
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:09.520]   So that's digital coming that's all digital into the mic right or into the iphone from the iphone from the ik
[01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:16.240]   Yeah, uh, we should mention uh, I I forgot to mention this that not only is it philip re you but it's real mac that did that clear
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:19.520]   Uh program and they've been around for a long time. They do rapid weaver
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:24.560]   Um and uh and other development tools for the macintosh. So it's kind of interesting to see them
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:29.840]   It's great. It's uh sort of app poetry it is in a way because
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:38.560]   It's beautiful a feature the deletion of what could be is what makes poetry. Yeah, this guy knows what he's doing. Yeah
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:41.360]   Andy and not co your pick of the week
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:47.840]   Uh, i'm in the middle of doing what I hope to be a comprehensive roundup of keyboard solutions for the ipad
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:52.640]   Uh, and so i've got like the office just full of pretty much every sort of keyboard you can get for the ipad
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:59.280]   Uh, and so i find that there's no way to crown a winner. This is the best keyboard you can possibly have for the ipad
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:02.240]   It's more like they're like the categories in the competition
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:07.120]   Uh, and so i've pretty much ready to crown a victor in one specific
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:11.920]   One specific category and that is i want a very comfortable to type keyboard
[01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:15.840]   But i don't want to carry something that's bigger than an actual ipad
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:21.520]   And so i found one that i really really like this is the zag folio 2
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:23.600]   Um for the ipad
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:26.880]   Um, what i like about is that on the on the negative side
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:30.000]   It is a of course a smaller size keyboard
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:33.040]   It's only about the width it has to be only the width of the ipad
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:40.640]   Uh, and as a matter of fact i tried zags keyboards last year and really just intensely didn't like them because it really became a case of
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:45.520]   So i really can't type with any speed whatsoever on it. I can't touch type on it
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:47.920]   Why is this better than the virtual keyboard anyway?
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:53.280]   Uh, but they certainly really went and upgraded this and i think that what it made me realize that the thing that i was reacting to
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:56.560]   Was not really the size of the keyboard but the quality of the switches
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:56:58.960]   And for these switches in the zag folio
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:04.240]   They're actually using scissor type switches that are the same basic types of technology that you find
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:07.200]   On a macbook keyboard or an apple's wireless keyboard
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:10.400]   So you're still dealing with the size that's a smaller keyboard, but your fingers
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:14.240]   Basically have that exact same sort of touch uh, sensation for it
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:18.560]   And although i find that i can't type at maximum speed with it
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:22.800]   I can type quite comfortably with it. I just have to slow down a little bit to accommodate
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:25.280]   Uh, the smaller uh smaller acreage
[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:28.800]   Uh, and it's also it's a very smart little keyboard. It has integrated magnets
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:30.960]   So if you close it up and automatically goes to sleep
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:35.840]   Uh, it's available in several fashion colors. It's not crazy stupid expensive
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:41.520]   It's about 99 bucks when he can when he compared it to the uh, the apple wireless keyboard costing 70 bucks
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:45.440]   That's certainly credible. Uh, it connects simply via bluetooth
[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:49.840]   And you can actually remove this keyboard from the case itself
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:54.240]   So if you want to put some distance between uh, the keyboard and the screen you can do that
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:59.680]   And the other final feature that's kind of that's very nice is that it really is quite flexible
[01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:02.960]   Uh, because you're sort of we're sort of used to
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:07.280]   Dealing uh typing on keyboards like this, you know in sort of portrait mode
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:10.560]   But because it's not locked into a single frame
[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:14.720]   You can also actually use it as a simple page, uh format like that
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:19.600]   I'm holding it with one hand so that if there's this round of tables to be much more stable as it is
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:21.360]   I'm very careful. I'm very
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:25.280]   Farried of dumping this on the tile floor. Uh, so i'm building a little bit careful with it
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:28.000]   So in that it's a rechargeable bluetooth keyboard
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.200]   So you're gonna have to recharge it every if if if your output is like mine
[01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:34.880]   You'll have to recharge it every three days, but for normal people it'll last several months
[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:36.320]   Um
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:38.800]   Very nice again, not the king of every single category
[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:44.080]   But if that really is your priority if you want something that that will be as compact as a netbook
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:49.280]   Uh, but still have uh, type as fast as as humanly possible on a keyboard of this size
[01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:53.440]   I do like the zag folio 99 bucks has been discounted. Maybe five or ten percent here and there
[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:57.920]   Uh, but good stuff for me. I'm surprised you didn't pick uh pink though. I I think the pink
[01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:00.480]   Really would be more suitable
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:07.040]   Pink well, yes. Well, you know, there's there's there's there types of my private life that don't choose to share
[01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:11.200]   They've got there's they also have another which is kind of nice. Yeah, yeah
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:15.840]   I'm not I'm not like tree. I can't just be one of these people who just gives and gives and gives of himself. I
[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:20.240]   There's a there's a softer side of air. Right? We'll expose to a few people
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:26.560]   Uh, ladies and gentlemen, I gotta say out of context. This is definitely based on the sexiest
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:29.680]   Is weekly if you just two minutes we've had
[01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:36.880]   There's almost like an episode of are you being served? It's because it's because we're all on toxoplasmosis right now
[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:40.320]   And and and tray you're doing a crazy thing you're doing a google
[01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:44.960]   Do you do google hangouts like just like your whole life is a google hangout because he's doing a google hangout right now
[01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:50.160]   A lot they all they're all fans. So they all get to participate. How did you uh select them?
[01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:55.760]   Uh, there's just great plugin. They all have facial hair. You got to see this plugin. It's called my
[01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:57.760]   Oh, that oh yeah
[01:59:57.760 --> 02:00:02.800]   Uh, have you ever heard of the my hangouts plugin? No, so yeah, watch this. This is so cool if you click here
[02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:09.760]   Okay, well, I can see what you're doing. So just describe it all all I'll choose the my hangouts extension here
[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:14.560]   It's written by a guy that's in his hangout named moham and mon suer
[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:21.120]   Oh, I know mom and sure. Yeah. Yeah, and so this shows you all the hangouts that are currently happening all over the world
[02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:28.480]   So cool and so you could just scan through there look for something interesting and just jump in and hang out
[02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:30.560]   There's also a map view
[02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:32.160]   Uh, which you can see right there
[02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:32.720]   Yeah
