[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.560]   Hello, everybody.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.560]   Welcome to Macbreak Weekly.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.760]   I haven't done this for a long time.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.520]   I started off with Leo and I started off doing Macbreak.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.280]   This is Alex, by the way.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.920]   And then Leo took it over.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.760]   And this is the first time I've hosted Macbreak in a long time.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.520]   Fortunately, I'm not by myself.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.800]   One of our usual suspects is here, Andy and Anikko.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.880]   Hey, Andy.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.240]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.600]   And it's good to have you.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.360]   I was so close to Boston.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.360]   I was in Boston last night.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.680]   I was in New York last night.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.440]   That's OK.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.840]   A lot of people come close to Boston.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.920]   I hear that a lot.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.640]   So don't worry.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.920]   It's not something that I question at this point.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.240]   It's not something that I simply accept
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.440]   that you're telling me the truth or you're lying.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.000]   That's all there is.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.400]   It was close.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.040]   But also coming back to the other side,
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.880]   we've got Veronica Belmont from Tekzilla.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.120]   Hey, Veronica.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.640]   Hello.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.480]   Thank you for having me.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.760]   I think this is the first time you've ever been on the show.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.040]   I think you're right.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.000]   We're expecting big things.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Don't want to have enough coffee today yet.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.320]   Well, drink up because when Leo said
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.240]   that you were going to be on, I was like, whoo.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.520]   And that will not be topped also by-- we have Ryan Block
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.280]   from GDGT.com.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.320]   Hey, Ryan.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.000]   How are you?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.520]   Good.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.440]   Where exactly are you?
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.800]   I'm in San Francisco as well.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.320]   OK, great.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.560]   But we're all spread out somewhere in the San Francisco area.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.760]   I'm in the interwebs.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.400]   In the interwebs, exactly.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.520]   And there's the variety of standard Mac news.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.320]   This is a lot of ongoing sagas this week.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.760]   One of the sagas, of course, we're
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.480]   dealing with--
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.480]   Macs is going on right now in LA with Adobe.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.080]   And so there's a couple things going on with Adobe.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.280]   Of course, Adobe is now Flash 10.1.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.280]   Now available on nearly every mobile platform, nearly,
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.080]   because it's not available on the iPhone.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.680]   So here's the question.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.000]   Oh, I was so surprised.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.480]   I know.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.000]   I know.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.440]   Now, here's the question I have for you.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.800]   Who's the loser in this?
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.040]   Is it Apple?
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.160]   Is it Adobe?
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.720]   I mean, the question is, it seems like there's
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.640]   a big tug of war.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.880]   So the big questions are, why is Apple doing this?
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.920]   Because we know it's not Adobe.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.520]   Adobe would love to be on the platform.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.600]   And who is really going to be missing out?
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.360]   Ryan, what do you think?
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.120]   Well, clearly Apple is not the loser.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.560]   I mean, it's certainly not like they can't sell iPhones
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.560]   without Flash.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.360]   In fact, up until about right now, almost nobody
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.640]   had Flash on their mobile phone.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.560]   So I don't think it's going to be something that's
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.960]   going to impact their bottom line too bad.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.280]   Adobe, obviously, not happy about this.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.880]   I think that ultimately the loser is every user who
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.600]   wants Flash on their mobile phone.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.120]   Although I would say anybody who wants Flash on their mobile
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.840]   phone is kind of a loser just in general,
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.680]   because Flash is a pro pro.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.400]   And should be stricken from the planet.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.800]   So you're not a big Flash fan?
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.440]   I hate Flash.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.600]   Veronica, what do you think?
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.040]   I was definitely-- I was going to agree
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.400]   that it's probably the users that do want Flash.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.640]   People have been asking for it for a really long time.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.040]   And it's kind of embarrassing now that the iPhone is pretty
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.560]   much the last platform for mobile that doesn't have it.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.200]   No, one of the things that Apple has said
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.840]   is that a lot of this has to do with battery power consumption
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.800]   and Flash requires a lot more than the typical HTML.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.240]   Andy, is that something that's an idea that you subscribe to?
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.200]   Yeah, also stability.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.840]   Every plug-in that you add to Safari makes it less stable.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.120]   And when you have an operating system like the iPhones,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.320]   one-- the Safari browser crashing
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.240]   is a big, freaking problem.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.600]   I mean, I'm willing to forgo the ability
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.080]   to punch a monkey while I'm waiting in line at the bank
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.480]   for added stability and fewer restarts on my phone.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.480]   But one of the things that I remember--
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.320]   But we are never having a phone.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.320]   We're not having a phone now.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.320]   We're not having a phone now.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.320]   We're not having a phone now.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.320]   But we are never having a phone now.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.320]   But we are never having a phone now.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.320]   But we are never having a phone now.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.320]   We're never having a phone now.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.320]   We're never having a phone now.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.320]   We're never having a phone now.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.320]   But we are never having a phone now.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.320]   But we are never having a phone now.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.320]   But we are never having a phone now.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.320]   But we are never having a phone now.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.320]   We are never having a phone now.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.320]   But we are never having a phone now.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.320]   But we are never having a phone now.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.320]   But we are never having a phone now.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.320]   But we are never having a phone now.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:16.320]   We are never having a phone now.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:23.320]   We are never having a phone now.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.320]   We are never having a phone now.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.320]   We are never having a phone now.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.320]   We are never having a phone now.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.320]   We are never having a phone now.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.320]   We are never having a phone now.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.440]   As the iPhone grows, as it gets more a larger and larger
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.840]   stake of that mobile market, does it get to a point where
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.480]   people stop developing flash on their websites?
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.520]   Because one of the differences, of course, from a lot of
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.600]   these web-enabled devices, these smartphones or whatever,
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.800]   a lot of them are only looking at the web version of a
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.880]   website.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.480]   The iPhone is just acting like a browser.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.600]   And as that becomes a larger percentage, I talk to a guy,
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.040]   and I think I might have talked to this on a previous
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.280]   Mac break, but I talk to a guy on an airport where
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.280]   their entire company is getting rid of all the flash on the
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.280]   website because the CEO bought an iPhone and couldn't get to
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.280]   their company's website.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.280]   That's great.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.280]   He was just like, "I want to get rid of all of it."
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.280]   I think it's an awesome thing.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.280]   It's the love.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.280]   Ryan, go ahead.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.280]   Adobe is staring down the barrel of the gun right now, and
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.280]   that gun is HTML5.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.280]   And pretty much every single thing in terms of rich media that
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.280]   flash has been able to do over the past decade.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.280]   Hold on one second.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.280]   Ryan?
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.280]   Yeah, can you hear me?
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.280]   Yeah, you just dropped out there.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.280]   Okay.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.280]   Well, anyway, just staring down the barrel of the gun.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.280]   Yeah, they're staring down the barrel of the gun.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.280]   It's HTML5.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.280]   Every rich media aspect that Adobe has built in the flash over
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.280]   the last decade is something that HTML5 should be able to do
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.280]   out of the box.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.280]   I mean, HTML5 with CSS stuff can do 3D graphics, it can do motion
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.280]   transitions, it can do embedded video, embedded audio.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.280]   All the stuff that we associate with flash as a plugin is going
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.280]   to be gone soon, hopefully, because HTML5 will take that
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.280]   over and put that at the browser level, which will be more,
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.280]   you know, faster performance, better battery life, and it'll
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.280]   just be all around much more usable and certainly compliant
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.280]   with web standards, which is what you want.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.280]   So, yeah, I mean, to hear that people are facing a flash,
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.280]   I mean, on my site, GDGT, we have one very, very small aspect
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.280]   of flash that we had to launch with, otherwise we couldn't get
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.280]   the feature out.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.280]   And I'm working like crazy behind the scenes to get it gone
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.280]   because everybody hates it.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.280]   Everybody hates seeing that one bit of flash and it just doesn't
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.280]   work right with everything else.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.280]   Now, one of the things that Apple has been, you hear constantly
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.280]   kind of flowing in and out of the conversation is SVG.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.280]   Do we think that that is going to be something that is really
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.280]   their answer to adding some of the interactivity that you would
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.280]   normally see in flash?
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.280]   Andy, do you know much about it?
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.280]   I don't know much about it.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.280]   I've been starting to gain more hip as to all the different
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.280]   varieties of software that are written using these toolkits.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.280]   I think the big deal is just the ability for developers to start
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.280]   writing applications that they can deploy on multiple platforms,
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.280]   including the iPhone.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.280]   They used to be a big shutout that if you're going to start
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.280]   writing something in shockwave or flash, one of the most popular
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.280]   and one of the most active online communities, online devices
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.280]   was sort of shut out to you.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.280]   Right.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.280]   No, yeah, I mean, SVG isn't a replacement for flash.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.280]   SVG is just a vector graphics format that's native to web
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.280]   browsers.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.280]   As far as I know.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.280]   Well, it's a big deal.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.280]   It's really HTML5 and the new CSS stuff that actually utilizes
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.280]   those things in graphics built into the browser to be able to kind
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.280]   of emulate a rich media experience.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.280]   Right.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.280]   I think that one of the things with the SVG is that because it has
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.280]   the vector and because you can add interactivity to that, you can
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.280]   do some of the region controls and also some of the animations
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.280]   that you would normally think of being done in flash.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.280]   You know, with SVG.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.280]   And so I know that there have been people that I've talked to
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.280]   about it and they said, oh, well, that's the direction that we
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.280]   would go.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.280]   But now the other thing that Adobe has done is try, they
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.280]   announce the ability to develop applications in flash for the
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.280]   iPhone.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.280]   They become full applications to the iPhone.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.280]   Does this make sense?
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.280]   I mean, does this, does it make sense for a developer to really
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.280]   go through the trouble of developing an application in flash
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.280]   rather than doing it natively?
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.280]   Well, if that's what they're building for other platforms,
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.280]   that gets to the point.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.280]   I think the larger point is that it gives video services the
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.280]   ability to leave to consider what if we were to just take the
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.280]   whatever Gizmo we have on our website that allows you to embed
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.280]   video hosted on our own site and simply develop a web application
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.280]   so that all of our video and all of our content that used to
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.280]   be shut out to every iPhone, iPhone user, what if we were to
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.280]   release a free application just for access and content on our
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.280]   site?
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.280]   That's just a sort of a flash playback system.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.280]   So really the big deal for me is that I didn't realize exactly
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.280]   how much content was being created based on flash.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.280]   So I don't know if it's any content that I was missing over
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.280]   the past couple of years.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.280]   That's the biggest question, I think.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.280]   At least that way you could kind of opt into a flash experience
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.280]   and didn't have to work with a buggy system within the browser.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.280]   You could say, oh, I want to go check out 12 seconds within the
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.280]   app and be able to see all that content without having it mess
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.280]   around with your Safari on iPhone.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.280]   You crash this one monkey punching app and nothing else.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.280]   Exactly.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.280]   Well, I think the interesting thing about that, though, is that
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:42.280]   it enables people who don't develop in Objective-C ostensibly
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.280]   to create iPhone apps.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.280]   If you're a flash developer, you could technically create an
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.280]   iPhone app.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.280]   It might be limited in a lot of ways.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.280]   You might not have some of the access to the hardware APIs
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.280]   or some of the other stuff that you might, if you actually
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.280]   really got your hands dirty and really developed a native iPhone
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.280]   app.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.280]   There's something we said for rapid deployment development,
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.280]   especially for people who are not traditional programmers.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.280]   Right.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.280]   I think for a simple application that makes sense, the danger,
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.280]   of course, is that I think that a lot of iPhone users, like
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.280]   myself, are very sensitive to the user experience.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.280]   I think Apple users in general are, I mean, Mac users in general,
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.280]   are sensitive to the experience where if anything feels like it's
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.280]   a little janky, we just go, "Ugh, this app."
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.280]   And we move on.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.280]   And I think that that's the -- I find myself using, for instance,
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.280]   if I can get -- I want every company that I work with to have
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.280]   their own little app for the iPhone rather than having to go
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.280]   to their website.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.280]   If I go to Hotwire, for instance, which is one of my pet peeves,
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.280]   I buy a lot of hotels on Hotwire.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.280]   And I have to go to their website.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.280]   I buy hotels, huh?
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.280]   Is this a monopoly?
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.280]   Yeah, I buy -- I don't buy the hotels.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.280]   I just borrow the room.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.280]   I get a -- last night I was in a -- I was right next to an
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.280]   elevator, wonderful thing of Hotwire.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.280]   So anyway, so the -- but the problem is dealing with all the --
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.280]   dealing with the web page is still -- it's fine when you're
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.280]   surfing.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.280]   It's a little bit more when you're inputting stuff into this
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.280]   little window.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.280]   And I find myself wanting them to have their own little
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.280]   application.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.280]   But if that application doesn't run like a real iPhone app,
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.280]   like really cleanly and real -- with all the stuff that, you
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.280]   know, Apple gives you so much stuff to write to.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.280]   The question is, is it doesn't make sense to -- if you don't
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.280]   know it very well, maybe it makes sense, but it seems like if
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.280]   you're going to build anything more than a basic little
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.280]   application that Flash would be a kind of -- you're going to have
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.280]   a hard time matching the same performance, don't you think?
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.280]   This is kind of a stretch, but wouldn't it be interesting if
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.280]   Apple developed a Flash application kind of the way that
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.280]   sends everything that comes from YouTube to the YouTube
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.280]   application, where you could view things in that environment as
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.280]   opposed to within the browser?
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.280]   Well, I mean, that's kind of -- isn't that kind of what Web
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.280]   apps -- the Web style for the iPhone app's work?
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.280]   Is it kind of gives you that little environment?
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.280]   It's kind of a mini environment that you'd have.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.280]   A lot of people don't use those as much.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.280]   Once the app -- that was kind of the cheat, right, to get on.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.280]   Well, it just means like a site that's completely developed for
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.280]   Flash, like, I always come on these restaurant sites, for
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.280]   example, and that it would actually open up the separate
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.280]   application so you could view it in that environment as opposed
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.280]   to in Safari.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.280]   And I think -- you go ahead.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.280]   I'm just saying, that's exactly how I would use that kind of
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.280]   application.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.280]   I visit a lot of artist sites, and artists want to show you
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.280]   exactly how artistic they are, so they don't just show you,
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.280]   "Here's my gallery of recent pictures."
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.280]   It's like I show you an 82nd animation there because I took
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.280]   -- I took a -- I went to the Learning Annex and took a course,
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.280]   and you can't get to the real content until you get there.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.280]   The only difficulty is that oftentimes these -- one of the
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.280]   banes of Flash-based designs is that they're designed for a
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.280]   certain minimum browser screen, and so a playback app would have
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.280]   to have some sort of a way to figure out how to deal with
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.280]   fitting that into a smaller screen, whether done through just
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.280]   a pinch and stretch or just scaling it down, that's one thing.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.280]   I think it's a different question, though, on mobile because
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.280]   most of the most useful things that a Flash app could do are
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.280]   things that iPhone apps would do very, very well.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.280]   A lot of the best apps that I use on my iPhone are not big
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.280]   industrial apps.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.280]   They're little gadgets that do one or two things and then go.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.280]   A lot of them even just break Apple user interface guidelines
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.280]   because all I need is a text field, a couple of little widgets
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.280]   and a button and a work, so that could be a really, really
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.280]   good place for Flash development.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.280]   >> Well, I got a question for all of you, actually, just while
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.280]   we're in the middle of this.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.280]   What are your most used -- do all of you have an iPhone?
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.280]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.280]   >> You don't?
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.280]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.280]   >> Oh, you do.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.280]   We all have an iPhone.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.280]   >> Thank you.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.280]   >> Okay.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.280]   >> I think I'll do it.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.280]   >> So what are the five -- what are the five apps that you
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.280]   think that you use the most on the iPhone?
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.280]   >> Oh, can I go first?
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.280]   >> Yes.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.280]   >> All right, I've got my iPhone right here, actually.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.280]   I use TripIt, TripIt Pro, quite a bit, Tweety.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.280]   I've just started using the Zipcar application, which I'm
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.280]   really excited about, and Dropbox and NetNewswire.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.280]   >> Very good.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.280]   Ryan?
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.280]   >> Let me take a look here.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.280]   Yeah, I'm a Tweety user as well.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.280]   I actually -- you know, I spend probably 80 to 90% of my time
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.280]   on my iPhone in the browser.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.280]   Big surprise there.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.280]   The email app, of course.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:16.280]   I use one called Ember, which is a campfire client, and then a
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:20.280]   bunch of other smaller apps for kind of single purposes, like
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:25.280]   4-square or convert or TripIt or sell tracker, stuff like that.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.280]   But yeah, you know what I mean?
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.280]   I'm thinking about this and how these might look and work as
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.280]   flash-based apps, and I kind of don't want that.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:39.280]   I mean, they all feel nice and native to the platform and quick,
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.280]   and like they were intended to be doing what they're doing.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.280]   And thinking about some person who is building this in flash to
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.280]   look like a flash app and then kind of porting that to the iPhone,
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.280]   I don't know that I'd want that with any of these apps.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.280]   Well, I think -- and I just think they look -- you know, the apps
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.280]   right now look pretty.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.280]   You don't mean within the iPhone, and so I'm not sure where I
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.280]   need to go with it.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:07.280]   I mean, I will admit that most of the web doesn't, but the iPhone
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.280]   apps work pretty well.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.280]   Andy, how about you?
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.280]   What are your big five?
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:16.280]   Big five, not including built-in apps, would be a GPS app,
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.280]   and right now I'm testing out 4-5, and I still can't tell you
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.280]   which one I like the best.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.280]   Tweety definitely.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.280]   I can tell you which one you like the best.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.280]   Okay, which one do I like the best?
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.280]   Tom, Tom.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.280]   Oh, you bought the Tom in?
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.280]   Well, I did.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.280]   It's the best one.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.280]   Well, sorry.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.280]   I bought them all.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.280]   It's -- no, I -- I -- I -- I acquired all of them.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.280]   I'm using my -- my Wonder Twin powers of being able to send an
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.280]   email to a company saying, "Please give me free copy for $100."
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.280]   I want to run about it.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.280]   But I -- I've only found two that are absolute losers, and each
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.280]   one of them says, "Guys, let's get you together in a room.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.280]   I'm going to give you each $50 to -- to give me one copy for my
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.280]   personal use only that takes this version -- this feature from
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.280]   your app, and this feature from your app, and the user interface
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.280]   from your app, and please give me the iTunes playback controls
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.280]   of your app over there."
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.280]   Right.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.280]   I don't -- I've not turned this into -- into a pick of the week
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:11.280]   about GPS apps, but the whole field is just still shaking itself
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.280]   out.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.280]   Tom, Tom, I think it's your default go-to if you have 90 bucks to
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.280]   spend, but otherwise there's -- ooh, isn't it -- isn't it nice that
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.280]   this one will -- will actually let me interrupt in the middle of
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.280]   a planned route and insert a little digression and put a
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.280]   wrap back where I was -- oh, that's lovely.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.280]   I love what that was.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.280]   [laughter]
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.280]   Yes, yes, I turned into a Faulkner-esque southern pop.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.280]   I talked about GPS, I can't help it.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.280]   But apart from that, GPS app to be named later, Tweety, of
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.280]   course, Air Sharing Pro can't live without a new app.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.280]   So, can't live without it.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.280]   Dropbox for similar reasons and ZenB lists.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.280]   If I have to come down to five, these are just ones off the top
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.280]   of my head.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.280]   But when I'm talking about those flashups, I'm talking about
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.280]   please, let's just stop selling tip calculators.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.280]   Please, let's just stop selling contribution calculators.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.280]   If you want to give them away for free, these are things
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:08.280]   where -- allow me to input two things and then click a button
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.280]   and then let's go.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.280]   I think we're seeing a lack of those kind of dashboard-esque
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.280]   little widgets that would work really, really well on the phone.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.280]   It seems like every time someone wants to do something simple
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.280]   like that, either they screw it up by just simply saying,
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.280]   "Hey, look, you can tell it was their second application
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.280]   after Hello World."
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.280]   And they said, "You know what?
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.280]   I can make at least $1,000 off of this if I release it as is.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.280]   Yeah, but if you wait a month, you'll figure out -- you'll know
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.280]   what you're doing in terms of building an iPhone interface
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.280]   and you'll actually do a good version of it."
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.280]   Right.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.280]   That's why it was kind of worth the wait to wait for a zip car
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.280]   and Dropbox because both the apps are really, really well done,
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.280]   especially the zip car one.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.280]   One downside I found to the Dropbox app is that I can't find a way
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.280]   to save files locally.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.280]   Like, say, for example, I save an iPhone background image
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.280]   that I want to use on my phone and I'm not syncing with iPhone
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.280]   anymore.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.280]   There's no way for me to download that file to my photos unless
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.280]   I take an actual screenshot of the photo while it's up in Dropbox.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.280]   Right.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.280]   It's still -- that whole integration of files is still a mess.
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.280]   Yeah, there's no local file system access.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:13.280]   So that is one of the many small things that I think kind of
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:18.280]   hardcore smartphone users have found over the years as it pertains
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.280]   to the iPhone.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:25.280]   Although I have to admit, my apps are mostly -- I mean, the app I use
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.280]   probably the most is Tweety.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.280]   And then after that, probably Auto Stitch.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.280]   Do you guys use Auto Stitch?
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.280]   I probably shoot like five panels a day with it.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.280]   And I've gotten really, really good at it.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.280]   And because I -- you know, just -- any time I want to see something,
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.280]   I want to see the whole thing at this point.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.280]   And Mint is something that I -- I don't know if I use it the most.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.280]   Oh, love Mint.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.280]   But I just don't know what I do without it.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:50.280]   And it's -- and then I use World Made a lot.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.280]   I travel a lot, so I'm on World Made all the time because it manages
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.280]   my flight schedules.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:59.280]   So I know -- because I hate having to open my laptop when I get to the airport.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.280]   So I just forward everything to trips it at World Made and it
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.280]   figures it all out and puts it all into an itinerary.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.280]   And then I have all my confirmation codes and where I'm going.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.280]   Oh, that's exactly what Tripit does.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.280]   I also use Flight Tracker Pro and that updates me on all my flight changes.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:18.280]   And I think that Leo -- I think Leo said he likes Tripit better or the same or whatever.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.280]   And I just -- you know, I hooked on the World Made and it's been so easy that it's --
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.280]   and I just -- oh, I don't know what I did without that.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.280]   Because there's so many times I walk into a hotel or they don't have my confirmation
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.280]   or I get to a flight and all of that stuff is all there.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.280]   And so I think I got somewhere near five of those.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.280]   And then, of course, Field Runners, which is just how I fill time between everything else.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:42.280]   Don't you find that if you were to make the pie chart of what makes your iPhone most important to you,
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.280]   there'll be those two or three apps that take up huge individual wedges.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:52.280]   But the rest of the pie is that big, sticky ball of rice of each individual little lap
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.280]   that you don't use more than three times a month, but the one time you need it, you're like,
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.280]   "Thank God I was stupid enough to download the silly little --
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.280]   the silly little access app because now I can do --
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:09.280]   by -- to me, it's like a little network status and network explorer apps where it's like,
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.280]   "Dang it."
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:16.280]   Just last week I had a net cam that I put in a storage about a year and a half ago
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.280]   and I used to actually have a little Post-it note saying,
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.280]   "Here's the IP address.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.280]   Here's how to get into the web server."
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.280]   But of course, I lost the Post-it note.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.280]   I was lucky enough just to find a power adapter for it.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.280]   And I'm like, "Oh, dang it.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.280]   I'll never be able to find it."
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.280]   "Wait, tap tap tap.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.280]   Here's the IP address.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.280]   Oh, I can actually open the embedded web browser for this button.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.280]   Good.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.280]   There you go.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.280]   That was 99 cents well spent.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.280]   Yeah, I mean, I --
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:44.280]   One of the coolest apps for me is the USAA -- I have a USAA account and it's a bank.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.280]   Oh, is that the one where you can take the pictures?
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.280]   You can take the pictures and check.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.280]   Oh, my God.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.280]   I'm so jealous of that.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.280]   So when I get checks from -- my other stuff is all auto-bill, but when I get -- you know,
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.280]   when I get any extra checks in that aren't my salary, whatever,
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.280]   I put them onto my USAA account.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.280]   It's just this crazy thing.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.280]   I'm sitting there going, "I'm taking a picture of this check and five minutes later,
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.280]   I will have access to that money."
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.280]   So awesome.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.280]   But don't you think that -- it seems like one of those features were four months from now
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.280]   if there's going to be a really bad problem and then we're going to be saying,
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.280]   "You know what?
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.280]   We really couldn't have been obvious to us that that was possible."
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.280]   We can't think of it what it is right now, but it's like, "Oh, you're right."
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.280]   What could possibly go wrong with this technology?
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.280]   Well, you know, they've been doing this for a long time.
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.280]   You know, my brother got me into it because he scans his.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:34.280]   So for a long time, you could scan them and email them.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.280]   So they've had this technology for a long time that they've been using,
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.280]   so they just applied it to this.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.280]   But it's just -- you keep on thinking that this should not work
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.280]   and someone's going to take advantage of it.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:47.280]   And somehow, so far, maybe they have insurance for that, maybe.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:53.280]   But I realized at some point that I had -- when I had to reload all of mine --
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:59.280]   I realized somehow I've accomplished either buying or acquiring 360 applications
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.280]   for my iPhone.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.280]   And I'm not really sure how it happened.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.280]   That's a lot of us.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:09.280]   You know, look, I'm totally with Andy on the kind of long tail of iPhone apps.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:15.280]   I think that's actually one of the things that the iPhone developer community has done
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:19.280]   to really build so much value around the iPhone as a platform.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:25.280]   But like I said, you know, I think the one app that I spend the most of my time in
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.280]   is still -- and will probably always be the browser, I don't know --
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.280]   Interesting.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.280]   And to bring this back to where we started, what's that?
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.280]   So boring.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.280]   You've got to get with the Oregon Trail.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.280]   Yeah, okay.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.280]   Anyway, so bring it back to where we started.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.280]   I think you still make sandwiches with mannehings instead of miracle whip.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.280]   That's how unhipp you are.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:48.280]   Anything that affects the browser experience, like Flash, is going to a big deal.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:54.280]   I mean, if Flash had a significant effect on a very small percentage of applications
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:59.280]   that you don't use very often, I don't think a lot of people would be so up in arms about
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:05.280]   its existence or lack thereof, I guess I would say, on the iPhone.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:10.280]   But because it's so core to one of the most primary experiences on the device, the browser,
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:17.280]   and because it can do both good and bad very quickly, I think that's one of the things
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:23.280]   that I think that's why we're all so passionate about what happens with Flash on the iPhone.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:30.280]   And now, here's -- moving on a little bit, is there -- there's a question of -- as we get
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:35.280]   all this stuff and we're moving on, you have -- Canada now is announcing that Bell and
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.280]   Tellus are going to be able to use the iPhone app as well.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:43.280]   We also have analysts saying that Apple could sell a lot more iPhones if they made it available.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.280]   Do we think that -- do we really think this is actually going to happen?
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:50.280]   Do we think we're going to see an iPhone that's available on Verizon on -- well, Verizon,
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.280]   I think, is really the one that everyone wants to -- that's what everybody wants, right?
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.280]   I never thought I'd want to go back to Verizon.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.280]   And now I kind of --
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.280]   I don't think it's going to happen.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:11.280]   I think that Apple made the smart move by doing a tri-band 3G HSDPA handset.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:16.280]   If they build a handset for Verizon, I mean, it will basically be only something that they
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.280]   could sell in North America.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.280]   They couldn't sell it outside of North America.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:26.280]   They're not enough 3G CDMA networks in the world to support it.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.280]   And they don't use the same standards as we do in the same frequencies.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:34.280]   So, like, South Korea has a 3G CDMA network, but you couldn't take that to South Korea.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:40.280]   So, Apple's Play was smart and they created a device that they could sell once, all the
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.280]   way around the world.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.280]   And that's been working really well for them.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.280]   It's hard -- I have a really hard time seeing them doing a handset just for Verizon.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:54.280]   Well, the question is because I've been told by some friends that there are chips that
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:26:00.280]   would let them do the 3G or the GSM as well as the CDMA.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:06.280]   And I have to admit, you know, I was just in Brazil last week and I had another phone,
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.280]   or made nameless.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:15.280]   And my iPhone had no service at all.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:20.280]   Yeah, but it's not that there's a lack of chips that handle the radio communications.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:25.280]   There have been chips that could do multiple communications.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.280]   And then there are world phones that you've been able to buy for years that do both CDMA
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.280]   and GSM.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.280]   It's really a question of radios.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:36.280]   It's a question of frequencies and it's a question of people can power.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:41.280]   And the iPhone basically has to be completely redesigned in order to support that.
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.280]   It's not just like, okay, take this chip out and put this chip in.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.280]   It has to transmit on completely different frequencies.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:52.280]   It has to be completely different communications stack in order to take advantage of CDMA.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.280]   It's not trivial.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.280]   I guess what I'm getting at.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.280]   It's not a small thing.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.280]   It's not trivial, but it's worth it.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.280]   I don't think that it's worth it for Apple.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:06.080]   I don't think it's worth it for Apple because from a PR standpoint, I mean, look, they're
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.080]   clearly selling a lot of phones.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.080]   I clearly think they're not going well with AT&T right now with them.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.080]   But here's the question I have about that.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.080]   You can't even know that it's AT&T.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.080]   Here's the point.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.080]   Here's the question I have about that.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.080]   Things aren't going well with AT&T.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.080]   I mean, everyone's complaining about the service.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:21.080]   And one of the things we were talking about when I was traveling was, you know, is it
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:25.360]   AT&T or is it just the fact that nobody uses their phone like an iPhone user when it comes
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.800]   to hitting the network?
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:31.920]   And this would be a problem for any phone company.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.760]   I mean, is this, do we think that this is something that's AT&T specific or do we think
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.040]   that it is something that is really just the fact that iPhone users are just slamming the
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.320]   network a lot harder than a regular phone user?
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:48.120]   Yeah, but that doesn't really change the fact that it's a really bad situation for both
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:53.760]   AT&T and Apple at this point where people can't connect and use the 3G connections and,
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.040]   you know, get their email and make their calls.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.600]   And it's not a good situation either way you look at it.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:03.160]   So why not take that next step and make it available for more users and maybe take the
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.160]   brunt off of AT&T?
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.800]   Yeah, some ways it would be doing AT&T a favor because it would take a little pressure off
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.480]   of their system, right?
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.840]   So it's just one of those things that it's very curious.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:21.960]   I mean, I would really, to me, a perfect environment would be a Verizon phone with, which I guess
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:27.480]   is what was the original idea in my iPhone.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.960]   But it appears that so far the iPhone trumps the thing.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.960]   But that's the number one thing.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.960]   I said the number one thing.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.120]   I think people that when I talk to them, I guess the two things that people say when
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.760]   they don't get an iPhone, which is like the four people left in San Francisco.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.920]   I mean, literally, I mean, it is in New York in San Francisco where I was in the last two
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.920]   days.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:49.000]   You just, you don't, it's like almost every single phone is an iPhone, which is, of course,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.480]   why the coverage is so bad.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.720]   But there always, it's the tactile keyboard and the, and coverage is the only two things
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.880]   that it seems to be the issue.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.600]   And did you guys see the little tactile thing that you can fit onto your iPhone?
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.560]   I kind of, I got to be honest, I kind of want one.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.560]   Do you?
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.560]   I really do.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.440]   The lack of the keyboard has always been my biggest complaint about the iPhone.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.440]   I just never really liked it.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:13.440]   I haven't heard about this.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.200]   How does it work with the, I mean, you have to have a finger touch on the screen for it
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.200]   to work.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.520]   It's, it's like a, it's like a rubber panel that basically you put on and it, it has
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:26.080]   a key that overlays on top of each virtual key.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.120]   And when you press it down, it gives you that, that tactile feedback.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:32.400]   Now, does it, what does it do when you change the, what does it do when you change the
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.400]   screen?
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.400]   Like when you change the
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.400]   Chantal.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.640]   It's for, it's for portrait orientation only.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.680]   And also when you, but when you change it to like symbols, how does it, how does it
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.680]   handle it?
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.680]   Oh yeah.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.680]   I mean, you're, you're kind of screw out.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.960]   Like it's not a practical solution.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:48.960]   It's the same thing.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.520]   When you realize that you're, when you realize that you're drinking mouthwash, that's the
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.280]   time to understand that you might have a problem with alcohol and you need to start addressing
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.280]   that.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.920]   If you're, if you're so addicted to tactile feedback that you're thinking of getting
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:04.880]   this stupid little rubber device, just yeah, it's, yeah, exactly.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:09.600]   You need to rethink your relationship to tactile keyboards or your relationship to the iPhone.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.800]   I just don't want to commit that.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.560]   You're calling me out of Naka.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.800]   It sounds like you're calling me out, buddy.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   Well, we're all here.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:19.400]   I would also call you out of that.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:24.160]   Before, before you get into a, into a rough and tumble with Andy, I just want to remind
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.080]   you that he wears tactical pants.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.080]   You know, I, you know, but, but, but we're not here in a threatening manner.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:34.160]   I think we all like to go around the room and each of us will talk to you about how your
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.400]   abuse of tactile keyboards has affected each one of us personally.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.920]   Now Alex, would you like to start and remember this is a place of safety and peace.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.920]   We're not here to judge.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.560]   We're just here to look.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:47.760]   This is, this is a basic human need though, the ability to kind of.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:51.120]   Well, how body interfaces with an object and you don't get that.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.000]   He keeps telling me I don't have haptic feedback.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   It's really hurtful.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.360]   But I mean, it's, it's also, it's also an important need to have a keyboard that actually
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.360]   works.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:05.600]   And the number of tactile keyboards that I've used that works even modestly, I can, I can
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.240]   think of maybe two.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:11.240]   We're asked, I can easily get 30 words permitted out of the virtual keyboard on the iPhone.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:16.360]   I mean, the, the, the biggest issue with the Palm pre was that the keyboard, it's, it's
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.160]   tactile, but it's damn near decorative and function.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:23.120]   You just cannot use it for anything except for to look at it and say, hi, I guess I've
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.120]   got what I wanted for.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.320]   I wished on the monkey paw and this is what it gave me.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.560]   Damn you monkey paw.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.320]   And I think with all of these phones, I mean, as I've been testing a couple of different
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:34.960]   phones and it feels like the, the, the real issue isn't that the iPhone is that great.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.960]   It's just that the rest of them are.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:43.640]   I mean, it's like, it's like the iPhone is like a third string pro basketball player
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.920]   playing in a high school league.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:49.200]   I mean, that's, that's all I feel there's always complaints about, but it's like, you
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.000]   know, I just think that there's, there's like, there's a great amount of genetic diversity
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.160]   in the handset market.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.280]   I'm very, very glad for that.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.080]   I'm very, I think that all the entire computer industry should be like the handset market
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:02.520]   where if you want to go out and find a machine that works specifically the way that you wanted
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.960]   to, you're not forced to settle really.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.160]   You can find a little candy bar phone.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.680]   You can find a phone with a really nice big tactile keyboard.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:15.280]   You can find an awesome touchscreen keyboard, a touchscreen machine.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.280]   It's all out there.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.280]   You just have to decide what you want.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.280]   That's out there.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.280]   Right.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.680]   Well, that's, that's a very idealistic way of looking out of it.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:25.720]   I think we all know that the iPhone is in a kind of a different league than your average
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:31.560]   Symbian handset or your average MAMO handset or most of the device is running Android right
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.200]   now pretty much anything with Windows Mobile.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.960]   I mean, there, there's a very large, you know, divide there.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.520]   And, and that's part of the reason why I've stuck with the iPhone, even though there are
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.560]   a lot of things about it that, that kind of drive me nuts.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.560]   There's a divide, but it's a philosophical divide.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:50.280]   I think that the iPhone is the ultimate phone for someone who wants one device that does
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:56.200]   at all for someone who wants a really powerful handheld computer that's based around communications.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:00.440]   But if you want the ultimate email machine, the iPhone is not the ultimate email machine.
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:05.680]   If you want the ultimate in comfort, size and convenience, also probably not the iPhone.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.920]   But that's what that's what I'm getting at.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.200]   If you want power, you go for iPhone.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:14.880]   If your needs are specific and kind of laser focused, the world starts to open up for you
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.880]   a little bit after that.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:23.880]   No, I just segue into some of some other news here from this because we have some some folks
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.880]   that aren't on very often.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.000]   We've talked a lot about the tablet.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.560]   Veronica and Ryan, are you tablet fans?
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.760]   Are you hoping to see a tablet?
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.360]   I kind of go either way.
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.720]   I'm not not really that interested in having a tablet myself.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.720]   You're not.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.880]   I've got mixed feelings.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:45.720]   I mean, I can definitely see myself taking advantage of when I use an iPod touch around
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.120]   the house as a mini tablet.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:52.320]   Again, I spend a lot of time in the browser.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.160]   It's got a great browser and it's fast.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.360]   I use that for the kind of in-home tablet computing things.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.680]   So people have something with a larger screen.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.120]   Potentially, high resolution would be nice.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.640]   But this room are going around that Steve keeps tabling the tablet because it's not
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:11.840]   good for anything except browsing the web on the toilet.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.800]   That's why tablets never really took off.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:19.560]   It's a very vertical oriented device style.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.120]   It's good for doctors.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.520]   It's good for engineers in the field.
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.520]   It's good for couples.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.520]   It's good for couples.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.440]   But it's not really good for end users.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.520]   There's just not a lot of reason to own one.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.520]   Interesting.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:35.040]   Yeah, because I know that people have heard me on the show go crazy.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.360]   We almost developed a tablet.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.920]   So I spent a lot of time paying attention to it.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:44.440]   For us, it was just this interface where I could be a little further away from it.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:48.240]   That was all I needed because I was like, if I could just move this iPhone another three
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:56.920]   feet from where I'm at and still watch stuff, I'd probably use a TV 10% of the time.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.280]   It was just one of the things that I could just move it around and have something, whether
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.000]   it's how-tos or training tutorials.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.360]   It just seems like the iPhone real estate is just a little not quite enough.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:11.200]   I mean, it looks like a backbook air that had a hinge that you could flip the screen around
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:15.360]   and turn it into a tablet and then still be able to flip it up and use it as a regular
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.120]   netbook or laptop.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.640]   Then that might be interesting just for design purposes.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.040]   I think that would be neat to have and see.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:27.400]   But yeah, I don't have a reason to use a tablet really other than occasional home use.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:34.480]   Is anybody going to pay $1,500 to $1,700 for that base?
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.480]   Not even fully equipped.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.160]   I mean, the promise of-
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.400]   Oh, we can put your books from them.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:43.120]   This kind of home tablet devices is that they're in that kind of range in between maybe a
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.280]   netbook and a cheap PC.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.800]   Well, if it's designed like a-
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.800]   Oh, right.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.800]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:54.000]   If it's designed like a netbook or a cheap PC, there's really no reason to build a tablet
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   to begin with.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Exactly.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.480]   I think that's what the tablet's going to really start to take off as soon as one smart
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:05.960]   company, perhaps based in Northern California, decides to start off with the idea of what
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.360]   is the need for a tablet.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.720]   That is not being sold right now.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.760]   What needs are not being addressed.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:16.880]   I think one of the keys is going to be the idea of having just the square of electronics
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.080]   that can do pretty much anything you expected to do.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.960]   I was having a conversation with somebody just a couple of days ago about eBooks.
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:27.520]   They were considering getting a Kindle book reader, and I love my Kindle, but you really
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:32.800]   have to be a reader to justify spending 300 bucks on a device that pretty much does nothing
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.400]   but read books.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.400]   I was having conversations a lot-
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.320]   But that device does need a clear need.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:42.600]   That's why the Kindle is doing really well, is because it's very easy to understand what
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.160]   that need is.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.960]   It's very difficult to understand what the need of its tablet would be.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.600]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.600]   It's continuing.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.600]   Continuing.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.440]   I was having a conversation with somebody about netbooks.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:57.440]   They don't have a need in their life for a $300, $400 cheap Windows PC that doesn't do
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.800]   a whole lot.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:04.320]   But the idea is that if you start to sell, I've got a $500 device that will do $50 worth
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.600]   of the need you had for 10 different devices.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.840]   A lot of people will go for that.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.240]   It doesn't have to be the perfect book reader because they don't want the perfect book reader.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.200]   It doesn't have to be the perfect net book because they're not looking for the perfect
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.200]   netbook.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:19.520]   All you have to do is convince people is find the nicest range of features that integrate
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:23.560]   each other well enough that people think, "Stop thinking of it as their book reader."
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.520]   They stop thinking of it as their media device.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:29.920]   They start thinking of it as their eye tablet, and it's a device that they use for a bunch
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.360]   of different things.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:35.120]   I think that's the best solution that we're going to find for the e-book reader market.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:39.120]   I think that it's inevitable that within five or 10 years, print publishing is going
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:43.600]   to be much, much, much muted from what it is even today.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:48.080]   But we're still going to have problems gaining people to spend more than $100 on a dedicated
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.080]   book reader.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:52.080]   But once again, if we have a tablet-sized device that does a million different things,
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.960]   and one of the things that does very well is help you to display and read books, then
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:58.280]   I think that that's going to help crack that market as well.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:03.120]   I have to laugh because I just have to laugh because I just did a mock-up design of that
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:06.560]   exact device for a magazine laughing at me perfectly.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:12.800]   I don't want people to think I stole that idea from you on the show because I've already
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:16.560]   done the whole mock-up design.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:20.480]   Just privately tell me which site you did it for so that when it appears all over the
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:25.400]   web, I could say, "I suspect this isn't an authentic Apple device, and I'm going to use
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:29.040]   the keys and keys and keys to the UI."
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.400]   I find that I'm waiting.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.640]   I was going to get the Kindle, and then I just decided that I did the same thing with the
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:35.640]   phone.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:40.920]   I hung onto my trio forever until the iPhone came out.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:44.000]   I was talking to somebody about this this morning.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.200]   95% of my phone use is not phone.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.040]   It's not music even for my iPhone.
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.960]   You think of it as a carrying around.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:56.160]   I watched some movies, and then I use all those apps.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.080]   For me, having a slightly larger screen would be a big boom.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:05.600]   To me, being able to have color images in my books and being able to have interactivity
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.240]   in my books, I think is the thing that I'm more interested in than having what's being
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.040]   provided and what will be provided on these readers.
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.000]   My problem is I just don't want to deal with that many items.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.840]   I'm trying to reduce the number of things that I have in my backpack because it's gotten
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.680]   a little insane.
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:21.680]   It's great.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:25.880]   Now that I have the 3GS, the four devices that I would take in the car with me on any
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:29.600]   duration outside the office is now collapsed down to one.
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.560]   I think that's another feature that I often leave the house with a netbook because if
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:36.280]   I'm going to be gone for three or four hours, I don't know what kind of email I'm going
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.520]   to get from an editor in that time because they're expecting me to change something.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.800]   I would not necessarily bring in a laptop with me.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:46.200]   Again, if I have that one device that does all that great stuff for me, bonus, I would
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.200]   spend money for that.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:51.400]   I think the one of the things is that the hardest thing to do is the interface for any
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:56.680]   hardware device and the question is how many people would allow you to start doing this
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.240]   interface.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.600]   I want to be able to control my car.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.600]   I want to be able to control my fridge.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.880]   I want to be able to control all these things.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:07.080]   I just want a little thing to just click it in or I just do it from wherever and turn
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.360]   the microwave on.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:13.440]   The thing is to have all the tools that Apple gives me for the interface rather than having
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.680]   them try to figure out how to put it into physical buttons which seems insane at this
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.680]   point.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.200]   I think that that's the thing that gets me the most excited.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.200]   We've got a floating variable interface.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.480]   We've got a couple things coming up.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.920]   New Mac Mini is getting short in supply.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.160]   Apple taking a higher percentage.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.440]   But before we get to that, we just want to thank one of our sponsors, GoToMeeting.
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.120]   Of course, you've heard Leo talk about this a lot.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.600]   The average business cost this day is a thousand bucks.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.160]   I can attest that that's pretty accurate.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.600]   The problem is that you get into all these face-to-face meetings.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:49.040]   You try to make all these work, but you actually limit the number that you do and how you do
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.800]   them because it's just too expensive.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.400]   It takes too much time.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.440]   We got to find ways to be more efficient.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.840]   With GoToMeeting, you can do that for just $49 a month.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.080]   GoToMeeting, of course, is easy to use.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.320]   You can start GoToMeeting with a single click.
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:09.760]   Everyone can see what's on your computer desktop on their screen so that they can follow along.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:14.080]   It includes voice over IP and phone conferencing.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.680]   What you can do is you can set up that meeting, the thing that you are going to sit next
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:23.240]   to someone and talk about, whether it's a sales presentation, product demos, training
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:27.440]   sessions, collaborating on documents, all of these things.
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:33.600]   Instead of having flying all the way out there or driving all the way in, whatever that might
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.760]   be, you can simply do that virtually.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:40.720]   GoToMeeting is just such a great solution for that.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:44.480]   It's a great way to make sure that you keep having the meetings that you need to have,
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:49.640]   especially in time when things are a lot harder to do that, but you don't have to leave your
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.600]   house, leave your office, so on and so forth.

[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:07.320]   Really, try gotomeeting.com.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.880]   Try having a couple meetings.
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:13.720]   If you'll have a free 30 days to test it out, and it's just a great solution.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:18.960]   If you're trying to stay connected without getting into the car, or in the plane, or
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:25.200]   in the hotel room and all the other mess that that creates.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.960]   We also have the Mac Mini Pool.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:33.400]   The rumor is that the Mac Mini Pool is getting shallow.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.400]   Have you guys seen this?
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.560]   This is according to Apple Insider.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.840]   They're starting to become resaleurs or getting advised of a two to three-week delay.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:46.720]   Now, of course, this usually means that we're going to see new Mac Mini's coming out.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:47.720]   That usually is the rumor.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:52.040]   Now, we have rumors also that as early as tomorrow, next week or the week after, we're
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:56.200]   going to see new iMacs, which is, of course, predictable given that I just bought.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.200]   I have Lea Whiteis.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.920]   I have this thing called Lea Whiteis.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.920]   It comes from being in the office here with Leo Too Long.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.680]   You start getting this thing where as soon as you buy it, you know that, and I bought
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:10.480]   a bunch of Mac Mini's for our servers, our little key servers that we have at the office.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.360]   I just bought some new iMacs.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.360]   Of course.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.680]   They're going to be new now.
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.400]   Do we think that we're really going to see?
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:21.120]   What would you change other than just speeding up the Mac Mini?
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.120]   Anything?
[00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.120]   Cheaper.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.120]   I mean, cheaper?
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.880]   That's the one feature that's missing.
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:32.520]   We need to have a $349 netbook priced Mac Mini.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:37.920]   You can't have people choosing between a $650 tower, Windows machine, and a $650 Mac Mini
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.920]   Hotplate.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:39.920]   Right.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.960]   That's definitely part of it.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:46.480]   Just because there are new Mac Mini's coming doesn't necessarily mean they're going to
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:52.680]   be new capital N. They could just be upgrades.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:56.480]   I don't know if we necessarily need to assume that they're going to be completely overhauled
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:00.040]   and almost unrecognizable from what we know today as a Mac Mini.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.040]   Maybe just move faster.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.040]   I'd be in the back.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.680]   It's a PC hardware.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.920]   It gets upgraded all the time.
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:08.160]   I'd love to see the HD mineport, of course.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:13.720]   But that would imply that the Mac Mini would be used in a home theater and Apple really
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:14.720]   doesn't want that.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:17.720]   But you can buy that Apple TV.
[00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:18.720]   I know.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.920]   But the thing is, is that's what everybody uses them for?
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.440]   My Mac Mini is a home theater.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:23.440]   That's what it does.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:28.600]   Everybody I know that has a Mac Mini at home, it is like the Apple TV on steroids.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.880]   I mean, that's what we use it for.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:30.880]   We don't use it for...
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.760]   I don't know anybody that uses a Mac Mini.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:37.400]   What we use Mac Mini's for in the office, no one works on a Mac Mini.
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:41.960]   We have Mac Mini stacked up that we use for serving keys to the Picscore members.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:42.960]   And then we have...
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:43.960]   And then the ones at home.
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.360]   And we have one that manages assets.
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:50.160]   And then we have one at home and that's my media server.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.880]   And it seems like that's what people use these for.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:52.880]   They don't seem to...
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.800]   I'm not saying they're not capable of it, but that's what people don't think of them,
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.440]   I think, or a lot of people that I know don't seem to think of them as real computers.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.560]   They buy iMacs if they want a real computer.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.760]   It would be a very judo style move.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:07.720]   It would allow Apple to make it much, much, much more attractive to this home theater market,
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:11.640]   which I think is the biggest market for the Mac Mini at this point, without having to support
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:15.760]   that market, without having to really promote this as a home theater device.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:20.520]   But it would really emphatically say, "Oh, this is the greatest home media system ever."
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:24.680]   Again, having their own unpaid evangelist spreading out and encouraging people to buy
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.920]   this cute little hot plate device.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.400]   Well, why not just discontinue the Apple TV and merge the technologies together?
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.400]   Damn good question.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.400]   I wish I hadn't answered that.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.640]   A question that I would ask for two years.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.160]   What would you take from each one?
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:42.480]   I mean, the only thing you really need from the Apple TV is the HDMI, isn't it?
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.480]   I'd want HDMI.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:47.760]   I would also want that 12-foot user interface.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:51.360]   It's the idea of simply throwing in the HDMI port and then pretending that this market
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:56.000]   doesn't exist is attractive because then they don't have to write their own software for
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.200]   a home media serving, excuse me, a media viewing.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:07.040]   But if they were to actually rev the Apple TV, it's been so far surpassed by all of these
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:10.040]   open source home media center products.
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.520]   Here's a phrase you don't hear often on this show.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.080]   It's been way surpassed by Windows.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.680]   Windows, Microsoft did something smarter a number of years ago.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:21.240]   They used to have a separate product called the Media Center PC that was designed for
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.240]   home theater use.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.280]   Then they suddenly realized that no one was really buying these machines, but they took
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:30.240]   that really great software, that wonderful remote control five-button interface and made
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:34.400]   it part of the media playing experience on every copy of Windows.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:39.560]   If you do have this thing plugged into a big TV, you just have a cheap little remote and
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:44.560]   you can access the entire library, plugins for YouTube, plugins for Amazon, plugins
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.880]   for Netflix, and it works beautifully.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.680]   That's a sort of software that they'd have to really come up to the plate with if they
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:53.920]   were going to start to competitively work in this market.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.680]   That's why I've been really worried about the Apple TV.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:01.240]   That's the epitome of what home theater was like in 2001-2002.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:06.680]   I think that just one of what I was going to say is that I found that I was very excited
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.920]   about my Apple TV until I got a Roku.
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:13.800]   Once I have the Roku, using all the other devices just faded away.
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:14.800]   Okay.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.160]   You start right with Foxy on it.
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:21.040]   But what if your Apple TV had the ability to do Netflix streaming and have the ability
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.040]   to do MLB.com?
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.880]   That's the story I'm talking about.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:28.920]   Right now you can buy DVD players and Blu-ray players that have that Netflix streaming built
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:29.920]   into it.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:30.920]   Right.
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.920]   You were going to say Ryan?
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:37.680]   No, it's interesting that Andy brought up Media Center because that is actually I think
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.440]   one of the best products that Microsoft has made.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.200]   They don't get a lot of credit for it.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.160]   Yes, it runs on Windows.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:46.920]   If you're a listener of the show, you probably are not too stoked about that fact.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:50.280]   But the actual Media Center interface is really, really good.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.920]   They did an amazing job on it.
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:56.120]   What I was going to mention, I think the one big differentiator there and one of the things
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:01.600]   that gets people to buy into the Media Center vision is not only the fact that it connects
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:06.560]   with devices like the Xbox 360 as kind of an extender.
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:11.440]   So you could have the central library of content and then it gets pushed out to other televisions
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:13.760]   around the home to your network.
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:17.400]   But the fact that that device is also designed as a DVR.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:18.440]   It can record television.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:23.920]   You can plug in a cable card tuner or an ATSC tuner or an NTSC tuner and it will act as
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:24.920]   a DVR.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.240]   It can completely replace your TiVo.
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.520]   That's an intended function.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:35.120]   It's not a hacker, a cluge and be it front row or the interface on the Apple TV.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.640]   Neither of those scenarios are designed to replace your DVR.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:42.080]   I think that's part of the thing that's really holding you back.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.840]   Do you want a DVR?
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.520]   I mean, do you care if you can stream everything?
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:48.520]   Does it matter?
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:51.720]   Do you really want to record all of those pieces?
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:56.840]   I mean, now that I have Netflix and I have streaming, I don't really feel like I don't
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:58.360]   record that often.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:01.600]   My whole thing is I've got all the long order and that I could possibly.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.080]   How would I watch my stories?
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:04.760]   I need to watch my stories.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:05.760]   Okay.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:07.720]   What was I thinking there?
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:13.120]   That's actually one of the reasons why I think that Apple TV has to be sort of a dead
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:16.560]   end product at this point because Hulu is great.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:21.480]   But there are only one or two sites like that where commercial content providers are
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:23.160]   focusing on one service.
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:26.800]   If I want to get Craig Ferguson's monologue from last night, I can't go to Hulu.
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.520]   I have to go to CBS.com.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:33.800]   And the same as if I want to get a COBEL report stuff after go to COBELBARNATION.com.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:37.840]   Really, the fulcrum of streaming media and streaming entertainment is still going to be
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.400]   damn it, just the plain regular web browser.
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.520]   It isn't the argument for the Mac Mini.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:46.920]   The main reason that I went to the Mac Mini is that with a wireless keyboard and a wireless
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:52.280]   mouse, I could sit there on my couch and I can watch, I can hit whatever it is, hit
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:56.320]   my little controller and boom, I've got the standard, this nice big interface and I can
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.320]   watch stuff that I have on Drive.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:03.800]   But I can immediately go right back to that and go up to watching stuff from a live station
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:09.280]   or streaming or I can watch Hulu or any of those things.
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.800]   And that dual purpose is part of what makes the Mac Mini I think a much better solution
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:13.800]   than the Apple TV.
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.440]   Well, let me tell you about this really cool device that's going to be coming out from
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.160]   ASOS in about a month or two.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:21.360]   I saw it two months ago and I can't wait to get my lunar unit.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:27.280]   It's essentially a modern take on the Commodore 64.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:31.160]   After that selling point, it's a win.
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.160]   Sign me up.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.160]   Yeah, no.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:39.640]   Imagine a regular sized USB keyboard that has a complete netbook style PC built into
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:47.080]   it and it has HDMI out and it also has an iPhone touch screen built into it.
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.440]   So essentially you just plug this thing into your TV set.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:56.760]   Not only does it turn your big 1080p or 720p TV into a computer monitor, but now that's
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:57.760]   the focus.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.680]   That's where you're getting all your media from.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.240]   I can put iTunes on it and so Stream Media from now.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:07.000]   I have every feature from the Apple TV and even if you're just sort of that bopping around,
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.400]   it's essentially a dual screen system.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:12.560]   If I just want to tweet about amazing race while I'm watching amazing race, I don't even
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:15.600]   need to minimize anything on my TV.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:19.120]   I can just do it all through that nice tiny little touch screen that's inside the keyboard.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:23.760]   So this is like the anti-tablet.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.480]   This is absolute.
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:28.280]   It's on the polar opposite of we're not going to give you a screen.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:30.040]   We're just going to give you a little keyboard.
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:32.040]   We're going to have a cassette interface.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.920]   We're going to say right.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:34.920]   No USB.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:35.920]   Go ahead.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.440]   Andy, you're talking about the EPC keyboard, right?
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:45.360]   I think the only unfortunate thing about that is that that screen is not actually an auxiliary
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:47.680]   display that you can do stuff like that.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.280]   I think it's just meant for widgets, right?
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.160]   So it's just like icons and you can bring up a widget or something like that.
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.160]   No, it's just a regular.
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:58.600]   You can't actually use it as like a second monitor basically, right?
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:02.200]   No, the operating system sees it as an auxiliary display.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:03.200]   Oh, nice.
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:10.560]   Or at least I should mention that I've had only like 25 minutes with the time with it.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.800]   And so I haven't actually broken one out.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.920]   That's the result of asking a direct question and getting a direct answer when you're talking
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.600]   to media, marketing people.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.360]   Okay, direct question, direct answer.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.960]   I'll put a star next to that one meeting.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.720]   I'm going to have to check to make sure if that's actually true or not.
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:26.440]   That's usually how that works.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.520]   No, moving on.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:33.760]   Have you seen the news that is it FyStar or Fister?
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:34.760]   FyStar.
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:35.760]   FyStar.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:36.760]   FyStar.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:37.760]   Sorry.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.640]   You're teasing.
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.840]   So anyway, they have announced a new OEM.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.440]   This is according to Mac News Network.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:50.400]   A new OEM licensing program designed to spread the company's virtualization, spreading the
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.720]   evil love all over the internet.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:57.320]   Subscribers of the program can gain access to the company's Darwin Universal Boot Loader,
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:02.000]   which allows users to install Mac OS X on a PC.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.880]   Now the question is, is number one, who would be interested in this and would they really
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.720]   want to go down into that fire pit?
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:13.640]   Now this is more like 50 minutes before the end of the Bond movie where the villain knows
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:18.720]   his scheme has failed, but I was just going to ruin everything by detonating the bomb anyway.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:22.760]   Just to spite Bond and then all the forces are good.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:27.040]   I can't imagine anybody given the trouble that they were having, just trying to put one machine
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.960]   on the market without getting sued into oblivion.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.800]   I don't know why anybody would really back this.
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.680]   If they open sourced it, that'd be another thing because we all know that that's like
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:35.680]   peeing in the pool.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:36.680]   You're not getting that back.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:37.680]   Right.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:38.680]   But I just like.
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:39.680]   I kind of love it.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.120]   I love it every time they do something like this.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.200]   It's just they have such coenas about the whole thing.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.200]   It cracks me up.
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:47.120]   Why are you being such jerks about this?
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:48.120]   Come on.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.680]   Just want us to do it.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.680]   God.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:53.440]   Well, I mean, is that the is the final play just to make it open source?
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:57.200]   I mean, like we're not going to this isn't going to work for us and we're just going
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:02.120]   to let anybody anybody do it rather than trying to try to make this work.
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.680]   Yeah, that's the Parthian shot.
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:07.640]   I mean, just you use the wheel around fire some arrows back at you.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:09.840]   I mean, you're going to die, but at least going to take a few.
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:13.400]   You're going to you're going to annoy Apple while you die, which is the best way to die.
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:16.160]   If you can't die, here is deaf, annoy people while you're dying.
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.480]   Well, you put all the work into it.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:20.400]   You know, you got to get something out of it, at least some notoriety.
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:21.400]   And true.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:23.840]   They definitely have that by now.
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:24.840]   That's for sure.
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:25.840]   Yeah, I.
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:27.680]   That's kind of way.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:30.760]   I get excited about that, but I just go, Oh, I just not.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:34.880]   Life is too short, you know, to get into a fight that I don't need to get into.
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:36.920]   I imagine I guess that didn't.
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:42.600]   I don't know how someone there at Pfister didn't know that this was going to be that
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:44.600]   much trouble.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.840]   I maybe they did.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.960]   Maybe they just thought it was a fight worth a fight worth fighting.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:56.440]   So also in the news, we've got Apple dropping the Apple drops the Chamber of Commerce.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:01.000]   I don't know from how high, but but evidently now the question I have, so Apple's dropping
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.840]   the Chamber of Commerce because of concerns over climate issues.
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:10.240]   The Chamber of Commerce oftentimes is trying to fight against almost all of those any kind
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:13.000]   of regulation that would affect their members.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.240]   Apple is has been doing a lot to try to kind of buff up their their green view.
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.240]   Is this something that do we see?
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:24.440]   Do we think this is a reaction to the years ago stuff that Greenpeace was doing talking
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:28.560]   about Apple damaging the environment with their production processes?
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.560]   Absolutely.
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:33.840]   I mean, they've made a big push, at least in the public eye to try to appear more green.
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:37.320]   And you know, they're talking about all their materials being a lot more less damaging to
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.320]   the environment.
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.360]   And they're trying to get away from that whole stigma.
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.680]   And I think it's a good move on their part personally.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:47.160]   Yeah, I guess my question is what are the advantages of being in the Chamber of Commerce?
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:50.520]   Do they have like a, do they have like a little club?
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.320]   You get really big t-shirts and nugs.
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:54.960]   Handcake breakfast is first and first Saturday of every month.
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:58.440]   I was like, when I saw that they had dropped out of the Chamber of Commerce, I was like,
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:00.160]   I thought that was only for little cities.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.160]   Right.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:05.760]   I mean, that's like the guy who runs the Tire Center, a guest and the guy with the print
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:06.760]   shop.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.720]   I mean, to me, I have to admit that to me, the Chamber of Commerce is the place that I
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:13.720]   used to go when I needed a map of a small town.
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.480]   Like that was the, you know, if you need like a little paper map, this is before the
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:20.320]   Google map, you know, when I was, I used to, I used to be a process server.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:23.040]   So you got really good at figuring out how to find people.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.680]   And many years ago, 20 years ago.
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:30.480]   And, and, and so the, the one thing you always did is you always knew where the Chamber of
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:33.440]   Commerce is so that you get a map of the city, map of the town.
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:36.120]   And, but that's about all I knew that they really did.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:40.880]   But evidently they also spend a lot of time fighting regulation.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:42.920]   So which I guess is their job.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:43.920]   So last.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:45.720]   It looks like the Chamber of Commerce is making more regulation.
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:46.720]   Sorry.
[00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:49.600]   Trying to keep, I'm just saying this Chamber of Commerce seems like they're trying to,
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:53.480]   well, actually they're opposing the climate change legislation that they're trying to
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:54.480]   go through.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:57.760]   It's interesting to see what other companies are, are dropping from the Chamber like Nike
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.960]   and Exelana and PG&E.
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:03.080]   It's just they've, they're in good company in terms of, you know, throwing their weight
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.080]   around.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.880]   Well, I mean, I think that, and this isn't really that much of a conversation for, for
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.360]   Mac break.
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:12.320]   But it really seems like we're kind of moving into an era where half the regulation is just
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:14.000]   the, the regulation of public opinion.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.040]   It doesn't matter what the laws are, everyone's just worried about how they're going to look
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.800]   because you can't control that anymore.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:22.320]   You can't, you can't spin it in the way that you used to.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:26.720]   And you know, it seems like Apple is reacting to that more than, more than anything else.
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:30.720]   I think, I think, I was just going to say, I think that's true.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:36.480]   But also, I think that this, that when all these different groups start pressuring Apple
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:40.520]   to go greener, I think that they tapped into a lot of sediment that was already there at
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:44.560]   the company because it's a lot cheaper just to simply say, Oh, for God's sake, great.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:49.240]   So you said, so you sent 16 college dropouts to pick a keynote with 5,000 people, good
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.720]   bully for you.
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:54.560]   I think, I think it's more than just simply good PR, although it is that.
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:57.520]   Well, I think, and, and I do think it's a reaction to the Greenpeace.
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:00.320]   And I usually think that I always watch them, watch Greenpeace.
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:02.040]   And I'm just like, what's the point?
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:04.280]   You know, like, you know, just nothing's ever going to happen.
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.280]   And in, in this case, I was wrong.
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:11.160]   You know, I think that I think this, what they did, what they, you know, what they brought
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:14.160]   out made, I think had a lasting impact on Apple.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:18.640]   And I think that it also hit, like you said, Andy, hit where a lot of Apple employees
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:21.560]   already think and also all the way to the very top of Apple.
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:24.920]   Something that I don't think Steve wants to be seeing this way, right?
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:29.160]   This actually kind of reminds me a lot of when Apple went DRM free, when they announced
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:30.160]   what they were doing.
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.720]   I mean, it was clearly was the direction that everybody was headed.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.920]   It was the direction that the industry was eventually going to have to go in, whether
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:38.720]   they liked it or not.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:42.080]   And so if you're going to get in that parade, at least get out in front of it, you know,
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:46.040]   I mean, if you're going to be in the parade, try to be the parade leader.
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.880]   And so I think that's kind of what Apple's doing here too.
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:52.840]   They're not necessarily doing anything that a lot of other companies aren't doing, but
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:54.240]   they are trying to be a lot more transparent.
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:56.480]   They're trying to get out in front of that parade.
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:58.480]   Absolutely.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:03.960]   Finally, before we get to our picks, Apple buys a map service.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:15.520]   So Apple quietly buys a map service that theoretically could make it less necessary for, it's called
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.360]   place base.
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.000]   And they didn't make a lot of hooplobe, right?
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:26.080]   It wasn't a press release, but evidently I guess this is being reported on CNET that
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:31.320]   the CEO, his LinkedIn changed from place base to Apple.
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:34.480]   Oh, the modern tells.
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:35.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:36.960]   Exactly.
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:39.000]   Someone noticed something changed here.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:44.720]   So the idea is, is this a sign of a growing split between Google and Apple?
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.880]   I mean, is this really they're just kind of trying to part the ways?
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:51.960]   I think this also has something to do with Apple wanting to have more control over that
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:53.040]   map data.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:57.280]   Right now they're limited by some really tight licensing controls as to what they can do
[00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:58.800]   with the Google Maps data.
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.160]   That's not really Google's fault.
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:05.560]   It's mostly the problem of the Google Maps product is a result of Google themselves licensing
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.520]   a lot of map data from a lot of different sources.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:13.000]   When I talk to Apple people in briefings for a bunch of different products, whenever the
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.360]   subject of how come Google Maps does not do, how come your map app does not do this, you
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:23.720]   get the answer, but you also get the slow side that says, oh, God, if they were not
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:28.920]   a PR person in the room, monitoring what I'm telling this person, I would be unloading
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:30.720]   and burning myself.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:38.280]   I think this is, if not an outright desire for them to create something brand new, don't
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:43.440]   forget that one of the great advantages of this service was the ability to combine lots
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.440]   of different data.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:49.840]   So if imagine that the maps function on the iPhone doesn't simply overlay traffic or
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.880]   satellite information, but also says, here's the crime statistics for this location that
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:56.120]   you're in right now for this time last year.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.440]   Here's a weather map from last month.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:01.680]   Here's what home prices were this month.
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:05.240]   That stuff that was in that service as of about four or five months ago.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:09.920]   So if not that, at least it gives them the ability to negotiate with Google from a more
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.640]   interesting position saying, well, that's fine.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.560]   We happened to have bought this map service just a couple months ago, chiefly because we
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.480]   liked the property that they're using and we wanted to use their wall art and our own
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.480]   Cupertino offices.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.280]   But if you want us to use their map data city, yours, that's fine.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.280]   We can do that.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.640]   It is kind of interesting to see the growing schism between Google and Apple, especially
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:32.640]   after Schmidt left the board of directors and what with the Google voice app and everything.
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:38.520]   I can definitely see Apple maybe wanting to slowly start moving away from that connection.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:42.040]   It's like when you visit the home of a couple of you know, been married for about five or
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:46.560]   ten years and suddenly you notice that his CDs are on one shelf, her CDs are on the
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:47.560]   second shelf.
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.640]   Not a lot of a couple of photos.
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:54.400]   Maybe they're making a plan.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.160]   Well, they seem to be doing so well together.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:00.240]   I mean, that was, I think that was the problem is it was like, man, these guys can take over.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:05.440]   But now it seems that that was just going to be too good to be true, right?
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:10.120]   Maybe you're going to say, Ryan?
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.120]   It had to end eventually.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.120]   I mean, they're both very ambitious.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.400]   It's seem almost too good to be true.
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.960]   You know, these guys are on the internet.
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.840]   These guys are making great hardware and software platforms.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:24.440]   Yeah, it's like clearly at some point there was going to be, you know, some crossover
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.240]   that started to make things difficult.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.800]   It started with the internet.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:29.800]   This just came up on the IRC.
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:33.240]   Have any of you tried the VONNAGE app?
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.880]   No.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.880]   No one's tried it.
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:36.880]   It just came out this week.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.680]   So it's out on a bunch of mobile platforms.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:41.200]   But anyway, just let people know VONNAGE came out with an app.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:46.120]   I have to admit, I use the Skype app all the time as well, especially on the server.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.120]   Oh, I use a lot.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.120]   You use it?
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:51.440]   I use the Skype app very frequently, especially for interviews and that kind of thing when
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:56.560]   I don't have time to find a secret office where I can do the podcasting with the headset.
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.240]   I just take it outside and use the Skype app.
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.240]   It works great.
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.240]   Yeah.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:03.760]   Yeah, no, I've been, we use it all, especially when I'm overseas.
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:09.000]   It's great because you just log into the Wi-Fi and bam, I've got a great phone.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.040]   I was organizing stuff last week and I'm 8,000 miles away and pushing all this stuff around
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.560]   making phone calls.
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.680]   And what was interesting is everyone kept on saying that I was clearer than if I had called
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.240]   from that country.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.600]   That's the insanity of the whole thing.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.720]   But VONNAGE has come out with one and people are interested.
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:25.720]   We've got pics of the week.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:31.400]   I don't know if Veronica and Ryan knew that those were coming, but I'm warning them now.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:35.680]   You've got like three minutes to come up with something cool.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:39.000]   If you want, you don't have to.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.640]   But before that, we want to thank Audible, of course.
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:44.800]   And it's easy to thank Audible because I think all of us use Audible.
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:47.480]   That's how I read books.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:52.280]   I was in a meeting over the weekend where I literally said, "This is how I listen to
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.280]   books."
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:56.440]   I just don't even think about reading a lot of text.
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:59.520]   If it's got pretty pictures, I'm very into it.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.240]   And evidently, I'm not the only one.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.600]   They've got over 60,000 titles.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:10.160]   And of course, you can get a free book, if you like, if you just go up to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.600]   And if you're looking for something, if you're trying to figure out what you should get for
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.400]   your free book and how it should work.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.400]   I'm sure.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.400]   I'm not.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:20.440]   I didn't even ask him, but I'm sure that I can just ask Andy.
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.880]   What should people think about getting?
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:29.280]   Well, this week's pick is sort of a sequel to a pick I had a few weeks ago.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.520]   As you know, I come from the land of the Cod, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:38.320]   And so I have sort of a longstanding history of reading about our late Senator Ted Kennedy
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.880]   in the newspaper a lot.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:47.640]   And so the week after he passed away, I bought the, by audible the Boston, wonderful biography
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:53.520]   of him written by the Boston Globe staff that was based on about 40 or 50 to 60 years worth
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:57.200]   the coverage of Ted Kennedy and the whole Kennedy family.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:03.320]   But just a couple of weeks ago, Kennedy was working on his own memoirs.
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:06.680]   And of course, they rushed, they sped up the release of that book.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:11.320]   So now you can get his like rather encomp, all encompassing memoirs called True Compass,
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:14.600]   a memoir by Edward M. Kennedy.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:15.840]   I liked it for a couple of reasons.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.640]   It's a great book in and of itself.
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:24.920]   I'm only about, I'm up to about 1963, 1964, just after the JFK assassination.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:30.000]   And you can see how, how the progression is going in the story that he's telling from
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:37.520]   being a kid and being an observer of great events, watching, basically playing with his
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:41.200]   grandfather, honey Fitz, who is one of the great politicians of Boston, former Congress
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.400]   or former mayor.
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.840]   And exactly every definition of a politician, the sort of guy who would just hang out in
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:51.240]   a hotel listening to see if he hears a Boston accent so he could introduce himself and maybe
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:57.360]   take the guy out to lunch to watching his brother, his older brothers get into politics to becoming
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:03.400]   involved in events by helping to manage campaigns and helping to get votes for his brothers.
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:09.680]   He was sort of like a real life version of what was that the Chris Farley movie, Black
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:10.680]   Sheep.
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:11.680]   He was the youngest.
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.680]   He was the youngest.
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.680]   He was the youngest.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:14.680]   He was the youngest.
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.480]   No, no, no, I'm serious.
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:18.680]   It was the youngest of nine kids.
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.680]   It would send him to Texas.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.680]   They would send him to Arkansas.
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:23.400]   There was some send him everywhere to get votes.
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:29.560]   There's this great story he tells about how he thought he would just be there at this
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:35.760]   rodeo in Texas just to say, "Hi, I'm here to ask you a Democrat to vote for my brother,
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.960]   John F. of the Scowl Kennedy."
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:43.960]   But he was told that there's a sacred tradition that only Bronco writers get to be introduced.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:46.040]   So he had to write a Bronco.
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:49.080]   He had to write a fucking Bronco.
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:51.720]   He lasted seven seconds before being thrown off.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:55.800]   At which point he says he got the biggest ovation and he managed to get the votes in,
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:56.800]   but stuff like that.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.960]   And now we're at the point where at the book where now he's writing his, he's writing for
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:06.320]   office for the first time himself, running for the Senate seat that was vacated by JFK
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:09.160]   after a two year temporary appointment.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.000]   And it's especially, it's interesting in and of itself because he had one hell of a life
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.600]   and one hell of a career.
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:19.520]   He is, there are four really bad incidents in his life that one of the reasons why you
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:23.120]   get this book is you want to hear him talk about, "Well, he got thrown out of heart
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.120]   for cheating.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.120]   Here's his perspective on that.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:26.480]   You definitely want to hear about Chapakwiddick.
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:29.880]   You definitely want to hear about his 1980 presidential race where it seems like he was
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:33.720]   hanging on way longer than any rational person would.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:40.000]   But you also, it's also interesting to, after having read the, or listened to the Boston
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.440]   Globe book, to hear things from an additional perspective.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:47.920]   There is one element in which part of the, one thing that I thought was really, really
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:51.560]   interesting, just contrasting what you learned from this book.
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:59.440]   The Boston Globe book was not terribly complimentary about his decision to settle in New Mexico
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:02.400]   and run, and get into politics over there.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:06.160]   It mentions that he fell, both books agree that when he was campaigning for his brothers,
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.760]   he really fell in love with the West.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:11.280]   He was giving serious consideration to, "Maybe I should settle down over here and I do want
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:13.760]   to get into politics eventually, but I can run for a seat over here.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:14.760]   So so beautiful here.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:15.760]   My wife loves it here."
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:16.760]   That sort of thing.
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:20.840]   The Globe says that, "And as soon as his father, Joe Kennedy, got wind of this, he said,
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.280]   "Oh, that's a stupid idea.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:24.280]   What's this damn fool idiot doing right now?"
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:30.080]   And he basically called it into running for the vacated Senate seat, left out by JFK.
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:34.600]   But within the context of Ted Kennedy's memoirs, you get the impression that he's the youngest
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:38.920]   of nine people, and the family business is politics and public service.
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:42.840]   And so when you, when you discuss these things with people who are that much more experienced
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:46.720]   than you, and you sort of look up to these people, it's not so much, "Oh, you idiot
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:49.240]   you're not running for what kind of damn fool ideas this."
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:52.080]   It's more like, "Well, here's alternative ideas.
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:55.120]   Here's what, here's the possibilities that maybe you haven't thought of."
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:58.440]   And again, when you have older brothers, your older brother is both the president of the
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:02.680]   United States, your godfather and 14 years older than you.
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:06.080]   You've been looking up to him as a hero since you were four years old.
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:09.080]   When he gives you advice like that, it's not so much, "Well, I'm an idiot and I'm
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.480]   thank God this person pulled my butt out of the fire."
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:13.440]   But you know, maybe I will take this advice.
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:14.440]   So that's-
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:19.440]   What's the book again?
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:24.440]   It's true compass, Colin, a memoir.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:29.440]   And so if people want, if you want to give that a shot, make sure to go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.440]   And wait, what was it about again?
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:33.440]   Such a funny girl.
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:36.440]   He was the true lion of the Senate, okay?
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:39.440]   Only those of us who live with a Kennedy family for all those things.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.440]   That's fine.
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.440]   No, that's fine.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.440]   That's fine.
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.440]   Just go eat and fast.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.440]   I'm a Boston girl.
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:45.440]   I respect.
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.440]   Really?
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:47.440]   I am.
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:52.440]   So the audible.com/macbreak, you can get it free.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:54.440]   Spell "lemonster" wister.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:57.040]   What do you do when it comes to a rotary?
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.440]   Explain that, then I'll believe you're from Boston.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.440]   Wister, W-O-R-C-H-E-S-T-E-R.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.440]   Ah, no age.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:03.440]   Phone note.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.440]   Phone note.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.440]   Phone note.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.440]   Masc chaos ensues.
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.440]   So-
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.440]   Masc chaos, get it?
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.440]   Mass chaos.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.440]   Mass chaos.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.440]   Mass chaos.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.440]   Mass chaos.
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.440]   Mass chaos.
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.440]   Mass chaos.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:16.440]   So, you know, instead of a legislature, he gets the cash.
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:19.440]   So now Veronica, do you have a pick for us?
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.440]   Now, what is the pick?
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.440]   Is that an audible pick or is that like good?
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:23.440]   No, no, no, no.
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:26.440]   We bought all the audible picks we can handle for the day.
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.440]   I want to go for an iPhone app.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.440]   Okay, iPhone app.
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:30.440]   iPhone app.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:31.440]   Mac thing.
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:34.440]   Thing that's tangentially connected to a Mac.
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:36.440]   I like Taxi Magic.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:37.440]   Taxi Magic.
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:38.440]   Which is an Apple.
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:41.140]   It's not available in all cities, but it is available in major major-
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.140]   metropolitan areas.
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:43.140]   Mm-hmm.
[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:47.520]   And it allows you to call for a taxi using your iPhone without having to talk to an actual
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.520]   person.
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:49.520]   Nice.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.320]   And you can schedule a time that you want your pick up and you can also pay right from
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:53.480]   the app.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.120]   You can pay from the app?
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.120]   Yep.
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:59.120]   You set up an account on rycharge.com, I believe.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.560]   And you know, I had big problems with the app when it first came out because sometimes
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:06.160]   the payments didn't go through properly and then you'd be sitting there without any cash
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:10.720]   in the car, which was probably my mistake in the first place to trust an app to actually
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:13.020]   pay for something the first time I use it.
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:15.980]   And I felt really bad and the poor cab driver.
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:19.460]   But to any extent, they fixed all the problems that they have and I work at all, I use it
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:20.460]   all the time.
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.460]   It's really great.
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:22.460]   Does it work with all the cab companies?
[01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:26.900]   It works with only selected cab companies that have made deals with rycharge.
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:27.900]   Like yellow.
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:32.260]   Like yellow cab and in the city around here you can get Luxor, I believe.
[01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:33.260]   Yep, Luxor and Luxor.
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:35.140]   Because those are the same ones that run credit cards.
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:36.140]   Mm-hmm.
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:37.140]   Yeah, that's probably great.
[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:38.140]   Yeah, it works great.
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:40.140]   Oh man, I'm getting, it's called Taxi Magic.
[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:44.520]   So the thing is, this is the most expensive part of the show for me because I end up buying
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:46.000]   every single pick.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.400]   This one's free, I think.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.120]   I'm pretty sure the app is free.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:53.000]   Well I guess maybe they're probably taking a little percentage of every thing.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   Don't quote me on that.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.120]   I could be wrong, but yeah, they do have, they get a dollar fee, I think, or a dollar
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:00.320]   ninety-nine fee if you choose.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.560]   Do they get it from you or from the taxi car?
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.560]   Yeah, they get it from you.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:04.560]   Okay, so you're getting a little bit of a breeze.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:05.560]   So that's definitely a downside.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:08.800]   So use it for the airport runs, not for the five block runs.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:09.800]   Exactly.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:10.800]   That's the most of my light.
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:11.800]   There you go.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:12.800]   And Ryan.
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:13.800]   I gotta wave my arms around.
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:14.800]   There we go.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.800]   Perfect timing.
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:16.800]   Yes, exactly.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:23.540]   Brontakar already mentioned, but I'm really into the zip car app this week.
[01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.820]   It took them obviously a little while to get it out.
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:30.140]   I have to think it's actually because you can use the app to honk the horn and unlock
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:33.100]   the doors of the car that you're about to rent, which is really useful.
[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:35.900]   I feel like you're in a big parking lot and you need to locate it.
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:38.820]   This is actually something I've had to deal with on a number of occasions.
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:39.820]   You don't have zip car.
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:42.240]   It's absolutely no use to you.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.220]   But it does make finding a local zip car really, really easy.
[01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:50.980]   I know that when I first, we use both zip car and city car share.
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:56.140]   We're kind of lots of choices because they're good for different things.
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:57.140]   City car share is good for them.
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:01.420]   The city and a little more flexible and zip car is good for longer trips.
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:05.060]   And the first thing that one of my iPhone came out, I wanted zip car to have a, or not
[01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:09.820]   zip car, but a city car share to have an application that I could just find the stuff and find
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:10.820]   the map.
[01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:13.620]   It's exactly what, and it came out in zip cars ahead.
[01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:15.900]   With this app and it's just fantastic.
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:16.900]   Yeah.
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:21.140]   I mean, ahead is kind of a relative term because it took them so long.
[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:24.820]   When the iPhone first came out, I was like, "Oh, this would be a perfect platform to
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:26.660]   have his car app on."
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:28.980]   That was a couple of years ago, obviously.
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:30.140]   And then they announced it.
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:35.020]   I think it was that it wasn't at this WWDC, but it was maybe last year's WWDC.
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:39.060]   Or maybe it was just, I don't know, they announced it.
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:41.340]   It feels like a long time ago, though.
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:44.580]   And it felt like we've been waiting for for a while.
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:47.220]   And their iPhone version of their site was just not that great.
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:50.180]   It was really kind of difficult to use.
[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:56.820]   So it's pretty amazing how much kind of stuff they fit into this app that I would not have
[01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:57.820]   expected them to do.
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:03.700]   I mean, the fact that you can, over a 3G network, honk a car horn and unlock its doors, kind
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:04.700]   of blows my mind.
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:05.700]   I feel like I'm living in the future now.
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:06.700]   I know, I know.
[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:09.980]   It's like a glimpse into this more perfect future.
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:11.500]   You're like, "We're almost there."
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:15.820]   That's when I get that kind of stuff, I always think that that's what comes up for me.
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:16.820]   Andy, how about...
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:18.420]   And once again, that's just the zip car.
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.060]   It's free, right?
[01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:22.460]   It's free, but zip car is clearly not free.
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:24.260]   No, no, absolutely.
[01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:27.220]   Andy, what is your pick for the week?
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:31.660]   My pick is a music and media-seeking application called Double Twist.
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:36.540]   You can download a free copy at DoubleTwist.com.
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:41.060]   If you don't have an iPod or an iPhone, you realize that getting media off of your Mac
[01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:44.340]   and into the device is kind of a pain in the butt.
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:48.780]   The only way you can do it from iTunes is to rely on the device's USB mass storage feature
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:51.580]   to simply copy things from one place to another.
[01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:56.740]   Double Twist, it's still in a sort of an early stage, but its goal is to be the one application
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:15:00.860]   that you use to sync all of your content to any device that you have.
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:04.460]   So, for instance, we talked about the Kindle before.
[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:11.340]   Of course, I use this to sync music and content and photos from iTunes library to the Kindle.
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:17.300]   It's a very iTunes 3.0-style old-school interface where you have all your devices and all of
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:24.100]   your sources of content in a panel to the left, to the right you have a navigable list
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:29.180]   of all the different content that you have on any device that's nearby.
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:34.580]   It's the same sort of scheme that you would find in Windows where it doesn't necessarily
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:36.060]   read your iTunes library.
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:41.380]   It simply looks for any sort of relatable content in any hard drive.
[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:46.860]   But it makes it very, very easy to sync music to, let's say, a PalmPray or, again, if you
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:52.220]   have multiple devices that work that way, it's a lot simpler to manage stuff using DoubleTwist
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:54.460]   than it is just via iTunes.
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:57.500]   Again, still sort of in an early mode.
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:03.020]   It has one nice bonus feature where you do have to sign up for a free account, register
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:05.140]   on DoubleTwist.com.
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:09.660]   But the advantage there is that if you suddenly want to share a video with one of your friends
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:15.100]   that are on the service, you can simply drag it from your existing library onto that contact.
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:18.420]   They'll get an email with a download link and it'll simply open right in DoubleTwist and
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:21.060]   give them the opportunity to download it directly into their library.
[01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:25.100]   But, like I said, very, very handy app if you have more than one device that is not an
[01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:29.300]   Apple product that you need to sync movies, photos, and music to.
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:30.300]   Fantastic.
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:33.100]   And actually, I just heard from those guys this week they're adding in Amazon support
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.820]   too for Amazon downloads.
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:36.820]   Yeah.
[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:39.300]   They're also working on iPod and iPhone support.
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:42.140]   Right now it only works with version 2.0, the operating system.
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:46.340]   I'm guessing that most of the people listening to this have probably moved on to 3.0 by now.
[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:51.420]   But I don't, I'm not sure if it's also missing things like being able to do playlists and,
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:53.620]   of course, it doesn't do smart playlists.
[01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:56.340]   But very, very good tool, especially for free.
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:57.340]   Fantastic.
[01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:01.780]   My, so I'm cheating a little bit because I have one pick that's not really a pick.
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:04.980]   I just want to pick it so that people know it there.
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:10.460]   I was talking, I was in New York on Sunday night and talking to, you know, hanging out
[01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:15.100]   with Justine Azaric and she was talking about how she doesn't really get the subways in
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:16.100]   New York.
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:18.140]   She just uses a lot of cab stuff.
[01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:23.460]   And the thing that I realized that a lot of people that I talk to don't use very much
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:28.300]   is I just want to recommend Google Maps on the iPhone.
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:31.820]   If you are, a lot of people think of Google Maps as something where you find out or something's
[01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:35.260]   nearby or how to drive somewhere, there's driving directions.
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:43.020]   But if you are in a town with a lot of subways, especially like New York or Tokyo, in both
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:47.620]   of those cities, you can literally say, I'm here and I want to go there and it'll give
[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:51.820]   you walking directions and, you know, train directions.
[01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:56.740]   And it was, I don't know if it's like this in New York, it is literally the one, like
[01:17:56.740 --> 01:18:01.740]   I had to get up town and I was sitting there and I literally just said, I need to get to
[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:06.060]   this and it told me how to get on the one and it said the next one's coming in six minutes.
[01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:09.780]   And boom, I got down there with one minute to spare and one minute later the subway showed
[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:12.740]   up and I got up there and it was unbelievable.
[01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:18.740]   And it really takes a lot of the stress out of traveling.
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:24.100]   So I mean, when you're in these like subway heavy regions, make sure to remember that
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.660]   the Google Maps is your friend in those areas.
[01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:29.860]   It really makes it actually makes sense because otherwise the subways don't really mean anything
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:31.500]   to me because I'm not from New York.
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:36.020]   And I think you almost have to be, you know, be born there or live there for a long enough
[01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:38.300]   for all those little things to sink in.
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:40.820]   I don't have to think about that at all.
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:45.660]   My real pick for the week though is an application that time is running out and so I wanted to
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:48.620]   make sure to recommend it because it's one of my favorite apps.
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:50.540]   It's not inexpensive.
[01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:52.060]   It's not inexpensive.
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:54.740]   I'm kind of known for causing trouble that way.
[01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:56.860]   And it is kind of specific.
[01:18:56.860 --> 01:18:59.060]   So it's a program called Image Modeler.
[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:00.820]   An image modeler is from Autodesk.
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:05.460]   It used to be made by a company called RealBiz and I've been using it for, I don't know,
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:06.820]   eight years, eight or nine years.
[01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:10.780]   And what it does is you can take a photograph of, let's say I can take a photograph of this
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:16.620]   computer from two different directions, like two different angles like this and I can,
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:17.940]   two different angles.
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:22.860]   And with just those two angles, I can create a 3D model of that object.
[01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:27.460]   So I can use those to create, using the change in perspective, it'll figure out where the
[01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:31.980]   cameras were and also where the computer was and where all the surfaces of the computer
[01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:32.980]   are.
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:33.980]   Now it's a little bit manual.
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:36.460]   You're drawing little boxes and you're doing little pieces but it helps you out a lot.
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:39.300]   Once it knows where the cameras are, it'll say, oh no, no, I think the point was over
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:40.300]   here.
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:47.100]   And we have built people's heads for digital doubles, whole buildings for digital mounts.
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:51.180]   In the film industry, being able to know exactly where your cameras started is very
[01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:56.940]   valuable and it's something that we haven't found another solution.
[01:19:56.940 --> 01:20:03.420]   The reason that I'm recommending it today is because they are going to start bundling
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:09.060]   it in with Maya and 3D Studio and some of the other stuff that Autodesk already sells.
[01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:11.500]   So they're kind of, instead of having lots and lots of little apps, they're going to
[01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:16.460]   say, well, you kind of need to buy one big app and have it all included, which I'll say
[01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:17.460]   I'm not a big fan of.
[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:19.660]   I don't think I'm kind of bummed about that.
[01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:23.540]   But if this is something you're interested in, it's worth going to download a demo or
[01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:27.380]   take a look at what it does if you're at all interested in 3D and all interested in integrating
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:28.380]   stuff.
[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:33.220]   The reason that I wanted to recommend it this week is because it ends at the beginning of
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:34.220]   November.
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:36.980]   You'll have to buy it with all the other stuff that's a lot more expensive.
[01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:39.620]   Now this thing is already, I think, $800 or $900.
[01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:40.620]   It's not cheap.
[01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:43.380]   It's a professional app for 3D.
[01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:48.620]   But it is, if it's something that that sounds interesting as I started to talk about it,
[01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:54.100]   you want to check it out now and not later because it'll be very hard to get later.
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:59.300]   And so I just wanted to definitely make that my pick because it's one of my favorite applications.
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:04.460]   I mean, it's one of the applications that we build a lot of stuff with that along with
[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:08.100]   what Stitcher was another one that Realbiz had that I use a lot.
[01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:11.500]   And so anyway, that's my pick for the week.
[01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:15.340]   And hopefully some people that are watching it, I know that mine tend to be very specific.
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:18.660]   But I started with very general, moved very specific.
[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:24.100]   And I'm just going to round the horn and thank Andy from the Celestial Waste of Bandwidth.
[01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:27.100]   Do you have anything coming up, Andy?
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:32.340]   Yes, as a matter of fact, I'm on the CBS early show Saturday morning talking about ways
[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:36.420]   of getting your phone to stop taddling on you on various things that you don't want
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:38.620]   other people to know about.
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:39.700]   And this week, thank you.
[01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:43.900]   If God is my friend, I will be finished with a third edition of my new iPhone book.
[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:44.900]   Very good.
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.420]   Good luck.
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:49.340]   And I'm going ahead.
[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:50.900]   I'm really looking forward to being done with this book.
[01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:52.620]   It's a great book, but I'm looking forward to it.
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:53.620]   I get that way.
[01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:54.900]   See, I get that way with just articles.
[01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:56.340]   I don't need whole books to.
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:59.420]   I'm just usually like, okay, I need to go now.
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:03.900]   So from Tekzilla, Veronica, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:05.260]   Thank you for having me.
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:06.260]   It was really great.
[01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:08.260]   Hopefully you're going to come back and play with us more often.
[01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:09.260]   Absolutely.
[01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:11.700]   It was really, really great to have you on the show.
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:14.100]   And do you have anything big coming up with Tekzilla?
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:15.580]   No, thankfully.
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:18.860]   I'm looking forward to a couple of weeks of normal work and relaxation.
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:22.500]   Very good.
[01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:27.340]   And from GDGT, Ryan Block, thanks Ryan.
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:28.340]   Thanks for having me.
[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:29.780]   This is really great.
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:33.420]   And for the rest of you, get back to work.
[01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:34.620]   Break time is over.
[01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:58.780]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
