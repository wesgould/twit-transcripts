[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Alex Lindsay has a week off. Doc rocks here in his place,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.240]   along with Andy Inaco. Andrew and A. Richie will talk about 10 cooks, 500 percent raise.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.040]   That's a lot of money. Is he worth it? Microsoft Edge is almost as big as Safari now,
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.880]   and all the rumors, everybody seems to agree, we're only two weeks away from a new Mac mini.

[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.640]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple. Alex Lindsay has
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.640]   a day off. Glad to see Doc Rock in the house. Our favorite, Hawaii and taking off his granny glasses.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.840]   Hey, you got LASIK. Congratulations. That's exciting. Yes. And so unfortunately for like a
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.760]   month or so, I need to Puss these readers. If I have to see something, I'll be doing like my dad.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.880]   Actually, it looks good on you. They look good on you. Don't don't just chew the readers.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.480]   At least you're not wearing it down on your nose like the old folks do.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.120]   Now you look old.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.640]   From room 222.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.160]   From room 222. Michael Constantine, ladies and gentlemen. It's great to see you, Doc. Thanks for
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.440]   joining us today. Also in the house, Andy Inaco, WGBH Boston. Hello, Andrew.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.440]   You know, teacher, you think that you're hip and down with the kids, but you don't understand
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.120]   what us kids are going through. Thanks to the planet we inherited from you people.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.000]   Hello, fellow kids. And also with us, Renee Richie, YouTube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.280]   Wearing a hoodie today. A fleece line. I'm in full Santa. I'm in full Santa
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.840]   guard because of the temperature Leo. And fame, fame, remember my name is all I'm going to say to
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.200]   a not-go of other high school. The reason we're talking 222 is of course because it's
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:52.320]   depending on where you live in the world. It's 22022 or 0222.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.760]   It's palindraming multiple people. This is a good time to live somewhere where they start with
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:06.640]   the year. Then it's 20222. It's 221 p.m. Eastern right now. So Leo's one like in one minute. It's
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.520]   going to be 45 seconds. It's going to be 222 on 22222.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:28.480]   And that's you guys. It's still on a
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.800]   Tuesday. Yeah, it's early in the morning. In fact, gosh, Doc, I thank you for coming in before you before
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.840]   breakfast. That's very nice. Thank you. You're going to have a spare. You want to have breakfast?
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.160]   The convergence has begun. That cracks me up with the numerologists. Acting as if there's some
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:54.320]   magic to 22222 when it's just made up. Everything's made up Leo. It's all made up, I guess.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.840]   It's like, okay, it's really cool that we got to see the year 2000, 000, but you realize that
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.360]   it was based on the numbers based on a guess about what when a dude might have been. It's all
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.640]   cray-cray. Might have been born and we've changed that like four times. Yeah, okay. We're not even
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.520]   on that calendar anymore. We're on. It's like to get us right now. It's like savings. All reality
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.920]   was supposed to collapse like in 2000, but then they changed to a different calendar system. And
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.840]   I've got an extra 48 years. Yeah. Well, I was just coming for us. Technically, today was supposed
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.040]   to be yesterday. But what happened was when a guy was making the calendar, the wife gave him a
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.240]   bunch of stuff to do. So he had to stop doing that. Go clean the thing like milk goats, you know,
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.080]   like fixed stuff in the farm is like, can I get back to this little calendar? Why are you making
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.560]   all those little boxes with the numbers? I need you to clean this place. And then so,
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:54.400]   that's what you're talking about, dude. Apple is readying new Mac books and iMacs for part three
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.040]   of overhaul. Mark Gurman in the newsletter power on newsletter.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.400]   March, are we still March 8th? We still in agreement on that. So far.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.320]   Yep. That's not. They just say it. That's two weeks from like 222. It's like they pick a date
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.360]   and if it's wrong, it's wrong. So it's right. It's good. It's right. It's all wrong. Yeah. As you
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.600]   point out, you think about it, the mass of three eights. That's why it numerologies here. So the
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:27.520]   three eights is a good number. Oh, God. I thought astrology was bad. So March eight, three eight,
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.760]   eight, eight, three max on yeah, on March eight, which is the third month. It's it's it's
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.120]   follow the money, La Porte. Follow the money. Eight is a lucky number. China. Right. Maybe I should
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.320]   do you. Maybe I should do your biarithms. I think your emotional curve is peaking.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:51.600]   I have that on my watch, actually. So March 8th. And then we saw in the Russian FCC filing,
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:58.480]   we saw four new looked like Max. Now more and more. And I agreed with you, Renee, when you said,
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.520]   well, it would be confusing if Apple will release M one and M two.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.280]   Hardware at the same day, but now more and more. It seems the rumor the drum beat is M two M two M
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.400]   two. So it's so weird. Cause like the original rumor from Dylan DKT about the M two MacBook Pro
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.880]   was that it was coming in the second half of the year. And it was in a 14 inch chassis,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.160]   but with the M two chip and the latest rumor from Mac rumors and from digit times, randomly accurate
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:29.040]   digit times is that it's coming like now, now, now, but in the like the 2016 era 13 and chassis.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.720]   And the only thing new about it is going to be the M two from power on Mark. Mark Gurman,
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:41.920]   who is the most accurate of all the prognosticators. The third round of Mac updates is likely to kick
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.600]   off on March 8th when Apple is planning to hold its first media event of the year. The presentation
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:56.960]   is likely to focus on the 5G iPhone SE and iPad Air, but I'm told to expect at least one new Mac
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.720]   that day. Make it the Mac mini, please, please, please, please, please, please, make it the Mac
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:09.600]   mini pro Mac mini pro Mac mini Max. You know, like back in the day you wanted your two fun
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:15.920]   teeth for Christmas. All I want from March 8 is a new Mac mini pro.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:23.360]   A dongle free Mac mini. Yes. New Mac mini with an M one pro chip. This is this is now no longer
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.320]   in the I've heard this is in the I'm expecting category. And we've explained this before that
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.120]   Mark now because his power on newsletter is not quite so tightly edited, doesn't have to say
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.680]   according to people familiar with the matter blah blah blah. And he can also say I'm thinking
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:44.320]   as opposed to I'm hearing. So he says I'm thinking a new Mac mini with an M one pro chip. I'm thinking
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.960]   that too. I'm thinking as hard as I can. There's I guess there's I thought there were four
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:55.600]   numbers in the Russian three entries for three in the Eurasian. Oh, there's three for Max and then
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.320]   one for probably the iPad, right? There's the iPhone, the iPads and then the Max. Yeah,
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.360]   and the iPads are three. It's Leo, my will all my will is bent upon this. I'm the best I can
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.920]   to give everybody that's all right. The portal has opened and you can time travel now for
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:15.760]   the throwing apple gear out of it. Yeah. So there's a 30 also expects a 13 inch MacBook pro with an
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:23.360]   M two chip. Now I think he expects that because it was in 2020 that they announced the M one low
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.800]   and Mac 13 inch, right? Yeah. Yeah. And the Mac mini and the I and the Mac book era, both
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.360]   was beginning big redesigns this year. So the lowest effort Mac update with an M two chip will be the
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.280]   MacBook pro if it doesn't get a redesign if that stays in the same chassis as the last time.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:44.240]   He also says in Mac mini with an M two chip. Now this is where we this is the footnote.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.760]   Podcasts don't have footnotes. So let's say this is so to vote.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.400]   There is a difference between the M two and the M one. It is not what you think it is.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:59.680]   The M two is not one better. It's one better core for core, but M one pro and M one max still
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.480]   have way, way, way more cores. It's like a next generation. Like if you're doing an Intel thing,
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.720]   it's a next generation core M when you still have a bunch of core eyes out there on your big
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:15.200]   computers. So the M two is also low end. It's based on the A 15, which is in the iPhone 13.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.960]   Is the A how is the A 15 different from the A 14? If you just were looking at the chip,
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:26.480]   the is it my efficiency cores are about 30% higher performance. The performance cores are about 10
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.840]   and 20% high performance, but they're way better. They're way more efficient. It's got an extra
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.640]   graphics core on the high end and the M two supposed to have two extra up to two extra graphics cores
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.040]   over the M one. And then it's also got a pro res engine, which the M one does not have.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:44.400]   Oh, interesting. So an M two double the system cache, which is helpful to keep it cool.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.840]   I thought there was a pro res engine on the M one pro and max. Isn't there?
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.320]   There are they basically put that on both the A 15 and the M one pro and max, but the original
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:59.280]   M one did not have H dot 264 and 265. So you would expect some differences in an M two based
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:06.400]   Mac mini or an M two based MacBook Pro, but given the maturity and the capabilities of the M one,
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:13.680]   given if you give it a lot of what cores? There would still be the higher and ram and ram.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:19.120]   It'd be still the higher performing of the two. You can see how this is you could see why Renee
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.360]   said, Oh, no, they shouldn't announce an M two on March 8th because it's going to confuse.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.120]   We're going to everybody's got to spend a lot of time saying, yeah, well, it's not better.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.080]   It's just a higher number. We went to this before like because they announced the A 12 Z
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:37.920]   iPad Pro six months after the A 13. But that number was as 12. We knew because it was a 12.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:45.040]   Yeah. But it was better than it was a 12, but it was a lower number, but a more powerful chip.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.920]   This is going to be the same thing, a higher number, but less powerful chip.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:54.800]   The thing that would make the difference though, Renee is imagine not having to need a plug a
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:00.640]   bowl or some other, you know, display link, adapter, start check or whatever. So with the new,
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:06.160]   so with the M two also cover the additional display. I don't think so. I don't there's no
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.120]   indication that it is not a big enough graphics core, right? Well, it's not the graphics cores
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.280]   that the M one pro and max have three USB and three Thunderbolt ports. Yeah. And
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.240]   ungodly amounts of GPU. And this will still have up to 10 GPU, but there's no indication
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.800]   we'll have more than the two USB and two Thunderbolt ports. So that's the issue is it doesn't have
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:33.040]   IO for more than two monitors. Yeah, it's not it's intended for ultra low power low cost
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:38.800]   machines. So if you want as I'm sure you do, if you want to abandon the dongle life dock rock,
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:46.560]   you got to go to the M one pro Mac mini. Because I know you're going to laugh at this and
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:55.360]   everything some nuts, but my favorite portable computer is still my second M one Mac mini 16
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:02.640]   gig. And I have this little $300 portable monitor, because when I go I can stream from that safely.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:08.240]   Like the the notebook itself has been mostly replaced by M one iPad, like fully loaded like
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.160]   my M one iPad is dumb. It's like $2,500. So what I need a portable computer, like I throw my mini
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.280]   in a portable display in the backpack. And it's better for what I'm using it for, which is mostly
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.680]   streaming or, you know, doing video oriented stuff. Now, if you'd like to start drooling,
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:30.480]   I don't think we're going to see a Mac pro next in two weeks, but maybe in June, they'll
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:37.920]   preview it for later release in the year. That's going to be a quad. It'll be twice the M one
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:47.920]   max. So Mark Herman says 20 CPU cores up to 40 and 64 graphic cards up to 128.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:55.920]   Those are dual M one max and quad M one max dies. Like likes Voltron together.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:01.440]   But as Alex Lindsay would say, and we had pointed out last week, it's still not quite
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:06.560]   Nvidia level, especially if you're using Kudo or some of the low level graphics primitives.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:11.600]   Or is he on level? They have a thread ripper. Well, I mean, just the number of cores, like
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.440]   there's there's still like limitations on the number of CPU. That's why there was also rumors
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:21.280]   that Apple's going to do a Mac pro with updated Z ons and updated AMD RDNA three just in case.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.160]   Yeah, because the scale the scale is still takes time. Like again, like Intel has all this stuff.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.680]   Apple doesn't have to go and have Intel make it, but Apple has to literally make everything that
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.960]   they need now out of Apple silicon. And they have only so many bad and with it, they can only make
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.040]   one chip at a time and they've got to make the new iPhone chip at the same time. So like,
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.360]   this is one of the cases where their small teams approach bottle next them and it just takes time
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:47.040]   to get all the stuff out. What do you think that Apple's trying to achieve with the pro line now?
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:51.600]   Excuse me, especially with a desktop pro line because they've got the creatives,
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.760]   absolutely. But are they would they be willing to simply say that, you know what,
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.400]   we're going to walk in creatives right now with by making sure that all the pro desktops that we
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.800]   make are really, really well suitable for that. We are not necessarily going to optimize for
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:10.080]   analysts. We are not necessarily going to optimize for researchers. Those are the three like big
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:15.760]   these are three those are the three people outside of CEOs who have a very big head and must have the
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.600]   most expensive computer in the entire office. Those are the three groups of people that will
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:25.120]   pay like $10,000 for workstation class. And it seems like there are two of those three
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:30.960]   odd items where Apple is not going to have a great amount of success competing with build your own
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:37.040]   build to order, create your own custom custom layout and basically swap them out in parts,
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.080]   swap parts out every month for the test that you need at hand.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.840]   Yeah, it just it seems like when they announced the 2019 MacBook Pro, we had a good indicator
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.880]   of where they were going because they made such a big deal about the afterburner card.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.560]   And now they're building pro like they're like the biggest expenditure of transistors in their
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.800]   last two generations of silicon were on pro res the a 15 for shooting pro res and now the
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.080]   M1 pro and M1 max for processing pro res and that's that's a very limited use case. It's very
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.320]   specific. It's not appealing to high end gamers and their pro workflow team, which is another
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:12.800]   huge investment like literally getting the best photographers from the best across across the barrel
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.600]   video editing people from Lucasfilm from Pixar from you know all those places. They're all production
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.840]   pros like when when Apple says pro workflows, there's no one doing like giant pivot tables and
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:27.120]   excel there. There's people doing music and video and 3d and those sorts of things. So I think that
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.760]   when Apple's talking pro now they're very specifically talking about creative pros and developers
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:37.120]   because developers is by far the biggest group of pros now but developers you solve by CPU,
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.760]   there's just compile time issues and some on GPU if they're doing extra stuff but those seem
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.720]   like the groups Apple's trying to make happy now. You know, it's a really interesting play is
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:55.840]   um so in a pro chassis it's enough space to even go to a situation where if I know I'm going to
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:02.880]   take this back right the 6400 right the performance 6400 and my 6400 I remember having you know your
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:07.920]   your regular Motorola chip but then orange micro or somebody we had this Intel card so that you
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:13.120]   can run a Pentium you would run them two in the same machine and then we got to power PC which
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:19.360]   performed a little better and then eventually we got to just Intel inside right if if the the
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:25.520]   the transition is going to be as difficult as it seems because of things that are going to be missing
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:32.720]   from Z on class whatever why couldn't they go to an older daughter card style situation for if you
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:38.640]   are the type of pro that needs that you could just stick in a card right because already we can do
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:45.200]   it by running externally in a sonnet box right in theory well actually like the external GPU
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:52.880]   yeah so why not why not give that level of class especially for the hot cards right Z non's are
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:58.560]   hot so put them in something external or you know put them in a in a way that you can run it on an
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:03.920]   additional card something that you can vent the way we do invented graphics cards and then you can
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:09.760]   get the best of both worlds because we'll just have space in the chassis to do so but this does
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.520]   this apple really care about that that's the only question they only care if you're customer
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.920]   stop well beyond a remote desktop like they're like just build your own gaming PC or your own high
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.360]   end you know busy and any other from beautiful remote desktop interface we built for you you
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.520]   just you just load it up on your Mac and run it from there yeah it's amazing put whatever ugly iron
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.440]   you want in the closet and then just the remote desktop on your beautiful Mac you know what's
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.080]   I don't think it had come true but I'm really hoping to see the stumpy design that everybody
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.400]   put out that looks like the cube but it has all the teas holes in it but it's only about your big
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:44.160]   so I want a mini Mac pro would be so cute yeah in fact that's the only thing that would slow me
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:50.480]   down buying that Mac mini slapping down my credit card is if I thought oh boy but wouldn't a mini
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:56.560]   Mac pro young and the once you pull out the zion in the AMD there's no reason there's a lot of space
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.760]   in that chassis yeah there's no reason for that yeah m2 even like multiple m and one max dyes
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:06.240]   not that big compared to those helicarrier cards well and you don't need the cooling that you needed
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:13.360]   yeah um apple's gonna focus you watch march h march 8th on power per watt that's where they beat
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:19.200]   Intel and NVIDIA and everybody else silly and if they continue focuses I'm sure they do even on
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:25.920]   the desktop in power per watt uh those numbers that graph you know the the typical apple graph with no
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:32.560]   reference at all on it just a line will be so good the base those graph the base those graph
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:38.240]   the good thing the good thing the thing I celebrate is that the Mac is back in fact Mark Gurman has a
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:46.880]   really great statistic from fiscal 2011 through 2020 the Mac generated 21 billion to 28 billion
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:55.760]   a year in 2021 35 billion big jump and of course that's apple silicon in a nutshell right there
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:01.840]   yeah justifies the investment justifies them going forward with it and for us Mac lovers it
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:07.680]   justifies them putting more love into the Mac yeah and we feel special again yeah exactly no I
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:12.960]   would say that not just the the technical aspects of apple silicon but the the sigh of relief that
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:18.960]   no apple is not going to push Macintosh farther and farther further and further into the background
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:24.960]   until it just becomes the platform you use to develop software for iOS and iPadOS and watchOS
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:30.240]   which is what really five or six years ago you would not have excuse me I don't I would not
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:36.160]   consider myself ridiculous to have that kind of a worry uh and oh we all did I think we all said
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:42.080]   that we expressed our angst uh nothing interesting was happening in Mac there's nothing really to look
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:48.000]   forward to oh they had that crappy touch bar and the butterfly keyboard they released terrible products
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.520]   and it really looked like apple all of apple's attention was focused on the iPhone and you know
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:59.200]   what I think that's what the market wants Charlie Munger uh chat rooms reminded me was recently
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:04.000]   quoted by a Yahoo finance given interview Yahoo finance he's the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.920]   he's Warren Buffett's partner he said uh and of course Buffett is huge into apple birchers I think
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:16.080]   the number one stockholder uh when asked about it he's uh Munger said I think apple's one of the
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.560]   strong companies will stay a strong company I think it's this is the pull quote ungodly well
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:29.680]   managed but then is that good or bad ungodly well managed then he said yeah i judge then he said
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:34.560]   i judge and this is the thing that's that that this is why apple was doubling down on the iPhone
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:39.040]   i judge the strength of the company based on how much the customers love it and i've got zillions of
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:44.160]   friends who do they almost part with their right arm before they part with their iPhone it's a
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:48.240]   hugely powerful position to be in and i think that's the kind of the iPhone and i wouldn't i
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.640]   that's not even close i'd keep my i'd i'd have an android phone in my right arm like you know
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:57.360]   no that's why you have a right arm so that you can have a Samsung watch and an android phone
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.200]   in the other hand yes that's all i'm just saying yes and pixel toran touch it is going to be a
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.520]   piece of touch it is going to be a lot more cumbersome if you if you spread your right arm
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.920]   that that's that's that's like a real monkeys paw wish sort of thing but but no the focus on
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:16.000]   ungodly well managed iPhone you know and and uh and that's what was scaring us was everybody market
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.240]   the like apple wasn't used to it either like apple came from these very humble beginnings
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:24.560]   like if you look at what they were great before the iPhone they had to bet like literally beg people
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.960]   to come to wwdc and they had just come off being almost bankrupt and they had some success with the
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.840]   iPod but then the iPhone hit them and it is a once-in-a-lifetime business most popular
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.920]   successful product in the history of popular successful products and it's like all of a sudden
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.240]   one of your kids is taylor swift and you have all this money coming in you have touring commitments
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.480]   you want to maximize what you can do with their your other kid is like married they graduated
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.400]   from high school trying to have kids of their own they're pretty much okay and you're worried
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.520]   they've taken your eye off taylor swift for a second she's going to end up like those guns and
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.200]   roses people that you've heard about horror stories so you've got to like focus a lot of
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.640]   it's saying the mac is actual rose is that what you're saying no the mac is the college kid who
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.800]   settled down and had kids and is doing okay and you're and then you you make the mistake of ignoring
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:11.840]   them and they're like but i'm your kid too i think of the mac wars as Neil pert perhaps
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:18.080]   you know a gift that just keeps on giving yeah yeah but like now like you know that everything's
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.960]   calmed down like the iPhone is getting established it's graduated high school and apple the mac is
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.800]   like can i have some love again please parents and apples like oh we're so sorry we missed you
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:33.120]   it's got to be very tempting for a company especially as a near three trillion dollars that uh to say
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.840]   oh we're gonna really you know why not double down on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:44.160]   but it's also smart and this is why Tim Cook earns the big bucks and boy did he get a raise this year
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:49.360]   is to say well but we got to prepare for the next generation and the next generation after that
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:54.000]   that's why they're doing ar that's why they're doing cars and knock on for my god i hope the best
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.840]   thing i hope the best thing to happen in this whole transition phase the best thing to happen
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.960]   was the thing that everybody mocked out before and everybody laughed and you have to have it to
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:10.080]   someone who understands their dream and their purpose so much so that they'll take all the
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:15.680]   ribbing and whatever and to me and it's only funny because we just did the video yesterday
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:21.360]   it was watch and not just watch as a arm accessory or an expensive thing everybody went on version
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:28.480]   one about but watch when we got health watch two and and after when health became a primary thing
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:34.480]   and so when Tim says to you when in years from now when people say what's the most important thing
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:40.240]   apple has ever done it won't be iphone it won't be mac it will be health and nobody listened to him
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:47.200]   they thought he was off his rocker but it remains you reminded me you and uh how do you say her name
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:55.200]   some ball the side some ball side yeah yeah you guys touched on so many things that i think even
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:01.760]   people who use their watch every day don't realize how dope it is and when you told the story about
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:09.360]   george falling i was like that's key to me right because when my dad fell i knew because of the
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:14.640]   watch yeah you know what i'm saying yeah like yeah sorry i don't i'm trying to tear up over here but
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:22.320]   i think that actually happened hundred percent and people get into this you know this or the iphone
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:29.600]   this and this and all these you know uh conjecturing and whatever but health is actually saving people's
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.920]   lives and it goes underreported and i don't think it should be it's not a chest meeting thing
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.000]   i don't think apple does it for the chest meeting i think they do it because they really care
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.880]   somebody somewhere in there had something important happening or maybe everybody just did it because
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:49.280]   they we at the time lost eve they did do a whole ad campaign though on how the apple watch has saved
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:55.360]   uh people and it works i watched uh very we were watching quiet
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:03.920]   next day iris a we were watching an nfl game in the season and uh we had a friend over who was
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:08.080]   watching the game and he ordered an apple watch right after that ad because he was worried about
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.840]   falling and i bought one for my mom for the same reason she's really it's really reassuring for her
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:20.880]   to have that on you dad's okay i hope i actually passed away in october oh sorry at the time you
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:25.520]   know it was the beginning of knowing but see here's the thing that tricked me out i recently just took
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:30.800]   a look at my gate data because i had you know my knee replaced like two years ago and
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:36.640]   my gate data is actually showing me how my leg is healing i like it every thought to look at that
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:41.360]   how many people have this stuff in their watch and don't even look at it i know because it goes
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:46.320]   so underreported i just turned it on last week uh during the show because somebody was talking
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.400]   about that feature and i forgot and i looked at health and there it is and saying oh yeah
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:57.040]   yeah you should turn that on okay so to lighten this up the best part about gate data i find out
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:03.120]   is i'm exactly 36 inch gate so back in the day when we were doing football and we used to mark off
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:09.840]   the penalties i was accurate oh you used that uh three you figured is three feet i'm doing a yard
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:14.880]   each time i stood i stood it tells you that you're it tells you how long your average stride is
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.680]   so i see what my stride how tall are you six foot even oh that's why it's three feet
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:25.680]   all right women where would i find the gate golden ratio math there where would show all health data
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:30.960]   okay stand minutes walking active energy environmental sound levels resting energy
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:37.280]   blood oxygen double support time i don't even know what that is step like oh and the low
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:44.320]   vio2 max is also really good oh wait a minute great okay you you said your gate is 36 inches
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:51.600]   yep mine's 22.8 inches well you take a little bit of small fast steps leo yeah you're not
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:57.440]   that was shorter to me i've stood next to you five ten somehow you know maybe it's an old man
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.760]   thing i maybe it'll take a little step but that actually explains a lot because i will at least
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:07.440]   he'll go walk in and it's like it's like it's like you want me to walk ten bases behind you for
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:13.040]   a reason she's like and now i look at my walking speed you ready for my walking speed what's your
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:18.000]   walking speed doc rock if you have a three foot gate your walking speed has to be pretty good
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:26.880]   yeah mine is two miles an hour oh no i'm more at least is four so basically i'm walking two miles
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:35.120]   behind her every hour it's crazy 22 inches now i'm feeling like you know you but you can
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:39.920]   wait you know you can't work on that it's it's not the size right size doesn't count that much does it
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:47.280]   i mean i've been with you those six inch those six inch platforms you bought in 1973 you got a
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.360]   lot of use out of them but maybe it's time to swap them for a good look at my walking
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:58.080]   new balance nine twenty what's your walking asymmetry doc rock i know but my speed was uh three
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:06.880]   point one so shut up so you're 50 percent five percent five percent my asymmetry is 16.9 percent
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.640]   in a healthy walking pattern the timing of the steps you take with each foot are very similar
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:18.000]   walking asymmetry is the percent of time you steps with one footer faster or slower than the other foot
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:27.040]   i have an uneven uneven walking pattern by stride is short i'm surprised it doesn't send me to the
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:32.560]   doctor saying you're dying i'm even alive how am i even alive dude there is so much good data here
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:37.760]   even the thing like environmental sound levels so one day what's your what's your
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:43.280]   speed they measure your stairs speed yeah he can stare for a while he's got a gaze what's your
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:53.040]   stairs speed it's right down below uh exercise stuff uh stair speed my stairs speed down is 1.4
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:30:02.400]   foot per second my stairs speed up is 0.86 foots per second oh there we go it's 0.72 foot feet per
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:07.760]   second and then 0.66 feet per second oh at least you're not so good on the stairs well yeah because
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:15.600]   i have a metal knee oh oh man at least my walking steadiness is okay you know what it was and he
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:23.440]   was right it's those goldfish uh shoes you had i have kinky boots and i'm not afraid to wear them
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.960]   they're tap shoes you had a really good you had a really good night in the disco one night you
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.320]   think now you think those are your lucky shoes you got them warm all the money shoes yep
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:36.160]   no isn't that interesting i didn't know they had all that stuff in there it's really good to turn
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:41.120]   that on that's fascinating again i wish i wish people would report that stuff instead of all the
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:45.360]   you know let me just try to take correct shots because they're you know in the in the top and
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.920]   i get that every top athlete or every top actor or whatever everywhere that always comes for them
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:55.840]   but there's so much good happening in that health app you know and uh Renee i guess you asked the
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:02.160]   question yesterday and i was multitasking so i don't remember the answer but you Renee had a really
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:08.000]   good thing about one of my if i was at you know at campus and i twisted my ankle and i could just
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.400]   walk in and just like wave my magic phone and they have all of my mental records and they have
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:17.360]   everything that they need in order to properly take care of insurance forms yeah yeah that was
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:23.280]   incredible that was a great question and i you know because we're as i'm getting older i'm like i
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.360]   want that to come sooner than later because i just think that's incredible the piece you're talking
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:34.320]   about Renee did a piece with symbol to say uh the apple vp of health uh yesterday on his youtube
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.400]   channel see if you want to see more of that you guys are following that guy Renee he's pretty cool
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:46.640]   he's he's got a good youtube channel um well she's amazing yeah one feature that's kind of like that
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:51.520]   that too few people activate is that uh first responders when they find your phone they should
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:55.520]   be able to access certain health information that you're making public through the lock screen
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:59.600]   without having to like unlock your phone and that's that's an option you can enable inside apple
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:03.920]   health so that you know who your contact is blood type allergies things like that nice something
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:08.160]   that everybody should do and a lot of people don't realize that that's something cooked for privacy
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.320]   reasons it's not an automatic thing but you flip a switch and it happens i guess really the bottom
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:17.360]   line is apple's firing on all 23 cylinders around my cylinders dad's gonna say like one of the
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:22.080]   things i really like is it goes back to like this old steve jobs video i'm sure you've all seen it but
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.800]   if anyone hasn't seen it they ask him about consultants and he has this this thing where he says
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:30.800]   you know consultants they're they're very superficial they're broad but they're superficial
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:34.720]   but like they only know what a banana tastes like by a picture on the wall and that just misses so
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:39.360]   much and apple's really takes that philosophy to heart like uh with their health team sumbled
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.880]   aside was their vice president she's still a practicing doctor she does like 20 percent time
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:48.880]   at stanford and like the marketing person on on health is is a practicing doctor and jay is a
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:54.640]   practicing like all of these people are industry experts that are brought in but are given the
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.800]   responsibility to ship so it's not just i'm gonna come in and spout a few ideas and i'm gonna leave
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.880]   and like who knows or who cares what happens but they are responsible for shipping those features
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:07.440]   and i believe evan dahl runs um the software team now because kevin is splitting time between
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:12.640]   watch and and in his special projects but it is just such a good team from top to bottom and hearing
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:17.360]   sumble talk about like anyone in the team can have an idea and then we go through the process of
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:21.040]   what are the technical requirements what are the validations what's the research we need to do
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:25.280]   how do we do how do we communicate this to people who like a lot of people find medical data very
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:29.360]   confusing how do we make it look easy for them doctors may be really technical but they may not
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:33.120]   know anything about the technology how do we help them understand what to do with the patient who
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:38.400]   comes in with an ecg from their watch and it's the amount of work that they do every year for these
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:43.360]   features to seem almost effortless is beyond stupefying to me i didn't realize that i was just looking
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:50.000]   at evan dahl's bio he founded flip board i forgot that uh it was an apple then went to flip board
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.240]   then came back to apple and yeah yeah so he's a software can i can i add one thing though i i
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:01.600]   still wish that apple would allow me to buy an apple watch and link it even just even not i don't
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:06.160]   care about my my android phone because i realize it's a complicated thing to it's not a trivial thing
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.480]   in order to make the apple watch compatible with android particularly all the android phones are
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:15.760]   up there but i have an ipad i've got a macbook i really wish that they would make that compatible
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:21.040]   so that i can make that choice where yes my favorite my favorite laptop is a mac my favorite
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:25.440]   phone is an android but my favorite smartwatch particularly for the health features is going to
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:31.040]   be the watch i'd even argue that it's better for apple customers like even if you have an iphone
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:36.080]   the ipad and the mac are way better devices for like going through massive amounts of data
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.560]   looking at large charts like especially now they have trend analysis it's all still confined on a
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:46.000]   tiny iphone screen and i would love that too i want my i why can't the ipad be an equal citizen
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.640]   with the iphone and all this you know it's going to be the good breakthrough too and this goes to uh
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:56.880]   through andy's point why this would be great uh i get my health insurance through blue cross
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:02.160]   mass because you know e-camsin mass juices and they have these things where you can submit you
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:07.120]   know exercise reports and things like that to get lower rates you know you you build points and
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:12.320]   stuff and they give you breaks on you know various things or they give you uh what is it like prizes
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:16.960]   for doing really good for your weight loss or whatever you're going to be able to you know
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:22.400]   telemedicine and things like that to actually lower some health costs because we're working on the
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:28.720]   idea uh she kind of said it yesterday people they do health part and they do the wellness part but
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:33.040]   a lot of people don't do the health and wellness part right like you either all the way sick or
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:38.000]   you're really really working on staying fit but what about that gap in the middle so i think
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.120]   telemedicine and things are going to get to the point where we now can move the data securely that
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:48.240]   we could even have it so that you know your rates and stuff will go down big like like a car right
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.320]   if i know you get an accident and you speed a lot you're going to make your car insurance but if
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:57.120]   you're a healthy and you know you know you look like you know jeff williams maybe your health care is
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:04.880]   cheaper yeah and that's that's probably the only area in which consumers can kind of trust uh
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:10.400]   can kind of trust companies with data because they're limited by HIPAA laws see it's the only
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.960]   really strong set of privacy laws uh in the united states the ones that affect uh you can't you
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:19.200]   if i give you my health information for a purpose it really really makes it difficult for someone
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:24.160]   to abuse that information in a way without my finding out about it and apple is also a company
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:29.600]   that i would trust to i would trust with that kind of information my only worry would be about if they
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:35.680]   let's say that i've been giving them this information like on a quarterly basis to sustain my low rates
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:42.640]   and then i do get sick and they're going to point to oh but uh anti-October 2022 uh turns out that it
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:48.160]   turns out that you were you were walking kind of slowly and you were near a power station so we
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:52.080]   think that that's what gave you cancer and you just you chose to walk in front of there so we're
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:56.800]   gonna deny your claim good luck though where's the shake shake oh they're bastards they're bastards
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.560]   don't give them any information talking about health insurance i mean they painted his toes or
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:04.800]   something because you don't have to listen to this part no well no we have we have we don't have
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.640]   health insurance kind of we have medical insurance scandinavia has health insurance it's not that
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.920]   we're opposed to it we just never bothered to organize it so we'd have nothing preventative
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.520]   the one thing i was going to add though a funny anecdote about strides is when they when when
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:19.920]   back before the world started ending and they were still doing events in kubertino at the steve jobs
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:24.480]   theater um they would take you on these little golf courts from the steve jobs theater to the
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.160]   apple health center for things like watch and health and those stuff and it's quite a trick so
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:33.280]   they got these golf carts for all the media people and everyone else but jeff williams would just
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:38.080]   walk and because he is so tall he would walk faster than every golf but you'd see jeff and you
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:42.560]   guy jeff and he's like i'll see you there and he would just speed right past like four or five golf
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:47.360]   courts at every stride and it was always remarkable to watch well so first the first idea which was
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:51.600]   to rent one of the you have to rent one of those six those those six person bicycles we're all
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:57.200]   facing the center like at the resorts i think i i think yes it usually beer involved is that i
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:04.160]   think yes that thing passes my house every single day i forgot what they call it but it's like a
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:11.040]   bicycle bar and yeah it needs to they drive around so weird yeah it's so weird i don't go to a wahoo
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:17.280]   and ride a bicycle facing in it seems like a bad idea i don't know yes um let's say a little break
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:24.160]   dak rock is here just uh just off of the uh just off of the uh big uh what is that building
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:30.560]   that with the flag on it uh that you next to the the loha tower just next to the loha tower and
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:37.040]   beautiful downtown hodlulu oh wow i get to see that thing every single day and now it's covered in
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:41.680]   led lights so they can use lights for various things whatever's going on there and so yeah
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:47.040]   kind of always look at it or something i think you should have a window behind you with the
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:52.320]   loha tower in it honestly but it's actually in front of me so but yeah i really can see it every
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:57.120]   single day it's pretty funny and i'm with me like when they started changing the colors every
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:01.920]   other couple of days with the lights i then have to go look and see why is it green today this
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:07.600]   yeah that's right that's right it's it's super funny yeah maybe it's on home kit it's great to
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:14.400]   have you doc also of course Andy and not co and ricki speaking of docs i showed today brought to you

[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:10.080]   speaking of tim cook and his 500 raise nice job timmy now we got to break this down he's got three
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:18.960]   million dollars in annual salary fair enough uh he got 82.3 million in stock awards and a 12 million
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:26.640]   dollar cash bonus uh you know if you're if you're running an ungodly well run company
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:31.200]   well the most successful company in the history of non yeah non oligopoly control
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:37.040]   yeah fossil fuel resources or armaments i'm not a big fan of extreme uh CEO compensation
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.560]   but if there is going to be an extremely well compensated CEO i should probably get
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.320]   to him correct can i can i just say that when hr calls him into that conference room for his
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:48.880]   quarterly performance review he's got to be pretty confident he's probably going to get that 4%
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.960]   cost of living increase i've made a i've made it the board must do that right i've made a keynote
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:43:00.560]   presentation explaining why you should give me a raise uh and uh and it's really just one page three
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:06.640]   trillion dollars that's all that's all it's one page uh it's like it's interesting because like
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:12.080]   there's this huge controversy right now in like in in our business uh where i want i won't name and
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:16.720]   shame them but this huge media company that keeps buying all these other magazines and websites
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:23.360]   they froze um all employee pay but gave the CEO like a 12 million dollar 12 million pound bonus
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:28.320]   at the same time there's no hiring uh everyone has to use a surface laptop go no exceptions like
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:34.240]   the whole thing is like and there's and then i i forget there was a whole bunch of drama around it
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:39.280]   so i am totally sensitive to CEOs and especially the disparity of pay between well often they make
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:44.480]   more money the less their employees make right they get rewarded for all those cost getting measures
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:51.200]   um yeah but in this case like he is the most successful it's like and he's not a founder like
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:55.120]   the other thing is like there are like people like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos they don't have money
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.480]   because of their salaries they have money because they have shares and companies the market has
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:03.120]   decided right should be so overvalued that they can buy the moon essentially with a few derivatives
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:08.800]   and that's a very different dynamic to Tim Cook isn't a founder he's worked for the money that
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:17.760]   he's earned at apple 98 how much he should get but 98.7 million dollars in 2021 yeah but there is a
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:23.600]   letter from uh was put a share i'm trying to remember there's there's either shareholders
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:28.880]   are have sent a letter basically saying that we're not upset with his performance but that's like
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:34.800]   2000 times base out the starting salary at apple and maybe that's a lot of money to give to one
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:39.680]   person compared to the lowest people on the ladder yeah and yeah i don't i don't think i don't know
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.840]   if there's a leak i don't i don't know if there's that's gone to the point of the sec now has to
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:47.760]   ask apple to respond to that letter yet but i thought that was kind of interesting because i
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:53.440]   absolutely agree when ukceo is performing like Tim Cook is performing and basically it is benefiting
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:57.280]   pretty much everybody inside the company and all the stock shareholders there's very very little
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:02.640]   room for complaint the old as the only thing that anybody could even bring up that would cause me to
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:07.760]   pause and say well maybe i do have to think about it is again in principle is it okay for a CEO to
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:12.400]   be making so much more than the lowest paid person in the company but that's that's a sociological
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:16.080]   question none of a financial question well i know so you have to talk to the board of directors the
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:20.720]   board is handpicked usually by the ceo and so they're off it's very much in the pockets of ceo in this
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:24.800]   case well the shareholders bring it up but but they don't apple chooses not to vote on it every
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:28.160]   year yeah but the only other thing like to add to Andy's point is like if there's any company that
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:32.880]   could afford and i i i'm as wary of spending Tim Cook's money as anybody else but if there's any
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:39.760]   company that could afford to treat every person on staff from like from like the the the first day
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:45.040]   retail on up and not even think about using contract like it still really bugs me that apple
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:48.720]   he plays the same kind of contract employee game that other big tech companies pay because it
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:53.200]   played because there's any company that should be premium not just like across products but top to
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.880]   bottom of the organization it should be apple like that's something worth spending that so i'm
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:02.800]   gonna be fair to Tim and we'll break it down he got the same salary as he got last year he did not
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:08.240]   get a raise it's three million last years three million this year most of that money comes from
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:16.400]   uh his contract uh the award was arranged 10 years ago when he took over his ceo in the
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:22.080]   condition he stayed on the job for 10 years so that's where that big 82.3 million dollars in stock
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:27.600]   came from that was an incentive given to him at the very beginning of his employment as ceo
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:33.600]   uh so that you know you can't it's not you can't really blame them for that the 12 million
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:38.800]   dollars in bonuses also contractual uh for hitting apple's financial and environmental goals
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:44.480]   um and its retention because he doesn't need to work today in his life again yeah yeah and in fact
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:50.160]   a lot of this is to keep him from retiring um the equity plan consists i'm reading from uh the
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:55.120]   observer uh equity plan consists of two equal parts one is performance based the other is
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:47:02.240]   scheduled to vest in three annual installments from 2023 through 2025 the non-performance part
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:08.960]   vest even if he retires but not the not the performance part so it's really kind of all there to
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:16.320]   incentivize him to stay on the job and in fact he took a vacation cash out he didn't take vacation
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:22.080]   so he got a vacation cash out of 23 000 dollars and and i'm happy to see that they're planning
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:29.920]   for his retirement apple did put 17 000 into his 401k and that's i think very very important you
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:36.720]   know what the shareholder message skips though and i can say this as an ex-apple employee the company
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:44.880]   takes extremely well care whatever you know i'm trying to say i got my ice fix not my brain um
[00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:51.840]   they take really good care of you right and also starting i want to say april or something uh hoping
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:57.760]   i get my friends in trouble um they're getting double sick days uh part-timers are getting double
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:04.640]   sick days um they are increasing salaries for all of the lower employees so it's not just that
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:10.080]   Tim's getting all this money they're you're sending it across the board that's what you want to see
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:14.800]   now it's not that's not slowing down the unionization effort there still is an effort to unionize the
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.720]   apple stories you know guarantee right this is going to happen because there's people that will
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:24.240]   always be that but the funny thing is in the stories about Tim right you got if you dig deep
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:29.360]   enough you'll find where apple has planned and stuff that's supposed to start like first of april
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:33.920]   or april for something like that where they're going to push you know the employee benefit package
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:39.840]   up and that covers all 270 stores so as apple retail employees who would be the lowest paid
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:46.320]   people um and yeah even when i worked at apple retail like our lowest paid we're still the highest
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:53.520]   paid in them all like it's crazy so i i just i just people would add to that right so i know i think
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:49:00.000]   mark reported it like beginning of February but that gets glazed over again right like oh look
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.280]   Tim's getting the raise so is everybody at apple so just keep it real but the just just to make a
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:09.680]   quick point about the unionization efforts at apple retail most of their complaints are that
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:16.880]   they're they're they're they're they're uh their pay is not keeping up with inflation and they're
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:21.520]   mostly asking for cost of living increases that keep up with inflation and and and i can see how
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:26.480]   we think no one's pay is keeping up with inflation because this seven percent inflation was not
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:32.800]   expected you know i mean uh we haven't kept our employees up with inflation because nobody thought
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:38.320]   we would have inflation like this this is out of nowhere you know just when when the the situation
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:46.000]   as i call it hit i know that like my buddy's got their full salary to be at home for like six months
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.440]   true and then they started thinking about well how can we still function as a business like they
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:56.800]   got no reduction in pay they got no they got their full salary the entire time and not a lot of
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:02.320]   companies that have money was doing that you know that's right they should get credit when they do
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:08.800]   stuff cool like that they should get credit for that's all i'm saying um you know the dot ds
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:15.520]   underscore store file i hate that damn file so that's why i hate that damn i named my cat dot ds
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:20.720]   underscore file you won't see it if you only use max i think but if you ever copy it to one driver
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:27.600]   uh um you know drop box yeah i guess you probably don't see it on i cloud because apple would hide it
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:33.280]   but that's a hidden file that is on all directories every single directory i see it because i always
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:40.960]   forget to add it to my git ignore file and github syncs it right up to my my git my github um well
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:47.680]   don't copy it to your google drive because google drive users not all of them a few of them have
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:53.360]   gotten copyright infringement notices over their dot ds underscore store file
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:51:02.560]   does the ria claiming that now too uh you if you got an email saying a file of yours violates
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:07.920]   google drives terms of service you can you could pretty much ignore this comes from bleeping computer
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:15.200]   um you know it probably is the case that somebody copyrighted a repository somewhere that had
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:22.560]   accidental ds store files what's what is ds underscore store anyway it's your um your file
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:29.920]   attributes meditate here yeah the basics yeah who owns it your chones your seven sevens
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:35.200]   sevens so they don't keep that in the file they keep that in a separate kind of index of of all
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:41.200]   i was hoping it was a nintendo controller but not lost it's not here's here's the uh from google drive
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:49.040]   safety the tweet your file violates google's drive terms services restricted file dot underscore
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:56.960]   ds underscore store wow uh google op- uh you know sis oh sorry whoops mistake don't worry about it
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:03.040]   google is continuing to reevaluate and kind of tighten up of uh content restrictions on google
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:09.200]   drive files because it really is being used as the the the the pirate channel for people who don't
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:14.560]   understand how use net or how these other transports work uh like if you go on reddit anytime you see
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:21.200]   uh a tv show posted from like two days ago or a movie posted oftentimes it'll be like a link to
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:25.440]   uh link to drive and so i'm told that over the past like four five or six months have been
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:30.080]   becoming a lot more vigilant about that kind of thing yeah google says they've corrected all
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:37.360]   known cases were files are incorrectly flagged uh we're still updating some edge cases don't worry
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:42.880]   if you get that notice don't freak out i don't know i think finally dot ds underscore store is
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:49.280]   getting the the attention and it deserves it's it's about time just happy to see that
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:54.080]   it's desktop services by the way oh is that what ds stands for yeah if you want to be super nerdy
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:58.880]   as desktop services so yeah it's not the only one isn't there another hidden file that um
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:04.000]   feel like there's two for you remember well back in the day Leo we had the dot sony right we
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:10.080]   remember you made something that's so yeah um i feel like i should look in my github
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:12.720]   [laughter]
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:19.680]   hey now this one i want some clarification on i saw this tweet a couple of days ago well from hector
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:27.520]   martin markan 42 on twitter well this is unfortunate turns out apples custom nvme drives are amazingly
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:35.600]   fast if you don't care about data integrity if you turn it on they drop down to hdd performance
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:43.120]   uh this has to do with uh caching and of course to get great performance modern hard
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:50.160]   uh modern disk controllers often have uh caches that they then flush the issue of course is if your
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:55.520]   system suddenly is turned off before the data is flushed you'll be uh you will lose some data
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:54:02.320]   as it turns out according to martin at macOS cheats on linux f-sync will both flush rights to the
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:08.640]   drive and ask it to flush its right cache to stable storage but on macOS f-sync only flushes rights
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:14.320]   to the drive instead they provide an f_unu score full sync operation to do what f-sync does
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:20.080]   on linux so cheating is not quite right it's just apple is optimizing the speed of its of its
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:29.120]   file system um yeah michael michael sly had a really good roundup of of takes on this uh and
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:35.760]   basically it's a combination of it's a problem it's a problem that basically every implementation
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:39.920]   of unix and linux have to deal with in some way shape or form because there's no perfect way of
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:45.120]   handling it chiefly because all of the different drives that that os has to deal with in their
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:51.520]   controllers the the firmware is locked up and the people who write this code don't understand
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:57.040]   exactly what the drive is expecting in terms of cache handling and so everybody seems to have
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:01.120]   their own way of figuring out what's the what's the best way to balance
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:06.880]   safety and integrity of data versus speed the only thing that seems to be consistent amongst
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:13.280]   all commentators is that uh a common a common of a common flush system that apple is using seems
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:19.280]   to be slower than what you'd see in other systems but yeah i agree the i think i think that he was
[00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:24.800]   being a little bit uh the sort of shorthand you use on twitter when you when he said that they're
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:28.880]   cheating i don't think he meant that he was trying to i don't think i don't think he was using an
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:33.600]   apple of it and in fact their f_s_n_s_ and samsung yeah uh test results right there that
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.400]   it's just that it's something it's a two layer problem and they have their own
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:42.560]   possibly of faking dealing yeah uh hector by the way is uh porting asahi linux to mac os so this is
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:50.960]   why he became aware of this michael sy has uh put all of his uh thoughts together on his blog mj t s a i
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:56:01.280]   dot com um and uh yeah if you're worried about this i think you shouldn't cheating is probably a
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:05.440]   little bit of a loaded word there are a bunch of like really annoying things that apple file
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.840]   system does and apple file systems apples new file system and there's you know they they've been
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:14.320]   working on it aggressively since they launched it but there's it still drives me bonkers you on a
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:18.400]   weekly basis if nothing else but a lot of the stuff is trade-offs it's like just like you can
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:22.240]   have it one way or another you can't have it both ways you can try to balance as best you can and
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:26.080]   they make choices i agree with the choices i disagree with i care about speeds i don't
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:29.680]   worry about this but if you care about integrity you're going to sacrifice some speed and i don't
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:32.480]   think i don't think there's a way for you to have your cake and eat it too with this you've just
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:37.920]   got to pick what works best for you yeah and apple has a solution according to manured handley
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:44.320]   that works it's just you know it doesn't it's not it's not what everybody else is doing and so
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:49.200]   the confusion the only thing they had to do the file system to make it great which we have now
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:57.200]   is uh when i'm copying things over from say like a one ssd to another and a file doesn't like
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:03.360]   something don't quit the whole thing not a fix to get before yep that we were in the we were in the
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:09.760]   cave ages until like what monoray that was that drove me baddie so i was used forklift you know
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:15.600]   just but regular folks don't know that and so you got i copied hundreds and hundreds of pictures
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:21.360]   one picture gets mad there's 300 more to go um which picture out of the 500 caused this problem
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:26.640]   that i can ignore i don't know start over also if you're concerned about this and you're running
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:32.880]   software for the mac you probably aren't operating at that level but if you are uh the developer
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:38.560]   pages at apple have a very good uh description of how you can reduce disc rates and uh what calls
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:44.720]   to make for best practices uh and and you follow best practices you're going to be just fine i don't
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:50.160]   i don't notice any significant data loss uh with apples don't worry about this and they still worry
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:54.320]   about like battery charging but this stuff is like so like the degree of sophistication behind this
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:58.480]   stuff now they go so far as to use machine learning patterns to figure out how you use your stuff
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:02.880]   and then try to preemptively load the things you use most because at worst it's a wash at best it's
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:07.040]   a little bit faster and they intelligently move it around so you're not hitting the same cells all
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:12.480]   the time and not causing like consistent wear in the same places it's moved so far beyond we had
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:16.720]   to micromanage all this time to begin with the operating system takes care of that or even
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:23.280]   the control in a way you can't work really anymore back in my day we ran defrag yeah i know people still
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:31.520]   ask you did you reg it at that you know i still have a drizzle i was just gonna i was gonna make
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:36.080]   a wise-ass comment that's okay go ahead what drives you not drives me nuts on a on a on a
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:40.160]   still a weekly basis is like a pf s has wonderful characteristics and again everything is a trade-off
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:44.080]   and for things like copying it's incredibly fast but because of the way it copies when i then go in
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:48.640]   and delete things from packages for example finder never updates so like i can delete 200 gigs
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:52.240]   worth of stuff and finder will still say i have those 200 gigs even though every third party
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:56.160]   utility will say it's gone and i still can't find a way to force it to update because it still just
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:59:01.360]   sees the clones like they're there are so many things that need like these little tiny fixes uh but i i
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:07.440]   do deep breathing and i move on move on yeah as we are going to do but get ready get your blood
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:14.400]   pressure will go back up as we talk about comixology when we come back i know you comic book fans are
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:19.040]   up in arms i've been pushing caffeine so i'll be nice and wired and twitch you will be talking
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:25.760]   about this i sure they've brought to you by molesa you know your address date is going bad it's rotting

[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:33.680]   prem but you can also use their web service you can even upload to a secure ft piece a server and

[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:20.640]   list they could do identity verification which is actually a great idea these days it eliminates
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:27.760]   uh you know false id and so forth reduces your risk it also ensures compliance and mostly keeps
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:32.720]   customers happy if you want uh longitude and latitude coordinates they've got geo coding

[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:32.000]   christmas cards go to the right address every year. So comicsology this isn't exactly just
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:39.040]   an apple story but I did when I saw this in polygon I thought I'm gonna have to talk to
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:44.400]   Annie or nay about this because I know you love comicsology amazon bought them and now
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.560]   apparently they're taking features out and changing some things things that I thought was
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:57.840]   were really great about comicsology. So there's no two page view there's no zoom
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:05.840]   it's a little bit complicated they so they did a sort of like a soft merge like a number of years
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:12.560]   ago where you can now sign into the comicsology.com website and use their use their online web reader
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:18.400]   and use their their comicsology app and you do all that sign on through amazon and if you bought
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:23.760]   comic books on amazon.com they would also miraculously show up in your in your comicsology account and
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:30.160]   vice-versa but last week just a few days ago they changed it so that now there's a brand there's a
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:37.280]   brand new app for all the phones particularly for the ipads and for the iPhones they're they
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:41.200]   have forced you to update to that you can't just simply stick around with your with the old version
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:46.160]   I will say that that's actually a win because the new the old version was kind of frumpy it really
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:51.840]   wasn't very very modern there are a lot of new features in the new app that I enjoy because I
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:57.440]   read my comics on my ipad pro big 12.9 inch ipad pro so for me the reading experience hasn't changed
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:03.040]   however the problems happen for people who are reading comics on laptops because now that really
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:09.040]   wonderful muscular comic comic book oriented web reader that used to get on comicsology.com
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:14.400]   has been swapped out for kind of an enhanced version of the kendall book reader which is in no way
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:18.880]   optimized for reading comics so when you do things like reading a reading a single page you'll just
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:23.920]   sort of shrink it down to the size to the vertical size of your screen when you have a two-page spread
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:30.160]   for some reason it wants to put margins all around it and in addition people who don't live in the
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:35.040]   united states they can no longer have subscriptions to their to their favorite comics there are a lot
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:40.880]   of other features that have sort of been disabled and turned off i hope this is basically all down to a
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:47.600]   up transition that they pulled the trigger on before they were really ready to go forward
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:52.000]   but this is causing a lot of people to ask well geez man i'm gonna use one of the many many
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.040]   alternatives to comicsology which turns out to be just really piracy if you want to get books on
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:01.600]   the day that they released or if you or wait three or four months and get one of those subscriptions
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:07.680]   to marvel and dc directly so it's a it's a bad thing people people people people who expect every
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:12.960]   wednesday like me like i i once i don't say that i i i arranged my entire week around wednesday
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:18.240]   when new comics come in however there is a certain metronome a regular beat to my life that has been
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:22.960]   consistent for a couple decades and it has been that i will get my comics on on wednesday this is
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:28.880]   what i will do i mean you disrupt that and make that work no make that work less well as it used to
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:33.040]   that's a really really bad thing all i know is pet and alswald was upset and if
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:38.960]   and as well is upset i'm upset so that's good you know it's just a desktop reader in fact you like
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:44.160]   the new app for i i pad is a great way to read comics the the new the new app is really nice there
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.920]   there's a lot of things that are that are good about this including like the now if you go to
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:52.800]   comicsology.com it'll take you immediately to the amazon.com comic book storefront which is
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:58.640]   not quite so good but the thing is it'll also it's set up like amazon so that it will not just
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:02.320]   not just simply take you to oh you're here on wednesday here the new releases today
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:06.320]   it will basically tell you take you to the front of the store and you have to scroll down before you
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:09.680]   get to new comics which is a bummer but we'll also at the top say oh by the way since you're a prime
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:13.760]   member here are a whole bunch of comics that you you get for free and i didn't realize oh i could
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:17.920]   have gotten like the sandman for free instead of having to like actually purchase it although
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:23.520]   whatever uh there there are things to like about it but the thing is it's i don't think that you
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:28.480]   i don't think you judge a transition like this just by how happy people are that look at the the
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:32.640]   positive things when you get people that are like saying you know what i'm going to learn how to
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:37.280]   pirate comics right now because that's really the only way that i can now it's not an unreadable
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:41.600]   experience it's like you get the same reaction that i had when apple updated the macbook pro and
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:46.000]   changed that keyboard to something that was it's functional but i can't use it and now i don't
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.400]   want to use my macbook anymore that's the sort of stuff that you really really want to avoid well
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:56.560]   here's a tweet from librarian megg book girl megg on twitter librarian here comixology was an
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:02.000]   invaluable reference for us in both cataloging and patron interaction it's a hundred percent
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:08.640]   useless now which is sad but i think you're right it sounds like they were my they're planning to
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:15.920]   migrate the web and hadn't finished it pulled the put push the button a little early maybe let's
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:21.200]   hope let's grasp fingers amazon will clean that experience up um yeah or do you think it has to do
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:26.240]   with the storefront like they want to move you to the amazon's storefront yeah there's been
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:30.800]   another problem that is not just for the users it's also also for publishers where it used to be
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:35.600]   a used to be able to submit comics and uh there's a there's a very very well greased rails to get
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:40.320]   things into the store now that's a lot of that's being managed through amazon now another person
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:45.840]   who's under the industry that i talked to the other day just casually says that he's wondering if
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:50.720]   part of it was that all the publishers that had their deals through comixology
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:56.800]   had royalty deals that were based on comixology and by forcing people to always buy things through
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:01.760]   the kit through the amazon store maybe now they will be subject to higher amazon royalties i don't
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:06.240]   know that for sure but that that's something i'm taking a look at but that would say oh yep that's
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:10.480]   just a bunch of a bastard thing for someone to do with it
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:14.720]   there's a reason why companies become that rich and successful it's not by saying
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:20.160]   yeah but that would be wrong we'd be kind of unfair wouldn't it yeah so this is so in a way
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:25.600]   this is what apple you know is inserting their rights with the app store on ios amazon saying
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:30.640]   no no you got to buy it through the amazon store instead of a dedicated comic store you
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.440]   i'm sorry you forgive my ignorance and this but i've never purchased a comic yeah i just use free
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.200]   comics for free comix day that's all
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:43.280]   i switched i switched to all the unlife forget the jersey one but i switched to marvel unlimited
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:47.280]   because i like i can wait i like so much stuff to do that i sometimes i'm jealous and want to buy
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:51.760]   something immediately but i would i just i can go open it and read every comic made from like last
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:57.360]   year back to the beginnings of time and it makes me ridiculously happy it's like i switched over
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:02.480]   and i'm i regret it sometimes but i don't regret it enough that i'm gonna switch back yeah no we that
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:07.040]   and that's the point told me that initial d is on for free for prime i didn't know that
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.360]   now i can go back and reread some initial d
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:15.280]   yeah it's there's there's a lot of deep dive stuff on there let's say like when sagging hit i was
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:20.160]   jealous i wanted to go back but i can wait yeah my my but my difficulties that this is this is the
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:25.840]   reason why i mean this is this is the reason why like i buy you know dvd's and blue rays and rip
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:30.240]   them to my library when i own something i want to have control over the entire experience
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:35.600]   and the problem is that if i i'm relieved that i really like the new comixology app but if it were
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:39.680]   terrible if it were just oh get you oh great you're i now have to read everything in the kindle app and
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:44.240]   they haven't done anything on the kindle app to make it more comics friendly i mean i have like two
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:50.080]   to three thousand comics that i've bought through comixology what what what choice do i have none
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:54.480]   because it's all drm'd uh oh that was that's another thing that they another switch that they
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:59.600]   pulled a lot of publishers have the option of allowing uh purchasers to download dm
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:04.640]   drm free copies of their comics if they so choose and now that apparently is no longer an
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.640]   option so there are a lot of really small things that are really really changing the experience
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:15.520]   i do hope they don't change the audible storefront to uh to be the amazon storefront that would be a
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:21.360]   bummer so this that's it's comparable to that right yeah and that's that's not a good example
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:27.760]   like i can't i can't stream directly from the app to to my smart speakers but if and if it were
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:31.920]   if i simply bought those bought those books as cds and rip them it was it would just be an audio
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:38.400]   file that can use the the audio player of my choice so okay okay
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:47.200]   it did let's see what else is going on in the world uh paddle this is uh another app store story
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:55.760]   the ceo of paddle has signed up 1500 developers with one billion dollars volume for the rival
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:01.040]   payment system yeah they were all in before there was one they were all in like their
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.400]   press release went out the second there was a court case they're like we're all in we're coming
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:09.760]   we're going and they're like wait what no uh their fee would be 10 percent on transactions
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:16.320]   lower than 10 bucks five percent for purchases more than ten dollars plus 50 cents uh of course
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:20.880]   you got to get apple to allow it and unless you're a Dutch dating app i'm just forgetting on though
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:27.920]   yeah you don't have all but is south korea a Dutch dating apps where else can you use a certain
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:32.320]   pan japan now yeah but it's unclear what it all means like it's still so unclear but i think
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:36.160]   their their play paddle wants to be the first like they want to win this they don't want it to go to
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:41.680]   pay power to stripe or to shopify or to anybody else they want to be the de facto easiest second
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:47.040]   alternative to apple available when when and if that that becomes the thing but but notice that
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:52.480]   what they're offering these these publishers isn't simply lower lower commissions it's also you
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:56.640]   want to be able to like give up give up coupons we'll let you give up coupons you want to be able to
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:01.920]   have a more a closer relationship to your users we'll let you do that too all the stuff that apple
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:07.200]   has been saying oh well if you we'll have all this stuff that apple that developers have been asking
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:13.120]   for for years and years and years that apple has been said nice boy here's here here's a new copy of
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:18.480]   xx code here's a new hat go back and write a new software i hope that just let just like all this
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:23.840]   hubbub over the past few years has forced apple to just out of the blue suddenly decide to say
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:27.280]   well if you're not making much money off of the apple if you're not if you're not generating a
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:31.760]   million dollars worth of revenue we'll waive all these fees for you and we'll also like give you
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:35.680]   a couple of other things we haven't given you before i hope that this also makes them want to
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:39.920]   spontaneously think of ways to give developers things they've been asking for for a long long
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:44.560]   time because once the i think this really showed off what happens when there is some sort of
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:50.160]   competition when apple has to compete for the first time uh so torn on this because like recently i
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:55.040]   i want app store reform in the worst way possible but recently i i made a new email address and i
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:58.960]   bought a bunch of stuff that i just couldn't buy on the app store and that address didn't exist
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:04.080]   anywhere else and now it gets so many marketing it even gets us political marketing messages
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:07.920]   and the only way that happens is that it got immediately sold to a bunch of mailing lists and
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:11.280]   i'm glad they have a better customer relationship with me but that was not part of any bargain that
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:16.560]   i signed up for as a customer when i bought their stuff and i i kind of want a world where i have like
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:20.800]   like there there are rules that they have to follow about when they can and will ask me and what
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:25.040]   they can do with that i just don't want them to necessarily be apple's rules it's funny because i
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:31.280]   create a custom email for every single thing i sign up for thinking well if they ever do that i
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:37.040]   will know you know if all of a sudden i'm getting a bunch of spam to verizon at laport.email well i'll
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:42.960]   know but in fact it hasn't uh it hasn't happened yet maybe i'm just signing up for the wrong things
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:47.680]   um which you want to say which payment system i don't because some of them have like people
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.960]   that i know are involved with them and i did it like there's a way to support them and it wasn't like
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:55.760]   for ask it was like for a lot of like you buy this and you get to do ab or c with it and it just
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:02.080]   that's frustrating it's really fun so fast i thought i thought i'd catch a lot of that going on it actually
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:07.600]   hasn't happened but i guess they're all it takes one or two bad actors to make you what's what sucks
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:13.360]   is the apps that won't let you go back in and change it so for instance like there's apps that you have
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:18.000]   and say you did sign in with google because you're on your phone and you need to do this app right
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:24.480]   okay now here's a perfect example so you go to the trip right and then there's a parking thing
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:28.640]   and they say oh pay for your parking with your phone because it's easier than getting to take it
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:32.320]   and then going to get a stamp and do all these other things right so you have these little boxes
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:36.400]   but really slow modems on them that allow you to pay for parking and municipalities all over the
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:45.840]   planet and everyone uses a different app thank you that's the key to this experience okay so
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:51.600]   you download this thing and wait i saw them like um uh what's the guy what's the guy's name oh all
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:58.240]   all right if you're sorry david i don't know kipper godfrey oh gilbert godfrey yeah i just
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:04.080]   i'll call myself godfrey but you uh you download this app and in order to get into work you have to
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:11.120]   make an account okay all right we're cool so back until recently you know we had google or facebook
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:16.560]   with your choices or you did the email away so you just picked google because it was quickest right
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:22.880]   you get it and it's done and so now apple came out with sign up with the private email and
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:28.960]   also which is fantastic but these apps that don't give you a way to go back in and switch to that
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:33.440]   right which would then help i guess kind of eliminate stuff because you've blocked all the
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:38.000]   way they've been sending but it will at least stop you from getting any future stuff you know that
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.800]   they might scrub your list for and i just hate apps that don't let you go back in and change that
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:49.760]   and drives me happy yeah i completely agree the part you just got me with the part each one is
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:57.440]   everyone is on app i need a folder folder yes folder okay and you think oh well yes what i
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:01.760]   have to sign up and stuff but this is going to save me so much time down the road no every in
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:07.280]   its boy it's ridiculous i don't know how it is in a way it's every town it's charging apps because
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:12.720]   i would let you carry the charging app there's like 97 charging apps dude the electricity is
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:19.680]   one thing why do i have so many charging apps well you know i get free charging from Ford on
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:24.080]   electrify america but if i go to charge point it's another thing and i got to sign up and i don't
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:30.240]   know i actually think doesn't fit in yeah if you get tasla to fit in i would and the thing that
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:35.680]   annoyed me this is a complete rattle uh we were in carmel and there was the hotel didn't have a
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:41.040]   charging thing but two blocks away there was a public charger and there's some idiot in in a
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:47.040]   hybrid not charging plugged i think he thought oh well this means i can plug i can park here
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:54.000]   it's a parking space for green cars no it's for people were charging so i jammed myself in next to
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:00.640]   him and took the plug that he should have been using but it wasn't used it and then of course he's
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:04.320]   pissed off because he can't get any has to get in the other side of his car he shouldn't have been
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:10.080]   there in the first place so he unplugs it from my car we had those we had those idiot truckers parking
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:14.240]   at the tasla things just to show they're they're oh yeah they're seeing a lot of like like why are
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:19.280]   you angry over elective don't be angry let me use it go away you got plenty of gas fidget people i
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:25.120]   don't i don't park in your gas station doesn't count no hybrid does not count i'm sorry if you're a
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:31.600]   plug-in hybrid okay you're part of it it was a plug-in i think it was a it was a bmw so of course
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:39.440]   it guys an asshole a usp a hard way to do it i know i'm teasing you i'm teasing you
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:46.320]   uh uh no but it was it was a it was one of those uh plug-in hybrid bmw's but he wasn't plugged in that's
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:52.080]   the point that's the point yeah he's allowed to park in charge with hybrids that plugged there that's
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:57.760]   ridiculous you don't have a plug you just got a hybrid and you just plug no no no look look
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:02.880]   and i got it hybrid people like we're in laws i get it but hey we still can plug it plug-in hybrids
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:09.360]   are fine which one do you have the 333 or whatever that is five five nice five thirty i very nice
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:12.960]   very very nice a usc port in your car does not make it a hybrid sir
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:22.160]   oh that's all right i'm sorry i just completely just completely rabbit hole that one i'm sorry
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.400]   sorry it's my bad news my fault with the parking no you're right though it bugs the
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:34.880]   hell out of me i just did a g squad move on that my bad g squad that's my my jerry i think people that
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:38.480]   in my streams that just go sideways talking about stuff they have nothing to do when we're talking
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:46.160]   oh well that's me i'm the geriatric guy in your stream i'm in the g squad now if you get 10% off
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:52.240]   at dennies if you go there before 430 you're in the g or in the g squad dude i just discovered a
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:58.640]   hotel gives a discount for 55 as a senior and and i i'm like did you know what does this count
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:06.640]   our our local our local grocery store does that 255 is uh is considered senior that doesn't count
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:12.480]   i shouldn't count so so that's why this show ends before golden corrallop absolutely gotta get
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:19.600]   their early bird special kids okay it's making sense microsoft edge is coming on strong
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:29.200]   almost beating safari in the desktop browser workers nobody beats chrome which completely owns
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:33.520]   because of the tabs right because those god awful tabs from last of the edges there's so many bad
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:40.560]   things about edge now um so google chrome at 65.38 percent of the browser market
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:51.360]   um but mozilla 9 percent oh actually edge is bigger than mozilla now it's 9.54 percent
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:57.040]   safari 9.84 percent so i'm still really salty they they got rid of their original rendering
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:01.200]   engine we we such a nice competitive browser rendering engine market we had tried it into that
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.880]   became everything's grown now and they got rid of it now it's all chromium everything's chromium
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:10.880]   it's fine yep yep there's it's but it should be noted that like last year was like the first
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:16.960]   year that microsoft kind of took out their old 1990s playbook on how to market web browsers
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:22.640]   where they started to get a lot more aggressive about about edge being the default browser and
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:26.880]   discouraging people from switching away from it and making it hard for people to sort of
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:32.720]   to to use substitutes for it so there's a and also there's a lot more
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:38.000]   lot more companies worldwide that are switching from switching to windows 10 and windows 11 which
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:44.240]   were the first os's of windows that had edge as the default so it's not necessarily that safari
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:49.120]   is getting less popular it's more like that's the temperature of the environment at this point
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:56.800]   yeah yeah um but do do do do do do i'm not gonna do any apple car rumors
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:03.280]   good so you can buy one meal so you can buy one feels like it's getting closer rabbit hole
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:09.600]   yeah how many clowns can we fit into an apple car yeah it'll it'll only get interesting once
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:15.360]   we start hearing rumors of really solid supply chain rumors of who's manufacturing what right
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:19.920]   at that point it gets i mean it's it's always fun every every once in a while to think about
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:25.920]   to try to figure out why the hell apple is even interested in this yeah uh yeah but so this is
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:32.160]   kind of a related story apple is developing chip modules and packages to be used in the apple car
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:40.000]   with a south korean semiconductor assembly and test from osat the uh uh this comes from the elect
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:47.840]   which i've never heard of but if they're working with osat to develop a module for the autopilot
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:56.000]   function according to sources so this is one of those how do you know whose source is and how do
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.680]   they know so the elect is that is that the nine to five site or is that the korean site because
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:03.520]   there's two of them that can feel the it's the korean site i think it's it's the korean
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:11.680]   th e l a c dot com not electric the uh the press press the hongor button at the top
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:17.360]   oh yes yeah i could turn it into korean just like that chon chonung daki beneath that
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:25.200]   you is that japanese does korean that's korean you speak korean and japanese yeah i didn't know that
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.200]   you're like that reporter who did all his different languages uh in front of uh the
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:36.720]   do you see that the ap reporter that was amazing yeah how many languages do you speak doc rock
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:49.200]   including swearing five english english uh bad english Japanese korean Spanish and swearing that's
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:56.640]   impressive that's impressive mostly number five is my number one you should see me in traffic
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:01.200]   actually actually half of that is sign language that's probably a six language yeah there you go
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:05.280]   you point out that doc rock swears like a proper person by that i mean a gen x person
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:08.640]   like because like whatever the millennials and centenials call swearing is just different
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:14.720]   are you fluent are you fluent in swearing doc rock can you read it you write it yeah yeah i think
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:20.560]   the time somewhere between the time in the army and then just um you know grown up as a black
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:27.360]   Puerto Rican kid raised by koreans i got a tip oh so you were raised by koreans so you're actually
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:34.160]   a native speaker almost no no my my when i moved here my sort of adopted parents just like took me
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:37.680]   in and i worked for them that's why i learned all of my electronic stuff my whole computer
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:42.880]   nerdery because we owned an electronic story we were a soty story basically here so that's how i got
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:47.600]   into video and in audio and all the i didn't know about your dad i'm very sorry to have heard
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:56.320]   that that's sad yeah condolences thank you sure it's tough uh foldable iphone no not not this year
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:05.120]   not next year maybe according to a report 2025 but here's the here's the really wild one apple is
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:11.920]   apparently mulling a 20 inch foldable macbook display give it to me now so my understanding is
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:15.680]   that the foldable part works is the unfoldable part that's still still problematic
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:23.360]   anytime you want but unfolding it again not quite there yet this comes from dscc analyst ross
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:28.720]   young uh foldable notebook why would you want a foldable notebook i don't i'm not a fan of the
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:34.480]   all notebooks are foldable once yeah exactly at once i've had the only unfoldable notebooks okay
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:39.520]   so i have a question just really just small you know poll how many you guys really want to fold
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:46.560]   before i i actually really like the z flip um i had those flip three actually i just packaged it up
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:53.520]   to senate stacey eigenbotham because as i said i'm getting the ultra uh 22 ultra uh today but um i
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:59.760]   like that idea and lisa was very attracted to it because so the flipper the fold leo the flip i
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:06.880]   had the fold and i don't want the fold that's not good but the flip makes it so small nothing uh it
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:11.840]   has a little screen on so you can see notifications you can see the time uh and then but it's so
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:16.960]   compact it's like the pocket square or something lisa was really trying to it so i said it won't
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.240]   work with your apple watch and she said oh we'll never mind then um and that's boy apple lock in
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:27.200]   to me you're adding one more step having to unfold it to do something like if you know you stop for
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:32.720]   guys like us it's not for big guys it's for it's for people who want a small phone you know they
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:36.080]   could put in their purse isn't the history of humanity the history of folding things like we fold
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:40.720]   everything we fold our clothes we fold sandwiches we fold pizzas if you're in new york we fold books
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:45.040]   like what's a book a book's a foldable parchment like we just we all over the course of technology is
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:49.280]   we're willing to trade surface area for depth because it's more economical to carry it that way
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:53.120]   so i'm like just make everything fold at a certain point people can choose i'm super happy but i
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:58.560]   but i i got to say that if if there were an ipad mini that folded into the size of essentially an
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:03.360]   iphone something plus that would get my attention really really quickly if i didn't have to give up
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:08.400]   stuff like it gave you got like sort of a second rate camera system on it the battery system wasn't
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:15.760]   very very good the screen was not even okay it was kind of there was a big cut for that there was
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:19.360]   there's a certain premium that i would spend for that because i spend a lot of time like on
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:25.360]   commuter rail on buses just hanging out places and that that's the one thing about this about the
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:31.200]   the Samsung Z Fold that it's like that's a really really good idea and i'm also and i will never ever
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:38.560]   lose the dream of being able to read being able to read a book digitally where i actually have a
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:42.560]   left page and a right page i think that's a wonderful concept even if you have two separate
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:48.160]   screens with a mechanical hinge in the middle like microsoft's duo idea no one's no one's really
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:54.000]   done a really great job of it but you know that's that is always that kind of dream i don't know
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.440]   if it'll be practical i don't know if when it comes out and it's practical i'll be able to afford it
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:04.720]   but this is something that i've always really been keen to see a new new era of hardware devices that
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:11.120]   can mechanically transform to suit whatever the task is and not just simply change user interfaces
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:15.680]   that's remember remember that there we were all old enough to remember when if there was some a
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:19.680]   function on the phone there had to be a button to make that function happen which meant that we had
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:23.920]   tiny screens and big keyboards now when the when the iPhone came out it was like no we can have a
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:28.720]   user interface that adapts to exactly what is needed and nothing more for this app now imagine
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:33.680]   that being a mechanical thing as well imagine having a book or a tablet or a or a fold and have
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:38.560]   pocketable device if you have to make sacrifices for the quality of the screen for the reliability
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:43.680]   screen these things are thick i mean i think maybe it's just early days i do think an idea
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:49.360]   of a of a of a macbook that's the size of a say a 13-inch macbook but unfolds to 20-inch screen
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:58.720]   sorry if i was going to do that i'd go back to 2002 with danger um love that side side side
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:05.920]   side yeah like if i could take the phone and then turn it into two you know to go like Andy said
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:11.280]   go from a phone to a mini by spreading it out i would take that i think that's also easier
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:16.400]   possibly than folding it but either way out if yeah if we're not losing anything and we can fold it
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:21.440]   i'm down but folding just because folding is cute i don't know about that absolutely yeah i mean i
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:26.560]   meant but for i don't think that apple would do the idea of a 19 you know 19-inch 20-inch folding
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:30.720]   laptop because they they would they would really have to prosecute that completely and they would
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:37.920]   have to reinvent what the mac OS is but the idea of having a a 20-inch iMac that when i need to
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:42.880]   leave for for a weekend i could simply take it off my my easel folded in half put in my bag and it
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:47.920]   is suddenly my laptop that's also really really intriguing as well as folding it the other way
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:53.440]   and having an ipad sort of sort of device all that stuff is really really interesting but apple's
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:59.440]   the short company this you look that to your history of uh of what microsoft has done uh
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:05.120]   has done with this surface and it's like it half works for a quarter of the features that you
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:09.600]   would expect it to have apple would want to make sure that well that we have to have a paradigm for
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:12.560]   what you have what happens when you have it in book mode when there's a left screen is it a left
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:17.200]   screen or a white white screen or is it two-page spread what happens when we fold it in half is it
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:22.960]   a just become a macbook with a 10-inch screen or is it now an ipad and i'm not sure that apple
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:28.400]   wants to put that kind of spiritual capital into a very very weird device that's relying on Samsung
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:33.120]   to create a screen that they haven't proven to be able to produce some quantity yet there was a
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:36.720]   good comment a while ago and i forget who said it but that you know apple of course like my
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:42.080]   understanding is that apple again has had foldables uh in prototypes since 2011-2012 hingeables back
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:46.160]   then now foldables um but they just didn't think the technology was mature but the comment that i
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:49.440]   found interesting was they also didn't know what the market longevity was going to be yet
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:53.600]   whether these were just interesting because people were bored of of slabs whether these were going
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:56.960]   to become something in their own right and they were paying attention to the market share of things
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:00.880]   like the fold and the flip and the razor to see if they were going to be like a spike and then
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:03.920]   drop down again or if they're going to be a steady climb and i think that's one of the things that
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:08.720]   apple tends to do is they're very seldom first to market we can tell when they are first to market
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:13.040]   because it's more painful experience but they look and they learn and i could see this like two
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:17.200]   or three years out when they when the technology has matured and they have a better idea of what
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:21.440]   the market actually wants with this they'll learn from everything we're seeing now and then exactly
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:25.680]   to Andy's point like this is ridiculous but like an origami thing that unfolds from a watch into a
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:31.760]   phone into a tablet into a computer into like a laptop into like a screen we'll get there with
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:35.760]   our yard before we get there with physical objects but they like the ability to just have these
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:41.040]   opportunistic interfaces of various and assorted sizes and capabilities is is where we're headed
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:44.560]   it's just where we're going to go and it's going to be fun to watch the apple warby park and mashup
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:50.880]   is going to be just get your money ready wait a minute oh yeah for the yeah yeah get your money
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:57.200]   ready yeah yeah take my money as my uncle is gonna say get your funds right oh i like that rainbow
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:05.600]   band get your funds right you got something to buy now um fda's cleared the first smartphone app for
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:13.440]   insulin delivery interesting yeah that's kind that's kind of a big deal the uh the control i don't
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:18.400]   i don't use one myself but i've been following this uh where insulin pumps they they can tell
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:23.280]   you that they can tell the where that hey you need more you need more right now and but it's up to
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:28.560]   the human to basically make a decision or to make a decision based on that the FDA finally got through
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:33.440]   as very as i as i understand it enough test that you can have this phone app of
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:38.560]   that basically through through a phone interface you can have this happen automatically and that
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:44.480]   the purse could actually be able to control things through phones i was trying to figure this out
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:50.080]   actually last week the map i might have things wrong and i wish i had this is the tandem diabetes
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:58.320]   care device fcc approval it's ios and android um it said it's the first right phone app for ios
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:02.960]   and android to deliver insulin previously delivery had to be handled through the pump itself of course
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:07.840]   you have to have an insulin pump uh installed already but with this update pump users will be
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:15.120]   able to program or cancel ballest doses of insulin which you're taking in meal times uh that's cool
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:19.440]   the big deal is that you're not you're not taking this you're not taking this hardwired
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:24.000]   pump out medical looking device yeah it's it's it's a screen right so basically you're doing what a
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.200]   lot of people are doing inside a restaurant which is you're taking out a phone checking it tapping
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:31.280]   comes right buttons and putting it back in your pockets so that's a big deal um i did miss
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:35.600]   i did misspeak it doesn't do it automatically it's no it's a good remote no automatically might be
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:48.880]   dangerous the serial number on an apple one is in fact handwritten by steve jobs is 45 year old
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:58.400]   mystery uh now uh not all apple ones have a handwritten number on the back a serial number
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:06.640]   but some do and of course people were curious who wrote this was it was was it daniel kotky
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:14.800]   was it paul tarell the board manufacturers say we didn't we didn't put it there uh in fact for a
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:21.680]   factory it would be very unusual to write a serial number in magic marker the pc board
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:32.960]   so uh i guess uh somebody has done a forensic analysis on the handwriting here's what is
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:42.000]   this shady handwriting analysis has been majorly debunked like majorly deboned there's people
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:48.320]   getting out of prison because of bad handwriting in the house yeah so this is cute and uh the apple
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:53.280]   nerd in me of course it's deep jobs just take a guess at it like doesn't really matter yes or
[01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:59.280]   no whatever but unfortunately uh yeah handwriting analysis is the science person in me says is
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:06.160]   debunked so i don't believe it so akim bakay who owns the apple one registry where this story
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:15.520]   lives uh apple one registry dot com uh actually asked for writing samples from daniel kotky
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:22.320]   uh and from steve wozniak kotky owns some postcards and letters from jobs from the 70s
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:31.280]   um the article uh says even a lay person could look at how woz wrote his letters or numbers digits and
[01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:38.080]   how kotky did and could tell it wasn't them you're right i mean i don't think this is
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:42.000]   i don't think this is not what it's not what the pencil is like in an assembler Whitney
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:48.400]   why didn't they just use a drum will then just dig it in like you know always maybe used to
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:52.720]   everybody had those little engraving things that never worked because you could never write good
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:57.840]   but they were all like five to ten dollars and it sounded like a jailhouse tattoo gun
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:05.040]   a this key and you would try to engraze stuff we honestly yeah we we know that steve could just
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:08.880]   stare the number into the thing right it's going to make it with laser stare at laser
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:16.240]   size yeah uh so only 200 apple one computers were produced in two batches of 100 there's
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:22.480]   so only around 82 left uh about 80 of the first batch have a handwritten serial number on the back
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:29.520]   29 of those 80s still exist most of those sold to the bite shop we know that steve went to the
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:37.040]   bite shop and sold them literally in person uh this is the very early days uh bakai went to a
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:41.120]   company in san a nd a california to do the forensic analysis they're one of the most
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:46.240]   he says one of the most renowned companies for sports card evaluation and forensic handwriting
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:50.640]   so you know you can trust them sports card evaluator like hey that's there's big money in that
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:55.760]   you know mess around with that so you're right i mean it's only six digits or something it's uh
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:37:02.160]   not a lot to go on but um also there's a i'm speaking i'm speaking from everything i
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:07.600]   learn as a fan of like nine seasons of the bbc show fake reforption which is one of my favorite
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:12.960]   shows they they basically they spend an entire episode trying to validate a work of art that
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:17.680]   whose whose provenance is in question are kind of missing and i'm thinking back to every single
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:22.880]   time that they're trying to validate something or including handwriting or a signature is piece of
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:28.960]   a piece of evidence and always what they come down to is that we don't just simply we have we have
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:35.040]   that they have uh like 800 different examples of paintings you know okay maybe not 800 i'm sorry
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:41.120]   i'm exaggerating but they they the idea that the uh you can look at simply here is a batch of
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:47.200]   handwriting samples and try to match it to this writing sample numbers are not as unique as signatures
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:52.160]   i'm have to i have to guess and even signatures would have they're not thinking just about how
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:57.120]   this signature work but is it randomized in the way that this person is randomizing things so
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:03.040]   i mean i i'm i feel sorry for somebody if they have to find out that they're 600 000 or a million
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:09.680]   dollar computer is not worth one point two million dollars but you know it's we we the book
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:15.920]   the book the job our life is your parents name you brindor you deserve to be the show called faker
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:24.640]   fortune i for one want to believe and uh it doesn't since it matters not a wit um i believe
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:30.720]   this yeah i would i would you steve hand wrote that number right on there i believe but i but i
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:34.160]   think that rene is kind of onto something i think that what we need to develop a charisma sensor
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:39.040]   because there's still going to be that residual charisma around it if steve jobs actually like
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:44.000]   wrote into that the distortion field right it makes sense that he would i mean he wasn't
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.400]   he wasn't doing the soldering you know it's not a calligraphy like you would expect from a
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:53.920]   student of repollege it's funny you say that the top of the cross the knock right that has always
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:58.080]   been the knock like steve was good at getting other people who were better than him to do the work
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:03.440]   that he can do so says he couldn't solder then uh yeah he was sat around and wrote numbers that makes
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:10.640]   the most logical he's the official letter from psa authentication services the writing is
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:16.720]   consistent considering slant flow pen pressure letter size and other characteristics that are
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:22.560]   typical of the other exemplars we examined in our hobby and professional career as part of the
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:27.120]   authentication process the item has been permanently marked with a proprietary invisible link that
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:34.240]   contains a patented strain of synthetic d_n_a_ which will flores under a calibrated laser
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:39.040]   in addition a tamper evident label containing a unique alphanumeric certification number
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:45.680]   has been placed on the item or on this letter of authenticity wow organic n_f_t_ wow it's got a
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:51.200]   d_n_a_ cert man not steve's somebody just didn't somebody just ask why is that kind of just like
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:55.760]   you know like who was that was that was it was it was it was oh that's steve oh thanks was
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:01.360]   was no mettle business card either right those thank you me i always ask those questions when i
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:06.880]   see just funny reporting but hey look the new the new quote is now good artist barl it was a great
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:13.680]   artist deal and steve serializes here we go a judge today dismissed a 2020 lawsuit
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:19.680]   from the makers of i diverse icons an app that claimed apple it violated their copyrights
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:27.600]   by ripping off the designs of diverse skin tone emojis in the decision district judge vince
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:34.720]   chibarria chibria riley said quote there are only so many ways to draw a thumbs up
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:43.360]   is the term nice try a legal term because it should appear in latin in this in this in this
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:48.880]   judgment yeah and also by the way only slightly diverse skin tones were adopted as part of the
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:55.840]   unicorn standard yeah so company has shown no evidence i'm still at diverse icons
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:41:03.760]   yeah i diverse the movie diverse icons assemble the case was this run out go ahead
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:07.360]   now it's going to say it was my second favorite sarcastic judge
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:11.120]   comment this week after the canadian judge trying to understand what the first amendment
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:16.400]   stuff was being yelled at about in canadian court okay you just imagine that movie like
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:23.360]   diverse icons from united colors a bit of time first they took away the headphone jack
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:29.760]   and i was not too perturbed because i am not a head phone jack for the headphone jack they came
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:38.480]   for the headphone jack then they came for the uh notch but now google following in apple's footsteps
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:47.200]   plans to curtail cross app tracking on android phones to talk about courage um there you go
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:53.680]   courage and that they they have the 63 percent of the worldwide browser market and they want to
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:59.680]   redefine what advertising on that market this is the same thing with apple it's like it's affects
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:04.000]   third parties apple's a first party in ios google's a first party on android and chrome right they're
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.840]   like the only they're like it just it hurts facebook which i'm actually i think everybody's gang
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:11.760]   up on facebook is what's going on to be honest well but facebook had so many opportunities
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:16.720]   like mr ksuckerberg he went out he hired mike mattis from apple he hired eric sang from android
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:21.840]   he gave them the steve jobs dent the universe walk around that awkwardly small garden and then
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:27.440]   they sat there and did nothing they made like chat heads it was like it's it was a worse squandering
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:31.520]   and he did that like three times he could have had a phone he could have had a browser he could
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:36.640]   have done like even amazon tried silk they just did nothing to own this until the metaverse and
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:41.440]   now they're like overcompensating yeah yeah and by the way google's not going to implement it for
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:46.240]   oh at least two years so you got some time facebook to come up with it well that that was that was a
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:51.840]   bit of a diffs dis slash dunk over apple where there's realized they haven't actually two times
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:57.280]   before they've proposed something specific and immediately got late leaped on by eff everybody
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:02.080]   saying this is terrible we're not gonna swap so yeah exactly so so this was this was them saying
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:06.400]   that we're going to take another we're we are still committed to not to getting rid of third party
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:11.440]   cookies here is what we're doing as we're planning it we're inviting lots of comments we have already
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:18.080]   brought a whole bunch of uk legislators on board to make sure that it conforms to it conforms to
[01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:23.680]   whatever uk laws are etc etc but the they did make they did that one little dunk saying what we've
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:30.000]   seen before how large companies have simply by fiat declared a change to advertising policies we
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.640]   are giving we're giving we instead want to invite the ad community and develop this along their side
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:40.160]   and we will not be doing anything until we have basically got given people enough notice to be
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:43.760]   able to change their business models or their software to educate this that's why they're saying
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:48.480]   not for the two or three years was it worse than that it was like oh yeah the shot only produced
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:52.960]   non-secure non-private really bad implementation we're not going to do that we're going to do
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:58.640]   good yeah we we don't this time no the first the second time yeah but the third time we're going
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:02.880]   to look at that rake and instead of stepping on it we're going to step around it we're going to see
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:09.200]   if that works they call it the privacy sandbox read read more about it privacy sandbox

[01:46:53.840 --> 01:47:00.640]   weekly time for our picks of the week let's start off with our special guest doc rock
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:12.160]   oh this is just in time for march eight we hope i hope this is this is the cal digit t s four right
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:17.520]   we're going from the t three plus to the t s four it's basically stands for thunder station four
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:25.600]   so this is a full thunderbolt for doc and everyone goes yeah doctor docs and even your doc and
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:31.040]   yeah whatever but what where this thing brings to the table which is quite amazing uh 18 ports
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:40.400]   yeah whatever um 98 watts laptop charging to me that's a big one yep and it will it will do 2.5 gbe
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:46.800]   so i know a lot of people haven't updated their networks yet um but i have 10 gbe network in my
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:52.960]   studio here and it's kind of nice to know that when you're doing the big file copies you know like
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:59.520]   messing around with like youtube videos and that but what cal digit just them and owc make the most
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:05.200]   stylish docs this one is really beautiful because you can use it standing up you can use it laying
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:11.360]   down um yeah so pretty incredible but the big one is especially if you bought a 16 and you have
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:18.240]   that beefy power supply being able to pull a full 98 watts of charging through it that's kind of
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:24.400]   the big i have the anchor which is thunderbolt three and i'm going to give that to lisa so that
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:32.560]   she can use her uh m1 laptop with her screens if apple does a mac mini this sure would be a nice
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:41.680]   side little side dock for it wouldn't it yeah exactly and so i have the older version next to my
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:47.200]   mini now but yeah i just really like the way that they're built um these little fans are they're
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:52.400]   great because they help dissipate the heat the only thing that makes it difficult is if you're like
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:58.160]   dust which i can't stand you have to vacuum it out because they're just asking to just collect
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:03.360]   dust but it does a really good job with heat management and cal digit just makes quality
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:08.080]   products was funny is you know we know them now for their consumer docs and that but us broadcast
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:13.680]   people they were the fastest hard drives you can get so probably somewhere in an old mac break
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:19.040]   weekly show my uh my seatmate lindsey paul it was like oh you should get these cal digit drives
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:25.360]   they're like four thousand dollars for like a megabyte because so they're not new i just want to
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:30.480]   point that out to people in the in the broadcast space that's what we normally use for really really
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:35.840]   high quality high fast drives i mean high speed drives back in the day for collecting video data so
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:41.440]   they're very well versed in making hardware and they just seem to make really incredible stuff
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:47.040]   since the only question is should i buy it now on the off chance that a mac mini comes out of
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:53.520]   marty well it's beneficial now for what you have for my laptop sure yes the thing that thunderbolt
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:58.080]   four brings to the table even if it's not your computer because you know the fight about why
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:03.120]   did apple label it thunderbolt four where they meant thunderbolt three slash usb four stop just
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:09.440]   go watch me nays channel anyway um you can daisy tame the ones that are actually labeled thunderbolt
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:15.040]   four so one advantage to it even if you have to use it with older kit is you can take this guy
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:20.160]   and you're still not enough ports right you can then add on the like oh i got one here
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:26.800]   cow digit or one of these other thunderbolt four dot uh hubs you can just stack these on
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:31.520]   you can add more if needed more ports than you might because there's no hdmi port on it if you
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:36.800]   can use display port it's fine but it doesn't create hdmi so you might have to add a little
[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:42.640]   something something if you want to i currently run a dot in two hubs no problem and because the
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:48.480]   four being daisy chainable but the disadvantage to my setup now is i have to put the hub in the front
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:52.400]   because that's daisy chainable and then the second hub and then the dot goes at the end
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:58.000]   see that's okay and it just doesn't seem sturdy for data right so yes i can't wait to swap this
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:03.200]   yeah look at all these ports this is really great yeah i have the previous version of this and i
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:08.240]   concur this is a really wonderful piece of kit the way it's built i've never had heat problems i've
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:14.640]   super convenient if you've got the this it's this box that made me able to swap out my kind of
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:21.920]   antiquated mac mini for a brand new m1 macbook pro because i just unplug it and unplug it like
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:25.760]   to one thing and i've got like this beautiful macbook plug it right back in i've got everything
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:30.800]   and it does it in such a way that it doesn't feel like a clue at all it's just really wonderful
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:34.320]   they don't put the design as an afterthought which is important because
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:39.760]   mac people we either show our stuff or we hide everything right some people got that desk where
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:44.800]   all you see is a monitor and a keyboard and there's other people like my desk i can't even see the
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:50.880]   wood anymore it's just covered with everything so you want it to at least look good right and i'm
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:54.720]   going for you know any of our studio people we're going for aesthetics as well so i just love the
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:59.600]   fact that cow digit doesn't treat it just like here's a box with a bunch of holders and enjoy
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:06.800]   yourself right they they do think about design is it available yes i ordered i'm holding it in my
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:15.840]   hand this is real oh good okay yeah so um go to cow digit direct or maybe b&h cow digit hasn't
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:22.960]   been put in stuff on amazon because they sell out so fast and also amazon is really fighting the
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:29.120]   counterfeiters during this time you know so um cow digit rode a bunch of other guys they're just
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:33.520]   like you know we're just selling on our own site for right now until we get enough where we can
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:38.000]   put it there and help fight the counterfeiters okay good and now so i'll buy it from the cow
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:44.000]   cow digit director b&h yeah how much b&h uh three forty nine i think it's not bad
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.480]   it's not bad all right yeah so i can use it with my m1 now
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:58.000]   my m1 pro now and then if oh it says that a stock dude you kill him so what i did i go to b&h
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:02.800]   he says i was stuck there too just do it anyway and then i swear he showed up three days later
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:07.760]   uh-huh love it yeah the cow digit t_s_4 doc
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:15.200]   Andy Enoco your pick of the week uh boy do i have a really great album to to recommend a happy birthday
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:20.800]   john Williams uh he birthed uh yeah the landmark birthday on the eighth and to celebrate that three
[01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:27.280]   days before that uh there is a new album john john Williams the berlin concert recorded in 2021
[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:33.200]   with the berlin philharmonic all of his like greatest movie hits from like i think the only one the
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:38.080]   only signature one that's missing is jaws and that's not really that interesting uh and not only is
[01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:44.320]   it just beautiful music recorded beautifully played beautifully but the recording is amazing and if
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:48.560]   you go to if you listen to our apple music yes of course it's high res yes of course it's lost let's
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:53.120]   yes of course it's Dolby atmos and again this is a you can get a lot of recordings of a lot of
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:58.720]   these things but this is it was done so beautifully that whether i mean whether i'm listening to it on
[01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:04.080]   the fancy like three hundred dollar headphones on the stereo like in the living room like on
[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:10.160]   my earpods stuff like that it is just not only just great music but you're just like you can't
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:15.120]   it's you can't be distracted by anything else by listening to it it's just such beautiful sound
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:19.200]   and again it's it's john Williams you can't you cannot go wrong you have so many memories
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:23.280]   like from harry potter movies close counter movies the raters movies of course you got
[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:26.320]   a close but the star trick excuse me i still get chills when i hear that
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:35.280]   the soundtrack to my childhood yeah no no i never thought much about this theme from Jurassic Park
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:40.960]   this one made me call that's a very and i'd forgotten how great the superman marches that is just if
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:45.040]   if the first if the opening to five minutes oh yeah i love it if the first five if the first five
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:50.960]   minutes of any superman movie were just superman being this wonderfully forced for good
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:57.120]   saving cats from trees and saving foundry nuclear subs and in a montage set to this five
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:01.840]   means minutes of music you get my eleven dollars it's just so beautiful sounds beautiful yeah
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:08.960]   planet krypton is such a great song too oh it's a great score too good nice the Berliner philharmonic
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:13.920]   car john Williams the Berlin concert and yes you can listen on apple music and a bunch of other
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:20.800]   places as well rene richie your pick of the week oh just just a quick aside if you haven't seen the
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:28.000]   new superman and lowest show on the wb just the first like 30 seconds of the very first episode
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:34.240]   is so filled with iconic superman like going back to the the seagull and schuster days of iconic
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:38.560]   superman moments that it'll give you exactly that kind of smile if you're looking for like
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:41.920]   doesn't have the john Williams score but it has everything else that you could need in a few
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:47.200]   superman moments um but my pick of the week is obscure three which is the latest version of
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:52.800]   obscure it's a it's a pro-camera app for for the iphone a lot of people will tell you that the
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:56.480]   iphone camera app has too many buttons and a lot of people will tell you that it has not enough
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:01.600]   pro features and you know apple has to decide between easy mode and god mode at some point
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:08.160]   but until they do the app store apps are picking up all that slack and obscure is just a really
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:13.840]   really good take uh it's it's by a designer um Ben he's he's phenomenal actually i'm getting
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:18.720]   his twitter name confused with his real name and i apologize for that um but like you just but
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:23.280]   you just basically you put your thumb down you move it out you get like haptic feedback the interface
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:28.160]   grows you can change the blur the focal point almost anything you want you can put it in video mode
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:33.920]   now i believe the video mode is what's new uh but also has depth mode and regular camera mode and
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:38.800]   it has all the controls that you want he's a terrific photographer he photographs all the
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:43.920]   old events and a lot of other conferences over the years so he knows exactly what you know what
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:49.360]   what real photographer is doing real real gigs need to work on and it's just so beautifully
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:56.720]   elegantly thoughtfully considerate to be uh put together that it's it's an absolute joy to use so
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:05.440]   if you have found yourself frustrated with the iphone camera and you have um and you have them
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:12.560]   um you know you've been looking for just another way of doing this it's and the other ones haven't
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:17.040]   suited you like for whatever reason any other camera apps haven't suited you give obscure a try
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:23.200]   it's just so to be clear unlike halide it's not new features it's just a user better user interface
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:28.960]   it does it does do all the depth stuff and it does the depth stuff in video as well so it's
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:35.520]   basically apple provides a bunch of apis that are far beyond um what they actually put in the
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:43.040]   camera app and developers uh developers like like halide and like obscure can take those apps
[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:47.440]   and just implement all those features for us all the manual controls that apples camera app
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:52.400]   doesn't implement and so you get this really fertile creative like for a while it was everyone
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:55.440]   made a twitter app that everyone made a weather app and now everyone's making not everyone but a
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:59.600]   lot of really really good designers are making camera apps and it's it's just brilliant thing
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:04.880]   and it's it's looks like it has its own library which is nice because uh it doesn't immediately go
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:10.960]   into photos or does it uh you you have to grant permission like any app it'll walk you through
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:15.040]   that as part of the onboarding procedure it'll say like grant access to it looks like it has kind
[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:19.840]   of annoying it's it says obscures oh it's an interface to the photos library is what yeah and you can
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:23.120]   go to every jediting built-in as well with some camera apps don't have but again it's very
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:27.840]   tasteful and thoughtfully in the workflow is very well thought out okay uh ten bucks
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:32.720]   i you know i saw it when it was announced and i thought do i i've got halide
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:38.960]   i've got the apple app do i need another camera app but it sounds like the ui alone this makes it uh
[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:46.400]   well binsman at this for a while well bimba karky um because that's right there was just obscure
[01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:51.360]   first yeah which i bought way back in the day of course yeah i'm about to just say something dope
[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:55.280]   because then there was obscure too and now this is obscure three it's the third
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:59:02.000]   it's one that time there was there was another one that he did that wasn't i mean it was still
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:07.120]   called obscure but it was obscure camera i think that's how we originally heard of it way back in
[01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:13.440]   the day and it was incredible so yeah it was like that in camera too which was a weird name for an
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:17.120]   app but those are the two best apps back in the day so it's kind of collegey
[01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:22.320]   you've been as they them so got that wrong early on i apologize all right obscure good catch
[01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:30.720]   tchua from ben thank you and uh ten bucks on the app store and that's rene's pick my pick is rene
[01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:38.160]   youtube.com/reneyrichy uh you can get breakthrough the m2 myth you can get uh
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:44.720]   find out all about apple health this is an amazing place to go uh for anybody who wants my favorite
[01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:49.440]   thing is rene's hot takes of like all of the trash that comes out because before that's always
[01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:57.600]   been like complaint now like the whole entire channels blew up just by hot takes smack yep so
[01:59:57.600 --> 02:00:04.240]   i love rene they take them down and his uh his his puns are not his puns what's the word i'm looking
[02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:08.080]   for his metaphors are pretty uh but like you could seriously make us really successful youtube
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:13.520]   channels all you did is go to slash r apple or slash r android and reflect back to them their hot
[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:18.400]   takes like just validate their hot takes you will have you will blow up on youtube in no time but
[02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:23.040]   that's that's not the world i want to live in so i'd rather do like i'd rather grow slowly and just
[02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:32.720]   give people good quality information yeah and eonako wg bh boston friday friday 1230 go to wgph news
[02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:38.640]   dot or to listen to it live or later awesome and uh anything else you want to plug like maybe a new
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:44.480]   website or soon again i'm trying to figure out how to just give people if he's if he's
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:49.280]   no no thank no thank you for your actually you're actually helping this move along because like
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:54.000]   i was i was not going to really talk about it and that left me that allowed me to basically take
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:58.480]   more time than i actually needed and so right now right now i right now i really am i'm in the mode
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:03.200]   where like this post-it notes about how if people want to give me money for the work i'm doing on
[02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:08.320]   this site how can i make it easy for them apart from putting money into a box and mailing it to me
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:13.120]   so that's the problem solving right now but there will there will be a gala a gala unveil sometime
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:17.440]   hopefully soon you mean you don't want us to put money in a box and mail it to you because if i
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:23.760]   would very much like that as well but again also again free free freelance journalist in the collapsing
