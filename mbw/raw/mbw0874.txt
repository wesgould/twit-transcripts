[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly Andy Anacos here.
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.000]   Alex Lindsey's here and most importantly Jason Snell's here back from his visit to the Apple
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.200]   campus. He has his first person hands on look at the Apple Vision Pro. We'll also talk
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.040]   about the other Macintosh computers Apple announced last week and the future of the
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:36.240]   iMac. All that and more coming up next.

[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.640]   Apple and Jason Snell's back from his little sojourn at the Apple campus.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.360]   Out where the sun shines and the fog does not eclipse the summer in the South Bay. It
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.720]   was so warm and nice and kupertino other than it rained at one point and everybody at Apple
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.440]   didn't know what to do basically. What do we do with this? There was a man with a squeegee
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.000]   trying to wipe things down. It was very consistent.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.880]   Did it rain during the event? No, it rained at that time the next day. When I was sitting
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.920]   waiting for my Apple Vision Pro hands on experience. Yeah, the sky just opened up and
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.680]   a man with a squeegee was trying to squeegee the entrance to the special lounge where we
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.040]   were all sitting. He was like, "This is a squeegee man." He was never going to win
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.800]   that battle. He's a human. Anyway, it was weird stuff. That's what he is. Andy Enoch
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.040]   was also like a squeegee. He's a squeegee, BH BOSF and parts elsewhere. Hello Andrew.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.600]   Hey there Heather. I know we're all excited to hear Jason's first hand reports of Vision
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.440]   Pro. I'm already excited to see that there are no longer any red marks around his face
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.480]   where it met him. So, any worries that like it causes an allergic reaction that would
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.920]   last at least a week? Absolutely dispelled today. We're on the board already. What a relief.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.560]   And Mr. Alex Lindsey, Office Hours.Global. Hello Alex. Hello. Hello. It's good to see
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.800]   you. It's good to be here. So Jason, you got to try them on. In fact, your six colors
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:38.160]   article, eyes and head on. Get it with the apple. I took it head on. They're in the
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.960]   forehead. I could never get it to fit exactly right. I came out of there feeling like I
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.760]   was really it didn't sit. Sit nice and get on your face. I mean, that that's happened
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.520]   with other VR headsets. I've tried and they've got they made the claim that they've got this
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.520]   one piece that fits the light shield that is like they're going to be a lot of sizes
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.440]   of them, but they didn't have that many sizes of them for whatever reason. I can never really
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.720]   get comfortable with it. Didn't they say they were going to scan your head and then? Oh,
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.200]   yeah, they did. It did. But like with if their plan is to have 15 sizes or 12 sizes at launch
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.320]   and they've only got four now, then they scan my face, which they did do very much like
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.560]   face ID. And then I guess they looked at it and said, wow, I don't know what to do here.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.160]   Just stick Bob stick the medium on. What happened? We got Jason Neanderthal Snell over here. You
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.200]   got any beetle brow or face masks? There's also something interesting that some social
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.400]   media pointed out that I missed in the keynote. Some of like the canned like fake living room
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.000]   videos, they had like a strap over the top of their head. Yeah, we all had that. You all
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.720]   had that. Absolutely. It was a velcro top strap to help with, you know, help with stable
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.960]   issues. The weight offs, carrying the weight across your whole head. And yeah, they did
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.480]   have that. And it was not all the materials. You'll be surprised. I don't know why. It's
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.320]   who knows. You'll be surprised to hear that the materials made in the headband and the
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.800]   strap are of the highest quality. They're very, very well made with the best because it's
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:11.760]   Apple. Of course, from the fine leather. Yes. Yeah. Oculus pro or whatever they call it,
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.760]   Metacwest pro has an optional top strap, and I actually don't use it, but I don't wear
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.360]   it for very long. So I think for like lengthy periods of time, you might want to have that
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.320]   top stuff. So that's not an option. That's something that comes with, I sounds like.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.480]   I think so. We don't know. It's hard to know. Yeah, there's so much we don't know about this
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.840]   product. We only know what Apple wants us to know about this product. And even barely that.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.480]   I am. I am. I have a new bet that they will not ship it with spooky eyes, but I'm just that's
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:46.000]   my guess. That is that is not of that's that is not a bad guess. I don't I don't know for sure.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.960]   I'm just saying that that's they got a lot of gambling. They got a lot riding on that. It's got
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:58.320]   either work completely 100% non goofy or let's just wait before. Yeah. And that must add a little
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:05.520]   bit to those lenticular screens must add a bit to the bill of materials and I'm sure it does. I
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.200]   mean, it's very clever. And they've said like, you know, you can't just put a screen on it showing
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.800]   eyes because if you're off axis, it looks redate. It looks like a screen showing eyes like they're
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.640]   following you or something. It's weird. So they did this lenticular thing. But I will say again,
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.800]   nobody has seen that feature, right? It's in some of those videos. I'm all clear whether they
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:33.440]   actually are even there. You don't see in your demo. Nobody saw it in person. The closest we got
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.400]   is that in the demo, we did get a FaceTime call from somebody who was using a digital persona
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.240]   presumably the same technology that creates the digital persona face creates the little eye
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:51.280]   area that gets put on that display. Those eyes aren't a picture of your eyes. They're a digital
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.280]   persona of your eyes. Yeah, they're skit. Well, I mean, they're taking picture of your
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:02.160]   expressions from your eyes and using it to do it. But it's not a one to one in a remote fashion.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.040]   Yeah. And they high think of a very, very high res mimoji, although I'll say like,
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.200]   I had a very positive experience with the headset. I think that as a piece of technology,
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.600]   the Vision Pro is remarkable. And that's the combination, the Apple combination,
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.240]   the hardware and the software, incredibly impressive piece of technology. However,
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.640]   we can talk about it or not, whatever you like. But I will say the one place where I went,
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:32.320]   whoa, now was the digital persona, which during the keynote, I read it. I was more optimistic
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.760]   on some of the people around me. I was sort of like, it might be okay. And other people were like,
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:41.840]   oh, hell no, basically. And then I saw it in the demo. And I was like, oh, no, no, no, no, it is,
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.440]   it is the uncanniest of valleys. It is, you know, the person I was talking to made a facial expression,
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:53.680]   I was like, no, no, you're, you know, no, it's interesting. They made an interesting choice with
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:08:01.440]   FaceTime that FaceTime would not be a legless immersive experience in the as in the meta experience.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.760]   It would be a FaceTime with a screen, but then they still have this issue with there's no camera
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.480]   on you. So they have to fake you and the fake you, it sounds like is not very good. I'm going to
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:19.840]   say this, this really strikes me as a concept car. You know how in trade auto show, they show
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:26.000]   this car that you go, that's wonderful. But it never ships. And I think this is their concept car.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.320]   And you now explain to me why we never saw anybody. Tim Cook on down wearing these.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.680]   No, because that's that feature doesn't even spooky eyes weren't there. I wonder if it doesn't work yet.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.720]   Yeah. I don't, I mean, you're right. I think you're right. I think the question is, you know,
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.760]   how committed are they to this hardware being final? They may be across that line, but, but
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:54.320]   you're right in spirit, because a lot of the stuff that's in here is very much beholden to Apple's
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.800]   concept of what this thing is. Right. So the eyes are there. The eyesight thing is there,
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.560]   because Apple is trying to send the message that they want you present in the world that this is
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:09.920]   an AR product and that if you can see out, people can see in right and that it's an indicator that
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:15.840]   they can see you. And like I get it, I get it entirely from a philosophical point of view.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.120]   But I have with some of these features, I wonder the FaceTime is like this too. I wonder whether
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:27.600]   at some point the initial philosophy will get overridden by user reaction and they'll realize,
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:33.680]   oh, like the dogma we went into when we designed this product is actually not how users feel.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.160]   And then they change the product. It may be too late for this one, but that's undoubtedly going
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.600]   to happen. I think the FaceTime in a window is a great example of that where I'm actually not
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.120]   convinced that that's the only way they're going to do FaceTime. I'm convinced that's the only way
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.760]   they wanted to show FaceTime last week, right? Because we're talking about a lot of time here.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.880]   There are so many things that I'm sure that they have very carefully omitted entirely,
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.200]   because either they're not ready to show them or they don't want people talking about them
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:05.440]   when they're talking about this product. And this is unusual for Apple in that they've got
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:12.080]   six plus months of runway here so that they can be very picky in what they disclose now versus in
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:17.600]   six months. I think the least compelling thing that they showed there and the most absurd.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.600]   Like it's not like I think there's a lot of things about the vision headset that work.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.360]   The moment I even saw it on the keynote, I was like, oh, it's going to be a bad idea.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.640]   Like that was going to really, it was like Polar Express, you know, and, you know,
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.680]   is about the Polar Express level. And I think that they just, it's so hard to do. I thought,
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.080]   I really thought that they were going to use Memojis. Like I thought that Memojis was the answer to
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.080]   that. That's why they had us all building them. That's why they got it. And I bet you that there's
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:48.320]   going to be an option to be sure. And everyone's just going to go to, I'm just going to use my
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.920]   emoji and we're all going to be fine. Because everything about Memoji works in that.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.520]   Just too proud of this. And so they don't want you to think about Memoji because that's like the
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.360]   fallback. They're so proud of this thing. And I think either it's going to have to get a lot better
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.080]   or they're going to have to just say, well, yeah, if you find this, I'm Kenny, you can just use
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:09.840]   your Memoji, which is, you know, because all the Memoji is also reading your face and generating a
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.320]   facial expression based on it. It's just much less of an attempt for it to be real.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.560]   By lowering that resolution and making it not look exactly like you, you've bought your mind
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.080]   immediately. It's why in writing, why you watch a Pixar, as soon as you get to the point where you're
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:27.200]   real, the only the only folks that have the only person that has figured this out, in my opinion,
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.480]   is James Cameron and maybe Weta, you know, in the world with millions and millions and hundreds of
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.640]   millions of dollars, they figured out how to get that to work. And not in real time.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:43.840]   Right. And not in real time. It's not the famous Scott McLeod understanding comics,
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:50.000]   like transition, whereas like there's a point there's a point between absolutely abstract smiley
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.560]   face and absolutely photographically real where you're getting the best of both worlds, where it's
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.920]   a cartoon version of somebody with just enough details, you absolutely emotionally connect to it,
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:06.880]   not so much that it has to be now spot on. And I think that's I got the I mean, I got the impression
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:14.480]   from that from everybody's hands on experience that maybe Apple's real goal this with that release
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:22.240]   with with that demo with that with that thing was to make sure that the information comes back.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:29.680]   These displays are incredible. I can read text at any size, any distance, the 3D effect is impeccable
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:36.160]   and not and also not quite so many people come back saying after half hour, I got nauseous or
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.000]   I got headaches because just just like with the Apple watch so long as they get the hardware
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.080]   right, they can they can build the software, they can fix the software, they can hold back
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.120]   software features until they're ready. But the thing that will cause this to be an absolute utter
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.000]   first day failure is if people put it on and say my God, this isn't nearly half as good as my
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.960]   $500 quest. This isn't nearly I'm not going to put this on for more. I can see I'm just having
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:04.800]   this for games, but the Apple thinks I'm going to use this as my 4k Mac monitor and use this like
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.120]   all afternoon, no way. Yeah, they want to dazzle you with their tech prowess, right? That's number
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.040]   one thing they're trying to do here is have everybody go, wow, look at Apple, they were capable of
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.840]   making this product, which by the way, I admit to be dazzled, right? Like I think this is an
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.600]   incredibly impressive product. Let's separate their two stories here, right? There's will it sell
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.080]   and do people want it and there's what is this product and this product is amazing. It is an
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.800]   amazing work of technology and also of user interface. The software in it is incredible,
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:36.320]   but like what we got last week was one, Apple showing you their tech skills and doing this
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.640]   thing. And then all of us who tried it could see that it's got it's incredibly the refresh rate
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:45.120]   is amazing. It looks not like reality, but like very close to reality when you're using
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.360]   pass through mode, all that stuff is impressive. And then the other thing they were trying to do is
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.800]   I think blunt criticism of the story that would be Apple wants to cut you off from the world.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.280]   So everything Apple did was like, no, no, we are being humane here. The word I keep coming back
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:04.560]   to is humane. It's like the headband is soft woven material. We can see your eyes when you can see us
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:11.840]   everything is a default to AR, not VR, everything defaults to you seeing everything around you.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.640]   They have that ridiculous shot in the promo video where somebody is packing their suitcase while
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:22.720]   wearing the headset, which is just like it's bananas. But I know why it's there. It's there
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.440]   because they want to say, look, you're in the world with this thing. And I think that literally
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:32.080]   was their number two goal with this product is to stop people from saying, Apple wants you to put
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.240]   a thing on your face where you never see anybody ever again, because they don't want to be seen
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.120]   as being kind of a detriment to society. And I think that that was what they were going for.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.520]   I think I think the part of it was just like, Oh, these, oh my God, they're so comfortable in
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.360]   light. Wait, I forgot I had them on. Yeah, exactly. You know, they say,
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.720]   they integrate into my lifestyle completely. Yeah, they say a camel is horse designed by
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:02.320]   committee. I think Apple has created a camel here where a lot of different inputs created,
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:08.240]   or somebody else called it, the Homer Simpson's car. They created this thing and they wanted to
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:16.880]   say, I want to show sweater. I want to show and I mean, it's a tough category when you're already
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:22.000]   before you even release the product saying, no, no, it's not like, it's not like what you think.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:28.640]   It's a really tough category. Yeah. I wonder if, so let's do some specifics.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:35.040]   You were in glasses. Did they did? Did you get the Zeiss lenses put in and all that?
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:40.800]   They basically had a lens crafters on site. I mean, they had a guy who took my glasses and scanned
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:47.440]   them. And so they knew my prescription and they then presumably had a bank of the magnetic snap-in
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.520]   adjusters that they found the ones that most closely matched it. And there was a, I mean,
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.600]   the way it worked is you walk in, they scan your face, they scan your glasses, and then you
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:01.840]   sit in something that's very much like an airline with an iPhone. Actually, and this is going to be
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.200]   the way they're going to do it when you buy this thing is that it's going to be integrated with
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.120]   the Apple Store app and they will actually, they scan it like Face ID. You know, you turn your
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.280]   face around. So you'll have to get your fitted in an Apple store to get this? Well, you could do
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.640]   it in the Apple Store app. If you don't want to go visit, they said they anticipate most people
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.480]   will want to actually try this before they buy it. Go figure. But if you just wanted to buy it site
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:27.040]   unseen, you would scan with the Apple Store app on your iPhone at home and it would send that data
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.440]   or it would send what your size choice was. And that's for that light shield, I think,
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.680]   more than anything. And you would send them your prescription?
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:39.360]   Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think not them. If it's anything like what Meta does, I think I used,
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:45.200]   I mean, I literally used an online glasses retailer. So I sent them my prescription and they sent me
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:50.960]   the adjusters for my Quest 2. So I imagine it would be like that. The people buy this will have to be
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:57.040]   extremely motivated to wear it. Yeah. I mean, if you need a glasses adjustment,
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.200]   you'll have to order that. And then, yeah, you have to do this. I mean, the sizing thing is
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.360]   probably not a big deal. Apple said they figure about half of the addressable market is people
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:10.880]   who wear glasses. So if you're in that half, like I am, then I mean, all I did was literally
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:18.000]   forward the PDF of my prescription to whatever eyeglasses discount, whatever the one is that
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.920]   Meta uses as their partner. I actually do the same. I can put the Quest Pro on over my glasses.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.800]   And I actually do that, which I know is stupid, but I did. It just slowly destroyed my glasses.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:33.440]   Yeah, it's not a good idea. And so and that's actually the primary reason I stopped using it.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.960]   Yeah, because I'm not committed enough to buy lenses for my Meta Quest Pro.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.600]   So when the fact that it didn't have it, you know, and I think that Apple, I mean, I'm curious
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:47.040]   about this. So with Jason, it's a magnetic and just the lenses snap in, snap out.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.880]   That's what they say. But again, the way this worked was they measured me that I sat in the
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:56.160]   airport lounge, while behind the scenes, elves with an assembly line or putting them all together
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.240]   for the rooms. Because it's remember, it's like an individual demo. So there were just a bunch of
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.680]   rooms and a door, you're led to a door and there are there's a PR person and a product marketer inside
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.440]   and the headset. So it was already set up for me by the time I was.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:14.480]   Sounds like seperate. This is Apple. It was, I don't know, I mean, I guess a little bit,
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.880]   like I said, I think it was more like a like an airport lounge and then you led into a kind of
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:24.480]   fake living room and it was very homey for a temporary structure built on the soccer field at
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.440]   Apple Park. It was very homey. How many demos do you think they gave? It really seemed like they
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.880]   were it wasn't like the I have an omelet station. That's what I want to know. It seems like they're
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:40.320]   got as many people in a hundred. It looks like very light snacks. I would say that that venue
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:47.040]   could probably do it was a half hour actually in the room. There's probably a reset, but let's
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:56.400]   ballpark it and say that maybe it was 25 and a 25 an hour. And they did it for a several,
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.920]   you know, at least two days, but still that there's a limit there. That's that's whatever that is.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:07.520]   That's a few hundred. That's four or five hundred people that at most. And maybe they had some other
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:14.480]   stations elsewhere for developers that were not part of the PR queue that I went through, but like
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:20.080]   it's a very small number because this was a super, I mean, literally every single person had a PR
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:25.440]   handler and a product marketing person from Vision Pro. It was a two to one ratio college
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:31.200]   students know that's pretty good if you've got two instructors and one student. It was pretty wild.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.640]   Yeah. So they're playing a man. They should have had a several zone defense.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.120]   They should have had a severance egg bar though. They really missed a bet.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.080]   It would have been good. I don't know. I don't I don't think they really
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:45.200]   covered it. Getting loaded up on grease and protein just before trying on the new VR headset.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:52.320]   You got to do the cross promos. They really do. So you liked wearing it. You as you point out in
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:58.480]   your article, you have experience with the PlayStation VR and the Metacuest 2. So you know,
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:05.200]   you're no newbie to this experience. Was it? I see the Quest Pro, but but I've seen those other
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:10.960]   two. I feel like the Quest Pro is just like a little bit higher res quest. Yeah. So yeah,
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.680]   I think it's really good. I mean, I think that the the imagery is really great. The three effects
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:20.160]   were good. What stands out? What is the difference between this, I guess, and the quest?
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.520]   I'll tell you. Well, I mean, the philosophical difference that it's it drops you into AR. It
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.480]   drops you into the world that you're already in where you're seeing your surroundings.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.320]   And that's pretty high quality because that's one thing with the Quest Pro. It's not it's still
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:37.840]   an outline. No, it's it's so the real world instead of being in what Metadrops you in a virtual world,
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.000]   right? Apple drops you in the real world. It is extremely high quality. I've seen some people
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.280]   say it's like reality. It's like, well, no, it's a lot soft. I mean, 4k is great, but it's not reality.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:52.000]   It's the highest resolution of all. No, the Quest Pro has a pass through mode, but it's not it's
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.200]   not at all realistic. It's just now apples apples is very, very good. And then that and so they
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.880]   want your by default, your experiences are going to be in that augmented space. And then there's the
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.680]   little dial, little digital ground that you can turn to to shut yourself off from the world,
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:13.520]   essentially. But that that is yeah, I mean, the 3D was good. The pass through mode was very
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:18.160]   impressive. The immersive stuff like the sports. I know Alex and I have been talking a lot about
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:24.400]   immersive sports on this thing like that slam dunk and that that it's a fielding error at Fenway Park.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:30.320]   The word just spec I wanted to reach out and pick up that baseball, but it was in play so I would
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:35.680]   have gotten in trouble. It just really remarkable. But I'll tell you, the thing that impressed me maybe
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:43.360]   the most is the UI on it that they it feels like Apple's best UI people spent five years on this
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.760]   because it felt like a natural extension of a lot of things we've learned from iOS and iPadOS.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.880]   That the gestures seem very natural. The fact that their eye tracking is so good that they are
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.640]   well, you know, we think about the size of touch targets on an iPad or an iPhone because they got
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:02.800]   to be the size of your dumb, meaty finger, right? Well, turns out our vision is way more precise
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.320]   than that and they're doing eye tracking and machine learning stuff to get it to be
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:12.720]   they know where you're looking. And it's really uncanny once you get it, you look at the close box
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.560]   and you know, tap your fingers together and it's closed. That's it. You look at the move,
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:21.200]   a little move handle on the bottom of the window and you pick up a window and you just move it
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:26.240]   somewhere and let it go. And it all happens. It doesn't have it doesn't have lag. Like they built
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:30.800]   a really nice computer user interface. One of the reasons why I think they want to call this a
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:36.800]   spatial computer is that they built a good computer UI for it that uses your gestures and your vision.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:42.960]   So there's no so the way it works with the Quest Pro is you have to kind of point at and there's a
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:47.600]   little dot and point at an icon and you press and hold and it looks. So you're saying, you know,
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.920]   the icons fairly small, you're actually can actually really tell that you're looking at that,
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.200]   not the one that's doing it. I mean, the app icons, the app icons aren't small, but the
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.280]   close box is quite small. It's a little circle and when you look at it, it turns into an X.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.480]   It absolutely works. There's no laser beam coming out of your pointer or anything like that.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:11.440]   You literally like, I didn't do this, but a friend of mine, Mike Hurley, he took an image off of a
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.600]   webpage and literally grabbed it and dragged it into another app and it just worked. You know,
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.880]   he grabbed it and it does start to feel tactile. Like I'm literally moving this picture from place
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.840]   to place. So as a computer UI and the eye tracking stuff in it, it's very, very good. They did a
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.840]   great job. Well, you did this. There's no expense. You did this sitting down, right? You did.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:34.240]   There was no mostly mostly. So you were able to stand up. There was a stand up component. So at
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:39.120]   the end, they do this dinosaur thing where basically they draw a portal into the wall at the far
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:42.880]   end of the room. So since it's augmented reality, they're able to basically layer
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:49.200]   their 3D content onto a physical object. So it looks like a dinosaur is looking through a window
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:53.360]   in the room. And at that point, they said, why don't you get up and interact with a dinosaur?
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.720]   And so I walked over and the frame. Honestly, the frame rates were good. I walked too far,
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:03.440]   so I walked into the dinosaur and then it was like, they're like, you're going to step back,
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.800]   get out of the way of the dinosaur. What happened when you walked into it?
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:13.840]   It got, I think it kind of grayed out. It was like, it was like, yeah, it was basically saying you
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:21.440]   have, you're occluding the object, basically. I'll take that one. I was too energetic.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.960]   No, no, but these are not the wall. Look, this is the thing that's most valuable is you have a
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.840]   subjective experience of this. So that's what I'm interested in. What was your subjective experience
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.480]   with it? And what I would say is that I think that the, the latency, like it was, I don't think
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.200]   people are going to, I mean, somebody will, but I don't think people are going to get
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:42.800]   car sick with this thing because the latency, the field of view was all very good. In fact,
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.960]   there was only one time in the entire demo where I could actually see the system struggling.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.480]   And at the beginning of that dinosaur encounter, they had, there's a butterfly that flies into the
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:55.760]   room, into the room, right? And they say, put your hand out and it's supposed to land on your hand.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:00.240]   And it did land on my hand. And then I moved my hand like, you know, back and forth a little bit.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:05.760]   And the butterfly lagged. The butterfly was a little bit behind. But it struck me that that
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:12.160]   was the first time I'd had the illusion broken in the entire half hour. So, you know, again,
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:16.000]   they put a lot of, there's a lot of money in this thing. There's a lot of hardware in this thing.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.080]   And that's why I think that it's worth having those two conversations about like, will people
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:24.720]   buy it versus like, what is it as a tech accomplishment? Because they spent so much time in money and
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:29.520]   through so many resources at that. And I'll tell you that eye tracking, that moment where I realized
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:35.280]   that I need to stop looking for the cursor because my looking was the cursor. That was when I went,
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:41.680]   Oh, oh, I see. And then the gestures are all I only like, you bring two fingers together to tap,
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.920]   you bring two fingers together and move it left or right to swipe, you move them up and down to
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:53.920]   scroll like it's all basically iOS gestures really familiar. So yeah, as a as a 3D computer,
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.160]   they really built a it's a remarkable user interface. I think they did a great job.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:02.640]   I really wanted to ask you though, about Mike's experience about drag and drop,
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.800]   like was the dragging part of it done with his eyes or with a gesture? No,
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:11.200]   with the dragging is with a gesture. In fact, my favorite, like, my favorite thing was moving
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:15.760]   a window. I still that's the one that I keep thinking of a week later is moving a window where
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.320]   I look down at the at the move, the move line. It's like the little indicator at the bottom of an
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:25.120]   iPhone. And I looked at it and I grabbed it with just by putting my two fingers together,
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.280]   at which point I could just move it wherever I wanted with my hand, but you use your hand.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.920]   And then and then I actually like moved it to the right and then I pushed it back a little bit
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.680]   further because I wanted to deeper into the room. And then you just let go and it stays there.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.320]   It's like you moved it physically. So you know, there are accessibility stories here.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.240]   There is a vision only mode you can use if all you have is the ability to point your eyes because
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:51.760]   you've got motor issues. There is a version of that there's they they never showed Siri,
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.920]   but I have no doubt that you'll be able to use voice commands on this. They just didn't want
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:01.680]   to talk about Siri. I wonder why they mentioned that you could look at a text field and say a
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:07.040]   search, but they didn't ever showed you that. Yeah, I never I never did that. And there's also a
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:12.000]   keyboard and the kind of you can you can interact. You can stick your hand on something and interact
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.200]   with it. You could probably stick it on Safari and like, like scroll it if you wanted to. It's
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.600]   it's just that I don't know if you'd want to for most things because the way I try to describe it is
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.520]   if we think about direct interaction with the iPhone where you're putting your finger on the
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:30.080]   software, essentially, and it's this we don't need a cursor anymore. We've got direct interaction.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:34.400]   This is like direct interaction at a distance. It's almost like you've got magic where you can
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.880]   just be like, Oh, yeah, scroll that. And you just move your hand and it scrolls it. You don't need
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.200]   to reach out and scroll it. You can just sort of like do it in your lap. And and once you get used
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.480]   to the fact that you can just leave your hands down on your lap and you can still make all the
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:51.280]   gestures because it's it knows it's looking down there and it knows when you're making the gestures.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.560]   That's all very effective. I mean, yeah, it's they they threw a lot into this.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.800]   That's that's another thing that I think is going to be really interesting to find out about like
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:04.560]   the idea of having a completely virtual keyboard. Like, are they literally going to say here is a
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.480]   completely fake when we projected on the surface? But the and the other thing is that like, I'm
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:12.240]   sure that anybody who is actually going to want to be doing like real typing productivity is going
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.320]   to want to have like, you know, a stock keyboard, but when it wouldn't be wouldn't it be great if
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:20.960]   like Apple like you looked at it. Oh, oh, I know exactly what that is. I'm going to give you a virtual
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.880]   one of your you feel it even though it's not really there. Your vision.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:29.680]   It may not even be so. I think you're right. They actually said, especially in the context of using
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:34.640]   a Mac that you could just use a keyboard and a trackpad and on the screen of the Mac and it will
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.800]   work perfectly normally. And I think that that's that's what they'll do. I know meta does this.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:45.120]   I believe with the Quest Pro, this idea that it has object detection. So I believe with the Quest
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:50.800]   Pro and correct me if I'm wrong, Leo, but it detects when you've got a keyboard and it actually
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:56.080]   like does a breakthrough. So you can see the keyboard in reality. I have never tried that because the
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.800]   notion of productivity in those things. I know right. I have weird friends who have tried these
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:06.480]   things and have me in the in the Quest Pro. Yeah, I apologize. I should have. Yeah. That tech is
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:10.320]   because they are already doing the person breakthrough where if you're in a completely immersive setting
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:15.120]   and somebody is looking at you and sort of leaning in, they appear sort of appear through the mist
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:20.640]   so that you so that you can see them, which I think is admirable. The idea that if somebody wants to
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:25.040]   talk to you while you're using this thing, the system will show them to you and say,
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:29.280]   hey, Bob is over there. That's great. But I think they could absolutely do that. And I would be
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:34.480]   surprised if they don't that if you're in an immersive environment, it would show you the keyboard.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:39.360]   But I would also say there are probably layers of immersion where, you know, first off, maybe
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:43.280]   you're not in an immersive environment at all. You're in your regular room and you're seeing your
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.440]   keyboard or maybe you're seeing sort of an immersive environment in front of you, but not all the way
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.600]   around. And when you look down, you see your keyboard. But I would, I think that Apple will
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:57.200]   absolutely do that sort of thing. So if you want to use a physical input device instead of reaching
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:02.320]   out and tapping on the virtual keys, which I am very skeptical of, I think that you'll be able to do
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:08.480]   that. So it does the more you talk about it and the more I read, the more I think that this is Apple,
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:15.280]   this is a concept car. This is Apple trying a lot of things. Yeah. And seeing what the reaction is.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.640]   Seeing what sticks. Yeah. Seeing what sticks. Seeing what people like. Even if they ship this
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:23.360]   concept car, I do feel like they're going to learn a lot about it. I think they plan to ship it.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:30.240]   Maybe not exactly as is, but they plan to ship it and they're watching carefully. It sounds to me
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:37.600]   like the piece they really got right is spatial computing. Yeah, you are there UI stuff.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.720]   That's the stuff I came away most impressed with is this idea. And that's why, again, we were
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:47.040]   listing the reasons the ways they wanted us, the takeaways they wanted from last week, right?
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.680]   They wanted the takeaway to be the tech is impressive. They're humane. And I think, I think the other
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:57.600]   one to takeaways was this is a computer, judge it as a computer, which is weird and interesting,
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:02.240]   but like I get it having used it. I get it that they're like, that's a place they're comfortable.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:06.320]   And the idea that they're trying to sell at least somewhat a productivity story to say,
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.560]   this basically it runs iPhone apps, it runs iPad apps. If you look at your Mac,
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:16.160]   it pops up a 4K virtual window of your Mac and you can control it. And like, and they're good.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:20.320]   They're good at computer interfaces, right? In a way, it's the metaphor that they understand
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.480]   the most. So of course, they're leaning on it. And I thought the comms are good. All I can say
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:29.680]   is that one of the things was interesting, I spent a lot of the weekend watching WWZ sessions
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:34.560]   to kind of get my head around that, by the way, so much nicer to watch pre-recorded
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:39.680]   WWZ sessions than the ones on stage. I mean, the audio is better, the presentation's better.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:44.320]   I just, you can move through it at speed. And so, so anyway, so I think that
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:49.200]   a lot of the vision ones are really good. The interesting thing that I found was,
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:54.720]   and number one is their concepts of the space. So you have, you have windows,
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.280]   you have volumes, you have spaces, like, and so they kind of define those for you. Okay,
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.840]   you know, a bunch of windows, this is how they work, then they have these volumes that are,
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:07.440]   that are the objects that you're going to be using or things that you can move around. And then
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:12.640]   the space is the thing you're inside of. And it's just a really nice way to, and a lot of things all
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:18.560]   feed around those three concepts. But the end, and it's just what it showed was really,
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:25.040]   we think of it that way, but I've never seen anybody describe it with such clarity, you know,
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.880]   like, like, for developers, like understanding, this is how you're going to do these things.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.600]   The other thing is, is that the fit, it's not just the fit and finish that they put on the
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:39.440]   end interface. It's the fit and finish of the developer tools. I mean, the developer tools are
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:46.240]   very well developed. And I mean, down to, I mean, so I used to develop, help develop a
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:51.840]   nodal compositor. And I worked on lots and lots of nodal systems. A nodal compositing, of course,
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.440]   is, you know, or nodal systems are, you know, you have boxes and you tie them together with little
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:02.240]   noodles and you build things out. Well, reality composer pro uses a nodal compositing system or
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:07.840]   no nodal system to drive it. It is the nicest nodal system I've ever seen. And I know that seems
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:13.600]   like a really odd thing. But to go down to the developer tool and make it the most functional
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:19.200]   version of that concept that I've ever seen was kind of amazing to look at. And it was just,
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:24.000]   and so there are so many things about it. And the way that compo, you know, reality composer pro
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.920]   works, the way that they're thinking about video, like video is so many of these things are not
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:34.240]   big steps for the developers. If you're already an iOS developer, there's so much of this. And
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:40.960]   this is what's missing. I mean, I've developed apps for Oculus. It's not that way. Like, it's not,
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.920]   like, you know, it is, it is like, it's like building a, it's like building a cabin in the forest
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:50.080]   being attacked by bears, you know, and so, so the, you know, like, and so the thing is, is that,
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:54.880]   is that you're constantly trying to figure this stuff out. And so, and there's no native platform
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.240]   like this that's built for the developers to put those things together, which I thought,
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.920]   you know, they've really done that, that exceptionally well. The video stuff is just,
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:07.440]   it's just HLS. And oh, right. We built a whole new format. That's the one little glitch that we
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:14.400]   have right now is the MV HEBC is their new video format. I, we were wrong last week, by the way,
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:20.400]   or I was wrong. It's not 83 frames a second. It's 90 frames a second. And it is 96 frames a second
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.160]   for film. And the reason they do that, of course, is so that they can equally show
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:28.480]   all the frames and they're not doing some kind of weird round up. It's easy multiple of 24. Yeah,
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:33.440]   four times. And so, so the, so anyway, so the, I got an F and math. Thank you, Al.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:42.560]   Yeah. So, so the, so great frame rates. And then, but also the funny thing about it for us that
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.760]   are doing live, I think we're, we don't know a bunch of us are talking about like, how do we
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:50.240]   do 90 frames a second? Like there's no systems that do that, you know, and so it'll probably be 60
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:55.280]   for a little while. But anyway, but the point is, is that all these platforms, as I watched it,
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.200]   what I can see is that they didn't, they don't make you learn something completely new. If you're
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.600]   an already an Apple developer, they're just adding on little bits and pieces. And then they're doing
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:10.560]   those add-ons in a very, very clear way. So, so anyway, that did you watch the track on Unity?
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.520]   How, because one of the things they said is, well, if you're not going to use our tools,
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.600]   you're going to have to use Unity. Yeah, I think that, I mean, I think that,
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:27.520]   I mean, you can use, I mean, I think that the misguided attack that Epic fired off has now,
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:33.440]   has now fired, you know, has now shown itself, which is none of us knew whether they were going to
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.360]   skip on building their own stuff or whether we're going to Unity Unity's a solid platform. Is it as
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:44.000]   good as Unreal? I don't think so. Not right now, but it now has a huge shot in the arm from Apple
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.840]   that it didn't have a week ago. And so, it's not so much that Unity is going to take over
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:54.080]   Unreal or Epic's in any kind of trouble whatsoever. They've got a great platform. A lot of people
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:36:02.080]   are using it. It's just that it emboldens their chief competitor a lot and will flow a lot of
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:06.480]   money into what they're doing. And so, it's just, it's not, it's not, and, you know, it's not a huge
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.840]   mistake, but it's going to cost Epic billions as this goes forward. So, by the way, speaking of
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.280]   things Apple didn't talk about last week, that they don't want us talking about in context with
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:19.200]   this product for the next six months, games is actually one of them. The only game context they
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:25.440]   talked about in the keynote was, you could play like an iPad game with a controller in a virtual,
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.800]   like what? But, but clearly there are, so there's the shared space that multiple apps can run in.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:36.560]   There's the equivalent of full screen mode, which is you can apps can be all alone in an AR space,
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:41.440]   and then there's immersive. And of course, you can play fully immersive games in this thing.
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:45.440]   There is a question about whether the hand tracking that Apple's doing is going to be so
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:49.360]   precise or whether you're going to have to buy an ad on controller for certain kinds of games.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.520]   I'm sure it's, you beat Saber, it's probably going to be able to do it or something like that.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.440]   But like, it's absolutely going to do that. You can see it in the sessions that it's going to be
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:01.840]   able to do that. It's just not what Apple wanted to emphasize. I think that's kind of interesting
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:06.880]   that every other VR system has been talked about in the context of immersive gaming. And Apple's like,
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:12.080]   like privately, they're like, yeah, it does that. But we're not talking about it right now. It's
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:16.080]   fascinating. I want to get more of your subjective points of view, especially about the field
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:20.160]   division, things like that field of view. We're going to take a little break. Jason Snell
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:26.800]   has tried it on. And we're talking about Vision Pro last week, Jason, just FYI. We debated whether
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:31.360]   anybody buy this. And so we're not going to talk about that. We did that. Yeah. And I think
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:36.800]   the jury's out on that point, right? I don't know. We don't know. Or even what this is,
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:43.520]   because I think there's a lot of things that could change in the next six to eight months. But
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:49.520]   we'd at least know what they showed. And the other thing, and I had said this before the event,
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:53.600]   was we want to listen very carefully to how Apple positions it. So I want to go more into that.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:58.080]   You started that conversation. I think that's really interesting. Our show today brought to you
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:05.760]   by Express VPN. Have you ever, would you ever forget to mute yourself on Zoom? And then,
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:12.480]   I don't know, say or do something, your coworkers probably don't want to hear. Yeah,
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:18.800]   you probably have using the internet without Express VPNs like that. You're out in the world,
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:24.640]   and you forgot to mute. Yeah, sure, it's just a bit of harmless banter. But when the boss over
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:32.160]   hears, well, it could end badly. People need a VPN to it for several reasons. But big one is to
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:38.560]   protect your privacy, internet service providers, your carrier, your home ISP, they know exactly what
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:44.480]   you're doing every website, your visit. And they can sell completely legally that information to the
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:51.840]   data brokers to add companies who then use your data to target you. It's happening all the time.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:39:00.240]   It happens on your TV set. We were talking over the weekend about what TV streamer to use. And the
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:04.480]   truth is that data that you're, you know, what shows you're watching for how long and when. And
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:08.400]   in many TV sets, because they have cameras, whether you're actually in the room, all of that gets
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:14.800]   sent back to the home office unless you're using Express VPN, Express VPN routes your network
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:19.840]   traffic through a secure encrypted tunnel. When you do emerge, you emerge with an IP address that's
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:27.120]   associated with Express VPN, not you. So no one knows what you're up to. Of course, it protects
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:31.520]   your security when you're at open Wi-Fi access points. They can't use that Wi-Fi pineapple to
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:38.480]   attack you. It also lets you have, you know, you choose your geographic location, because you appear
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:43.280]   on the internet, wherever that Express VPN server is. And because they have servers all over the world,
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:50.640]   that can pretty much be anywhere easy to use works on iOS, works on Mac, Android, Windows,
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:55.440]   Linux, you can buy a router from Express VPN. They actually have very good routers with Express
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:01.840]   VPN built in that protects your whole house. You can, yes, you can put it on your TV in many cases.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:06.000]   I mean, it's really a powerful solution. Very easy to use. You fire it up, you click the button,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.080]   and it will choose the fastest nearest server automatically. I should tell you for your security
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:18.240]   and just to reassure you, Express VPN says in their privacy policy, we do know logging.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.640]   They have that privacy policy vetted by an independent third party on a regular basis.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:27.680]   But they go the extra mile. They've created this trusted server technology that runs in RAM,
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:32.320]   is sandbox cannot write to the drive. And it's just for you. So when you open it,
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.600]   that's your server. That's your trusted server running in RAM. When you close it,
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:43.200]   it's gone with no trace of you left behind. And as if that weren't enough, they use a custom Debian
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:48.960]   distribution on all their servers that wipes the drive and starts over every reboot every single
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:56.160]   day. Again, all of that has been has been verified by independent third parties. It's fast because
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.960]   they invest in the network fast enough that you can watch HD streams from anywhere in the world.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:06.160]   They're all over the world. As you see, 94 countries seen that and tech radar, both
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:12.240]   great Express VPN number one. It's the only one I use. It works everywhere. This is the way

[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:58.800]   that you saw it here. I even wonder, Jason, if Apple's thinking this form factor, we're not tied
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:03.040]   to this form factor, right? Yeah. I'm a firm believer. I know we've said this because we've
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.480]   been talking about this product before, like for six months or a year before we even knew what it
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:11.600]   was. One of the things that I really do believe is that Apple is playing a long game, an extremely
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:17.120]   long game here. And like this one, like, like you said, Leo, it's kind of the concept car they're
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:21.040]   going to put on sale, but it's going to sell in small numbers for a high price. But they're
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:26.960]   going to learn a lot. And I think that within Apple, you know, I just get the sense that they
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:30.080]   are going to do kind of what they do with the Apple Watch and say, we're going to learn
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:35.840]   how people use it and what people want and what turns people off. And what expensive piece of
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:41.760]   hardware have we built into this thing, anticipating that people would use it. And then it is not used
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:46.960]   and we can just dump it because we've reconceived of this. And then I would be very surprised if in
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:53.840]   four years or five years, the vision, OS category, whatever it looks like at Apple doesn't look
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:58.640]   remarkably different than this because this is the product of Apple internally. And remember,
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:05.040]   they don't do market research and stuff like that. It's it's Apple all in black boxes inside
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:10.080]   Cupertino, spending five years envisioning this product. And now it meets the real world. Now the
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:14.320]   fun begins, right? And I think that people, even people inside Apple who are like, I don't know
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.680]   about this feature. I'm not so sure. Pick your favorite, pick your least favorite feature,
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.640]   whether it's the eyesight or it's the digital persona or something else. And then
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:26.160]   undoubtedly, there were disagreements, right? And then this is where reality hits the product.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:31.760]   And somebody inside out Cupertino is going to be like, ah, I told you so and things will change.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:36.080]   Yeah, this is a design by a committee. It really is. Andy, I can see you want to.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:40.480]   I'm sorry. Chime in. I'm sorry. I mean, it's it's that's I think that's absolutely true. I think
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:46.160]   this I think Jason was absolutely 100% correct if this is like, even with the even with the iPhone
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:50.880]   as revolutionaries, it was they had to deal with the fact that, okay, we know, we know how to make
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:56.640]   this thing fail hard. Let's not do any of those things. Whereas this is there is no market for this.
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:04.720]   We are really free to decide an absolutely optimal product because as I I'm sort of disappointed by
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:08.480]   a lot of the conversation about saying, Oh, yeah, but that's they said they said that the that the
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:13.280]   iPhone would never sell. They never said said, Okay, well, the what people need to understand is that
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:20.560]   at the time in the months before the iPhone launched, there had been 830 million cell phones
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:28.160]   sold in history. Whereas today there are 65 only 65 million users of AR, not just like people who
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:32.320]   bought these just people they're considered by market analysts to have used it. That means that
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.800]   as we've been saying all along, we don't know exactly what people can use this for. But that
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.640]   if Apple Apple is the one of those few companies that has the ability to treat this like an
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:45.680]   opportunity that says, look, we can we can we can basically do the chess move where we keep our
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:50.320]   finger on the on the piece. We haven't gone yet. We haven't moved yet. This doesn't count because
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:54.480]   they know they have five years to really figure out like what are people are even marginally
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:58.880]   interested in buying. So do they really have five years? I know they can afford they have the runway,
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:06.640]   but the public give them five years. I think so. I mean, again, it's it's so long. I think that
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.960]   it's been demonstrated. There's still there's definitely a market for this within the within
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:16.160]   the realm of researchers within the realm of people who are doing who are vertical industries that
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:21.200]   do a lot of training medicine a lot of these companies. They could publicly held company if
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:27.440]   this sells below expectations next year. They make so much money that they're shareholders
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:32.560]   with all the latitude they're going to and their believers. The shareholders are generally
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:36.560]   believers who are like we believe that Apple is really going down a new path here. Plus,
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.920]   they're still throwing off profits everywhere else. So they're going to give them all the rope they
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:44.720]   need for this. But Andy, I agree with Andy. I think also that some markets will present itself
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:48.480]   fairly quickly. I've already heard from several people who went through that demo experience like
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:55.440]   me who said they think that 3D movies and immersive video at sporting events and concerts and things
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:01.920]   like that will sell headsets on its own. Plus, you talk about travel and where it or people will
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.840]   wear it at home. No, you wear it at home and you're there and you're completely immersed like a
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:10.800]   sporting event or a concert. And then also the travel like Road Warrior kind of thing where
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.640]   you're like you're in hotels and you can bring you've essentially got an iPad with you with a
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:19.280]   giant screen. And if you open up a Mac now the Mac is controlling it too. You can have multiple
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:24.240]   windows up and all of those things like will will somebody want to work eight hours on this
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:29.120]   thing? I don't know. I mean, how long did you get to where you were half an hour and you feel
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:35.520]   worse in any way? No, no, it hurt from the beginning till the end. But like I said,
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:41.920]   you're just I kept adjusting it and it just was right here. So it didn't get worse. I think
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:46.160]   that's a positive that it didn't get worse, but I did not have a good fit. Anyway, I think there
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.080]   will be some markets that we will be surprised by where somebody will be like, well, wait a second.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:56.720]   I'll just I'll just buy it to watch those. Taylor Swift fans will easily spend $3,500 for a good
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:01.280]   see at the concert. This was a conversation that I had with some people last week, which is there's
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:07.360]   probably a price between watching it on TV and buying a Taylor Swift ticket. Right. That gets you
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:14.800]   the immersive Taylor Swift concert experience after the fact it on how is the sound? Good.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:20.080]   The sound it's a lot like the quest. It sounds good, but it's speakers right over your ears. So if
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:23.760]   you were really wanting to block out the world or have the best sound, you would pair it with
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:29.920]   some some air pods, but it can you know, again, yes, you can, but philosophically, again,
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:34.560]   what Apple wanted to show is you're hearing the world around you and you're seeing the world around
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:38.240]   you. They didn't want to hear the right they want to have both of those things going in there,
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:43.040]   but you totally can do that and put in some air pods and have it be noise canceling and completely
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:46.560]   immersive that way too. Yeah, and I think that I think there's probably going to be a version of
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:53.360]   this that is the form factor that we see now for quite some time. And it's going there'll be other
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.120]   versions that are lighter, other versions that are less expensive that will all come out. But
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:01.120]   this is the pro version. This is like the cheese grater. And this is going to continue to be there
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.160]   because they're not going to be what they're just going to keep increasing their performance.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:09.520]   They're going to probably get a little lighter. I'm guessing that within two or three versions,
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:14.880]   you'll see it be 25% lighter, but not not significantly less. And then there'll be a light version,
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:18.320]   there'll be an A-VAR version. There might be, you know, all these other things that they've done
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:22.720]   with everything else that they do. But there is a, I think there's people who are going to want
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:26.080]   to have the higher performance. I mean, this is a good performance. It's not incredible
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:31.120]   performance for a headset. It's the best performance in a publicly available headset. But getting to
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:35.920]   six to eight K per I, 120 frames per second is going to be probably within two versions of this.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:39.280]   And at that point, it's pretty compelling. And the people who use that one aren't going to want
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:44.800]   to use the little ones. So I don't think that I, and I think that what Apple did that the other
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:48.960]   companies haven't done is take away the cost constraint. There was so many conversations
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:55.040]   related to these headsets of how do we make it $300 or $500 or $1500 or whatever it is.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:00.800]   And they take things out and they also aren't chip designers. So they weren't able to, you know,
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:06.080]   do it at the level that Apple was doing it at. And so I don't think Apple has to go crazy.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:10.000]   And this one, I think is still going to sell again next year, they'll sell as many as they
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.640]   can make. I don't think that that is very high. Andy, you had a story on that.
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:20.400]   On that, that Sony said, what did they say about the screens? They said, I think I found the
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.080]   original article, but they basically, there was an analyst that was saying that that Sony will
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:29.040]   probably not the number of screens they will be able to ship in any one year is in the hundreds
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:34.160]   of thousands, not close to the million. So that will be probably the big limiter on how many of
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:39.360]   these they can sell. Yeah, 900,000 a year, according to display daily. And so that's that's if Apple
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:46.160]   bought every single one, that's that that's 450,000 a year at this point. And I mean,
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:52.720]   this is 100,000 stories also from the elect that Apple asked them to be able to make more.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:58.320]   And Sony said, no. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, Apple gets one at once eventually, but this is one of
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:02.560]   those things where how do you create a market for a display like this? Well, one, you do this,
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:07.760]   you make a product that requires it and you go from there and Apple and Sony will either be good
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:11.920]   partners or Apple, you know, it wouldn't surprise me if we're reading that story that Apple has
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:18.720]   already got a different partner for a future version. And there, and you know, it is Apple is not
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:24.160]   likely to be denied, but because they've got all the money and they'll find a way. But yeah, I would
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:27.840]   imagine this thing is going to be supply constraint. Honestly, that may be one of the reasons it
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:32.720]   costs what it does, not just that it's made out of extremely expensive components, but because
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:38.720]   you know, if they know how many they're going to be able to get, you should price it. So,
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:45.360]   you know, you limit demand, right? Because you can't sell, well, they could price it for 2000.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:49.440]   And that would be great and they could sell 2 million of them, but they can't make 2 million
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:53.520]   of them. So why would you price it that way? Yeah, exactly. I think that they will, they would
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:59.760]   sell exactly the same number next year at 3500 or 1000, because at 3500, they're still going to
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:05.120]   max out the number, the number that they can make. And so to your point, you know, I think that
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:08.960]   that was a better situation for them. And I think it also gives them some cover, like, hey,
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:13.760]   we're selling them as fast as we can make them. Oh, yeah. I'm saying that on the analyte call,
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:18.560]   right? We were there that we sold out. We were doing the best we can. It's a new, it's a new
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:22.800]   vertical and we're still working out some of the kinks, but we're selling everyone that we make.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:28.000]   And that's, you know, for an analyst call, that's pretty good signal. It's expected they'll make 100,000
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:35.680]   Sony says we can make 800,000 screens a year. That's 400,000 devices at max a year if they buy all
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:45.600]   of Sony's supply 50,000 to 100,000. So 50,000 to 100,000 devices per quarter, according to the
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:51.360]   elect. Right. Yeah. So 100,000 is not unreasonable amount. It's not enough to move the needle. I mean,
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:57.520]   this really is a developer tool. Well, that's when Andy mentioned pro, one of the, one of the pros
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:02.080]   that are going to be using this product, Andy and Alex both touched on it. It's developers,
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.480]   right? Like one of the things that's happened. And I know David Smith, who's an iOS developer,
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:11.840]   wrote a really nice essay this week about, about why he's very excited about developing for this
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:17.920]   platform. It is, you know, if this is going to be big, eventually, one of the things that Apple has
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:22.000]   as an advantage is the App Store and its app developers and people who are familiar with its
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.280]   platforms, developing software for it. And I would imagine that a lot of the sales of this thing
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:31.200]   there will be a developer edition. Apparently, this is something that's come out that there
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:35.520]   will be a developer kit that will be available to approve. They'll need to do that because they
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:39.760]   want to reserve a certain number and make sure developers get them. Absolutely. Yes. They are
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:45.200]   going to ship some of these hardware, whether it's the final or a semi final version. I think that
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:49.600]   later this year, developers will be able to ask Apple and they'll look at their track record and
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.440]   then they'll approve them individually and someone will come to the house and who knows how that
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:58.160]   will work. So, Halide will get one. That's what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. David Smith will get one
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:02.640]   right for his now that he's written that essay and he's proven himself with with Widget Smith and a
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:07.520]   bunch of other his popular apps. I think he will do it. But that's the other role this product plays
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:13.360]   is it is going to get this in the hands of developers to write the software and now's the time to stop
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:18.640]   complaining about the stop complaining about the store and start saying how great Apple is if you
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:23.920]   want to get your tip. It'll be a year or two before they complain about the VisionOS App Store and
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:30.000]   what the rules are there. And the interesting thing is that it is, you know, for developers,
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:36.960]   it's a pretty green field because you're going to have a bunch of people who let's say tens or
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:42.080]   hundreds of thousands of people who had the money to buy a $3,500 headset and will buy most of the
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.880]   apps that are developed for it. That's true. Just to see what's going on. Yeah. You know,
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:47.440]   like they're just going to be doing research. They just want to see what's going on. They want to
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:52.720]   see the next thing. And so for a developer, you know, to push into that market, the risk is actually
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:57.760]   lower than it seems just because you have people with money that are ready to spend money and need
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:01.520]   and want to know if there are other developers, if they're going to want to see how everybody's doing
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:08.800]   everything. You can almost guarantee yourself 50,000 units for sure. If you write it reasonably
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:12.240]   well, if you follow the guidelines and you have everybody is pretty good. So I guess,
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:16.720]   really, I've been asking the I've been saying the wrong thing and asking the wrong question. It's
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:23.920]   not really what the public reception for this is at all. Not yet. It's how much Apple's willing,
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:30.240]   how long Apple's willing to go? How many years? How many versions are they willing to develop?
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:33.520]   Absolutely. To get it to the point where they will do want it.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:38.720]   I think they're $50 billion in. I'm sure you're right. We know that
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:43.920]   MetaSpends 10 billion a year on its. I think that Apple's spent a lot of money on this. I think
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:48.720]   that they're in. That's the one thing that we see. I think that I think they'll spend another 50
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:53.040]   billion in marketing over the next couple of years. They're going to spend some you're going to see a
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:58.800]   lot of ads for this. I mean, they're there. They need to create a new market.
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:04.800]   What's interesting is that it's not it's a computing platform to them. It's the next computing
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:10.880]   platform. It's another place to be to do your work. And I think that and do work, do everything
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:15.200]   you're doing. It's not it's not a place to play games or a place to disappear. You're going to
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:21.120]   know, yeah. And so I think that they're they're looking at that as a you know, if you look back at
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:28.160]   the 1.2 million iPhones that were sold, that was a good start compared to what they what they did
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:32.720]   not what they do now. Leo, I think it would take a complete rejection of the product. Right? Like
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:37.120]   if they can't find a market for it, if everybody like nobody buys it and everybody looks at it and
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:41.760]   says this isn't good for watching sports and isn't good for watching movies, it isn't good for doing
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:46.400]   video coverage. Like if there is a complete utter rejection of it that people just like all their
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:52.480]   assumptions were wrong, I could see a scenario where they walk away in a few years. But I think
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:57.200]   it feels to me like it's going to take years to even find out if that's true. So they're in,
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:00.240]   they're not going to walk. They're not have to doing seven years of work on this. They're not
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:05.760]   going to walk away in the short run. It's going to take an extended belly flop for them to get there.
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:10.000]   And honestly, I think it might take so long because I really do believe that in the back of their
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   minds what they're thinking is eventually we're going to get glasses people can wear out in the
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.880]   world that augment reality. And that's the prize at the end of this. It's kind of like waiting for
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:24.160]   10 years nuclear fusion. It's not been in 10 years away. But yeah, 30 years of that.
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:28.320]   Some day you will. It's going to be been when it happens though. I wonder if the other thing
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:35.120]   that might happen is that if the vision transmogrifies, I mean, spatial, I'm kind of of the opinion that
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.960]   there isn't really a market for a computer you strap to your face that that's really not the
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:45.440]   form factor anybody wants. So I'm wondering though, maybe spatial computing could be expressed
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:51.280]   in some other form. Maybe you could project screens without wearing it, project them and I
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:55.200]   could still use the gestures in the eye. There might be other forms that you could do without
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:57:00.240]   having this strapped to your face, which I don't really. And maybe it's just me because I just
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:03.280]   have a visceral reaction every time I do this. I just don't like it.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:07.200]   I had a conversation last week with somebody who said the exact same thing Leo, the idea that
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:11.600]   what if this tech has other ramifications that we haven't really talked about?
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:15.920]   Like I'll just throw one out there. What if you had a big screen in front of your Mac?
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:21.840]   Exactly. And it had a sensor display on it and that you were able to actually like
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:27.200]   move the windows and gesture and scroll and do all sorts of stuff with your hands instead of
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:32.800]   using a trackpad? That would be interesting, right? And like they have the technology to do that.
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:38.800]   They bought the company that does that. What was the name of that thing? I had it. I still have
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:42.960]   it somewhere a little brick you'd put in front of your computer and you could gesture
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:46.480]   with it. And then they bought the company. So they own this technology.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:53.600]   Or a top three in minority report where he's going like this and he's got the screens.
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:57.520]   I think it's just as likely just just are a lot easier than those.
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:02.320]   Yeah, they're better than that. They're much more subtle. You're down here going,
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:08.560]   me, me, me, me. I really think that there is a mark. That is something that people would want.
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:14.480]   So and this is just and I think I think Apple, I hope that person you were talking to was really a
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:19.280]   smart, savvy person. It was only smart and savvy people were allowed in.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:24.960]   Because I really think that that's how Apple's thinking also is we want to
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:31.280]   test some technologies and I note that they say spatial computing a lot. I think that that's
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:38.800]   very interesting. Yeah, I'm still on the fence on that term. It's like, I don't know how much this is.
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:44.880]   I'm very, very impressed with especially after watching all the videos from developer week
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:48.800]   about how well they thought out the idea of what does an interface that exists in three
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:52.720]   dimensions look like. I've seen this from Apple in a way that I haven't seen from any other maker.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:59:01.360]   Nonetheless, Apple, they are the king of spin. They are the kings of managing perception.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:05.840]   And I'm trying to figure out if they're just trying to bamboozle people into thinking that,
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:10.560]   no, no, no, we're not competing with anybody because we're just doing virtual screens. We're
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:15.680]   doing an entirely new paradigm for computing. And you don't want to be fooled. You don't want to
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:19.040]   be a boob. Well, Mark Zuckerberg doesn't think they're competing.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:26.320]   He says the vision pro. He told this at all hands meeting. The Verge got the text of it.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:30.640]   It could be the vision of the future computing, but it's not the one that I want.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:36.560]   First off, you're talking your Mark Zuckerberg. Sorry. And you're talking to
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:40.800]   your employees and you don't want to be sorry because Apple is.
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:43.200]   Yeah. We have an Apple. Seriously.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:47.600]   Although his vision, he said that we're all about connecting people. I'm like,
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:52.800]   really? Also, and Facebook's like, we have values. And I'm like, really?
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:56.480]   Really? Facebook? You have values? And you're about connecting people. I mean, Apple's whole
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.440]   presentation was actually about being present in the world and not cutting yourself off by
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:07.520]   default. But what Mark Zuckerberg means is we think that you should be little mumoji,
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:12.560]   teeter-totter action figures in a virtual meeting somewhere in a virtual office.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.600]   Here's the quote.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.480]   There are very different.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.040]   Here's the quote.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:19.760]   Zuckerberg said the question is about, quote, "People interacting in new ways and feeling closer
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:25.760]   at the quest while also being active and doing things by contrast. Every demo Apple showed was
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.880]   a person sitting on a couch by themselves." True.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.880]   I mean, that could be a vision of the future of computing, but like, it's not the one that I
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.960]   want. Is that lonely computing?
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:40.000]   I would be shocked if there isn't fitness and people moving around in this product by the
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:40.800]   time you watch this.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.560]   I thought when people talk about fitness, I would just like, if I put a $5, $5, $5, $5, $100
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.640]   headset, I don't want to get sweaty.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:46.640]   Exactly.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:50.400]   I was like, I immediately was like, "The Sweetshield."
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:54.240]   Oh, sorry. We saw the red dot on the side of this thing. So congratulations.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:57.040]   We'll sell you a new display panel for $2,800.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.560]   Well, to that point, he says, from what I've seen initially, I'd say the good news is there's
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:06.320]   no kind of magical solution that they have to any of the constraints on the laws of physics
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.040]   that our teams haven't already explored and thought of.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.400]   There you have it.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.440]   They went with a higher resolution.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.480]   It was a physics.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.280]   Yeah, break them.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:17.040]   They went with a higher resolution display, and between that and all the technology they put
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.760]   in there to power it, it cost seven times more.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.720]   And now-
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.480]   And our low end product that I just pre-own.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.280]   Our cheap product.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.520]   And that requires so much energy you need a battery and a wire attached to it to use it.
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:31.760]   They made that design trade off, and it might make sense for the cases they're going for.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.680]   But look, I think that their announcement really showcases the difference in the values
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.520]   and the vision that our companies bring to this.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.880]   You know, that's fine, though.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:43.440]   I mean, you should compete if this category can succeed.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.360]   And he's trying to pump up his employees.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.160]   I totally get it.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:46.640]   I totally get it.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.240]   From the outside, I roll my eyes at Facebook's values.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.040]   That's so rich.
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:57.520]   And he compares it to the hastily pre-announced Quest 3,
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:01.600]   rather than their pro product, which was originally 1500, which is how great you have.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:05.120]   I will say my friend Mike Hurley, who I do a podcast with every week, he tried it.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.280]   He also owns a Quest Pro and has used it extensively, including in meetings.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.560]   And he said, you know, it's not just two or three times better than the Quest Pro.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.960]   It's like 10 times better than the Quest Pro.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:17.760]   Well, it has to be.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:21.840]   That's the old story is that I can't remember who it was.
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:26.880]   Some management consultant said, if a new product isn't 10 times better than an existing product,
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.160]   it's going to disappear.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:33.600]   It has to be an order of magnitude better to make people make the move.
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:38.560]   The issue is also is that when you talk about your employees,
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:41.280]   one of the reasons you got to keep on pumping up your employees is that
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:45.200]   employees, it doesn't really matter how many headsets they work on.
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:48.080]   It's how cool the project is, especially for programmers and developers.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:48.960]   Don't leave.
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:56.080]   And I guarantee that everybody at MatterWork Oculus is looking at the schedule on their stock options.
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.520]   You're like, they're just looking at like, am I in year three or am I in year four?
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.560]   Am I in year one?
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:06.080]   What's the quarterly? Because Apple is going to, as this starts to turn,
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:09.680]   Apple is going to turn into a huge, Hoover machine looking for the best developers.
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:10.240]   Well, there's another.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.680]   And they're going to start poaching everybody.
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:16.000]   There's another angle on it, which is that arguably, Met as Vision has failed,
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.320]   that this is not a success.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.840]   I don't think it is.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:27.040]   And I bought the first Oculus Rift, the one that was on the Kickstarter.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.720]   I bought pretty much all of them.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.720]   I mean, this is very much a Facebook sort of perspective where they're not a hardware company.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.720]   Their hardware exists to get you into using their service.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:43.360]   So their perspective is going to be, let's make this as affordable as possible so that as many
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:45.120]   people can get these as they can.
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:49.440]   So that once they get, once they learn that, oh, I've got all my core friends are basically
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:52.000]   getting together in this Facebook VR sort of thing, Met as VR.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.520]   Hey, I want to get on that too.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:59.600]   So it's, and we're doing it collectively, not just the people in this conversation,
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:03.440]   but we're doing this reaction, which is a very American thing where there's a winner,
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.880]   and then everyone else for losers.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:09.360]   It's going to be very, very possible that it could be just like the phone market where
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:15.360]   there is the iPhone, and then there are people for whom the iPhone is, and other $1,000 smartphones
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.400]   are dramatic overkill for what they want to do with it.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:22.560]   And they're going to be the ones who buy the $400 or $500 headsets because they just want a game
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.880]   where they just want to have these entertainment experiences.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.880]   So there could be a lot of different interpretations of this.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.520]   This is why the next five years are going to be so interesting.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:34.080]   One, and it's so important for Apple for that to exist because that is what's kept Apple out of
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:37.280]   an enormous amount of trouble up until now is Android.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:40.720]   Android has been a gift to Apple, even though Steve Jobs took it really badly.
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:46.720]   Android is a huge gift to Apple because it really blunts a lot of the antitrust stuff because
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.320]   there is another market that is actually bigger than Apple's market.
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:55.920]   And so I think that it is very important for Apple for those others to succeed,
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.480]   for Facebook and others to or meta and others to succeed.
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:06.480]   I think that it is, but I do think that it's going to be something like,
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:14.080]   the hard part is that this is a real contrast between move fast and break things and
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.080]   fit and finish.
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:22.960]   And I think Apple couldn't come out with anything less than high fit and finish.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.840]   When they did this, they had to do the Apple version of this and they couldn't put something
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:35.600]   out early. That said, they had to put something out eventually because no plan ever survives
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:40.400]   meeting reality. And so they could do as much as they could and show that they can do something
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:44.640]   great, but they have to have people interact with it, have them see it.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:48.400]   And so I don't think that they need more than a couple hundred thousand people to buy it for
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:53.040]   the first couple of years. I definitely don't think this is the product that they envisioned
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:57.760]   when they seven years ago when they started it. I think this is the product that they knew they
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:03.120]   could get to probably five years ago. I think the essential thing was making sure they got
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:06.560]   developers on board as quickly as possible. And that wasn't just getting the hardware out.
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:11.520]   That's showing off what they did last week, which is just my goodness. I've written just a handful
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:17.920]   of Swift apps, but it got me and just basically test apps just to get used to writing iPad apps
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:21.680]   and thinking that I was watching videos thinking that, gee, I don't think it would take me more
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:27.520]   than a day to adapt for three apps that I built for VR and not just this lame, oh, instead of
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:32.160]   having an iPad app now, you've got the ornaments that are hanging from the bottom. No, I could
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:37.200]   see how well if I wanted to actually add this feature that I thought was kind of interesting,
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:41.280]   I don't think it would take very long because I already know the Swift, I already know this
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:46.000]   app, this app is already running on iPad, and they've seemed to have outlined very, very easily how
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:52.080]   the skills that I already have are easily transferable to basically enhancing these things. That was
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:56.480]   part of the most powerful part of last week's announcements was just simply convincing even
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:01.760]   people like me that who are not professional developers that, hey, look, creating really good
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:06.000]   VR apps is accessible to you and get you excited about doing it.
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:13.520]   Well, let's pause for a moment. We're going to talk some more. Jason Snell has tried it.
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:17.920]   He is here to tell, I didn't ask about the field division, we'll get to the field of
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:22.240]   you in just a second. He's going to tell us more about that. We should really talk about the Mac Pro.
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:27.360]   I'm waiting for my 15 inch MacBook Air to arrive any minute now.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:30.400]   Jason, how uncomfortable was the Mac Pro to wear?
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:36.160]   You know, I chose to wear the Mac Studio instead because it's a lot lighter and it's the same
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:41.920]   processor. The code name for that was Flavor Flav, I believe, heard from start to finish.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:45.360]   From start to finish really should be the show title.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.280]   Actually, it's kind of comfortable. You wear like a shirt.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:56.960]   Andy and I co-Alex Lindsey Moore to come on Mac break weekly. I was hoping that the laptop would
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:01.760]   be delivered before the show was over. It looks like now UPS is saying it's going to come between
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:06.880]   two and five tonight. So if you want to run over to my porches, steal it. That's your window of
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:13.840]   opportunity. Go on over and go to John Ashley. We lost him. I showed you today. Oh, I hope you had
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:18.880]   a good lunch because what I'm about to do is going to make you very, very hungry. Our show today
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:26.320]   brought to you by HelloFresh. Oh, man, I love our HelloFresh box. It takes the work out of eating well.

[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:43.200]   What I like about HelloFresh is the quality of the ingredients, farmed a table quality.
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:50.240]   You know, it's funny. I'm now disappointed when I go to the grocery store. I said,
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:55.440]   "But that pepper isn't as nice as the HelloFresh pepper was. Those snap peas don't snap. Hello
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:09:01.840]   Fresh's seasonal ingredients are picked at peak ripeness and travel from the farm to your doorstep
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:07.440]   in less than seven days. And I think that's probably as fresh as you're going to get anywhere. Fresh
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:14.160]   flavor in every bite. They look beautiful. They taste amazing. And you get the recipe right there.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:18.480]   Figuring out what's for dinner is not at the top of anyone's summer activity wish list.

[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:17.120]   So Apple, it wasn't all Vision Pro all the time. When we were there though, Jason,
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:23.440]   are you sitting through the computer announcements thinking we were thinking we were sitting here
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:30.320]   thinking, I think it was almost what an hour and a half in. Are they going to do the Vision Pro
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.000]   or whatever they're going to call it? We didn't know the name at the point. I think the fact that
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.440]   they announced a new MacBook Air, lowered the price on their most popular computer,
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:45.200]   introduced a new Apple Silicon chip, updated the Mac Studio and finally ended the Apple
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:49.840]   Silicon transition with the new Apple Silicon Mac Pro and they did that in 13 minutes. I
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:52.640]   thought, oh, yeah, there's going to be a headset. Yeah, because they moved through it pretty quick.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:59.920]   But still, I mean, in a way, it's a shame because they really did a lot of stuff just
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:05.040]   independent of the Vision Pro. I agree. I mean, not only do we get the map for the future of
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.800]   their operating systems for the next year, which is always a big news, but the Mac announcements,
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:13.200]   which didn't, they weren't necessary. They just had them ready to go. So I guess they fired them off
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:19.840]   in 13 minutes. But like they're not, like I said, this is the first appearance of the M2 Ultra.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:25.840]   They finally closed the transition by doing a Mac Pro. They brought back the Mac Studio for M2,
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:30.080]   which was an open question about whether that product was going to get updated for M2.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:35.440]   And then I think the most important things they did is they took their most popular product on
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:41.200]   the Mac side, the MacBook Air M2, and they cut the price by $100, which I did not have on my
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:47.440]   bingo card and did that 15 inch laptop that we've been discussing that's been in the works for a
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:52.400]   while now. And Mark Gurman from Bloomberg reported over the weekend that they had originally planned
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.320]   on that to come out last summer. And they just they basically delayed it until now.
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:02.240]   They wanted to ship it with the 13. And next time they revise these, they'll probably ship
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:07.760]   together. But like 15 inch laptop, it used to cost, it used to cost like $1,200 to get a laptop
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:12.240]   over 15 inches on the Mac side, because you had to get a MacBook Pro. And most people do not need
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:18.000]   all the features of a MacBook Pro. And now for $200 more, and it's actually 100 if they're
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:26.000]   configured the same way, because that 1099 MacBook Air is like it's got too fewer GPUs,
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:33.600]   and it's got the low power power brick. And like it is not like it is it is decontented as the car
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:40.320]   people say. So it's really like $100 price delta to get the bigger screen. I mean, I think that's the
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:45.120]   honestly thing that's the biggest impact news of the whole week in terms of like immediate
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:50.400]   real impact is that Apple's best-selling Mac is $100 cheaper. And now there's a 15 inch option.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:54.800]   Like that's huge. It's huge. Yeah, in some ways it tells you how committed they are to vision
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:59.600]   Pro that they were willing to dilute what is really a big story in order to get the vision
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:04.240]   pro at it's not a new story. You know, like I think a lot of times we go into WWC looking for
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:07.280]   something new. And this would have been like, yeah, it's great. But they're not. I have to tell you
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:10.960]   they want to launch something people on the windows side people on the PC side are looking at that
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:18.640]   15 inch MacBook Air 3.3 pounds. They're thinking, Oh my God, you know, did you notice Leo in the
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:22.880]   in the keynote that they kept talking about switchers and it works with your iPhone.
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:29.040]   A lot of Intel. Yeah. Very clear message on the 15 inch MacBook Air that they think that there are
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:34.480]   PC laptop users who they can get with. I don't think I misquoting Paul Therat when he said,
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:39.120]   this is again going to be the best computer for running Windows. It'll have to be Windows on ARM.
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:46.000]   But it runs pretty well on my 13 inch MacBook Air. I think it'll run just fine on the 15.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.600]   There is nothing there. I mean, this is big. And the PC market, by the way,
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:58.320]   and including the max has been going down after COVID by significant amounts. And it's hurt HP.
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:06.640]   It's hurt Intel. It's hurt Dell. So offering a laptop that makes people's mouth water
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:12.800]   is probably not just a laptop either. I mean, you're talking about a group of computers.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:17.520]   Apple is no longer making something that's $60,000 or no longer really making that part of what
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:22.880]   they're doing. But you're looking at a group of computers that the value for the for except for
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:31.680]   some specific verticals for most people, the money you pay for the power that you get is very high.
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:35.600]   I think this is computer very hard to reproduce on a PC and that's from $12,000
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:42.080]   all the way down to $600. There is an incredibly great value for desktop. There's an incredibly
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:48.320]   great value for mobile. So I think that it's a really they're really making that environment
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:52.320]   difficult for a lot of PC manufacturers.
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:56.960]   I love the Mac Studio too. In terms of value, the power of the low end model,
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:04.400]   which is the is the max chip for $2,000. I bought one last year and then one model and I love it.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:09.840]   And it's very powerful, but the power price combination I think was reasonable.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:14.640]   And that ultra, I think the beauty of the M2 Ultra Mac Studio really is that it's exactly the
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:20.080]   same speed as the Mac Pro. You don't have to buy a Mac Pro and spend that kind of money
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:25.280]   in order to get the fastest Mac that Apple makes, which I think is awesome. And then if you need the
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:31.600]   expansion and the extra I/O, you can buy a Mac Pro and some people who have lots of PCI cards
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:36.080]   they need to put in it. But like everybody else, like you just don't need it. You could just get
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:40.720]   the Mac Studio and you've got all that CPU and GPU power just the same. It's literally
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:45.600]   because I talked to them about this when I was down there. It's literally identical in terms of
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:49.520]   performance and they are not there's nothing in the Mac Pro because they both have enough
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:53.200]   cooling that they run unconstrained. There is nothing in the Mac Pro that makes it go faster.
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:55.120]   It's all just about ports and slots.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:59.280]   I love that too. And I love the fact that they're just saying, hey, if you need the PCI,
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:03.360]   I'm a person that is probably going to get one because I need the PCI slots and I need more
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:08.480]   of the thunderbolts. But if you need eight lanes of thunderbolt, you need a bunch of cards for a
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:12.400]   little bit more money, you can buy that. But otherwise, it's the same. And I think maybe they
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:16.000]   learned that a little bit. I think we're seeing that with the phone as well, where they're not
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:22.240]   holding back features from the smaller version of it. You can get a big version or a small version,
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:29.040]   but they're both largely the same. And I think that's the right direction. If you want those
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:32.160]   extra features, you can pay a little bit more for them. And there will be people who need it.
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:35.680]   I mean, we have just stacks and stacks of the sonic boxes because I don't have anywhere to
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.320]   put a card. So I'm looking forward to those cards.
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:45.920]   So that's interesting that the Mac Pro is no more performant than the M2 Ultra
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:52.960]   Mac Studio with a 24-core CPU, 76-core GPU, but it is a thousand bucks more for the slots,
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:56.560]   basically. Yeah. Well, yeah, because you got and then there's some extra ports too,
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:03.120]   because obviously there's more that the Ultra is capable than it is on the Mac Studio's port grid.
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:08.240]   But yeah, basically performance-wise. Look, what we've learned with Apple Silicon is that a chip
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:14.720]   is a chip is a chip. I keep saying, like literally an M2 in the 15-inch year, the 13-inch year,
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:21.360]   the iPad Pro, the Mac Mini is the same. They're all exactly the same in terms of performance
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.840]   essentially within. I honestly think that's a chip is a chip.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:28.000]   That's a selling point because you look at the AMD and the Intel product grid,
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:34.720]   it's baffling. It's crazy. There's low power for mobile. There's high power for desktop.
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:40.560]   There's all sorts of weird features. And it's very, I mean, it's confusing, I think,
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:46.640]   for normal consumers, maybe gamers and Pro users can figure out what they want.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:52.080]   But it really is straightforward with the Mac. It's like, yeah, here's your choice.
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:58.000]   I don't feel like my M1 studio is slow, though. I have no desired upgrade at this point.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.760]   No, I did it. So I did a review of both these systems, which is funny because there's not a
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:08.000]   lot to say. It's other than the M2 Ultra, which is a new chip, everything else we've seen before.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:14.160]   But even, I mean, it's also the same story going from M1 to M2, which is it's incrementally faster,
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:18.800]   and that's great. But the audience for it is people who are still back on Intel, who maybe
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:26.720]   want to change chip classes. If you've got an M1 of anything, you don't really need the M2 unless,
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:30.960]   like MacBook Air, at least the physical characteristics change. But the Mac studio,
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:34.800]   all it is is a slightly faster chip. So the people who should buy the Mac studio are people
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:39.280]   who are on Intel or who bought a laptop like a MacBook Pro, but spend most of it attached to
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:44.000]   a display and maybe a studio would be better, or maybe they got a Mac mini and they're like,
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.800]   maybe I'll go with a little more power and get the Mac studio. But like M1 to M2,
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:53.280]   fundamentally, it's only this incremental update. I'm going to wait for the answer.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:58.480]   It's very fun. I'll upgrade to an M3. Are they in a yearly cadence now? Are they going to kind of
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:06.560]   get this all in order? I mean, M2 debuted here last year, and there was no M3, right? So I think
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:11.520]   there, I think it's, we'll see Mark Gurman says that the next air isn't going to come until early
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:18.400]   next year. So it may really be more of like an 18 month ish cadence for the chip generation.
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:26.720]   We'll see. Yeah. Alex, the Pro is cute. It's a little smaller, right, Jason? It's not,
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:32.160]   it looked, it's hard to tell, but it looked like it was. No, it's not smaller. It's literally the same
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:36.480]   enclosure. In fact, I mean, the motherboard, not everything has obviously changed, but like,
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:40.160]   the fans and the metal enclosure and the wheels on the bottom, if you buy those.
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:43.280]   Yeah, still $400. A lot less expensive. Yeah.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:51.840]   So for you, just because of the slots, a Pro makes sense. Yeah, I mean, being able to put a lot of
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:57.680]   IO in there is definitely things. That's something that I do. So we're, we use cards with what we're
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:03.920]   doing a lot. So being able to put in, you know, I can, you know, we have, when we want key fill
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:08.720]   outputs, we want to get a whole bunch of like, for instance, for Zoom ISO, we can take, you know,
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:12.240]   in the current situation, we can do it with the little ones, but it's nice to have a box that you
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:18.560]   could slide in that, oh, I can, I can have a bunch of storage, I can have much more RAM, I could also
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:25.200]   output, you know, 16 Zoom ISO's or maybe even eventually 32, you know, if I was feeding those into
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:30.480]   some kind of, you know, display system, you know, so I think that there's a lot of opportunity,
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:35.280]   you know, for that to expand a lot. So, so I think that it's going to be, you know, we were
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:39.920]   already talking about the fact that not the bandwidth wouldn't allow us to do this with Zoom ISO, but
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:46.080]   at some point it'd be great to be able to push, you know, 48, 48 outputs of, of Zoom ISO, which may
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:50.400]   seem like a crazy thing to do. But if you're doing, if you're doing an event, like a hybrid event,
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:55.360]   you want to put a whole bunch of people on the screen, having right now, what that was, is an
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:01.040]   army of small laptops with sonnet boxes, you know, that we're all, and people have done this,
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:06.960]   having one computer with just a bunch of STI coming out of the back of it would be, you know, super
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:11.040]   useful. And so that would, you know, so there's there'll be people who buy it just for that kind of
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:19.200]   thing. So the new Mac Pro is designed in California, is a product of Thailand with final assembly in
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:25.920]   the US. So the Austin facility, the Texas facility is still going to do final assembly. I don't
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:30.400]   understand why they say it's a product of Thailand. Does that mean everything's made in Thailand,
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:35.360]   and that you screw it together in Austin? I think that's probably part of the agreement they made
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:39.680]   with the government, whatever benefits they needed to get. Yeah, some legal definition.
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.040]   They're going to do as little as possible.
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:47.440]   In Austin. I think there is a, there's a, I think there's some legal stuff about what,
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:51.840]   what percentage of the parts are created and what you call it. Right. You know, so I think
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:58.560]   product of Thailand may assembled in the US. Okay, just so you know, I mean, I don't, who cares.
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:04.400]   Um, not China though, which is, I guess, Apple, Apple cares. That's going to keep on going. I,
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:08.400]   I don't think we're going to see, I don't think Apple's going to keep on building on. I mean,
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:13.600]   they, they're still building a lot of their core in China because they have no choice,
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.720]   but I don't think they're going to keep on further development of that. Yeah.
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:22.320]   What about the iMac? Why did we not see an updated iMac? Did you ask anybody, Jason?
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:27.200]   Is the iMac dead? Do you want us just to buy a Mac studio and a monitor?
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:31.680]   You know, I was in a briefing where somebody asked that question and they, they basically said
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:36.160]   a non answer because they can't talk about future products, but they were very supportive of the
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:41.200]   iMac. I think based on Mark German's reporting on this, that the truth is that they just decided
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:45.680]   that the M1 iMac was good enough and that they had other products they needed to build and that
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:50.400]   they would come back to it with M3. So I think I am a hundred percent confident that there will be
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:55.200]   an M3 iMac and that would be an upgrade. With a bigger screen? I don't know about that. I think,
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:58.880]   I think they're very happy with that. And now that they've got the studio display,
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:05.200]   do they need a 27 inch iMac? And I've heard that there's a debate inside Apple about that.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:09.760]   Mark German has reported that they've talked about building a larger one, but it was not a priority.
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:14.640]   And given that the 24 inch model wasn't a priority, enough that it didn't make it to M2,
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:21.440]   I would be surprised if there were a bigger iMac than the 24. Yeah, they probably have done research
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:27.680]   or whatever that is Apple does instead of market research and found that the audience for the iMac,
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:34.000]   the home audience is really happy with 24. They don't want a bigger screen or the MacBook Air.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:42.720]   So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, because so Lisa has that, you know, the probably a 5k iMac, the 27 inch,
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:48.880]   and it's kind of on its last legs. I guess I wouldn't replace it. She says, I want to know
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:53.440]   their iMac is that honey, it's 24 inches. I think she was screen real estate's important to her,
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:58.480]   so I guess she's really going to be a Mac mini with a bigger screen. Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:03.280]   And it's fine. Who should get a Mac mini versus a studio? Is there a clear demarcation there?
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:09.440]   I think there is. I mean, the beauty of those two models is they encompass Apple's entire chip
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:17.280]   range. So it's M2, M2 Pro, M2 Max, and M2 Ultra. And the truth is, you know, it's going to be
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:23.920]   what's it worth to you to have performance, but that is a pretty nice rising amount of power based
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:28.560]   on what you want, power, memory, you know, CPU graphics, all of those things. And then the price
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:33.120]   goes up as you go up there. So I think there's something for everybody there. I've talked to people
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:37.760]   for whom, base Mac mini is all they need. I've talked to people who are like, no, no, that Mac,
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:43.360]   the M2 Pro is like the sweet spot. It's like, it's a Mac mini, but it's got more power. And it does.
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:49.360]   It's nice. It's basically an M2 Max chip with some of the course turned off, basically. So it's
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:55.360]   it's pretty powerful. For me, because I do a lot of podcasts and video where I'm doing like de noising
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:00.960]   and video encoding and stuff like that, for me, the Max was the choice that I thought was like the
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:05.680]   best fit for me. And if you're a really high end user that has high end needs, that Ultra is
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:13.200]   Mac Pro full on Mac Pro power. So like, I think there's a pretty good, I think with the Max Studio
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:17.200]   coupled with the mini apples got a really nice ramp there that they didn't used to have,
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:20.320]   where it's like, take your pick compact desktop max, we got them all.
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:25.120]   Yeah. And I think that it's in it's the best lineup they've ever had. I mean, they say that all
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:31.440]   the time, but it's really the cleanest lineup where you have this gradient that starts at $600 and
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:36.800]   goes to $12,000. And there is something there that you can just kind of place into it inside the
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:42.320]   desktop, inside of the the laptops. And I think it does have partially have to do with the fact that
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:46.880]   they are no longer constrained to somebody else's chips. You know, like they're, they're now, you
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:50.800]   know, we're, we're seeing this kind of chaotic start of all these chips and all these different
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:54.800]   places and they're getting them done as they can get them done. And I think that it'll settle into
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:00.640]   you know, this year we're having, you know, I think it will settle eventually into the M3 is
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:06.960]   in one year, the M4 is in another year. And everything is very similar all the way through to the phone
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:12.800]   in the iPad. And it just really makes them much, much more efficient. And it's easier to code for,
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:17.840]   it's easier to, you know, there's so many things that that this makes efficient. And it makes it
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:23.360]   again increasingly difficult to compete with. Mark Gurman, by the way, is saying that the Apple's
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:29.040]   already working on a less expensive vision pro. I wonder when it comes out, if it comes out and say
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:35.440]   March of next year, if they might offer two versions by then, they might say it's like a couple
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:39.920]   years off. Okay. All right. And I don't think that again, I think that there's a vision pro, I think
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:44.000]   the next one will be the vision, you know, or there might be even another vision pro before the
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.600]   vision comes out because I think that they're this felt like, I mean, for all the stuff that we
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:54.480]   know about video production and video and constraints and so on and so forth, this felt like a great
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:29:00.880]   step forward. That's a huge jump over where everybody else is. And like half a step short of what we
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:07.920]   know is kind of where a lot of people are going to land, which is the 126 K or 8K per eye. And so,
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:11.760]   so we know that there it's a little short, I think the pro will probably close that gap
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:15.040]   either completely or partially on the next version to do that.
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:20.640]   Yeah, I think it's going to be interesting to see if they decide to if they decide to plan these
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:25.680]   things out the same way that they've done like the MacBooks where yes, they could be making five,
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:30.720]   six, seven, $800 MacBooks. They've decided that they never have to sell a MacBook for less than a
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:35.920]   thousand bucks or ideally, and this sweet spot will be 11 or 12. And that will be the floor for like
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:44.320]   with the technology is or if they decide that it would behoove them to have a consumption-only version
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:50.080]   of this that costs like that will be like the iPad version of this where no, it's not really going
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:55.680]   to be for yeah, you can use it as a 4K display for your Mac, but it really isn't for like running
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:00.000]   its own apps. It really is just for being in full virtualized experiences. Like Jason said,
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:05.200]   that they've got three different kinds of like basic apps that run one of them. This would be
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:09.040]   not the one that gives you a fully immersive environment running apps and virtual screens in
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:13.760]   front of you. This would be only for the kinds where, hey, watch this movie in 3D or hey, play this
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:19.520]   game in 3D. I didn't ask you about the field of view again, Jason.
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:26.000]   I didn't notice any tunnel vision is the short version. I didn't do like a real like glance around
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.840]   test, but I felt like I was in in perfectly normal vision with peripheral vision and all that.
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:37.280]   I can't like I was kind of distracted by the dinosaurs, but it seemed pretty fine for me.
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:40.800]   Show title. Yeah. Well, that's the point is if you didn't notice, you didn't notice that's good.
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:44.880]   And that's the real problem, by the way, with the magic leap and the hollow lens, is that they
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:52.320]   have these letterbox more like mail slot views of the world. And that's no tunnel vision for me.
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:57.600]   I mean, I've heard it described that way. And people worried about nausea again, like all I can
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:02.320]   tell you is it seems to me that Apple, I mean, they've designed an entire real time operating
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:07.440]   system layer and a real time processor in order to make sure that there's very little latency,
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:13.920]   and that I guess the chip is right on the back of the of the displays in order to reduce latency
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:20.400]   there. Like I, I didn't experience anything that I would say was like a red flag about it. It all
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:25.280]   seemed really, really, really good to me. That said, if you're super sensitive, I think the long
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:29.680]   in the long run, you're going to have to go to an Apple store and try it out to see. But it
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:33.840]   seemed like they nailed that experience. I think it's frame rate. Like I can just say that,
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:38.640]   yeah, generally, 90 frames is pretty good. Pretty good. Yeah, pretty darn good. And so
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:43.520]   that makes a, I think that that really does make a huge difference in how people perceive that,
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:48.880]   that process and a resolution as well. Alex, I'm curious not to hijack this, but I'm curious,
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:54.320]   what's the frame rate of reality or more, more to the point, what's the frame rate at which it's
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:58.640]   indistinguishable from reality for humans? There's a lot of opinions about that.
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:04.320]   Okay. So there's, so there's, so some people will say that it's 240 frames or somewhere in the
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:10.560]   vicinity of 240 frames. Most people think it's somewhere between in the mid 90s. So the mid,
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:14.560]   so the 96 frame, then, you know, so most people think that that's where it becomes
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:19.600]   okay hard for most people to distinguish it. But there are definitely like everything else.
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:22.720]   There's people who can hear further out. There's people who are more perceptive to those things.
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:30.320]   And so, but what people find is that when they say it feels like real at a high enough resolution,
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:38.480]   it's about, it's in that 90 to 96, 98 frames. So they're very close. At 120, they're going to,
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:43.920]   in 120, they're going to be over what most people perceive as real time. There's a lot of
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:47.200]   idiosyncrasies about 120 frames a second that we're still trying to work out. But there's,
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:51.360]   but at that rate, at that frame rate, which is what every monitor that you have, your
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:54.160]   phones, everything's kind of moving towards that frame rate.
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:33:01.840]   That's where we really feel like it. It feels very fluid. But again, some people will say that
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:08.160]   people can perceive it even up to 480 frames a second. But most people aren't conscious to it
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:10.240]   after somewhere in the mid 90s.
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:14.160]   I think this is why I was really, really pleased that there are so many people out there that got
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:19.280]   demos. And so if it's true that hundreds of people got these demos, that's a very, very wide
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:24.480]   spectrum. Joanna Stern of Wall Street Journal has one of the most valuable write-ups.
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:27.760]   And she didn't have a great time with it. She didn't, she didn't, like she wasn't blowing
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:31.600]   chunks or anything like that. But she was kind of glad to take it off at the end for exactly that
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:36.000]   reason. And I'll have to update my knowledge about frame rate. The last time I really looked at
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.960]   like research papers, and what they're doing, it was a, there are a couple studies that did like,
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:47.200]   hey, we're going to be putting a high definition, high frame rate monitor next, in some rooms,
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:50.640]   we're going to be putting a window in other rooms. We're going to see who figures out that they're
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:56.320]   looking at a monitor and not, and not at a window. And that magic number was in the 300s.
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:00.320]   But that's, that could have been a completely different set of, set of constraints. It could
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:04.720]   have been, and also, I don't, I don't think if, if I remember correctly that it wasn't,
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:07.360]   they weren't trying to say, well, let's keep reducing the frame rate to see
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:12.480]   like, to the, to the level that you're talking about. So I'll have to update my, my knowledge.
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:17.840]   I asked chat GPT what the frame rate of reality is, and it refused to answer. So I'm canceling
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:23.200]   my subscription right now. It's unreal. And matrix doesn't want you to know the tech details.
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:29.520]   They want you to see the, you know, a big, a big piece of this is that it's, it's the return on,
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:34.000]   on effort as well. So at, you know, it's not necessarily, that's, that's why some people are
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:41.360]   saying you might need 480 frames to be absolutely to hand, but 99% of your perception at 120 frames
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:46.960]   per second is handled. And the amount of technical lift to go from 120 to anything higher, the amount
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:51.120]   of technical lift to get to 120 is a big deal for everybody right now. So, so I think that it's,
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:55.920]   I think that there are a lot of folks are looking at, you know, again, most people think that the,
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:00.160]   that that base rate of really people feeling like it's fluid is not in the mid 90s.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:05.360]   Yeah. Yeah. But this, but this is a really big question though, because it's, it's one thing when
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.040]   you, it's one thing when you've got like a gaming headset where people are going to be using it for
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:14.480]   half, whoever long it takes to entertain yourself in an airline seat, say, whereas if Apple is really
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:18.480]   saying that, no, no, no, this is spatial computing. This is really a computing platform. We expect
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:24.160]   you to spend like a full work day or even half a work day parked with this thing on your, on your
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:30.400]   face looking at virtual screens. That is, that is the, the Ironman triathlon of this kind of technology,
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:35.040]   where if it's, if it's good enough for two hours, it might absolutely be unbearable for three or four
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:38.480]   hours. Yeah. I still think, I think that the weight is going to be, you know, a challenge for
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:42.720]   them. I think that for, to leave it on for the day, I think, Jason.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:46.800]   I didn't know. I mean, I think it's about a sound from what I meant.
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:54.080]   The meta-quest to, I thought it was not unreasonable, but again, I only, first off, I couldn't get
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:57.680]   it to fit right. And also I only use it for half an hour and half an hour session is not a,
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:01.680]   as Andy said, it's not a two hour session. It's not eight hours. I will say that Apple
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:06.480]   actually suggested in their presentations that you could wear it all day and do work.
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:12.480]   And I find that fascinating and a, it seemed like a wild claim to me. And it makes me think that
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:17.680]   there are people in Apple who use it all day and are fine. So right. Like, and maybe those people
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:22.800]   are outliers. I don't know, but I was surprised that they actually seem to say, yeah, that's a use
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:28.080]   case. Use it all day for computing. You're going to buy one? I mean, it's my job too, but I'll tell
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:32.080]   you after that 3D experience, if they've got lots of good 3D and immersive content, I would buy one
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:36.320]   anyway, because I am one of those people who would be like, Oh my God, like, I watch,
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:41.200]   I have watched movies on the MetacuS2 and it's, it's display is terrible. But the 3D
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:45.520]   movie experience is actually pretty good. And if I could do that and then there's Shareplay,
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:49.600]   if I have friends who've got it and like, I can see a use case there, if they do a sports thing,
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:54.160]   if I can watch a baseball game every week in that immersive 3D environment,
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:59.280]   it's going to be tough for me to say no to, but it's also my job. So the business will buy it.
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:03.440]   And I'll write it off. I'm sure. And that's also you spend a lot of your day alone in your
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:08.800]   garage. So I, well, that actually, that's, I think that's an important point. It's absolutely true that
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:14.160]   these are solitary experiences. I, the movie watching, the problem with the movie watching thing is that
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:17.600]   I watch almost every movie I watch with my wife and we're not going to have two heads. And I'm going
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:23.680]   to watch it. So right. And so like, how much of this conception is people who are alone? And what
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:28.160]   are the use cases? And the truth is, and this is the thing is if I had one, it's more likely I would
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:33.920]   use it for work than for pleasure, only because I'm sitting at my desk all by myself all day working.
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:39.280]   And so if it was a productivity boost for that, you know, I just push my display away and use that
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:45.840]   instead, that would be fine. If I could, if it worked, right, a lot of ifs there, if you're somebody who,
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:49.920]   you know, maybe it is when you're watching on a plane or something like that, or I have a friend who
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:54.480]   watches most of his TV shows at night in bed after his wife has fallen asleep, right? Like,
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:59.280]   it's just a thing. Like, I could see scenarios, but you do have to kind of come up with solitary
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:03.280]   scenarios for this stuff. And that's that is weird. I did think that it was interesting that
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:09.200]   I suddenly realized, Oh my goodness, they did the whole prehistoric thing in 3D. Like, like,
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:13.520]   when they did that, I was like, that whole series is all going to be like, they're going to have
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:18.160]   experiences that are going to and to go through the amount of expense that it took to make that.
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:23.360]   If they in knowing, knowing what they know now, I suddenly realized a lot of things that they built
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:26.880]   may have, not necessarily all the video stuff, but a lot of the CG stuff that they've done
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:32.880]   could potentially be done in, you know, it could be re-rendered or is already rendered in a stereo
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:40.720]   environment. And that we, it is interesting that Apple TV is is something that because Apple
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:45.920]   spending money on that as well, you know, building stuff for this headset is much more seamless than
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:50.240]   it is for meta. You know, like it is, you know, like, Oh, we can just shoot this, you know, because
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:56.080]   you can shoot it. You need the time X stereo cameras or what do you, what it takes.
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:01.280]   Yeah, I mean, so for the level that they're doing it out, the real challenge you get into is that
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:04.880]   you need a lot of control over the cameras. It's a lot more complicated than putting the cameras
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:09.360]   next to each other because you have to manage both the, you have to manage the
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:14.160]   interocular distance, that's the distance between the eyes. And then you also have to manage
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:18.400]   convergence. So, and that is where the cameras, if they're sitting right, butt it up against each
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:22.320]   other, you can't manage the convergence properly, which means that because when we look at things,
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:25.840]   you know, if you look at something really close, you're seeing your cross side because your eyes
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:31.120]   are converging on that, on that point. And so the issue is it's not straight out. It is converged
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:35.280]   on a piece. And so you have some pretty complex systems. So what we tend to do is we have one
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:40.320]   camera looking through a basically a teleprompter and, you know, a mirrored glass and another one
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:45.120]   looking up. And so then you have to build all the gears and so that they all work. It's kind of,
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:51.360]   it's a very, you know, you reverse all of those. And so now you have these two cameras that are
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:58.640]   looking at it and they're in the right place. And now you can manage your focus, your zoom and also
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:06.560]   your convergence. And all of that is pretty complicated. Now you can, for 2D, end up delivering
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:12.960]   just one of those eyes, left eye typically. But the, but so you can do that 2D delivery,
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:21.280]   which interesting is Apple's new video format is designed. The MVHVAC is designed to, if you only
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:24.960]   have a 2D display and they talk about it a couple of times in their delivery, they want to make
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:29.440]   sure that you're going to deliver one eye, you know, when you're, when you're doing those things,
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:34.800]   if you don't have stereo. So the stereo, it's a big rig. But you have to remember that we're not
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:40.000]   shooting live and there's lots of smaller rigs. So there's going to be an experience, the Canon R5
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:47.840]   with its stereo, the Canon R5 has a stereo lens. That's 180. That works really, really well for
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:54.080]   doing VR. And I think you're going to see a lot of little stuff done that way. We have to remember
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:59.280]   that Apple did, you know, so the 180 experiences are a different thing than movies. Right. And the
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:02.720]   other thing is, is you have to really decide whether movies are the right thing for someone to watch
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:12.800]   because in full VR, lots of cuts and big camera moves is goes back to what we were talking about
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:17.920]   earlier. So frame rate is one thing. Moving the camera a lot is another. Yeah. You can make people
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:22.160]   feel pretty sick pretty quickly if you're not. Yeah, I get sick. I get to be in a virtual on a
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:26.720]   regular screen because the head bob in the movement makes me queasy. Right. With that,
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:30.880]   where the virtual movie theater reduces that, right? You actually put it in on a screen as long as
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:34.320]   you're in a frame and you're not hanging, you're in a frame, you can see seats around you. There's
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:38.480]   a reflection on the ceiling of the lighting from the like you do that and it feels okay. But
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:43.840]   it's fantastic. Apple actually built their own rig to do those 180 immersive, which is interesting.
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:47.520]   But everybody's going to want to, you know, start exploring with that. It'll be interesting to see
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:52.080]   how that goes. And then a footnote for what Alex said is if that sounds complicated and
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:57.120]   all that, that's why most Hollywood movies are shot in 2D. And then there's a 3D production house
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:02.640]   that creates a 3D version. Yeah, because it's not as good. Right? It's not. It's not as good. It's
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:07.440]   not as good. It's like those 3D comic books we used to see where there's like, there's just planes
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:13.200]   of depth instead of it being truly if you look like this in proper 3D. It looks as it looked like
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:20.480]   this pizza coming. Oh, yeah. Oh, that is the future. The house of pizza. Oh, pizza. Oh,
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:29.280]   oh, exactly. And the big question is what they do with these, you know, the big question will be,
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:33.520]   what do they do with these two lenses that are at the top? And do they either computationally
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:39.440]   match them? Or do they actually make another lens here so that the phone can generate 3D?
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:43.840]   And if the phone can generate, if they, if you can pick up a phone and go like this, and while
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:48.880]   this is much closer than interocular distance, the thing to remember is that the hydrogen,
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:55.600]   the red hydrogen was even closer than these two lenses are. And so what that, you know, so that
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:43:00.960]   whole silliness of, I mean, not silly, but whole silliness of putting something on to shoot something
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:06.400]   on a birthday is less silly. If someone just picks up their phone and shoots stereo for the headset,
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:10.240]   sends it to their friends, and they're able to put that on and feel like they were there as a
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:15.760]   model. It's got to be coming, right? I mean, I feel like Apple doesn't announce future products,
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:20.560]   but that was screaming. We are going to do 3D capture on the on a future iPhone.
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:25.680]   Yeah, obviously the next fall. Yeah, it feels like it's going to be such a bummer. If they,
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:30.560]   you know, being able to have this phone right before the headset comes out and being able to
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:34.160]   generate all that content, it feels like a really missed opportunity. If it's a think about this
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:38.720]   year, but it'll definitely, as you said, definitely an exterior. But you could do it in this form
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:43.600]   factor, you think? You could you could do it in that form factor. You wouldn't have to put it
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:48.480]   so that I again, I shot. Or do you put a second camera bump on the other end of the phone?
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:54.880]   I would love I would strongly prefer the second camera further apart because the 3D is way better,
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:44:00.480]   but with computational photography with the LiDAR with a lot of things, you can you can they can do
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:06.640]   a lot of work on that that feels pretty good. I think that I do think that they might need a fourth
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:10.240]   sensor only because I think that they're going to want to have those two sensors. I think it's
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:13.600]   going to be really hard to make those two sensors work perfectly together. You really want them to
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:18.720]   both be the same focal length. The one X is both those of the point five or whatever one they pick
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:22.640]   is there's two of them and they shoot stereo and the other two.
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:26.880]   Take who has it in our chat room? They sell two phones.
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:33.360]   I really miss that. I got your second iPhone so that you could shoot for the vision pro.
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:38.080]   Have that rig around somewhere. I don't think that's I don't think that's terribly silly either
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:46.480]   because I could see having a native 3D capture via via two sensors as part of the pro phone line,
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:50.960]   but now you're getting into how much would it cost to have that extra lens array and that extra
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:57.200]   sensor into every phone that they're expecting everybody to buy. Is that going to be what gets
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:44:59.520]   people say, you know what? I don't want to buy the pro all by the normal one.
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:08.560]   There's also by the way, I read another paper about an idea for using camera. There's a number
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:12.800]   of there's some actual like, you know, unavoidable jitter like when you're actually holding a phone
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:18.240]   and trying to shoot. There is an idea for an algorithm that would be able to essentially use
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:24.640]   that jitter to capture like acceptable 3D from a single lens. I would love to see an AI solution
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:29.680]   to that like some of the builds. Don't forget they have the LiDAR sensor and everyone.
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:35.440]   So they've got full depth. They could do a fake 3D based on the depth data. They just wouldn't be
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:39.840]   capturing sort of like behind the corners for the parallax, but they could definitely do it.
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:46.080]   I would say Andy, yeah, I mean, I can imagine them doing a 3D photo is a display on the iPhone as
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:50.080]   well. So the people who don't have a headset can still sort of like do that thing where you
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:56.240]   you can kind of like tilt it a little bit and get that 3D almost lenticular kind of style effect.
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:01.280]   I could see them doing that as part of it. And that would be right because if it's this limited
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:05.440]   product and then they put this feature in the iPhone and you're like, well, yeah, if I don't
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:10.080]   have that headset, but if you've got other ways to display it that are like cool enough,
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:14.800]   you can get away with it. I think people are going to I'm sorry, just quickly that I think
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:19.200]   that this is part of the halo effect of the of the vision pro that people are going to be
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:24.400]   capturing with these $3,500 devices that they already have. All kinds are really cool content
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:30.080]   that Apple is going to want to figure out a way to give people on the ground, so to speak,
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:33.360]   the same experience with their phones that will get people to think, oh, wow, I could be shooting
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:36.880]   video like this, or I could get I could be seeing this much better than just simply sliding this
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:41.920]   just like what the what the Google cardboard used to be where here is a series of here's a
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:46.320]   headset just slide your phone into the back of it and we will fake it for you. Yeah, I think that
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:53.040]   if they put another lens in, which the hard part is, is that all the computational stuff looks okay,
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:58.480]   even Apple's computational stuff looks okay, you know, and I think that they want to make
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:02.320]   sure that that experience on the headset is amazing. And I think that and I don't think they'll put
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:07.120]   it in all the phones. I think this is the pro version. So you put basically in the pro version
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:13.280]   is a 3D shooting option, and the other versions are not. So I think that that's where you put it,
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:16.560]   you know, the I don't I couldn't find my headsets out in the garage. I'm not going to go get it.
[01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:21.440]   But what I did is I built I printed this these two pieces. I printed a piece that had, you know,
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:25.520]   if you think about having the phone here, and after some iterations, I learned, you know, so you have
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:30.080]   the two the two here. What you have to do is line these up. So then I had another one that was like
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:35.840]   this. And then I had the other phone interesting like that you rotated it. So I had to rotate it
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:41.280]   around, which would work fine. And so I just had a big that looks pretty funny and goat rock up
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:47.040]   and up in Bodega Bay with someone walking around with this rig. People, I got a lot of attention.
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:52.160]   Anyway, but but I was shooting some stuff here and it worked. It worked exceptionally well.
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:56.800]   It, you know, as far as stereo goes, because I got these were when I printed them, I made them
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:03.520]   in a interocular distance. So they they did what they needed to do. The problem is again, gets back
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:10.480]   into the finer things of convergence. So they're both going straight and getting both cameras to
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:14.080]   start at the same time was hard because they don't sink together. So you have to kind of hit them
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:17.680]   and then you have to find the frame and you would put your hand out in front and snap and then you
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:23.200]   go back and everything else. And so it's not it's you can Jerry rig it, but it's it's not a
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:28.720]   but Apple could obviously I think when I started when I started playing with it in stereo,
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:33.760]   I was like, Oh, this would be really nice. I wonder how many I wonder if the memo went out to
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:39.840]   producers for Apple TV plus just keep this in mind, shoot it this way or or something. I think
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:42.960]   you have to really decide you're going to do it. I think that they would you know, and I think that
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:48.400]   it's a huge advantage for Apple to own the broadcast rights for MLS. There is so much every time you
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:53.600]   start. Yeah, it is massive like that by that purchase makes that's why they kind of sense now
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:57.920]   makes sense because because the thing is is that being able to say, I mean, the amount of
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:01.600]   infrastructure that you have to deal with with broadcasters because their job is not your job.
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:06.160]   They don't care about you. Like I've done tons of 360 in stereo at concerts at
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:11.360]   you know, these things and the fact that Apple can say, I have a piece of content that is
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:16.800]   paying for itself in some other way and I can and I also control it. So me saying, I'm going to do
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:21.920]   an Ed Sheeran show, let's say, and I'm going to pay for it and it's going to get distributed on Apple
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:26.640]   plus comes out of that budget. But oh, I have the ability to put the cameras exactly where I want
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:32.800]   them because I own the space is massive, you know, for for Apple to be able to not have to deal with
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:37.440]   all the other things that we deal with when we're trying to shoot these because people are like,
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:40.640]   well, you can only put the camera over here and you can only put don't put it in the way of the year
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:45.440]   and people can't see if you put the camera there. All those things go away with Apple money and
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:49.840]   Apple infrastructure. And so the ability to generate some of this content is going to be
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:55.760]   pretty they have a much better chance of building compelling content because they have more control.
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:03.920]   I'm going to defer a conversation much needed about the new iOS 716 17 and the new 17 and the new
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:10.560]   back OS Sonoma loves saying that till next episode. We'll save that because we're running out of time.
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:15.440]   There is a couple of Apple TV plus stories though. There is a reason to finally finish watching
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:20.240]   season one of foundation because season two is a minute they just released the yeah,
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:26.960]   I don't know if I will. They just released the trailer for the new season today.
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:35.600]   I'm going to stick with to be honest with you. The what do they call it? I want to call it whole,
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:41.840]   but it's really silo. I'm going to stick with silo and there is a note. Good job.
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:49.040]   And Pruitt, he has snagged Hugh Howie, the author of the novels that silo is based on
[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:59.760]   wool. And so he will be on our for the club members. He will be on a special club twit
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:09.360]   event on June 29th, 1 p.m. So towards the end of this month, Hugh Howie, Hugh C. Howie joins
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:16.320]   amp Pruitt in conversation. If you're a silo fan or a wolf fan, June 29th at 1 p.m. That's a good
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:23.200]   reason to join club twit. This is and is the community manager there and he's been charged with
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:27.840]   making it exciting to hang out and club to it. And I think he's done a really fantastic job.
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:33.840]   We've got a bunch of events coming up besides that June 29th one. Sean Powers, Fireside Chat.
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:38.160]   He's the one of the hosts of Floss Weekly will be Thursday at 9 a.m.
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:46.640]   The fall June 29th Thursday, the Terraformers, Stacey's book club and immediately, but shortly
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:53.200]   after on the same day, the Fireside Chat with Hugh Howie and the booze fueled inside twit after
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:59.920]   hours, July 14th, Rod Pylo do a fireside chat on the 27th. What do you get with club twit? Let
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:05.440]   me tell you, you get ad free versions of all of our shows. You get shows that we don't put out
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:12.000]   for anybody but club twit members like that Hugh Howie interview, hands on Mac with Micah
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.560]   Sergeant, home theater geeks with Scott Wilkinson, hands on windows with Paul Therott on title
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:21.600]   Linux Show, I can go on and on. Those are shows that eventually we hope will become public like
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:25.440]   this week in space. It started in the club. The reason we can do that is club members
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:31.040]   subsidize it. They pay there seven bucks a month. They also get access to the discord, which is
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:36.160]   really fantastic, a great community where you can chat about the shows, but you can also chat
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:43.920]   about other topics of interest to our audience, which is a lot of fun. John, it's not going to be
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:53.440]   booze fueled, you say? It's not. All right. Well, I like 10% 10% OK, fine. Some of you will be
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:53:04.080]   booze fueled. If you're not a member, we wish you're appreciated if you join club twit.tv/club
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:10.080]   twit. I don't know if you've heard, but the podcast advertising environment has gotten tougher
[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:19.920]   and tougher and we see a time where Spotify, iHeart, Apple, Amazon will eat up the podcasting space
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:25.040]   and all the advertising. But we want to keep doing these shows. I just would like to keep doing this.
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:29.920]   So it looks like the way forward really is going to be club membership. So please
[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:36.160]   twit.tv/club twit. It's a great way to get some a lot extra content, a lot extra fun,
[01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:41.360]   but also support what we do going forward. Thank you in advance. Our picks of the week coming up
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:48.800]   in just a second, but first a word from Zokdoc. When somebody's really good at what they do,
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:55.360]   you know, when they're it's Jason Snell at six colors or or a waiter who really is, you know,
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:54:01.280]   serving you and explaining what you're eating, things like that, or maybe a doctor who really
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:08.640]   tells you what's going on. Then you know that you got your in good hands, right?
[01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:14.560]   A good doctor makes you feel heard, makes you feel at ease, helps you feel better.
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:19.120]   But not everybody wants the same kind of doctor. Some people want doctors that
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:24.000]   that are, you know, give you all the options. Some people say, don't I just tell me what to do,
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:30.640]   Doc. I don't have I can't absorb all of that. Well, you can find the right doctor fast with

[01:55:54.640 --> 01:56:01.440]   They are fan. I've used them. They're great. Zokdoc.com/macbreak.
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:06.720]   Let me thank them so much for their support of Macbreak Weekly. And again, I know you're smart.
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:11.360]   You can take your phone and download the app, but then they wouldn't know you saw this.
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:16.640]   And so please just do me a favor, Zokdoc.com/macbreak.
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:23.040]   All right, picks of the week time. Let's start with Alex Lindsay.
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:34.480]   Hello, hello. Hello, hello. So I have an aspect ratio. No, I'm fine now.
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:41.040]   Okay. I only have an aspect ratio to share with you, which is 9x19.
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:45.200]   9x19. What's that aspect ratio is? Is that your camera phone?
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:51.280]   It's just your phone. It's your phone screen. So 9x19. So if you're using mid-journey,
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:58.800]   remember that you can just set AR. Dash dash AR. And the only reason I said this is that I had
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:06.080]   like one lock screen or two or three lock screens on my phone. And now I don't know
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:11.440]   what I got to begin to doing it. So if you look at this, let's see here, let me show you this is
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:15.280]   like, I'll just show you some examples. I just started experimenting with it. So here you have
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:20.800]   like this one, like these little pictures, little pictures, you know, like, this is like
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:26.160]   this is all mid-journey. All of these are mid-journey. You know, like you have these little,
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:32.320]   I was playing with octopuses for some reason. This is some more high, you know, ones, there's
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:39.280]   like, then you have a shark, this shark and these go together, I guess. Anyway, so, but it even
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:42.880]   does the little thing where it cuts the little bit of the nose out of the out of the out of the,
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:48.880]   Oh, look at that. So it's below the clock. Yeah. Yeah. So so it's and then there's a couple more of
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:53.200]   these and what's interesting about it. And then I got into these, all these geeky ones and then
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:57.200]   my, I made some for my wife. Give me a prompt so I can enter it here. So it's AR.
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:02.080]   Well, you just do whatever you want. So how do you have to do that?
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:10.720]   I don't know. Oh, it's just dash dash AR space nine colon 16, nine colon 16. I'm entering it
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:15.120]   right now. Dragon scales. Oh, and would you do any special lighting?
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:20.320]   Um, in this one, in this one, uh, you know, I think that this, you know, a bunch of these, oh,
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:24.400]   and by the way, this to take it one step further, I was experimenting. I haven't gotten working yet,
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:30.880]   but this is the little square underneath that that's made by Photoshop. So, so I said,
[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:37.040]   I just took it and I selected that area. And I said, produce an LCD screen, uh, that, you know,
[01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:42.960]   produce an LCD screen inside. So I use gender of AI and Photoshop to put a screen into the,
[01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:49.360]   which is easier than trying to get it to work. This, this was like, a macro shot of, um, you know,
[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:56.000]   a Mac overhead macro shot, uh, steam punk circuit board. And then I gave it, I think I said something
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:01.280]   like a seven S three, um, you know, or, you know, just gave it, you know, gave it some lenses and
[01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:07.280]   things. And that's what I ended up with, you know, and, um, but here's like, oh, I like years and
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:11.440]   scales. I love, I love like some, these little things like this. And so it's what's, what's
[01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:15.440]   interesting about it is, is of course it's not just that it's a photo or feels like a photo.
[01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:25.040]   It's that it is, um, it fits. So it's actually building the photo for the aspect ratio that you're,
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:30.480]   you know, that you're doing. And so it's, you know, and for having fun, like in all of these,
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:38.080]   if you look at these, you know, all of these are like, that is a perfectly framed or my phone.
[01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:45.600]   So they're all, they're all framed. They're all like, they're composed for that aspect ratio.
[01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:51.040]   It's not just cutting something out of a photo. It is actually being, you know, it's composing the
[01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:57.120]   photo, you know, for the, you know, for the frame that it has, you know, so anyway, it was one of
[01:59:57.120 --> 02:00:02.320]   those things that I don't know how I did it or I mean, why I did it at first. But now it's kind of
[02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:06.320]   like I'm sitting in line somewhere, I'm waiting for something. I'm like, I'm going to wonder what
[02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:12.080]   an octopus would look like underwater. Great idea. So so anyway, it's, it, I went from having none
[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:16.480]   to maybe lots and then sending friends, some of them like, Hey, this one, you probably like on
[02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:22.880]   your phone, like family, like my daughter and my wife, son. So this is really a tip, not a pick.
[02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:28.080]   But when you do your, uh, your image, it's kind of a side. Yeah. It's good. When you're using mid
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:34.560]   journey or whatever, uh, in mid journey, you do the prompt and then you add dash, dash, dash, AR
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:41.280]   space, nine colon, 16, very nice. I'm sorry, nine colon, 19. And it will, it's, it's really 19.5.
[02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:47.600]   I did some research on it after I got going. Um, and, uh, but it's a, but live by 16 will work.
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:52.160]   Nine by 19. Nine colon, 19. Oh, I think 16.
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:54.640]   I, I, that's for TikTok.
[02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:58.080]   Nine colon, 19.
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:04.240]   Oh, and 19. God, it's that'll, that'll be the same as your, at least my phone. I don't know if
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:09.920]   all the Apple phones are the same, but the, for the, at least the 14 pro. That's nine 19.
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:21.600]   A computer motherboard. Lit from above dramatic lighting dash AR nine colon 19. I'm going to try
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:28.160]   that right. Dash dash. It's dash dash. They are space nine colon 19. 19. Thank you, Alec.
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:37.040]   Lindsay. Yeah. I'm gonna have some fun making wallpapers. Very cool. I apologize to everyone
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:43.280]   for how much time that that will suck up if you start playing with it too much. It's too much fun.
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:49.360]   Annie and I go pick of the week. Uh, very quick one. Um, I, I'm a sucker for every single
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:54.560]   organization outlining note staking tool that I ever, I've never heard of. Just discovered one
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:02:01.040]   last week called bike and it's made by the same guy who did a task paper. So really, but I like
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:07.040]   about it. It's really, really clean. It's not like omni-outliner, which tries to be, it could be
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:11.440]   anything you want it to be if it involves organizing information. This really is a straightforward
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:17.200]   outliner, but the payoff for that is that it's very, very clean, very, very fast. I love that
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:23.360]   there's little animations that take you through the outline as you go. Very, very scriptable,
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:28.240]   very, very work flowable. And I've have, I've only used it for a week. So that's, it's basically
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:32.560]   on my radar, but if there are times where I've recommended omni-outliner to people,
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:38.000]   because it is, I think one of the greatest apps I have ever used, you know, since I was a child.
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:42.880]   And in terms of this has transformed like what I do, outliners kind of do that. I think that
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:48.000]   omni-outliner is kind of the, the, the, the tops and all of that. However, it could be a bit much
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:52.640]   for some new users. And so if you're just looking for an outliner that is better than just simply
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:59.280]   markdown hyphens, this is worth looking at. It's licensed, it's licensed. So you get a three-day
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:03.600]   free trial or I think two weeks free trial if you were downloading through the app store.
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:09.600]   And it's 30 bucks a month, excuse me, a month, 30 bucks a year. So it's also less expensive than
[02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:13.680]   omni-outliner pro, not more expensive than the basic version, but less expensive than the
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:19.440]   on the one. It's a bicycle for your mind, right? Hog-based software is Jesse Grojini. He's great. I
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:24.080]   love all of this software. He's been around for some time, one of the longtime Mac programmers.
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:30.480]   Yeah, this is a great little tool, bike outliner, bike outliner. Have you ever tried log-seq?
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:35.120]   No. Oh, I'm going to recommend this. I'll give you a little quick
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:45.360]   recommendation. It's very similar. It's an outliner, but it stores as markdown on your hard drive.
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:54.320]   Let me open log-seq and I'll show you how I use it. It's not as pretty. You've got the
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:04:03.600]   animations, but this is line one. Then you can do it in line two. I'll show you what I did during
[02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:11.840]   the Apple event. I did the outline here and I was able to put in the feature quilts as we're
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:19.040]   talking, paste them in and so forth. It's a really, this is not web-based. This is local on my hard drive.
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:24.480]   It's an open source project though, so it's free. Although I pay, I actually contribute back to it
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:30.960]   so that I can do these things. So it runs on everything I have. It's a multi-platform
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:37.040]   beyond Apple. It's got a very Android. It's got a very good mobile.
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:42.320]   That's the chief advantage to me. I'm very cross-platform, so I have to be able to use it.
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:48.800]   Yeah, I got to say Ulysses, Ulysses text editors is getting me like, "Oh my god, it's going to be
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:55.120]   another factor towards." If I switch back to iPhone, it's probably because Ulysses is becoming a
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:05:00.800]   bigger and bigger part of my workflow for everything and it's a bummer that I can't check things out
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:04.480]   or add things. Two things are added on my Android phone. Well, I know how you feel about that.
[02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:10.080]   Since you use Android and Mac, this is a perfect log-c, L-O-G-S-E-Q.
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:18.320]   I've gone from Rome Research. It's kind of a local Rome Research notion. Oh, I've gone
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:23.040]   Obsidian and this is the one I've really stuck with. It's really fantastic. There's people like us
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:26.320]   that like, "Well, we want, but we're always looking for something." You're always looking for the next
[02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:33.360]   best one. Jason, the week vision pro. Oh, no, I'll do all the product.
[02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:40.800]   No, wait until next year for that. Libby has been picked here before. Adam Inks by my records,
[02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:47.440]   picked it in 2018. He was just recycling Andy's pick from 2018, but it's been too long for me to
[02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:52.720]   tell people because you should know about Libby because it matters for all of you. Libby is an
[02:05:52.720 --> 02:05:58.880]   iPhone app, iPhone iPad app that is a front end to Overdrive, which is the system that most
[02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:05.920]   public libraries use to let you borrow ebooks. And this is a thing a lot of people don't even know
[02:06:05.920 --> 02:06:11.040]   that they're like, "Oh, I only read ebooks. My library is irrelevant." It's not. Most libraries
[02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:15.280]   have support for Overdrive, which means you can check out a book, you can get in line and
[02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:20.880]   your books. And yes, not only can you check out a book and send it to your e-reader,
[02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:26.800]   but it's got audio books too. And it's an audiobook player, full featured audiobook player,
[02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:30.640]   so you can play it in the car when you're taking a walk or whenever you listen to audiobooks.
[02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:37.200]   The experience in the US, it's actually really great because it's got a Send to Kindle. If you're
[02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:43.360]   using a Kindle, I use Kobo e-readers. They work all over the world with Libby because they are
[02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:47.440]   integrated with Overdrive. They're like a partner. Yeah. My understanding is that, and they used to
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:52.160]   be the same company. Kindle, I think, integration is only in the US, so be warned. But if you have a
[02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:56.080]   Kobo, Kobo's are awesome. By the way, I got a Kobo's for Libby. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:06:56.080 --> 02:07:00.160]   Yeah. And a Sonoma County library card. And the other thing I'll point out is,
[02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:04.960]   even if you go to your local library and you're disappointed, they don't have Overdrive or whatever,
[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:09.600]   you would be surprised. Check around other libraries in your area, because, for example,
[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:13.600]   if you're a resident of the state of Massachusetts, you can get a Boston Public Library card.
[02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:17.920]   If you are a resident of the state of California, you can get a San Francisco Public Library card.
[02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:22.320]   You may be able to get, and also your library may have reciprocal arrangements with other
[02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:28.000]   libraries that you can put into Libby and search through those and find the book wherever it's
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:32.640]   available or available the soonest. Anyway, and it's got a nice interface where you basically,
[02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:37.360]   if you have to get in line, it sends you a push notification when your book is ready. You can
[02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:42.080]   defer. If you're like, "Oh, no, I'm already reading something," you can say, "Let me know in 20 days,"
[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:46.160]   and then you just stay at the head of the line, which is really nice. A lot of good stuff,
[02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:52.720]   great for audiobooks. Highly recommend if you are a reader or a listener, your local library
[02:07:52.720 --> 02:07:58.320]   is going to give you access to stuff that you had no idea existed in Libby. Libby is a great way
[02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:05.200]   to do it. Check it out. It's free from Overdrive. Very good. I love it. And it has dramatically
[02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:09.440]   increased my wife as a librarian. She's always like, "You want me to bring you a paper book home?"
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:14.800]   And I'm like, "No. No, I'm done with that. I've moved on in my life. But now I use Libby all the
[02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:20.240]   time and I'm reading lots of library books on my co-book." It worked for me. I agree with you 100%.
[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:27.920]   It's a great way to get a unlimited amount of content. It's still checking it out from the
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:32.720]   library. It's like getting a library book, right? Yeah. You have 21 days and if somebody's waiting
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:38.080]   for it, if nobody's waiting for it, you can renew. It works really well. It's great.
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:43.040]   Libby, Overdrive.com, or get a COBO.
[02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:51.520]   Just check it out right from your COBO. Yeah. That is it for MacBreak Weekly. Thank you, Jason,
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:57.040]   for giving us your first person hands-on perspective on the Vision Pro. I really appreciate it.
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:09:04.640]   Next week, we'll do Mac OS Sonoma OS 17 for iPad and iPhone. I think there's some really interesting
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:09.280]   features in there. We can talk about that. Of course, all the Apple news, Jason Snell is at
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:14.160]   sixcolors.com. If you can't wait till next Tuesday, he's there all week long.
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:19.680]   I am there all week long. I won't be here next Tuesday because my daughter's graduating from college.
[02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:23.680]   Congratulations. I will be here. Sorry about that. They put it on a Tuesday,
[02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:27.200]   literally during MacBreak Weekly. That's hysterical. Are you going to go to?
[02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:30.880]   Yeah, yeah. Going up to Oregon for that. So that's going to be great.
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:35.840]   But yes, I will be writing lots of things on sixcolors. We'll be talking. We have all
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:39.040]   summer to talk about those things, too. I'm sure we'll keep talking about them.
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:43.920]   You also have an M2 Ultra Mac Studio review right now on sixcolors, which is definitely worth
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:49.040]   checking out. How do you write a review about something that didn't change very much? Well,
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:53.920]   you try. Yeah. I've been reading all the 15-inch MacBook Air reviews. It's like,
[02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:58.560]   well, it's bigger. It's bigger. Yeah. It's bigger. The screen's 15 years.
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:04.800]   And as you say, sometimes bigger is better. So this is better. Sixcolors.com/json.
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:09.200]   He does a lot of podcasts, all of them wonderful. Including this one.
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:16.240]   Well, this one is one of them. One of them. There's a six-colors podcast that's
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:23.200]   incomparable. Tuesday. I bet you upgrade with Mike Hurley was pretty interesting after you both
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:30.880]   tried the vision. Yeah. We did that episode in my office yesterday. We both got to kind of exchange
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:33.440]   our experiences with that. Well, that's right. Because Mike's normally in the UK.
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:37.200]   That's right. But he was here for WWDC. That's awesome. He was sticking around.
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:42.560]   Fantastic. Awesome. Mr. Andy Naco, AI for the rest of us.
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:49.920]   Where can you go and be on GBH next? Well, unless Trump gets indicted again,
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:53.600]   sometimes next, sometime next week. Do you keep getting pushed off for Trump and
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:59.600]   this is the second time I've been bumped because of Donald Trump being indicted for something.
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:04.560]   It was supposed to be on last Friday. And of course, the indictments got
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:09.680]   broke on Thursday night. I'm like, you know what? I'm going to continue to write up everything I'm
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:13.760]   going to need for tomorrow. But I don't think I'm going to have a feeling. Is this? Yeah. Yeah.
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:19.520]   So they might be able to get me back on Thursday. Definitely going to be on a week from Friday at
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:26.160]   12, 5th, 1245 PM at the Boston Public Library. So go to wgphnews.org to watch it live or later.
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:32.400]   Very nice. Office Hours.Global is where you will find our good friend Alex Lindsey
[02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:37.120]   really full of great information. What are you working on this week?
[02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:44.080]   No, it's a busy week. As always, but there, you know, we've been really working on improving
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:47.440]   the, you know, every, every second hour we had, we talked about trademark law yesterday,
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:51.840]   incredible attorney interest gain, answered our questions about copyright and trademark and
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:55.680]   understanding what those things are. We talked about 3D printing this morning, kind of an intro
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:11:59.440]   to 3D printing to get people. We're going to be talking a lot about that over the summer and into
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:06.160]   the fall. Gain staging, the incredible subject of gain staging is tomorrow. So this kind of gives
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:10.320]   you the minutia that we get into. And then we covered Cinegir about a week and a half ago.
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:14.560]   We're going to talk about that on Thursday and what we did in live use and cameras and stuff like
[02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:22.160]   that, how Office Hours actually works. There's a huge machine on the back end that makes Office
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:25.200]   Hours work. So we're going to talk about that on Friday with the team. And then finally,
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:32.800]   we're kicking off our disabilities, our disability or accessibility focused series. So there'll be
[02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:38.560]   seven weeks of talking about disability awareness in etiquette as the first one. But we're not only
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:42.800]   talking about accessibility, but we're also experimenting with it. So you'll see us putting ASL
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:47.120]   into the show and we're going to be working with captions and working with a lot of other things.
[02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:53.200]   So we're using it as kind of a lab on how to actually produce a show that is fully accessible,
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:57.200]   as well as talking about those subject matters. And it's usually when we do education,
[02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:02.720]   education takes the summer off, the teachers take the summer off. And so we're moving to
[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:06.480]   accessibility for the next seven weeks and so Saturdays will be really interesting.
[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:10.720]   That's really good. I think that's a great idea. Lots of good stuff this week.
[02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:15.040]   Office Hours.global if you want to hire Alex for your next event,
[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:22.880]   090.media is his his biz. Thank you, Alex. Thank you, Andy. Thank you, Jason. Good.
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:29.040]   Congratulations on your daughter, Jason. That's wonderful. One less tuition check is always nice.
[02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:39.200]   Yeah. I remember that. My daughter delivers her thesis defense for her masters on Saturday.
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:44.720]   And I think that will be the last tuition check. We'll see. You never know. She's
[02:13:44.720 --> 02:13:49.920]   hitting about getting a PhD, which would be funny to call it Dr. Abby. I think that would be fun.
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:55.520]   Maybe there'll be more. Tell your children. Think of all the dad jokes, though.
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:14:00.480]   Dr. Dr. Herts, when I do this, don't do that, dad. Come on, let's just order her.
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:08.000]   Oh, she needs no encouragement on that regard. Thanks for joining us, everybody. We do Mac
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:13.680]   break weekly on Tuesdays, 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern 1800 UTC. Next week, I guess I'll have
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:18.720]   a 15 inch MacBook Pro to show you. I was hoping I'd have it for today. MacBook Air, I'm sorry.

[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:46.080]   all that. What you may not know is that twit now is a show dedicated to it, the untitled Linux
