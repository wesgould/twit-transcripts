[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.640]   Welcome to Mac Break Weekly and
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.200]   We just completed an hour and a half
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.360]   Announcement for the iPad and if you're just tuning in no not the iPad one not the iPad to the iPad
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.680]   Ryan Block was at the announcement from GD GT calm and he's right now in the demo room Ryan can you hear me?
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.840]   Yeah, hey, you hear me? Yes. So are you looking wait a minute is this it?
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.960]   This is it right? There's a wire in the way, but if you can move that wire out of the way
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:05.920]   So a little bit better set the scene for us first of all you're the first you're seeing this written display in person. What do you think?
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:14.000]   It's pretty outstanding. I mean, you know if you've seen a written display, you know how big a difference
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.520]   or she's like regular kind of you know work it a
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.520]   Plan look at that you see that all right. Yeah, of course
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:33.520]   And yet it still looks fantastic, which is pretty amazing. Yeah, yeah, it's it's pretty amazing
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.960]   Does this photos on it? Yeah, I'm asking our friend. Yeah, oh look at that
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.960]   That's what it's here
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:52.800]   Yeah, it gets really sharp
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.080]   It's it's a little bit heavier than the previous in previous iPad that had to
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.960]   But it doesn't really look significantly thicker. It's like maybe a millimeter or something like that
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.960]   And they still I noticed have a smart cover. So the smart cover still works just fine
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.720]   We thought it would but that confrides it. Yeah, I couldn't get a firm answer on whether the previous smart cover still work
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.320]   but it really looks very similar I can't imagine it's
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:30.720]   What can I show you guys? What do you want to see it feels pretty snappy? Do they have it was an iPhoto?
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.720]   We were looking at the new iPhoto
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.760]   That was just the photos app is iPhoto one here? It sure is
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.400]   Okay, it's too again. Here we go. There's a journal
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:50.480]   So i'm going to do a little so you can buzz around rearrange them resize them too. Wow, look at that. Oh my goodness
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.440]   Now that's that's where you're seeing some processing power
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.040]   Well like this map just tiny little map is just like so crisp
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.000]   Yeah, there you go. You can make it larger
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Wow
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.280]   Wow
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.680]   We're talking to ryan block of gdt guy
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.280]   He's at the demo session right now
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.920]   This photo looks like
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.680]   Oh glossy print. I mean it doesn't look like a screen. It looks like a real photo
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.960]   That's pretty crazy. Take a touch it. Yeah. Wow
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.160]   Look at that
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.800]   It's like a shoebox and photos. Yeah, significantly
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.840]   A faster. I mean the the instant rendering of those images as you scroll up is a really good test of a processor's case filming
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.160]   And it's faster and it's sitting on top of something that's the resolutions four times as many pixels. I think that's the price
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.280]   Of course you needed that
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.680]   Does it
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.160]   Yeah, let's look at some text. I don't know if we'll be able to pick this up, but
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.920]   Wow
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.400]   Wow
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.840]   Holy
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.960]   Come only there's no aliasing. There's no artifacting
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.400]   Uh, that's a that's a 300. That's a hundred. What is it?
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.400]   223 dpi does it feel any naco asked ryan? Does it feel warm on the back with all that work you've been doing?
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.040]   Um, it's
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.400]   I know why but you know, it's also being manhandled by a lot of people myself included
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.840]   So
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.200]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's I think it's gonna be hard to know for sure
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.040]   Right
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.520]   Until we actually get one to play with ryan. I want to thank you so much for giving us the first look
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.640]   Uh, yeah, take a picture. Let's just let's just take a picture
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.880]   All right, let's make this make this really meta here. Hold on. Oh, yeah. All right. Here we go. Picture of the picture
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.920]   Oh, yeah, thank you
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:56.160]   There it is and you saw the face recognition at work too there it immediately saw ryan's face with all those other people around there
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.840]   That's pretty good ryan block gd gt.com. Thank you for a first hands on
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.320]   Uh, the new ipad. Thank you ryan. Yeah, thanks guys. Have a good one. Take care
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.160]   Well, it's very exciting. Let's talk to our panel. We've got Andy and not co joining us from a chicago sun times
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.680]   he's still in
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.600]   in boston also sera laine
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.320]   from tnt and ipad today
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:24.160]   and of course andy i'm sorry alex lensy from the pixel core and mac break weekly mac break weekly is on the air and uh
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.520]   Very interesting with the one person we haven't heard from yet because we've been covering this for since nine am
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.080]   Is you andy and akko your thoughts?
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.360]   Uh very big deal also. I think it's so
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:43.200]   I won't call it an aggressive move, but I think it's a clear move where uh apple is making a very clear statement that they are
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.840]   establishing the ipad as a
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.840]   Challenge to every notebook that's out there
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.600]   Uh that this is not going to be in it
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.840]   This is not designed to be an accessory to anything
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.640]   Uh that the next time that you have a few hundred bucks in your budget for a brand new notebook computer
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.720]   Uh, why are you even considering getting something that folds up like this and has a keyboard?
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.800]   Uh, why aren't you considering getting an ipad and I think that interestingly enough
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.480]   They extended that challenge even to people who might be considering a macbook as their next device
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.600]   So I this is this is setting up to be a really cool
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.720]   Really cool challenge here. What what is what is i photo except for the statement that?
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:26.160]   Why would you want to ever take a photo out of this device to put it onto a desktop for editing i movie the way they expanded it for
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.120]   Obviously the fact they put in a 1080
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.800]   HD video cameraman that they're they're going to be beefing up iMovie
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.200]   But they beefed up iMovie to also the extent where you can do shot lists you can do outlines
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.720]   You can really organize your entire shoot before you've actually start walking around with this plate of glass in front of you
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.560]   Again, the message is why would you ever want to take this video off of this ipad for editing when you've got a wonderful video
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.560]   Editor right on board so i
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:56.400]   It's i got to say that i've usually been the guy who said that oh mac OS has a wonderful future
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.360]   It will never it will never be diminished it will never be discontinued
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:06.720]   I don't think that it's going to be discontinued, but this is i think this was a shot across the bow of every person who is
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:14.400]   Manufacturing notebook computers and that would include also our oddly enough apple itself apple began or tim cook began this
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:22.320]   Presentation saying post pc four or five times. I mean, you know, I thought hd was going to be the big story
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:28.000]   But I think you hit the nail on the head Andy they're now saying this is your device. This is it. This is your computer
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.320]   It can do everything you want to do
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.120]   Uh, you know, it's a content creation device
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:40.080]   Anybody's great content of this device. Yeah, all this thing was getting when tim cook was now including
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.920]   iPhones and ipad touches as post pc devices
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.400]   To me felt like a bit of a reach because the ipad is clearly post pc
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.760]   The handheld devices are just nicer versions of something that we've had for five or ten years
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.720]   But I think that there's a i do feel like a cia analyst who's
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.760]   Was watching like the live satellite transmission of a politburo like announcement say okay
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.240]   He's wearing the pin on his left pin right and now
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.240]   Assistant who used to be standing next to him is now two people away from him now
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.400]   He's gonna standing closer to the military governor of this. Oh, what what do we get?
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.800]   Sarah lain. I think we I think this is
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:22.800]   Pretty much in every respect what the rumor mill said it was going to be with the exception of the name
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   Is just an ipad? I I will say I I think we're all really surprised by that
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.040]   Nobody predicted that it would just be ipad the new ipad
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.960]   um, there was a lot of ipad HD didn't sound quite right ipad 3. I thought that's what it would be but
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:46.320]   There was enough buzz before the event that ipad 3 wasn't that didn't make sense either
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:52.000]   I guess it's just uh, you know, we had we had a prediction in our in our live coverage that just ended
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   That maybe it's because there might be some truth to there being a smaller ipad in the future
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.520]   And then you don't want ipad 3 and then ipad 3 mini
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:08.000]   You would have ipad and whatever the new version is right that just makes more sense as a naming convention
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.920]   Yeah, I think that's the only way to make sense of it because otherwise it just seems it's
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.400]   Unless you unless you say hey, they don't they don't have names for the macbook line
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:22.320]   Well, it's confusing because there are still selling an ipad 2 for 399 for 100 bucks less
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.120]   That's the weird part
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.040]   So it's that's that's the only part that seems confusing from a marketing point of view
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:33.200]   Just calling it the ipad is a statement. It's saying you want an ipad get the ipad
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.720]   But when you have two of them, it's not as clear. It's a very strange like a whole lot of peter gabry levels
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.720]   Also, if they stop naming ipads, are they gonna stop naming iPhones?
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.720]   Interesting is there gonna be an iphone five interesting
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.080]   But I think it's different because I don't think they're gonna make a different kind of ipad
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.120]   iPhone I mean the iphone is kind of it seems like they've they've found they found a form factor that they're gonna like I do I do
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.360]   Buy into the idea that they're gonna there's gonna be another ipad
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.280]   I think that there is a form factor between the seven a seven that makes sense in it
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.360]   I mean whether we see it or not this year
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:11.680]   All right, we're gonna I want to come back and ask all of you if there were something you thought that they would announce that they did not announce
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:17.360]   We also want to talk about the apple tv. It's funny. They kind of skimmed right through it and i'm not clear exactly
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.480]   Uh, what what is new on the apple tv? You're watching mac break weekly saryllene
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.320]   Andi and ako alex lindsey leo loport talking about obviously
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.320]   The big apple story of this week this month
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:38.160]   Possibly even this year and I think you could even say perhaps the biggest and most important story in technology for at least some time to come
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.200]   This is um, I I feel the same way about seeing this that I did about seeing the first ipad
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:50.960]   Um, I think this is a breakthrough in terms of a po it truly is now a post but you could say it was a little bit of a stretch
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.600]   To say you could use the ipad one or two for everything. I think this is now pretty close to a post pc
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.800]   We're only when you look at having a bluetooth keyboard for those people want to tell you
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:04.800]   But they're adding dictation and they're talking about that and that's obviously a direct assault on against the against the keyboard
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.560]   Well, you know, I
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.000]   I'm on the committee trying to decide what to buy for the high school
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.280]   You know, they all got mac books when they matriculated for four years
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.320]   It was a one-to-one laptop program many schools now do this
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.800]   And uh, they've mapped will discontinue to the white mac book and we were in a little bit of a crisis mode
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.800]   Like well, what do we replace it with an air?
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.080]   Is an ipad enough? I think now it's very clear the ipad is enough this new ipad is enough
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.440]   This is this is for these students. This is going to be their next one-to-one
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:38.240]   Program there there it is on the apple site apple store has reopened for those of you who want to order but good luck getting in
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.520]   I'm trying
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.960]   I will buy as many as I can up there it is and in fact the
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.200]   Uh, the availability you can pre-order now apparently
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.160]   If I look at this they say new ipad from
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.360]   399 so maybe that's what they're saying
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.280]   You know, that is more like the mac book. They're not going to call it the ipad too
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.760]   Right, it's just it's the ipad from
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:05.840]   399 just like the mac book pro you get a low end one or I and one that makes sense
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.880]   All right, I think we've parsed that enough. We're gonna come back with more
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.720]   I'm gonna be ordering an ipad while I do this commercial so I hope I don't sound too distracted
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:18.800]   This is partially show brought to you by by the way go to meeting works great on an ipad
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.520]   Go to meeting is the way to have meetings going forward. It's a simple online meeting service
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.760]   They've always had great screen sharing and now they have hd video conferencing
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.880]   Which means you can see the people you're meeting with you can see your clients your colleagues
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:39.520]   You can get more done faster. I just think this is a great way to you know business is about personal relationships
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.520]   But we're all distributed around the world these days
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:46.320]   What a great way to make it much more personal with the hd faces from citrix
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.960]   See attendees eye to eye
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.040]   You build trust build conference great for product reviews demos. We just use it the
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:59.680]   To look at the new website for the tech guy labs website a couple of days ago product reviews demo sales presentations training
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.160]   We use it for our weekly status meetings
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:08.240]   You can try it free right now 30 days of unlimited use as many meetings as you want as long as you want for 30 whole days
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.000]   Visit go to meeting.com use the offer code mac break
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.800]   Yes, it works on the ipad it works on the I think they've got iphone as well for this and of course of on your mac and your
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.960]   PC it's really exciting and I would love now that we've got this great hd camera and the capability on the ipad
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.040]   I bet you citrix updates that go to meeting that
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.360]   support giving because right now you have to have a mac or pc to
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.840]   Pretty have the video
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:40.080]   Wow, would that be cool? Yeah, go to meeting.com use the offer code mac break. We thank you for the support
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:45.840]   Do you like this can you get the shot of uh all the max here? We've got uh the original the classic
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.800]   Uh the se 30 and a 25 and of 25 anniversary
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.180]   I think the shell at least for my two e is is at home and my parents have a
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:59.120]   I just bring the shell. We don't need the these are all working. I think and there's also a newtner to study an ipad
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:05.920]   Original ipad stuck in so we've decided to miss to dress the set with all the uh, but I think this is hall obsolete
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.960]   And yes, those are obsolete
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.960]   I just just get here wondering
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.840]   I'm telling you everything up there. Can't they do
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.360]   Obviously all right pre-order the stunning retina display five megapixel
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:23.920]   Uh ultra fast for ge starting order and after delivery march 16th limited quantities. Okay. Let's see if we can get one
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.400]   Let's see if we can get one. Should we try this? I can't get in. I can't get any either. It's really slow
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.920]   I can't believe you did
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:37.120]   Well, i'm only here. I think the question is how many can apple actually sell they were we the rumors were strong that they were making these in
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.680]   November of last year and boy
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:45.440]   When you see how many countries they're going to sell to make this available in a dozen countries right now
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.520]   currently, yeah, so by by
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:54.480]   What predictions do we have by the 18th or 19th the monday after it goes out?
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.360]   How many have they sold in 24 hours? No, no, no
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:03.440]   Including pre-orders for a week by the 20th or or 9 15 million 15 million. I want to say 20
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.880]   They did eight the for uh, didn't they end up last time for ipad 2 for the first week. I think they did eight
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.440]   I may be wrong chatroom. Correct me. Let's find out
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.360]   There'll be two by the way, you're absolutely right ae io you says in our chat room
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:20.080]   They're gonna have two for every country two for england two for hong kong two for canada
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:26.000]   That's that's how we do it and then the rest go to by the night. Yeah by the 19th. Let's say i'm gonna say
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.160]   19 and a half million 19 and a half million. I say 15
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.880]   Andy do you want to weigh in on this a little wager?
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:38.480]   Oh, he said that it 15.5 million ipads the last quarter alone, right?
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.760]   This is a this is a brand new thing that people have been holding off for i'm gonna say
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:48.320]   More than nine less than ten. Okay, so and he's on the low end nine to ten. I'm 15 you're almost
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.440]   20
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.840]   But by the 20th you want to get in on this? Yeah, we're talking the first the first uh, so after
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:59.280]   the pre-order after the pre-order and after the first weekend weekend of say okay the monday following the weekend, right?
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.440]   What's our high?
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.440]   19 and a half 19 and a half
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.440]   19.6
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:10.960]   Well, exactly i i think 20 is high but i'll say 20. Why not?
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.400]   Given that they sold remember 15 million in three months
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.280]   In uh in the last quarter
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:23.360]   Took a five million a month. Yeah, even knowing that obviously there'd be a refresh on the question is whether they actually had made that many
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.160]   You know by now. Yeah
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.880]   Well, what is the profit margin on these do we know?
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.440]   A lot. Is it a lot?
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.680]   Yeah, I think it's um they could sell it for less. I think it's a hundred and twenty dollars in the last stat
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.720]   I saw so when you see a little less of this one if they that would say something about why they're selling the original or the ipad
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.520]   Two for three ninety nine that would be still a fifty dollar
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.720]   or
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:53.680]   This morning about whether apple would this would consider dropping the having one ipad but dropping the price on it and taking a slightly lower margin on it
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.280]   Uh, I really did think that it was gonna be no they'd much rather
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:03.520]   Fill it. I think philosophically they'd much rather protect their their high margins and then introduce a drop of price on a previous product
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.680]   That doesn't seem to quite so much of a value add
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:10.960]   Any where's there anything that you were hoping to see in this announcement that you did not see
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.000]   Not uh, there was
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.200]   This is this seems to be the year that everyone's complaining that people pretty much knew what was gonna be announced beforehand
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:25.760]   Uh glossing over the fact that yeah, but what's been announced is really really cool. I mean you you get you get a double rus solution display
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.600]   That's bigger. That's better than the display. I've got you know my my Mac book here or in terms of actual screen acreage
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:37.760]   They they were a little bit fluffy on the details of the cpu and how fast it worked overall
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:42.160]   That's gonna be interesting to test out. It's gonna be interesting to get some real world tests on the battery
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.680]   I don't think anybody was doubting that they would make sure that whatever they did with the screen whatever they did with the radio
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:52.000]   It wouldn't affect battery life and they they're sticking to 10 hours of overall battery life
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.480]   Nine hours for using mobile broadband
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:19:01.040]   Uh, so no, there's nothing to be disappointed with the iPhoto was a nice surprise the updates to iMovie also a very nice surprise
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.840]   Uh, so I can't I've I've been
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:09.600]   Alternately over the past hour and I have asking iTunes why are you lying to me and saying that there's no ios
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:15.440]   You like me and saying there's no iPhone app. I've been just told by the big man that that they're there
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.240]   Uh, because yeah, I think iPhoto is gonna be an interesting interesting
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:25.520]   It is string arrival given that there's so many really good photo editing apps are already in the app store
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.360]   So this is apple
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:34.800]   I I really does seem as though they're saying that this none of the other apps there can hold a candle to what a truly native born ipad app
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:40.240]   That's designed to do everything that anybody could ever want to do and not ever thinking that you're gonna be exporting photos to
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:46.160]   Photoshop elements or even desktop iPhoto. That's a really cool statement. They're making it
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:52.720]   I can't wait to see what the next it makes you wonder what the next iteration of the iWork apps are gonna be because we haven't had a really major update
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.960]   Of those in quite a while
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:59.440]   Any either of you are surprised by anything that you know, I thought we'd hear about syri
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:04.640]   Yeah, they didn't they it was a little confusing at first. They started talking about voice dictation
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.000]   Which is still using syri. It's like a syri light so you're not
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.640]   It's not nuance
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.880]   I believe you're still outside. It's still server side server side. So still gonna put some pressure on it, but not as much
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.120]   I think that the problem right now is I know that I still have problems where I'm because I use syri pretty
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.600]   I find it frustrating because I'll dictate a few sentences and then it just comes back with nothing
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:28.080]   Right and that happens way too much for me and in fact, I've stopped using it because it's just not reliable enough
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:34.160]   I'm sure that's why apple didn't put syri on this new ipad because there's just no way they could
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:39.840]   Uh supported but I'd like this talking is the new typing and I think you hit the nail in the head Alex when you said
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:44.560]   This is how they get around the keyboard. This is how they get around the keyboard and when you when you're talking about schools
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.560]   I really think
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.600]   When I look at my kids who are my younger kids who are two and four
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.720]   Uh, I don't think they're gonna know how to type
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.480]   Yeah, like I don't think I think by the by the time that they turn 10 when that becomes something that people start talking about
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.760]   And I don't think they'll write very well. I think I think that you know, I can't what old people do
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.240]   I tried to write I tried to do cursive like a week ago. I couldn't do it. It hurt my hand
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:14.160]   It hurts it hurts. The muscles are gone, you know to do that for a long time in the in the evolution of personal
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.600]   Computing
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.120]   Hardware was desperately trying to keep up with these graphical user interfaces
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:24.080]   You know when from a text interface to a graphical user interface finally hardware did catch up
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:30.560]   We our processors are so fast that no GUI is bogged down at all and I was I I've been thinking a lot about well
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.560]   What's the next thing you do?
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:38.560]   Because and ultimately you do want to drive hardware by by making software demand more of it
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:43.280]   What's the next user interface? Are we just going to have keyboards mice and windows forever?
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.800]   And I think apple has answered that I think the mouse is gone. You've got touch clearly superior
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.240]   I think the keyboard might be going away. You've got voice
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.280]   Maybe not clearly superior yet, but as it gets better
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.240]   It could be clearly superior
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.880]   And windows this is what a big surprise to me
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:07.120]   Windowing and in some ways multitasking is gone because it turns out and I find this myself with lion
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.200]   On a desktop that it's easier to do apps full screen
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.720]   It's nice to context switch and I think that's something that maybe the
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:20.480]   iPad OS and six can can respond to the idea of sliding from a full screen to a full screen
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.560]   That's the thing by the way
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:28.720]   Going to a school that I have I do say you know a lot of times a student will have a website open and a word processor open
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.080]   Then they want to do that side by side you cannot and that's a limitation
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.000]   I think of the iPad right now you cannot do that but once you can swipe context switch
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.360]   I think that goes away. This it's clear
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:44.320]   This is the next generation of computing I think and the more I think about it the more I think
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:49.520]   Anyone who's used Siri regularly in Alex. I know that you probably use it more than I do, but it doesn't always work
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.880]   She
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.560]   It's it's great for certain things, but it's not perfect and that's why it's still in beta
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.520]   They don't want to have a feature that's still in beta
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.360]   When 15 million people buy these iPads and then say this is terrible. I hate it
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.760]   Because they'll all hit it at the same time and they want to play with it and it's gonna be bad enough when they start doing dictation
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.920]   And by the way speaking of hitting it at the same time and he does not agree the uh, okay
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.520]   We'll get to you in a second the uh, I would not want to be an apple sis admin right now
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:18.320]   They are the websites are slammed. This is what you get when you hit the pre-order button
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:23.680]   Uh, that's not what you want to see and that they they only show that because they just really are not
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.840]   In good shape. There are probably there's probably 10 million people right now
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.040]   Trying to load the apple store. Andy. What did you want to say?
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:38.960]   I think it's ridiculous that series kind of I think I think the reason I really do think the reason why siri was not available on the ipad is that
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.640]   On some level it doesn't make sense in the ipad. You don't pick up
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.280]   You don't pick up a tablet and say siri
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.720]   How do I get to the burr the burrito bar from here and then put it back in your bag?
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.920]   Rest and iphone is something you just take out of your pocket. You make these simple requests
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.120]   You put it back down again
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.840]   Well, you could argue that for the camera as well
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.920]   The ipad is not something that you hold up and take a beautiful picture of a mountain vista
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:04.480]   But now you can and it's gonna look pretty good when I think also in an in an iCloud world
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.080]   I kind of just want my experience no matter what device i'm on to be the same
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:11.280]   You know, I just wanted to be you know if I if I am using siri on on one thing
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.160]   I want to be able to use it on all the things and that's the that's the complaint that I have
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:18.640]   I agree and I think series more than just where's the nearest pizza parlor?
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:23.520]   It's make an appointment. It's set a reminder. There's a lot of things that you would do with siri on an ipad
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.160]   Um, uh, I agree. It's not 100
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.840]   But uh, and certainly you get 90 with voice dictation alone
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:35.040]   I mean the ability to talk to my ipad and and type email messages is is I hope it works
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.960]   Well, I I think it really comes down to the the lack of server capacity
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.960]   And you have to wonder why with a hundred billion dollars in the bank couldn't apple just
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:49.360]   Build a lot of surfers. I think that they are. I mean there's a lot of face book scales, uh, google scales
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.440]   It's well known how to do this. It's a little shocking that apple has not figured out
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.680]   I'll argue that what facebook and google i mean, we're not google
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:00.080]   But what facebook's doing is is not as complicated as what series doing. I mean that's that is some heavy
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.520]   Heavy calculations, you know to make that to figure that out from a whole bunch of different accents
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.160]   Which it you know it does to the varying levels of accuracy
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:14.000]   For the point of the back end, it's just data. It's just more servers more capacity that solves the problem
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.240]   Yes, it's sophisticated calculations is doing but you can solve that problem
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:24.800]   And I would I would argue it's a scaling problem exactly like google and facebook and others face. I think apple
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:30.160]   I think apple's cheaping out on us to be honest with you. I think they need to spend some money
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.360]   Uh, they they have closed down the store now. So they obviously realize that they don't want to don't want to do that
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:42.880]   Um, which lte network to choose? I'm grandfathered into unlimited data on atnt would be hard to give that up
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:48.240]   This is this is a question in general. Should you go for a 3g4g
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:53.840]   Uh for $129 more or just wifi and I think that uh
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.840]   It really is a use case. I mean if you spend a lot of time at the airport, maybe
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.920]   I have can't you get wifi everywhere you want? No, I you know, I have to admit my experience
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.080]   I have one iPad the first I got the very first iPad
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:10.640]   And the wifi only and I have to say the experience without 3g is a completely different computer
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.920]   Because it's not just whether you whether there's wifi at the airport or not
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.800]   It's whether the wifi will work and whether you have to log in and whether your SMTP is gonna
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.440]   You know there like there's all these things that that work or don't work
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:26.080]   And it's just I find half the time on an airport half the time I'm somewhere where I have access and I just turn the wifi off
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.240]   I'm like stop. I just want to use my 3g because I want it to work
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.640]   I just want that would be like someone saying who ever needs a myfi
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.480]   I never need it because wifi is always available. It just doesn't work that way
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.080]   No, but you do have an effect on wifi if you have a smartphone with hot spotting
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.160]   Um, I see I think I'm gonna buy the wifi and we'll see but I don't
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.880]   In the past I've used that I have a 3g. I don't think people want that extra bill
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:54.720]   I think most people do have the capability of hot spot with their phone. Right. I suspect that this well, we'll see
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.880]   I don't I'm much more interested in the wifi version
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:03.840]   The other issue of course as you said is well, where is LTE best and that's gonna depend a lot where you live
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.880]   But at and t has LTE and just a handful of cities
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.640]   Horizons over 150 cities. So if it's LTE you want
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.760]   Uh and you travel a lot you rise is an easy
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:19.520]   winner on that one and I I don't know but I think that the capability is roughly the same isn't it speed wise
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:24.640]   It's 80. What did he say 80 megabits? It's fast. It's amazing. Well, that's the theoretical speed, right? Yeah
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.960]   I mean the the big deal is that there's so many radios in this thing no matter what standard you've got
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:34.720]   I'm whatever towel you're connecting to it'll probably find the fastest speed imaginable. Yeah. Yeah, here is a big
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.600]   Other shoe dropping we now apple tv
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:43.200]   Um, they did you know they skim through it and I wasn't sure there is a new apple tv. It's a hobby
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.520]   You know, it's it's the you know, it's not it's not just a software update. It's a new $99
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.080]   But it looks the same. It's still a puck
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.200]   Yes
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:56.000]   Netflix has announced and this I think is the other side of the equation that they are going to have
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.960]   Integrated iTunes sign up on your apple tv. So in the past you've had to go to the Netflix
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.360]   Site, right it will pay via the iTunes account
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:12.400]   And it will be 1080p high def 5 one doleby audio
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:17.520]   So you better damn well have some bandwidth and it better not be with Comcast because that cap will kill you
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:23.920]   Um, but that is this is if you want to know what Netflix was waiting for that's what Netflix was waiting for
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.960]   Tight integration with an apple tv one and I think that
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:31.920]   In this with this other rumor that we saw about catalogs which they didn't talk about at all at this event
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.440]   But they're changing a category
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.800]   There's this interesting thing when you see this integration with the with iTunes that
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.280]   You know apple more and more people just want to order stuff through the you know
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.560]   Do their orders and the question is is how far apple takes that scb is telling us in the chatroom
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:55.120]   That in order to get equivalent battery life on 4g and with that big screen quad quad pixel screen
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:58.340]   They went from I think he said he said 25
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.480]   Milliamp hours to 45 milliamp hours
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:07.760]   So that is significant. This is don't look at that that chat is old. I guess I'm uh
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:16.720]   Someday i'll get a good chat program. Maybe colloquy will solve that problem. We had by the way, uh, oh software updates are available for your
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.600]   computer. I wonder what I wonder what that could be
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.720]   No, okay boring old stuff
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.720]   Damn
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.960]   I want something new
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:34.240]   Apple tv anti what do you think what's going on there? Is this is it still just a hobby?
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:39.600]   Why did he not give it more? Why did he give us a short shrift? I thought hd would be the story across the board
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:45.520]   There's just not much to show they updated the interface to make it a little bit more modern. They added 1080p
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:51.120]   A5 processor in it by the way the old app. I bet two processor, which is probably more than adequate to 1080p
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:58.800]   Extended iTunes in the cloud to the apple tv so photo stream works streaming of a movie purchased movies works
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:03.280]   So you're talking about hammering the bandwidth of apple servers talk about streaming hd without
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.960]   loaded
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:10.000]   Who a local server right that's just a machine that's gonna be pretty interesting and 1080p airplay so
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.440]   um
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.880]   That's intriguing
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.200]   I'm starting to think more of the apple t that says a product and more of just another
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:23.120]   More more of a faucet so to speak where you're not supposed to really pay attention to it or like it as it is
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.520]   You're using you use it only as a way to pipe
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:29.680]   All of those ios features and all of those iCloud features and all your content to a tv
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:35.120]   So I think that maybe apple's thinking that if you are thinking about this as an actual interesting consumer device
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:40.000]   They've probably screwed it up. They really just want to use it as a way more ipads more iPhones and more i
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:44.880]   As camaroni sizzner cherum. It's a dongle. It's just a dongle for your tv
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.160]   right
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:51.440]   And you get nucubase kabec capability one thing i wish though is that there was some way to enforce some some sort of
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.400]   uh
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.840]   integration so that
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.360]   You know, we have a sick we have a four by three ipad and a 16 by nine screen
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.120]   And I kind of want both of them to be the same
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.880]   You know this this like weird thing where if i especially if i mirror my ipad onto it
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:08.000]   I'd love it to go into some mode where it dropped now that you have the resolution you could literally have
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.320]   1920 by 1080 on
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.320]   both both screens
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.560]   effectively the new apple tv will be available next week as well so
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:21.680]   What while you're in the store if you ever get in the store you might as well just buy everything you will too
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.800]   That's the whole thing is that it's only 99. Oh, it's a hobby
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.920]   It's a hobby that makes a lot of money
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.960]   It's gotta be yeah, it's gotta be pretty profitable
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.480]   for him
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.240]   I can't tell you how many times i've
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.120]   wanted to rent a video
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.640]   Or or buy a video whatever uh via
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:44.880]   iTunes and started it on my ipad or meant to you know
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.360]   Maybe I was taking a trip and so I downloaded a bunch of stuff
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:52.880]   And I didn't get to them on the plane and it's so nice just to go airplay and it's next to me on the couch
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.880]   And it's all nice there on my uh
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.360]   I'm a big Samsung TV and now it's gonna look better
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:01.280]   You won't even need to do airplay if you're using the as a tv it'll know you bought it
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.160]   It'll know where you stopped playing it. It'll just start up on the tv
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:09.040]   Um, I think at cloud integration is important. It's again. It's another it's like a utility
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.840]   I think you're right, Andy. It's it's just like having con ed in your uh
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.400]   And this and this integration is what all these
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:21.120]   A lot of these companies are missing when you know they're talking about I think is it 70% or 80% of people or more that
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.320]   internet capability in their tv that never
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:30.560]   Plug it in right which includes me. I mean I have it on my tv and i ios 5.1 is now available
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.200]   if you have an ipad
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.200]   This uh, it's amazing
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:43.760]   Just tapping all my buttons trying to get everything to load it says japanese language support for syri photos can now be deleted from photo stream
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.400]   Thank god. How was that so hard?
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:54.160]   Uh, I think just the apple just doesn't know how uh dirty minded some of us are camera shortcut now
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:33:02.080]   Always available on lock screen for 4s 4 3 gs and ipad touch camera face detection now built into all ios devices
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:07.360]   Um now highlights all detected faces redesigned camera app for ipad
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:12.800]   Genius mixes and genius plays for itune match subscribers audio for tv shows and movie on ipad
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:17.120]   Optimizes how ladder and clear podcast controls for playback speed
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.120]   And a 30 second rewind for ipad for podcasts
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:27.040]   That's good for us if you want to hear it again and again because you always skip back to the the last chapter right?
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:31.040]   To get too far. Yeah address addresses bugs affecting battery life
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.080]   Well, i'm going to download and install it because what the hell
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:39.920]   We pay for enough bandwidth. Yeah, it wants power. I'm 94 charge
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:43.120]   So sarah and i will both download that simultaneously
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:47.120]   Um
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:51.680]   So that's on who gets it first. Yeah, really the apple site itself is pretty snappy now
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:56.960]   I think it's probably the store that is that is dead evidently the store is on another server
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:02.080]   Uh for another handful of well factor. That's what i bet you that's what they did. I bet you they just
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.600]   They said they moved it off. I'm getting to the store. Oh, i'm gonna get one before you
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.520]   Yeah, i'm not sure if this is an improvement or not
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:11.920]   But my copy of itunes have stopped saying that there is no update to be downloaded and start saying i'm sorry
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.920]   I can't contact the store
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:20.000]   I get caught at the update server. I was i was sure this app update would be uh would be that but i guess not
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.840]   During the announcement when they mentioned uh plane uh or or accessing your photos
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:30.240]   On your tv via your apple tv you said well i can already do that
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:35.760]   Right, but now the photo stream is on the apple tv so you just it's an app
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:40.240]   Yeah, in the past you'd have to say i want to use which folder do you want to use for screen sharing
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.120]   Right, so you'd have to set it all up. This is much much much simpler
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:43.520]   Yeah
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:49.360]   And let's talk about software because i think that was uh something that turns out to be very important to this whole story
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:54.720]   uh new iLife uh new apps and uh apps from adobe new gaming
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:35:00.080]   Uh all to support the retina display apple also said that their apps are all going to be retina ready
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.640]   Uh and available as soon as the ipad uh
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:07.600]   New what are we gonna call it is out. Let's take a break though while we're doing that
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:14.240]   Uh, I want to say hello to our friends from smile i bet smile smiling right now they make that great pdf pen app
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.040]   Uh not only for the uh for the mac
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.520]   But they also make it uh for the ipad and i'm sure that smile
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.840]   Has been working on uh double res and everything this is so great
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.160]   In fact you won't have to work too hard because of course pdfs now are going to look spectacular
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:36.320]   So when you get a pdf very often you want to make corrections fill out forms uh if it's a form pdf
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.360]   Uh if it's a fax uh that you have to sign you want to put your signature on there pdf pen
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.680]   I immediately bought it for the ipad just ten dollars on the app store and it's so useful
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:52.160]   You can edit pdfs on your ipad you can change pdfs redact content or annotate content
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.920]   You could fill out an application you can even sign a contract on the go
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:59.440]   I have my signatures and initials in the library. It's fact
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.400]   It's so annoying. I just signed the lease and I have to sign sign sign sign sign
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.400]   I just want to go dumb dumb dumb dumb with a stamp in pdf
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.080]   I just should have just said
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.240]   Send it to me and i'll have i'll do it with pdf pen
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:17.440]   The ipad app now allows you to add text and images and signatures make changes fix typos resize and delete images
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:25.360]   Mark up documents and once you're done you can retrieve and save pdfs directly with dropbox
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.440]   Evernote and google docs isn't that nice?
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:31.200]   It's all of the above it is a fantastic app. I use it all the time
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:36.240]   Such a great job because this is the thing people I get all these contracts for loners and stuff like that that I have to sign in
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.240]   Right and send back and uh
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.880]   And usually I just wouldn't send them back and I wouldn't you know
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.960]   I just wouldn't sort things out because I have to deal with this
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:48.720]   I have to print it out. I have to figure out how to do this and it's just really has taken so much stress on smile software
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.440]   They've been they develop for apple only that's all they've ever done
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.600]   They are they love
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.080]   They love apple and they do great software
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.120]   $9.99
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.320]   $9.99 is a great price smile software.com/macbreak
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.440]   If you want to learn more just go to the app store and download pdf pen
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.160]   For the iPad
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.520]   Finally getting some movies from the apple site. They're showing off
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.120]   I think the thing that they really do just want to show off is this red and display
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:20.160]   And I don't think any movie is going to give you a sense of how good this can look
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.080]   I'll go full screen on it. Maybe that'll look better
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:25.040]   I think once people hold it in their hand, it's just my gut
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:25.760]   Exactly
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:31.600]   They're gonna it's such a big deal that the first thing that you do when you hold this thing for the first time is just look
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:37.440]   at to see how clear and crisp the test that the text is before as before a customer even taps a button
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.080]   Before he launches they launch an app or turn a page
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:45.200]   They see how beautiful this image is and how easiest to read compared with anything else
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.840]   That's gonna sell a lot of product. I think and boy
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:52.640]   It sure puts every other tablet to shame in fact it puts most notebooks to shame
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.040]   I think I think what you're really gonna see
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:38:01.040]   It's gonna be an iPad world 2012 is the in many ways the the year of the iPad
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:05.520]   I know it's hard to believe that 2011 wasn't but I think that this is such
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.800]   It just looks better than any computer
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.560]   This is huge and it's 500 bucks
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:19.200]   I have to I've been kind of moving to where I'm spending more and more time on my iPad and less and less time on my laptops
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:23.120]   And I can definitely see this is this is probably going to be the turning point where I bet
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.080]   More than 50% of my time is gonna be on
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:26.640]   It's funny
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.080]   I for a long time did do
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.600]   I not for a while did that with the iPad and I went back to the MacBook Air because I wanted the keyboard
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.600]   I wanted the functionality
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:34.880]   I don't know. I think that
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.480]   Well the Bluetooth keyboard I might I might be swayed a little bit more
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.200]   I always reached for the MacBook one. I've got a type
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.840]   Yeah, but on the other hand I always try to touch the screen
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:49.280]   That too, you know what I do I try to increase the yeah, let's look at this picture a little closer
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:53.520]   Alex you had mentioned that you thought that they'd talk a little bit more about catalogs
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.480]   I thought you know
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.640]   It's a rumor that people have been noticing about catalogs and so they that there's a new
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:06.560]   Area that's there and in its in its most basic fashion catalogs as a new section is probably an extension of iBooks author
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:12.320]   Which is that I mean if you want to talk about a great format for a catalog, you know interactive book
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:19.360]   Especially on this kind of display is going to be where you want I mean I guess he's skymall or or
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:25.040]   Pottery Barn or any of the lands end putting their app on there now you could have not only you could
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.760]   Uh, not only would you have the pictures?
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:32.560]   But you could have videos and you can have little interactive pieces that you can rotate the shirts around and everything else
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.040]   And so so I I think in its most basic form
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:39.440]   I think just just putting a whole section for cataloging that makes it easy for people to find them
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.280]   I think in the the bigger picture is is once apple has you in a catalog
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.720]   Are they going to offer the ability for you to order?
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:52.640]   Through that catalog on your at iPad, you know, and of course, you know get a little bit of the back end
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:57.040]   Because when you look at the the ease of use and people don't like dealing with their credit card
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.000]   Well and app makers have noticed
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.520]   um and erin wackens wrote me yesterday. I didn't see the email till just now that
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:12.560]   Um, an app he represents called catalog with a ue at the end was changed by apple from lifestyle to catalog
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.080]   Right. They added this category
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:22.240]   So a man getting on a plane and instead of getting a skymall catalog getting an iPad with the skymall catalog on it would pay for itself
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.600]   The program would pay for itself, you know in a month
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:31.520]   Uh, people would buy more uh, it'd be more interactive and when you think of when you think about the things that you can do with a
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.040]   With an interactive guide or an interactive catalog
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.840]   Now you can sit there and open it up and you can get videos
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:42.000]   You can get all kinds of extra information more than you might be able to get at the actual store
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.880]   Let me back up on this because this is the thing that people say art
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:49.440]   Is anybody gonna really do this this guy's at the beach with his daughters and he's videoing them
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.360]   Taking pictures and videoing them with his iPad does this
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:57.840]   Is this they look dorky right now or is this where is this where we're headed?
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.240]   Well video video yet still photos. No
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:06.640]   I think because when he's shooting video, you're already in position where you're taking something out you're holding it for minutes at a time
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.480]   It's not about
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.960]   Putting your pocket take it out of your pocket put it back in your pocket
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:16.400]   Also the fact that you can do so much of that all on board the fact that you never have to like look up a cable
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:20.800]   That's what that's what would get me to stand like a dork at a recital holding up an ipad
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.160]   I think in a year we'll have this discussion and people say well, of course it's completely natural
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.560]   Why did you ever think that was weird?
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.640]   It is where first well
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.400]   I when i 10 years ago or 12 years ago, I remember I was shooting in aquatraz and there was these
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:36.160]   Crazy japanese tourists that were holding their their cameras out in front of them
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:40.720]   I was like, but it is. I was like that is insane, you know and and yeah, I haven't
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.200]   Well, and if you think about hey a family goes to the beach
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:49.680]   You got to pack up a bunch of stuff. Yeah, your ipad is your camera your video camera and all of the books that you want to read
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.880]   You have to be under the umbrella. I guess to be able to read them on the ipad
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:58.720]   But it's all in one let's back up here because I want to talk a little bit about iPhoto. They're demonstrating iPhoto here
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.960]   This is a new app on the ipad
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:04.960]   Um, they've always had photos that was only a gallery
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.760]   This is this really also changes the ipad considerably now cradette
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:16.160]   We saw earlier in the show ryan block playing with the journal, which I hadn't really even seen much of that's always very impressive
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:22.320]   Yep, what did he just do? Let's go back a little bit. Okay. Okay. Alex lindsey is just to explain what we're seeing. Okay
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:28.640]   Just okay. Just do okay. He's got three images. He's not not that version. He'll go to another one
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:33.680]   He'll do something else. Now he's he's he's my favorite. What is this? Oh, I want to make this guy bluer
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.840]   Oh
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.360]   Wait a minute. Yeah, yeah, holy now they they spent some time on this
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:44.000]   We were in the presentation, but they spent some time on this that they have these color swatches
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.120]   Oh
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:47.120]   This is but this is what um
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:54.560]   Adobe's you know photoshop touch that isn't it just doesn't feel like an ipad app and it does not take any advantage of the contextual
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:58.880]   Information and I think that it's actually figuring out that that was a sky and that's what you'd want to do with it
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.680]   Now this is the journal. This is
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.800]   Go ahead. I do think this is partly a message because uh
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.720]   Adobe made it a multi platform version of photoshop and like you said, Alex
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.800]   It doesn't really feel like an iOS app
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:16.560]   Earlier on Steve jobs and one of his keynotes was saying that sometimes when apple releases their own brand of software
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.600]   It's because they want to send a message that this is what is capable
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.080]   This is what you can do with an iOS app
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:26.800]   So if you just want to make a hypercard stack that could be easily ported by a flash
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.120]   Please do not submit your app to us here
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:34.880]   Let's let's go back and do he did it again now if you look at the there's a four-way slider
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:39.760]   We're gonna have to wait till Steve stops talking here. There's a four-way slider. He's at Bryce
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.080]   He's got to the right blue skies
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:45.600]   Up saturation down would be a presumed desaturation
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:49.680]   So he can more saturation or more blue in the sky
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.320]   Oh my god
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:59.360]   That's beautiful. Look at that. This is where you get now the processor the a5x
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:04.160]   dual core dual CPU quad GPU
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:12.960]   And I think that that is also really important. We're not talking about multitasking. We're talking about pushing pixels
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.920]   And a lot of headlands got that wrong quad core CPU
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.560]   Right, so they don't know a lot right away
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:20.480]   But that's the thing that you need the power for I mean
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:25.680]   We've already seen a lot of power with the the current i've had as far as what it can do and we and and with the
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.800]   With that new display that is where you really had to put your money, right is to make sure that it's it's
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:37.680]   An insanely high resolution. I mean most of our computers aren't aren't working at that unless you have a really really like a 27 inch monitor
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.520]   You're not
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:46.800]   You're not going into that. Also looks like apple app advice has noted that uh, they have now bumped up the maximum over
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:51.120]   over um 3g or lte 250 megabytes from 20
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.080]   Now for both verizon and it
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.360]   Uh, well, they say it's within
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:03.520]   With an o s because yeah, of course with the larger display you're gonna have larger larger sized apps in general
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:09.520]   Finally now that the app apple site is up. We can see more about the apple tv as well iTunes movies
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:16.640]   Netflix youtube vimeo those are all these are all here before so that it's a different interface. This is the new
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:22.720]   I've seen that that's not new right? Yeah, that's it. Is that it's cleaned up the interfaces?
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.160]   Yeah, I I already have that on the
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:31.520]   Apple TV if you look at the other stuff the top movies just a little it's just a little bit tweaked
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:36.560]   It's cleaned. Yeah when they showed the apps the actual apps themselves. It looked like a much more
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:41.040]   It wasn't like a bunch of scroll down windows, right? It was actually graphically showing them
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:45.680]   Player content from mac or pc on the big screen
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:51.600]   Um, this is this they've they recently updated this Netflix app and this is the newer Netflix app
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:54.800]   But the idea that you use iTunes to pay for is very interesting
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.280]   That's a good move for netflix isn't it?
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.680]   It also says apple doesn't want to be in that business
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.360]   Let let netflix do this right?
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:07.840]   Well, and I think that the apple tv I think it was a good move for apple to make sure that netflix was on it because that has been what made
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.640]   the apple tv a valuable
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:15.440]   Asset for me because I you know able to have a subscription and have all this so apple didn't get into the subscription business
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.640]   But they let you have an a subscribe business. I think that what they what I'd love to see is
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.080]   You know spotify on on the apple tv
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:27.280]   I think I would probably buy mlb tv. I mean, uh, i'll do it just to see it
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:32.800]   Well, I bought it last year on uh, I think was on netflix and the idea is you pay i can't remember what it's 250 bucks
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:38.560]   And you get every game from both points of view the home and away team in audio and video
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.280]   Are you gonna buy that colin?
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:47.760]   You want to watch your fillies games right for the home the homers the home tv broadcast
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.640]   Yeah, I think this is a
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.920]   Pretty amazing pretty amazing. It wasn't it isn't the the yeah
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:58.880]   This solves the court cutting problem because the problem with court cutting is losing live events like this
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:05.440]   And once so if you can get me, uh, you know live news or uh, you know major events on this you don't need cable and wall street
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:09.840]   Journal starting it's a it was not a very good start, but it was you know, you're starting to do terrible stuff
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.920]   Those stuff they're doing. Yeah
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:17.120]   Um, I would I was surprised bloomberg didn't jump on that one because bloomberg does some very good tv content
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.720]   And they have a great great app for the for the iPad as well
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.880]   So I mean they're they're definitely spending a lot of energy in this area
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:27.520]   Let's just see if the store is open because I yeah, I really want to buy some stuff apple
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:30.880]   I want to give you some money evidently not the only one
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.960]   Help us help you
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:37.200]   Shut up and take my money
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.640]   really, um
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:46.160]   So that's iPhoto very exciting iMovie updated tell me about what's new and iMovie you said I like this and any mention this
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:51.920]   The idea that you plan your movie before you shoot it you have your shot list on iMovie
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:55.200]   Which is the way the way that a lot of us do that
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.000]   But
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.080]   And you don't have it on the camera
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.840]   While you're out there
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:06.960]   Well, and a lot of ways one of the things to think about I think that filmmakers are going to use this for is and we already do this
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.920]   Uh with the iphone and not as much with the ipad though
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:15.680]   Is that you go to a scene if you look at like uh, ramen rudrigas has a great like 10-minute film school at the beginning of one of his movies
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:19.360]   Uh, and he shows himself taking a video camera at that time
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:23.760]   It was like a vx 1000 or whatever and or 2000 and shooting all the scenes
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:26.800]   And so imagine walking into a set that you know that or a location
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:31.840]   And shooting a whole bunch of scenes with a handful of stand-ins and then editing it all together while you're still
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:36.880]   There to make a decision about whether that's what you want to you know use in the film
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.880]   Uh, or this is how I'd want to do it
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:42.080]   And so I think from the from just the filmmaking perspective it'd be it's exciting
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:46.160]   Obviously, it's very exciting if you want to put your put together your own stuff. I can definitely see
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.000]   um
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.720]   A huge push for like those short 48 hour film festivals with your ipad
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:56.640]   Mm, you know where the whole thing is just yeah, you get to go in there with an ipad
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:59.200]   And come out with a movie. I'd be tempted
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.760]   I would be tempted if I had a 40 hour our film festival
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:05.040]   I'd be tempted to do it in the ipad because what you could do is simply you're at the
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:10.240]   You plan the whole thing out and you shoot the scene over and over again editing it in while you're standing there and then okay
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.240]   We got it and then you walk away
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:15.440]   You gotta get a 64 gig
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:19.200]   Of course 16 is not gonna be enough if you're doing all that right, you know me
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.000]   Well, but I mean not just you you would anyway
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.280]   I do think this means buy more memory than in the past
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.760]   The other thing to remember is if you are interested in these interactive books
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:32.080]   And and I think that you're gonna we're not seeing a lot of new interactive books and people keep on thinking about us textbooks
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:34.960]   But there there's gonna be a lot of interactive books and two gigs
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:37.840]   Right now is the max. I bet you that's gonna go up
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.560]   And so you're gonna you're you are gonna fill this up. I would
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:44.400]   If you if there's any way for you to forward it, I would get the 64 gig
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:48.080]   I was one thing I was surprised at as I was very surprised. We didn't see a 128
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:50.720]   128 gig
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:53.440]   iPad I really felt like given the the
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:57.440]   bump up in resolution the interactive book opportunities
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.840]   I thought we'd see something a little bit more memory to hold all of this
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:05.520]   And I think that would diminish they're they're probably gonna be insisting that oh who needs memory you've got iCloud
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:14.160]   Yeah, but it's by cpoint. Yeah, because because sinking sinking your six gig movie over iCloud was not gonna be happy
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:21.120]   It's encouraging that uh ryan block when he was when he was holding that bed said yeah, I mean it's it's a little heavier
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:26.160]   But it's not so much thicker considering that uh people expected it to be I hope my case
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:28.160]   So my cases will still work
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:31.760]   It's it's actually it's actually you almost trivially so i'm scrolling through
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:39.920]   Yeah, it's one millimeter. It's like one millimeter thicker. It's like two tens of a pound higher heavier, right so
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.800]   Ah more software updates available
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:46.320]   iTunes 10.6 is now available a one megabyte
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:52.320]   Download adds the ability to play 1080p HD movies and tv shows so that's a good update to get
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:51:01.120]   Just keep waiting keep waiting for more keep waiting for more we don't even know what we're waiting for apple has put video
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:08.000]   Up of the ipod event apparently according to the twitter verse that was fast. That was very fast
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.320]   Yeah, it's it's right on the uh actually wonder why they don't just stream the damn thing
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:18.000]   Because then they wouldn't have all everybody there blogging and it's that's that's the part of it
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:24.880]   We asked each other that before uh the uh our live coverage started and it's like it does help create the frenzy
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:30.640]   Yeah, it absolutely does. I mean by putting everybody on even footing and making them all compete to get the news out first
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:34.480]   It's it's well designed. Mm-hmm. They're manipulating us. We know
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:40.800]   All right, here's your quest question of the day if you were going to buy an ipad and you you saw in the store an ipad and an ipad
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.800]   too, which one is newer
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.040]   Right are you talking about
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.280]   Yeah
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:48.720]   Yeah, what are they gonna?
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:51.920]   Well, the first gen ipad was called the ipad
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:56.800]   Yeah, so you have to make the distinction between now are you talking ipad or new ipad
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.960]   Where I think to be the new ipad people say again
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.560]   I'm saying a lot of people are you big and be defrauding a lot of people?
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:05.680]   Yeah
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:09.760]   I was surprised they didn't see that even in the slide that didn't even capitalize new ipad
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:13.760]   But that's that's the consistent phrase that they're using time and time again
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:18.720]   So it made me wonder before I saw it on the store whether or not that was actually the name of the thing the new ipad
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:24.320]   I guess if the end was capitalized then the official name would be new ipad, but it wasn't
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:29.680]   And then the next one will be newer it's and then no, it's an ipad to make us have this conversation
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:33.280]   Yes, it's ipad. That's it. It's ipad
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:38.480]   Uh, and I think it is I think when you go to buy it anywhere, but ebay
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:43.840]   You'll buy an ipad and the lesser the 399 one just has a slower processor
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.960]   Lower resolution screen the 499 one has better
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:50.640]   We're gonna take a break come back talk more about what is new
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:55.280]   Lots to talk about apples big ipad announcement today
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.720]   iPads are on sale if you can get into the apple store you can pre-order
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:05.520]   And they'll be available march 16th and that does make a lot of sense since they're opening new stores in houston and london on that day
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:13.360]   That'll be quite an open busy day. It'll be worth going to houston for that or london or london. Hmm. Which one huh? I say london
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:21.200]   Right now though. I want to talk a little bit about audible.com. You know audible of course works great with your old ipad

[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:03.360]   sci-fi used to be uh, I have to say a gap on uh

[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:19.600]   But it is available. Well, you could say that about harry potter too and yeah, i love it
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:22.960]   Yeah, yeah, i haven't i haven't read it, but i'm looking forward to reading it
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:27.120]   I always like to read the books before the movie comes out. What are you reading these days? Andy?
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.280]   Uh
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:34.400]   Actually, i'm still i'm a little bit backlog because of it. There's been too much. There's been too much news
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:39.040]   I've had someone recommended me an interesting book with the most interesting sort of recommendation
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.160]   It's called
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:46.320]   I scry scroll it back up here. It's called the jejewick guy to almost everything a spirituality for real life. Wow and
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:51.680]   And he's saying I want you'll find about 40% of this really cool
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:55:00.320]   20 20% of it interesting you will disagree with about 25% of it and there's 15% I can't classify it is a
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.920]   uh
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:08.880]   Jesuit who's sort of trying to explain like the Jesuit way of life and basically how you can apply these basic ideals just to daily existence
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:15.840]   Uh, I can't speak for it myself, but the person who recommended this to me has recommended two books in the past five years that i've really really liked
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:20.640]   uh, he's a way he's a guy who put me on a project of uh, uh, operation mince meat by the way
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:26.000]   Uh, so I don't know what this means. Uh, I've I've listened to I did download it
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.280]   I listened to like part of the first chapter. It sounds a lot like
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:37.760]   He could either be here's exposure to a different set of ideas that might let you bring clarity to how you see the world
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:45.440]   And how you approach everything or it could be this person really believes in what he believes in and he really thinks that you should believe it too
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.880]   Yes, my dad used to call the Jesuits gods marines
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:54.640]   Yeah, there no I I I had two Jesuits teachers and they're the coolest teachers ever
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:59.360]   Probably because whenever whenever I was having obviously I would hear a sermon like on a sunday
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:03.760]   I talked to I talked to like this teacher about it like on tuesday and they say okay
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:08.240]   Here is what you really need to understand about that parable. It's mostly made up
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:17.040]   Uh interesting that I might have to get this book that does sound uh very very interesting dad went to regis and fordham
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:21.280]   So you know a little bit about the Jesuits, uh, if you want to get this book or any
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:27.440]   Uh single credit book free you can right now go audible.com slash mac break download it and enjoy
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:30.080]   It is nothing like having an audible book
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:35.680]   I've been uh, I didn't my cable isn't connected yet, but you know what I didn't even mind because I've been listening to game of thrones
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:39.520]   I'm trying desperately to get through clash of kings before it comes out on hbo
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.360]   And i've literally been listening for five or six hours each day
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:51.520]   I maybe not I maybe I won't get a cable hook hook up. I'm loving it. I have to say audible.com slash mac break try it today
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.760]   So something really weird just happened to colin's
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:56.560]   Colin weirs uh phone
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:03.120]   I guess we have forg now in petaluma is that is your phone doing that? Well, i'm on verizon you said
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:06.240]   Get up this far into these firsts
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:08.640]   Right colin did you just update it?
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:16.000]   He updated to five one and he's now got forg sneak, um, which just made a decision for me on which I bet i'm like
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   We aren't lucky enough. We live in cow country. We know we usually get uh big advances like that
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.760]   Uh, well, what if I what about the back hat to rise and this is a verizon?
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:31.680]   So i'll i'll let you know be interesting it wouldn't it if all of a sudden verizon said forg to yeah, the update is almost
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:34.240]   Half i think you said you had a wi-fi only
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:38.320]   Uh, no, no, this one's verizon. Okay. I'm saying i think i'm gonna get wi-fi next time
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:42.480]   You're crazy. Well, it's my money. That's true
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.920]   I know I shouldn't assume anything about my own
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:49.680]   You'll be spending my money too. I'll get you i'll get you forg
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:54.000]   Uh, now do you get you have one for ipad today, but you're not gonna get another one personal ipad
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.440]   Just use that one right. Oh, yeah. I just need the one. Yeah, i'm not gonna get
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:02.080]   But we'll get you we'll get you 64 gigs verizon. Okay, right or do you want atc?
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:06.320]   Here's the thing you might want atc. I get that unlimited data. Uh, we'll get you atc
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:09.520]   So doesn't that make sense? I wonder if atnt would screw me with that
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:14.080]   Exes saying this is hspa plus this is not for glte
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:16.640]   I've been hanging out on the unlimited data for a little bit
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:21.360]   That though the iphone forest doesn't have an lt8 chip set so it's hspa plus that's all it is
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:26.000]   Do you think that there would be any reason for atnt to kick us off of that unlimited?
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:31.920]   Yeah, what they're doing is they're clamping us there it did it's getting so bad now that you go past 30 gigs
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:38.000]   You're you're no matter what if you go past 30 gigs don't feel like i'm noticing anything particularly bad
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.360]   You're probably not going past 30 gigs. I don't know how that's possible
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:47.200]   I use this three gigs not 30 did I say 33 gigs three gigs? Yeah, but i'm using where the three gigs a month
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:49.840]   That's probably why I am I think I am
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:53.040]   Well, sure I am. Can I do a show about ipads?
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:55.760]   You did not get the text message saying you're being throttled not once
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:58.880]   Not once
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:00.880]   I don't feel throttled thing is I want the tethering
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:05.840]   Yeah, so my whole thing is it's like I want the tethering and i'm and i feel like i'm getting clamped and or i know i'm getting clamped
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:08.320]   and I just feel like
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:10.320]   Yeah, this is beautiful. So by the way
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:18.080]   It even says if you read the read me that one of the things they fix at 5.1 is the atnt 3g logo
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:22.880]   It's they fix the logo. It's just a logo, baby
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:28.800]   What what the in upper left? Yeah, it's for it. Have you updated a 5.1 yet?
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:31.040]   No, well when you do it was always
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:37.120]   It was always it was a japan plus it's what it's what 18t. Oh, oh, I don't by the way
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:43.760]   Even lte is not 4g 4g is 100 megabits a second. We're not we're not there yet in the united states
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:46.000]   um
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.240]   iMovie i photo we talked about
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:56.320]   A dobe showed sketch pro is that what they're calling it was auto desk and i'm sorry on i'm never showing sketchbook on the ipad
[00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:00.480]   And there was sketchbook pro and then another there were two programs
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.520]   There's infinity blade
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.520]   Sketchbook pro
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.200]   But the you know the all coming in april and then there's a rumor
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.400]   There was a rumor that someone's got a pen now that you know kind of pays attention
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.120]   How hard you're pushing that can kind of work with some of the stuffs. We'll see if that
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:19.280]   Well, no, we i've seen that before it and it really is it's the pen though that's figuring it out
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:24.160]   Yeah, so what happens is you're pushing it and the pen's figuring that out and then and then sending that back to the to the ipad and
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:30.400]   Through what bluetooth that's the rumor. Oh, okay, because we've seen this before with pens that the more area surface area you
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.400]   Yeah, that's not that's not as good
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.800]   It's much that harder. No
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.680]   Um
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:44.080]   Interesting side light uh Walter isakson the author of the apple uh the steve jobs biography
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:49.440]   Um was doing an interview on tv cultura's roda viva in brazil
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:55.600]   I don't know why no one asked him this before the the host kaiotullio costa asked him
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:00.560]   Uh walter you said you'd read an addition to steve jobs bio. So what's missing?
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.360]   And isakson said oh
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:10.000]   He says i left a few things out of the book one of them being details of what steve thought the next apple tv should be
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:16.080]   He says he left it out of the book because apple hadn't yet done it and i thought that maybe that that was unfair to apple
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:19.200]   Before they produced the tv reporting what steve thought it should be
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.160]   Um interesting interesting, but does he say anything more? No
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:32.560]   Apple the apple tv announcement was totally expected
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:36.400]   Not particularly exciting just kind of reason right?
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:41.040]   Yeah, they were just like that was the first thing we talked about faster processor. That's about it
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.120]   Kennedy p
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:48.320]   Made the interface look a little more pretty stores apparently backup in some jurisdictions not mine
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.320]   No
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.360]   This is a
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:57.760]   Feature that they could add to the apple tv that wasn't simply you see this feature that we have an iCloud and it's well
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:00.320]   Now it's available. We're extending it to the apple tv right
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:06.240]   Siri, uh, well even Siri I mean it seems as though every the whole point is just to be the the siphon that
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.640]   That takes cool features from the desktop and the mobile
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:13.520]   The people who have been able to get in the store i am to have said that you can order two
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:18.000]   What should we do order two all order two you order two?
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.400]   Oh, no, don't you don't you have to use my credit card. We'll get we'll get somebody over there in order two
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:25.520]   um
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:28.720]   I could just invoice you
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.840]   Invoice me
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:37.120]   Invoice me baby. Um, what other what else can we talk about if we hit every possible topic
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:41.200]   Here's an interesting one that is again not with the ipad announcement, but I thought very
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:47.120]   Very interesting corona sosus speaking to the dow Jones newswire apple has offered license
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:52.880]   It's smartphone related patents to android makers. We won't sue you sam san
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.960]   Motorola
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:59.200]   HTC all you have to do is pay us $15 a handset
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:06.800]   There's a rumor microsoft gets five to ten dollars per android handset
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.360]   $15 is a little high
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:15.200]   But if your htc motor roller and sam san all of whom are in court right now and continuing to fall behind
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:18.960]   That's the thing is that why wouldn't would you sign it or not? Would you do it?
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:23.200]   That's a lot. It's a lot
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.440]   It's 50 more than microsoft's asking
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:32.000]   By the way 70 percent of android handset makers have taken microsoft's offer. So $10
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.200]   Is is probably the right i'm a good business plan by the way. You don't need to actually do an operating system
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.200]   I make anything just sue
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:47.440]   Uh, so that that's that's that's good. We you saw the 25th billions download. I guess that's a story
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:52.480]   Um, I don't I think we're gonna do computers. There's nothing more to say. I think we're done
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.480]   Is there anything more to say andi and not go?
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.640]   Uh last words
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:01.840]   Uh, i was i was scrolling through this you through is anything else there you've already written a 2000 word article
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:08.480]   I've already I've already it said that that was that's my problem today. I was already way way talked out about the subject before you sat down
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.840]   Behind the behind the microphone, but you had time to formulate your thoughts
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:16.240]   That and that was a good thing too. Yeah, um, it's it's interesting. I've got the this week
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:20.080]   I'm also going to be reviewing finally the aces transformer prime android tablet
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:23.760]   Which I kind which I kind of like and I see why it should exist
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:31.600]   But man is is it ever been more clear that just when uh, all those android tablet makers have started to get their act together
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:37.040]   They can make a successful interesting tablet, but the tablet that they're making is the same
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:42.880]   iPad finally that apple introduced two years ago and now apple really with the with le
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:46.080]   The ipad new vell
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:51.040]   Has uh as i said has taken another jump forward so now they're right back in the in the in the back horse produce
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:54.260]   Position and now they still have to now they have to deal with a
[01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:58.960]   399 dollar ipad too that they had problems with competing with at 499 last year
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:04.880]   So I honestly I honestly don't know what the android market is going to do to finally
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:09.920]   Produce a convincing ten inch tablet that makes sense to a large swath of people
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:12.240]   It's I I'm absolutely bad
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:16.640]   This is I'm not saying that as an insult towards towards android. I'm saying that i've looked at this
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:21.040]   I've talked to manufacturers. I've talked to people who sell these sort of things and I just can't see
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:24.400]   an aspect of the tablet tablet business where
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:28.880]   Uh android can really have a future in right whatever apple has not snapped up
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:34.240]   It looks like microsoft is in the position to say we're gonna go after all the people who for whom an ipad still doesn't make any sense
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:37.920]   I don't know do you think microsoft with windows 8 will have a credible reply?
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.400]   I agree with you android is is in the dust
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:46.320]   I think so definitely because uh, I don't i'm not saying that i'm not saying that they will definitely win
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.400]   I'm saying that this is the first real test
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:53.920]   apple has produced an ipad that everybody wants but it's a tablet that really
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:06:00.000]   Lives without much competition what microsoft might be doing might be able to do this time next year is have
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:06.960]   a one device that gives all the practical benefits of a tablet and and also gives you all the practical benefits of a
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:10.800]   desktop operating system because as much as I love the ipad as much as I rely on it
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:14.720]   Anytime that i'm in anything that's could really be called a project
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:19.920]   The ipad is not my go-to device. I can work I can write a column on it, but I really can't
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:26.480]   Search and write a column on it. I I have to I truly it looks kind of silly, but I I truly do have to have my iPhone
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.920]   Connected to safari like on a little easel next to it
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.000]   That's my second in for a second app running
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.800]   So we're what's most interesting is not the mark the marketplace aspect of it
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:42.240]   But just the idea that we're gonna see the entire world starting with the United States of america
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.920]   These users are gonna vote on what they really really want if you give them a
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:53.840]   $99 computer that will run a really good slick truly well designed mobile multi-touch operating system
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:57.520]   But also can run multi windowed apps like the conventional stuff that even
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:04.160]   That the rest of the world uses what they prefer to have that device instead of an ipad and something else or is
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:10.160]   Are they possible or are they even capable of doing just an ipad for for all their usage? So
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.160]   And I think microsoft is the first real challenge
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:16.960]   Come across the next year or two
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.040]   Final thoughts saryllane
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:22.880]   Can't wait to get one wish the store was working a little bit better
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:26.080]   They've replaced you know, I replaced the error message now with just a big oops
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.480]   It's probably the most trivial thing to
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:32.080]   Uh worry about but what do I do? Why do I?
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:35.440]   Got the white now. I love it matches my phone
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.920]   I was gonna ask you because when you bought the white last year at austin
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.480]   You weren't sure I wasn't sure it looked like it was maybe a little smaller just kind of optically
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.400]   It felt smaller than the black so I bought the black i've gotten really used to the white
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.880]   I really like the way it looks like you should buy the black and i'm gonna buy the white
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.920]   You think so sure what i- just let's go freaky friday on this
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.400]   version of ipad i'm with you okay
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:59.760]   I'm gonna buy the white just because I want to distinguish it from the otherwise completely identical ipad too
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:08.000]   Oh, no. Oh wait a minute. I could tell it's 0.02 ounces heavier. That must be the ipad new
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:13.680]   Uh, tim cooked it. You know what we haven't seen the video yet, but it's it seemed like he did a credible job
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:19.440]   Nobody was complaining about him on stage. Let's watch a little bit of him just to see how he how he feels
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:29.200]   Today we're announcing the new ipad
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.000]   And it is amazing
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.640]   We've taken it to a whole new level
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:38.080]   And we are redefining the category
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:40.800]   That apple created
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:45.920]   With the original i have to say in some ways he almost feels like he's channeling steve jobs
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:52.320]   Over the most fundamental features and he's certainly much better than he was in his first stage appearance. Yes
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:56.160]   Everything
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:00.000]   That millions of people have drawn to love about it
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.080]   It really is huge. I'll show it to you
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.720]   Interesting
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:12.080]   Uh, Alex lindsey final thoughts. I think that it's it's obviously a revolutionary move forward
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:16.320]   I think that when you look at where they're going with the education market with you know
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:21.600]   The higher resolution is going to make a difference with textbooks with other trainings and so on so forth
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.720]   So I think that that's going to be big
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:29.280]   I think the creation tools also make a difference for the education market the video the the the iPhoto tools and so on so forth
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:33.120]   Are going to be very important when you are considering replacing laptops with
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:37.440]   iPads you need to have that in there for people to build the reports and and so on so forth
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:42.320]   And so I think that I think they'll sell more of these and they sold of all the other iPads, you know
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:47.360]   Throughout this year you said so you said 20 million almost. Yeah, so it's gonna be it's gonna be a big
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.680]   It's gonna be another banner year for apple
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:54.800]   And I think that it's it does get very difficult to see how someone's going to catch up
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.800]   They're building an entire category
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:01.760]   Uh of their own and and every time people start to even threaten to get close
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:07.200]   I think that uh they start pulling away again. I would have liked to see a 128 gig, but
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:11.760]   But I just by two 64, you know, I was thinking about just using high cloud
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:14.960]   I was thinking of andy's issue with you know, multi window
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.280]   And I was thinking you know for the same price as a laptop
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:20.480]   You could just get two of them and get a case that would just clam shell them together
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.880]   And then and then if they if they bluetooth together well
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.400]   You could use one as a keyboard and then when you need it to you could kind of pull them up
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:30.400]   And you could be building on one looking at the other one. I actually think it might actually work
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:34.800]   I've seen a more error message more web based error messages
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:38.800]   Yeah, attempting to buy this thing that I've ever seen before
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:44.080]   This is a third different error message their servers are just server dropped the connection. It says
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:50.160]   So i'm gonna keep trying. I'm not i'm not giving up. That's what we boys and girls. That's what we call demand
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:56.560]   Yeah, that's what that is a huge service probably like one of the biggest servers out there and it's being every business in the world
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:59.280]   Just says how do
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.280]   How do I get that?
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:09.120]   How do i just great things, you know make great products, I guess and uh and innovate and uh and continue to perform
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:12.880]   Even after losing your visionary leader
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:16.640]   Um, I think there's no question that today apple did
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:23.600]   uh steve jobs proud and um this this probably isn't the last project that uh steve worked on
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:27.840]   Uh, I imagine there's an iphone five that has some of his very dust on it
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:33.840]   But you have to say that tim cook and company have have kept the flame alive and this is absolutely a product that
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:38.800]   Uh fulfills steve's vision. Well, that does it for this edition of mac break weekly
