[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.040]   Talking about the latest Mac news,
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.920]   joining me from his lair in the Boston area, Mr. Andy
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.240]   Anaco of the Chicago Sun.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.880]   Times I know it's confusing.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.800]   He's on the right coast, but he talks from the Midland.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.040]   I like to confuse my enemies, Leo.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.680]   I'm surprised.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.960]   I'm surprised that you managed to maintain a fixed target
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.160]   for so long and survived in this industry.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.760]   It's true.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.280]   It's true.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.160]   They know exactly where to find me.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.440]   I'm just waiting.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.800]   There's even a window right there.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.240]   I don't know.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.680]   It's crazy.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.480]   We thought we'd have Alex Lindsey this week,
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.960]   but it turns out he is at the Republican National Convention
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.240]   under lock and key.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.240]   So sitting in his place over on the right hand seat,
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.000]   the I-C-E-O is here from throwboy.com.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.680]   You're holding it wrong.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.720]   You're holding it wrong.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.440]   It's just a little Steve.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.280]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.160]   Don't follow for Steve.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.960]   That's a cute-- do you think he got in trouble for that?
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.280]   I actually-- he was selling it, but it is sold out now.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.160]   It seems like about every year or so, somebody comes up
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.880]   with a really cool craft project.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.680]   There was a bobblehead or at least a big head scarf
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.920]   for the figure.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.160]   There was an almost creepily photorealistic doll
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.880]   that was available for all of 18 seconds.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.680]   And they tend not to last long.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.240]   There's a reason why Tfury.com put their teachers on sale
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.800]   for only 24 hours, because that's
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.720]   about the window that they have before.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.640]   The people who own the rise to back to the future in Robocop
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.480]   are going to get together to stay--
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.800]   Well, this is a benefits to American Cancer Society.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.000]   10% of proceeds go to the American Cancer Society.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.520]   And I think it's an homage, clearly,
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.280]   from throwboy who loves Macintosh.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.160]   And it's cute, but it is sold out, so it doesn't matter.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.160]   He's wearing a black turtleneck, blue jeans,
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.520]   and John Lennon glasses.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.600]   And it's really adorable.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.800]   I just really like it.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.920]   It could be anybody.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.480]   He calls it the ICU.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.440]   Could be any.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.280]   I don't know.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.080]   I'm sure it was done with love, but I imagine
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.000]   that if I had a famous father or a famous relative,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.920]   I don't know how I'd feel about soft toys out there
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.520]   in the market.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.600]   Yeah, I guess so.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.120]   But I know it was done with love.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.200]   But you're right.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.240]   And I think there are rules about this kind of thing.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.240]   I don't know.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.680]   If somebody wants to make a doll of me,
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.120]   I'm not going to get mad.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.760]   You've thrown down the gauntlet.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.880]   Yeah, I wish somebody would.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.520]   I'd be thrilled.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.600]   Are you kidding?
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.280]   OK, nobody's going to make a doll out of me.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.720]   I could tell you right now.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.280]   Leo LePort says that it's impossible to make a doracle
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.560]   stuffed doll out of Leo LePort.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.920]   Couldn't be done.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.200]   That his listeners are not clever, crafty, or creative enough
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.360]   to produce adorable stuff.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.000]   Leo LePort, which then he would then totally put on the air
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.240]   and probably keep in the background of all of the shows
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.520]   for at least about a month.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.840]   Crediting always this awesome, awesome thing
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.920]   that one of his listeners and viewers did.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.400]   But nobody could ever do that, so.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.960]   Whatever happened.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.400]   None of them.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.960]   None of them.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.480]   Never happened.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.880]   Oh, you're going to bring me my puppet?
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.240]   Brian Hogg actually did do this.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.960]   This is-- you know, Brian does the--
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.560]   he does Moss puppet.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.920]   And I actually have a number of Leo effigies in my office.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.800]   And any of them without dried blood and skewers in them?
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.840]   Hey, Val, you got it.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.240]   Every time a heart shape box--
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.320]   Here's--
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.840]   Hey.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.880]   Every time a heart shape box is delivered to those two,
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.080]   I was like, oh, god.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.520]   Someone else made an effigy, Leo, and did a voodoo thing on them.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.240]   I stuck it inside a cartoon heart.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.760]   One of these days, I'm going to control my nail clippings
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.400]   because I tell you, people keep--
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.840]   they keep emerging here.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.080]   You want to see the creepiest effigy of me that ever was made?
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.600]   This is a 3D model.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.760]   That's me.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.240]   Just bizarre.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.120]   My staff keeps bringing me effigies.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.680]   That is not weird.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.680]   That is just weird.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.680]   And I'm eating the microphone.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.000]   It looks like the microphone is coming out of your mouth.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.400]   It is.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.800]   I think this was-- I did that apparently because this
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.200]   looks like it's taken from a picture.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.360]   Everything is photorealistic, including the clock.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.160]   This was-- picture was taken September 21 at 1.09 PM.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.600]   Wow.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.520]   Tuesday.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.880]   I think I was doing Mac break weekly.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.920]   And then here's another one.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.480]   This is-- this one was made by--
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.760]   oh, I can't remember his name, but he did--
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.440]   Well, that's cute.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.960]   Isn't that cute?
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.760]   I'm sitting on my bottom.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.240]   That's lovely.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.600]   So you thought I was joking when I said
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.200]   there were a bunch of effigies.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.960]   Actually, this one is--
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.080]   I think this is crocheted.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.280]   Oh my--
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.960]   Isn't there a video game with crocheted?
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.440]   Oh, it is.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.160]   It's like-- what does it call?
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.880]   A little big planet?
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.440]   Oh my god.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.880]   Yes, but I hope he eats his cat, the--
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.280]   it's turning to QVC all of a sudden.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.320]   Now this Leo actually--
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.440]   we have 50 of these.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.280]   We're going to use FlexPay.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.400]   $29.99 a month for 30 months, and this could be yours.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.200]   You know, it takes over 30 hours by hand just to paint the hair.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.480]   Just to paint the hair.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.400]   Well, is this really only $79--
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.120]   well, I already said $79.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.600]   Oh, I'm going to get fired for saying that,
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.760]   but we're legally required to stick to that prize.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.240]   I would snap these up.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.960]   Andy, I think you actually might watch a little QVC there.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.880]   It looks like you're watching the knife show, actually.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.880]   Well, you know I have a guy who for many years
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.880]   worked until 3 or 4 in the morning in a home office
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.800]   without any cable TV?
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.480]   Every call that comes in, every hand that goes up--
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.400]   $19.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.240]   $94.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.800]   That's all that's--
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.400]   So some-- despite the fact that I'm all alone here
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.360]   at the Twig Cottage with my rounded rectangle table,
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.160]   I have companions.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.720]   This is sort of an advanced look at what the final days is
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.400]   going to look like.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.760]   Leo in the home.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.400]   We couldn't Skype anybody, so it's just me and the puppet
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.400]   today.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.480]   That would happen.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.200]   I can see that.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.680]   Andy, before we get to the Mac news,
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.720]   I think probably something we should talk about briefly.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.120]   And I know you'll have something to say about it.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.840]   Saturday, Neil Armstrong passed away.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.160]   The first person to walk on the moon
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.400]   and a real hero to us all.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.800]   He was 82 years old.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.840]   There was a great quote.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.600]   I'm going to see if I can find it about him being really
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.760]   a true engineer.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.520]   And he was-- it's interesting, because the personalities
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.360]   of the two men who first walk on the moon, Buzz Aldrin,
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.000]   Neil Armstrong, were so very different.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.440]   I've interviewed Buzz Aldrin.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.920]   In fact, we have a show with Buzz Aldrin
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.200]   on our futures in biotech.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.920]   Fascinating guy, really interesting guy.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.400]   But Neil was very quiet.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.040]   Didn't do a lot of interviews.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.120]   He was-- I don't know.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.320]   Did you ever give a chance to talk to him?
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:42.840]   Oh, never.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.840]   And boy, would I have jumped to that chance?
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.240]   Me too.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.120]   But the interesting thing that I think
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.320]   made a lot of people respect them,
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.440]   among the plenty list of things that you were striking for,
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.520]   is that it's not as though--
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.440]   I'll be up front.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.800]   If I walked in, walked on the moon,
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.600]   I would be a total blank about it for the rest of my life.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.440]   It would be-- I would like go to Starbucks.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.000]   How much is the moon?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.520]   How much is the medium chocolate?
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.000]   The hot chocolate?
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.960]   Oh, that's 425.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.520]   Oh, is there a discount for someone
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.520]   who's walked on the frickin' moon?
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.920]   I would try to do such a try to win every single argument.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.360]   Every time I check in for a flight, I'd ask for, hey,
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.040]   I walked on the moon.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.680]   Can I get a first-class upgrade?
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.640]   I would be a jerk about it.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.120]   Neil Armstrong was more like, that was the most wonderful thing
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.440]   I did.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.480]   It was time for me to move on to the next part of my life,
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.320]   because you can't be-- there are a few people that
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.040]   can be a 58-year-old astronaut.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.360]   There has been done.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.760]   Alan Bean, who was the lunar module pilot on Apollo 12,
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.680]   was actually-- a lot of those guys
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.400]   wanted to stay in to even fly the space shuttle.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.320]   So he actually commanded us by a Skylab mission.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.840]   I think he test flew the shuttle.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.520]   It's amazing that the fact that he, quote, disappeared
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.560]   is only a reflection of the fact that so many of us
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.160]   wonder, if you were an astronaut,
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.800]   why would you ever leave that life?
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.000]   So he didn't really disappear.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.600]   He just led a normal life.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.840]   He was at engineering conferences.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:06.240]   He was there at sort of fraternal social organizations
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.460]   involving professional flyers and professional test
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:08.960]   pilots.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.600]   He was always there.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.720]   He just didn't feel the need to always
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.640]   be up on a big stage, having everybody tell them
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.880]   how fabulous he was.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.960]   So I mean, start to finish just what
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.520]   an example for everybody.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.120]   He-- one of my favorite quotes from him,
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.400]   I am and ever will be a White Sox pocket protector, nerdy
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.880]   engineer, one of the most inspiring guys.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.600]   Here for those who want to relive it,
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.960]   I'm sure there's been many opportunities on TV to do so.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.920]   His first steps on the moon.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.440]   [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.720]   - That's one small step for man.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.920]   - One giant leap for mankind.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.920]   - And I look beautiful for radio.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.160]   - And here's the start, beauty all its own.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.160]   It's all right.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.440]   - I'll never forget it.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.800]   I was 13 years old.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.760]   I remember watching this--
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.600]   I remember getting-- I watched every moment of it
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.800]   from the launch to the landing of the lunar module
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.120]   to the first steps on the moon.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.800]   And I think for a lot of us, it was
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.040]   the kind of the inspiration that got us into science
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.440]   and engineering and technology.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.240]   And certainly most of the technology we use today
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.240]   is the descendant of the technology
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.680]   and the inventions that were created for that amazing--
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.400]   - That's a big space race.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.360]   - Now, Dun, do you think that there's
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.920]   such a difference between the way that kids grew up
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.840]   with space exploration in that generation
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.640]   and the way that they're growing up right now,
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.760]   where they're no longer the sort of, oh my god,
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.320]   a man has landed on the freaking moon.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.240]   It's finally happened.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.520]   Those moments are in the past.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.400]   But on the other hand, I think a kid
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.760]   has never had more power to simply pull up
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.760]   as much information about an ongoing space exploration
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.480]   that they want.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.280]   There's never been so much access to so much historical
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.200]   information and even present information
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.080]   and information about future flights.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.160]   I mean, there's a reason why, like anybody,
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.400]   I like the space shuttle.
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.760]   I like crude space exploration.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.800]   But I don't feel as though we've been cheated out
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.880]   of the cool stuff by virtue of the fact
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.200]   that you have the Curiosity rover,
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.120]   you have the Soho station, you've got all these spacecraft
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.840]   that are out there sending back information and pictures
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.880]   that you can feel as though you can actually explore
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.280]   things yourself instead of just getting the day out
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.600]   from school to watch a lunar land.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.000]   Moon landing was probably pretty cool.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.080]   But I do hope that the kids today get as inspired
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:30.960]   by all this as we are.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.320]   Because I tell you what, it was because my generation
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.840]   was so inspired by those things that I think we have
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.120]   a lot of the stuff that we have today, a lot of the technologies
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.720]   that we have today.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.080]   And I hope that the kids today are equally inspired.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:47.120]   Curiosity was an amazing moment, really an amazing success,
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.360]   engineering success, NASA success.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.960]   So I just wanted to make sure that we acknowledged
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.960]   the passing of the Vosco de Gama of our era.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.440]   I mean, a great explorer and a hero.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.760]   I guess that I've always loved that image of,
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.840]   there's still a lot of Apollo astronauts,
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.600]   they're still around, so much from around.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.280]   And just there's these, you can be at a Dunkin' Donuts
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.920]   seeing what you think is just this like very sweet looking
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.920]   78, 79 year old man, sipping a copy and having a crawler
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.920]   not knowing that, oh, he walked on the moon.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.320]   (laughs)
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.200]   He spent two months on Skylab.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.200]   Oh, that person actually dead.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.080]   Actually, actually was part of the Apollo Soyuz project
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.720]   in which a Russian, a Soviet and American spacecraft
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.000]   docked in orbit and they had vodka in love.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.040]   Oh, that guy who's now spilled his coffee,
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.720]   his cursing and dabbing in his shirt
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.040]   is actually one of the most remarkable men
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.560]   who's ever lived, interesting.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.400]   - Truly incredible.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.800]   And I read an article that said that there are fewer
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.040]   than a dozen men who have walked on the surface of the moon
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.400]   and they're on their 70s and bit by bit,
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.480]   the time will come and then there will be no human alive
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.520]   who knows what it's like to step on the lunar surface.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.440]   We gotta fix that, we gotta change that.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.920]   All right, moving on to the Macintosh
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.160]   and of course this was a huge week.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.840]   I thought this show we would be perhaps saying,
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.120]   well, the jury will be in any minute now
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.120]   in the Apple versus Samsung case and they shocked us.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.320]   I had to rush in, I literally rushed in on Friday afternoon
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.120]   so that we could cover the reading of the verdict.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.160]   The jury came in after three days, a three week trial,
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.280]   109 pages of jury instructions and immensely complex,
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.400]   33 question, 20 page verdict form.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.120]   And you know, to all intents and purposes,
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.360]   it looks like the jury just, in fact,
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.720]   when they talked to the jury,
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.120]   it seemed as if the jury from day one said,
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.000]   "This is obvious, Samsung copied Apple in every respect,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.520]   "not interestingly, not on the tablets,
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.080]   "but in every respect on these phones
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.920]   "and we're gonna punish," I think was the words
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.200]   of one of the jurors, "punish Samsung."
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.960]   They ended up awarding Samsung more than a billion dollars.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.000]   We've talked a lot about this by now, of course,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.360]   on the day of the verdict and then on Sunday.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.480]   But I haven't heard from you, Andy,
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.760]   what's your thought on the result?
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.560]   I thought that a verdict in favor of Apple was inevitable.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.080]   The only decision, the only thought in my mind was,
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.440]   "Is it gonna," if you're evaluating,
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.960]   evaluating the question that,
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.200]   did Samsung's first generation Android phones copy the iPhone?
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.440]   It's not a question of yes or no,
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.080]   it's a question between yes and healthy half.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.400]   And then, because really, I have a Samsung Galaxy S,
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.520]   like the first generation phone,
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.120]   actually in my office, in my library,
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.440]   and you put this next to an iPhone,
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.960]   and anybody who tries to claim that,
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.560]   no, no, no, they just happened to,
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.080]   they just happened to design a handset,
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.080]   and they just happened to,
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.840]   I suppose there's some surface similarities,
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.640]   but no, no, those things are gonna happen, no, no, no.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.520]   It was a clear ripoff.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.160]   A lot of the interface, also a clear ripoff.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.400]   I am trying to taper down the things that I say
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.520]   about the Galaxy S3, but this is germane here,
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.520]   that even when Samsung created their own version of Siri,
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.080]   oh my God, they copy the interface
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.440]   down to almost the very last pixel.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:16.280]   You're just like, please don't make me have to defend you,
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.040]   Samsung, 'cause you're making it awfully, awfully hard.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.320]   And then when you get down to the way
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.000]   that the case is going to be presented,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.880]   where they can't just, in a perfect world,
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.800]   you could simply handage your,
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.920]   here is the iPhone first generation iPhone,
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:33.920]   here is the iPhone 3G, here is the Samsung Galaxy S.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.640]   You tell me which one was copied from what,
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.640]   and then that would be the end of it.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.800]   Instead, you have to simply say, we're Apple,
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.440]   we own these following patents.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.560]   These are, here's the paperwork, the proves that we own it.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.880]   Here is documentation, the proves that Samsung phones
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.600]   have these features, point for point for point for point.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.960]   Either way, whether they went at the left brain
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.520]   or the right brain analysis, you knew that Apple's going to win.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.960]   I didn't think that they would win quite so overwhelmingly.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.200]   It also remains to be seen exactly what the far flung
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.840]   impact of this is going to be.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.280]   I was very, very concerned about an Apple win,
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.960]   because remember that Apple has spent the past year and a half
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.760]   trying to get injunctions internationally
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.840]   against every really good Android phone that's out there.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.000]   That anything that's made a big, big splash,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.440]   as they've been trying to get it restricted,
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.200]   it's sale wherever they can get that done.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.040]   So my worry was that as soon as they got this positive verdict,
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.280]   they'd immediately try to say, okay, well,
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.680]   we've proven that Samsung has stolen our phones,
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.080]   but now we're going to get the seat conjunctions
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.360]   against pretty much the whole board.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.880]   And right now, it seems like all they've done is
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.240]   seek injunctions against phones that were actually mentioned
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.480]   in the trial, which is totally appropriate
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.280]   because these are all early generation phones
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.720]   where you, Samsung just does not have a defense
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.200]   about where the origins of these phones are.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.680]   What I hope desperately is that this doesn't turn
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.760]   into a situation where Apple feels as though
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.280]   they are the Marcellus Wallace of the phone industry,
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.240]   where if you want to, it's their town,
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.800]   if you want to sell phones in their town,
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.920]   that permission comes through Apple,
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.600]   either in the form of getting a licensing agreement
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.040]   from Apple or just being told to run out of town.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.840]   So we're going to have to find out
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.440]   how that actually plays out.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.240]   Again, I wrote a piece, unfortunately,
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.080]   these are the times when you really do wish
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.880]   that you didn't have print deadlines to butt against,
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.720]   just like you.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.200]   I was not expecting a verdict by the end of the week.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.960]   I really thought that it was going to be
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.360]   about a week and a half, two weeks,
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.680]   by the end of this week,
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.000]   for them to really go point for point for point,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   because it's not, when you follow the jury instructions,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.760]   it was not just to create a good verdict,
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.600]   but also to create a verdict that's going to stand.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.760]   So if they came back out after 24 hours,
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.360]   that's pretty much begging some say,
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.600]   "Okay, they couldn't possibly have processed
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.640]   "all of this stuff, we want a new trial."
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.640]   But yeah, so I was out, I had plans
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.640]   that I was out from like four until it was going to be 10 or 11.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.080]   Went out to dinner with somebody.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.840]   When I got back to the car at 6.30 is when the news
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.800]   that there's going to be a verdict soon,
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.760]   I was supposed to go someplace else to meet up
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.040]   for like a family party thing,
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.880]   and I had a zip over there.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.720]   Sorry.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.680]   The verdict was still going to be exactly as dip in
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.600]   and do one of these dramatic like made-for-TV movie sort of things.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.360]   I'm sorry, but Japanese zeros have been,
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.120]   have bombed Pearl Harbor.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:17.960]   I'm wearing it, Warren,
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.760]   I'm afraid that I'm going to have been called an act of duty,
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.760]   folks, God bless you all.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.800]   That's the closest thing a tech journalist has to that.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.720]   Exactly, we're usually not, you know,
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.600]   we're in the shooting world, you understand.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.000]   It's like, no, no, no, a multi-billion dollar company
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.200]   suing another multi-billion dollar company on a product
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.840]   that's made about a couple hundred million dollars,
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.880]   but yes, I have to stop what I'm doing right now.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.400]   So I had like maybe like an hour,
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.320]   hour or hour and a half to read everything I could
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.880]   about the verdict and write 600 words for print.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.920]   Everything that I said in that column was pretty much true.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.920]   I did say that I would have nuanced one point more.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.440]   I said that given that Apple was asking for $30 and licensing fees
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.400]   from Samsung for each one of their phones,
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.000]   what discounts to be applied.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.760]   I wonder that if this does happen,
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.120]   you know, certainly whether it's a direct markup to the consumer
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.600]   or an indirect one, I'm certain that this is going to be
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.000]   a week more expensive, write more and more expense
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   for the consumer.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.480]   Had I had a little bit more time
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.400]   on what a nuanced that a little more, it's possible.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.600]   I certainly don't think it's not a possibility.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.400]   I certainly don't think it's something we shouldn't,
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.400]   we shouldn't be thinking about,
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.800]   but I certainly shouldn't have said that it was likely.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.400]   But the other point that I made that I'm,
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.800]   that is still sticks with me is it just got a real,
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.040]   the smartphone industry just became a much,
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.560]   became a much, much more dangerous place to operate
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.720]   because it's not just the case of creating a phone
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.160]   that's a complete knockoff of the iPhone,
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.680]   which again, that's what the Samsung Galaxy S really was.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.600]   It's also, there's so many basic patents that Apple has
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.840]   about anything that you can do with a phone
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.480]   that was from the most logical to things
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.280]   that have been predating actual touch screen phones
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.880]   since the mid 2000s.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.440]   It's, I'm looking at these patents,
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.440]   I'm looking at these things that Apple is asserting.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.720]   It's hard for me to think of a device that really,
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.560]   even devices made 2005, 2006,
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.160]   that would be kosher according to Apple.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.880]   So we can only wait and see what shakes out from this,
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.840]   but the worst case scenario is that you can't develop
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.000]   something with rounded corners,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.920]   because Apple says that anything with rounded corners
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.760]   is an Apple design.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:30.840]   You can't interact with a touch screen device,
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.800]   the way that you think that a touch screen device
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.760]   would naturally be interacted with.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.960]   I mean, things like tapping, what happens when you double tap,
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.600]   what happens when you tap and hold.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.200]   This is, these are like basic, basic verbs
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.800]   related to this piece of technology,
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:44.640]   and I'm talking about the iPhone,
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.400]   talking about a touch screen.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.480]   And I'm, it just, if I have concerns,
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.840]   it's because I think about what would have happened
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.000]   if all this had happened in the early 80s,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.800]   that well, we didn't invent the mouse,
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.960]   but we're the first people to patent the concept
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.200]   of the click, the double click, the double click and drag,
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.080]   the click and drag, and now if you make any sort of device
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.680]   that does that, you're gonna have to come
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.400]   talking to us and our lawyers first.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.960]   So I repeat that this is all just things
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.560]   that are on my mind, but this is not something
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.040]   that I can really put out of my mind,
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.360]   because Apple is, it's almost as if Apple's legal pursuits
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.600]   are now an entirely new product line
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.520]   that they've unveiled in 2011 and 2012,
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.560]   just as significant to the future of the company
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.960]   as the iPad, as the iPhone, as macOS, as iCloud,
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.160]   is their ability to project power
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.600]   and to defend these patents that they have
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.680]   against anyone who might be competing with them.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.640]   So 2012 was gonna continue to be an interesting year.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.360]   2013 is going to be a very interesting year,
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.280]   and I can't tell you exactly what's gonna,
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.720]   it was gonna shake out from this.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.160]   - Yeah, I mean, well, one thing we know,
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.240]   lots more, court, dance.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.080]   I mean, this is far from over.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.600]   And I guess the best that you could hope for out of this
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.600]   would be perhaps that Samsung and other manufacturers
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.360]   would say, okay, well, let's see if there's another way
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.040]   to do this that would be as good, but would not infringe.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.440]   - Yeah, and that's absolutely true too, but it's hard.
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.400]   Like I said, reading all the documents
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.920]   that Apple presented during the case,
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.760]   the most critical one to my eye,
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.800]   being the licensing agreement, the proposed licensing agreement,
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.720]   they sent to Samsung in 2010.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.560]   It's hard to identify a device
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.440]   that would really pass Apple's smell test.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.120]   And the example that people keep coming up with
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.520]   is the Windows Metro interface, the Windows Phone interface,
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:31.080]   the Windows 8 interface of the Windows Surface look and feel.
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.880]   And that's very, very true, but it's unique,
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.760]   it's distinct, it doesn't have zero intersection
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.760]   with the way that the iPhone and the iPad work.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.640]   More importantly, I think the reason why Microsoft
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.040]   is untouchable is that they already have an agreement
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.920]   with Apple that says that we're devices
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.200]   that we're making are perfectly okay with Apple.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.480]   So that's the difficulty that I have,
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.800]   if everything that you want to do,
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.320]   even if you have no desire to imitate the iPhone
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.200]   or the iPad, you now have to make sure
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.120]   that you talk to Apple and show what you're doing
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.560]   to make sure that you're not gonna get sued by them,
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.600]   or more to the point that they have these patents,
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.960]   these are real patents that make sure that,
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.480]   yes, we have a button that interacts
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.120]   with a finger when it's pushed.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:15.880]   And yes, we have a list that scrolls when you go like this.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.160]   If we give you a dollar 10 cents per handset,
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.000]   is it okay if we make a device that works exactly the way
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.920]   that anybody who developed this device
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.960]   locked inside a closet since 1968
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.400]   would make this device work?
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.720]   So you like innovation, but when you get down to it,
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.640]   I think that very few products are 100% innovative.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.840]   This is, I'm writing a followup,
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.040]   the piece I wrote on Friday has gotten,
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.560]   let's say a lot of play and has inspired a lot of discussion.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.840]   So I'm being very, very careful and precise
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.360]   when I write the followup, which hopefully will be filed today
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.360]   and should run tomorrow on the Sun Time site.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.640]   But it's hard to even pick up the first generation iPhone
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.000]   and not see features and user interface elements
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.560]   that were present in previous phones,
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.840]   like two or three years earlier than that.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.400]   And again, I look at this iPhone,
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.280]   I wonder if the iPhone were created
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.160]   in this exact same environment,
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.040]   could they simply say,
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.040]   could they put in something like a scrolling list?
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.160]   Could they put something like a mechanical button
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.440]   that takes you instantly from wherever you are
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.400]   into the application launcher?
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.720]   Could they have a row of static icons
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.560]   that represent the most frequently used features
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.000]   of this device?
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.920]   Can they develop an iPhone with rounded corners?
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:33.160]   'Cause the great thing about the hidden benefit
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:37.800]   of all this discussion is that it's caused me
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.080]   to give my office a really thorough cleaning
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.960]   to dig out all kinds of old devices
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.520]   to refresh my memory.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.160]   And so now I have the Palm LifeDrive,
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.640]   which I don't have, which I had here with me,
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.680]   but it is a silver tone device with rounded corners,
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.880]   with a large prominent center home button,
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.720]   no mechanical keyboard, all on screen keyboard,
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.440]   that again, if you were trying to call balls and strikes,
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.720]   instead of looking at the overall character of the device,
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.160]   you could, someone who is a, let's say a rabid Palm fan,
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.360]   could say that, oh, well, the iPhone
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.040]   is clearly ripped off from the LifeDrive,
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.640]   it's just not even, it's just not even--
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.160]   - I have a LifeDrive, it looks a lot like it, yeah.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.040]   - Yeah, exactly, point for point for point.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.240]   Whereas the sensible person says, no, no, no,
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.800]   you can't simply say, this has a center home button,
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.400]   the Southern has a center home button,
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.840]   this second device came out before the first device,
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.680]   clearly this first device stole that idea from this,
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.440]   you have to look at the overall character
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.640]   and the overall nature of the device.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.560]   And I don't think the 2012,
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.640]   I can't think of very many 2012 phones
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.920]   that would fail that test,
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.600]   but I think that most of the 2012 phones I've seen
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:46.040]   look completely, they have shared DNA,
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.840]   they were certainly born on the same planet as the iPhone,
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.240]   but on different nations,
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.800]   in many cases, actually separated by a body of water,
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:53.640]   in my opinion.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.040]   - Well, and this is why it's asking a lot
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.440]   of a non-technical jury to,
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.880]   this is the LifeDrive, by the way,
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.000]   and I can't turn it on,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.640]   'cause it also has a proprietary connector.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.840]   - Yeah, but me too.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.160]   (laughs)
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.440]   - It was, you know, a grid of icons, home button,
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.960]   I mean, this looks like an Android phone,
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.840]   in some respect, but this is known.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.680]   - Interesting, as a matter of fact,
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.840]   if Rich appears, I actually,
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.200]   I am, a couple of days ago,
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.560]   to give, he owns a kitchen scale
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.800]   that looks, that looks--
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.640]   - I do too!
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.480]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.600]   - I have that scale, I know what you're gonna say.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.100]   - It's black with like white silvery tramp
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.320]   that's rounded, it looks like an iPhone.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.280]   - Exactly, it looks exactly like an iPad,
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.000]   and so I'm doing my research to find out
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.800]   when was this device designed,
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.440]   and as near as I can tell it was designed
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.720]   before the iPad was first released.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.440]   So it's like, fine, so now Apple is gonna,
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.680]   it is the claim that this digital kitchen scale,
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.080]   being a digital device,
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.040]   as a flat tablet looking thing with rounded corners,
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.160]   that this has misappropriated Apple's intellectual property.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.760]   I hope this doesn't come across as Apple Bash,
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.760]   and this is really just a case of how bad
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.120]   the United States patent situation is.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.160]   There's a, as I'm writing this follow-up piece,
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.640]   I'm trying not to use incendiary comparisons.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.800]   There's, at the end of last week,
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.320]   we also had the other interesting piece of news
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.040]   was that Lance Armstrong finally said that,
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.480]   "Hey, I'm not gonna fight these doping allegations anymore.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.160]   I don't care if you strip me of my awards,
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.400]   I'm just done fighting this sort of stuff."
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.480]   And I couldn't help but make these lame comparisons
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.720]   between the way that the United States patent system works
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.560]   and the way that in the worst times
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.840]   of competitive bike racing, the drug situation worked,
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.120]   where if a company is found to be patenting everything
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.520]   they can possibly do, they're patenting the color orange,
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.160]   they're patenting square buttons,
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.280]   they're patenting round buttons,
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.880]   they're patenting buttons with text and graphics on them.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.440]   It's not because they're being jerks,
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.200]   they're trying to take over the entire industry,
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.480]   it's because it's the only way to compete in a world
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.040]   in which everybody's patenting everything.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.760]   And if you do not have intellectual property
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.880]   on the things that you design,
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.920]   the thing you're designing becomes vulnerable.
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.800]   And it kind of seems like the situation
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.200]   in a lot of competitive biking,
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.320]   as people have been trying to explain to me,
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.040]   that if you're doping, it's not necessarily
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.240]   that you're trying to get an advantage over everybody else,
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.360]   you're trying to establish parity
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.680]   with the 40 other people in this 100-man race
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.840]   that are also doping.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.080]   And if you want to actually be able to compete
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.360]   and actually survive, you have to do this thing.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.600]   It doesn't, it's, I'm not using that analogy in the piece
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.080]   because it's not very accurate,
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.600]   but I couldn't, it helps illustrate the difference
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.800]   between someone who, a company that acquires
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.000]   a huge library of patents because they're,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.680]   they're intending to be bullies
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.440]   and the people who are just simply smart enough
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.440]   to know that this is the world,
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.080]   this is the business that we have chosen
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.880]   as they say Godfather II, we have to,
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.760]   you have, this is the way that you have to do business
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.040]   in the 21st century.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.040]   - Do you think, I mean, you know,
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.080]   of course people complain about software patents.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.240]   And a lot of these were not exactly software patents,
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.800]   they were design patents.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.360]   But do you think maybe that the problem is so much,
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.680]   not so much that you can do that,
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.760]   but that you can do it for 17 or 20 years
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.880]   and in technology that's forever,
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.360]   it's effectively forever.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.600]   What if these were one year,
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.840]   I mean, the point of patent law is,
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:16.240]   in return for you telling everybody how you do
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.320]   this amazing new cotton gin,
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.600]   you get the rights to it for 17 years.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.600]   And then after 17 years,
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.120]   you've presumably recouped your investment
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.760]   in inventing the cotton gin,
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.160]   but now the world benefits
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.120]   'cause everybody can make a cotton gin.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.480]   The problem is that in technology,
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.400]   that still holds, it's just the timeframe is too long.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.000]   What if we're 17 months?
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.120]   - Yeah, I mean, even when we're talking about these phones
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.240]   that Apple wants to get restrictions on,
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.120]   these are already just ancient as hell phones that--
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.080]   - Right, these are the ones they want to ban.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.760]   The Galaxy S2, the only reason that's still around is
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.560]   'cause people like Cricket and Boost Mobile,
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.600]   the low end guys are selling it, you know.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.680]   The showcase, the droid charge, the Galaxy prevail.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.920]   - I had to look up so many of these.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.440]   (laughs)
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.120]   They're basically burners in almost.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.960]   - Yeah, they're not current technology.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.120]   So yeah, you're right, if you have a 17 year lifespan
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.200]   on a basic patent, like, I'm sorry, I'm basic,
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.360]   I know the basic patent, I think is a legal term,
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.160]   but I mean, in terms of just something that's very, very simple
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.400]   and very, very straightforward, that's a big problem.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.120]   I also think that time and time again,
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.160]   you see all these cases where a company has
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.240]   awarded a patent and then there is prior art,
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.080]   there is provable demonstration that no,
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.080]   this thing would actually, this is a basic idea
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.360]   that was already out there,
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.120]   that nobody was really able to claim
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.280]   because it seems as though everybody,
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.880]   all at once came up with this idea
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.720]   of representing things as pictures.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.240]   When you look at the, for instance,
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.080]   the development of the first Macintosh,
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.800]   the, even before Apple got its tour of Xerox Park,
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.480]   and the legendary story is that they wanted,
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.240]   they were building a new business computer,
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.680]   they got a tour of Xerox Park, they saw the Xerox star
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.920]   or a predecessor, so, oh, we should make a computer
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.040]   exactly like that.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.960]   But in fact, the Macintosh project was already all about
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.160]   creating a really easy to use friendly computer,
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.120]   which makes, makes texts and graphics on the same display,
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.440]   without any barrier between those two,
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.920]   they had already even chosen on black,
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.440]   chosen black pixels on a white background.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.560]   The demonstration they got at Xerox Park was the fact
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.480]   that they had this, the Xerox had this device that
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.920]   incorporated a lot of ideas that were already floating around
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.480]   for three years before then.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.840]   And there's a lot of innovation,
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.400]   a lot of new ideas at Xerox are in there,
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.400]   but it's not as though this thing never existed,
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.680]   this basic concept never existed in any form outside of Xerox.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.760]   This is just a concrete example that they can take a look at
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.040]   that would give them an idea of how such a machine would work.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.200]   I mean, a lot, it's really hard to see the source of an idea
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.400]   and demonstrably prove that not only did I originate this idea,
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.400]   but anybody else who had this idea could only have gotten it
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.560]   from me.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.240]   It's just not the way that any creative endeavor
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.240]   and engineering is a creative and never works.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.560]   Yeah, Sir Isaac Newton said, "If I have seen farther than others,
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.720]   it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.600]   You'd know what he did in the world,
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.240]   invents in a vacuum."
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:13.080]   So I thought an interesting article by Farhad Manju,
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.680]   who writes her slate, he wrote this for Pando Daily,
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.000]   in which he said this perhaps was an intention,
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.120]   that's actually not the article,
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.440]   but it was an intention, I can pull it up.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.280]   It was an intentional decision by Samsung.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.160]   He said, "In 2007, when the iPhone came out,
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.160]   companies were faced with really three choices.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:34.160]   Ignore it, which is what Rim did and Nokia did."
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.560]   Maybe that strategy is not so good.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:41.440]   Strategy two, which would be the pure strategy, is beat it.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:46.240]   And he says, "That's what Palm tried to do with WebOS."
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.720]   Another film strategy.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.040]   He said Samsung took the third road, which was to look at it.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:54.680]   And this is, I think, what the jury found was most damning,
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:58.680]   was that email from Samsung executives said,
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.760]   "We have a crisis of design.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.280]   iPhone is better than everything we do."
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.320]   And it appears that made the conscious decision to copy it,
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.960]   and that this billion dollar fine
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.200]   is just the cost of doing business.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.880]   They've made $21 billion in that time on their phones.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:18.400]   So it's just a price, it was like R&D costs.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.400]   Well, copy the iPhone.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.360]   And what's interesting, and I think this is also true,
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.480]   and Manju makes this point as well,
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.920]   that was how they got into the business.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.840]   They have moved quite quickly beyond that,
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.520]   and newer Samsung phones, the Galaxy Note 2,
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.040]   which comes out tomorrow,
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.160]   are clearly not iPhone rip-offs.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:38.520]   They are unique, and in some ways best to the iPhone.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:39.360]   - Yeah.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.240]   The other example here is that,
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:46.160]   when a new device creates such an instant sensation,
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.200]   the desire to create a device like that,
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.360]   isn't just simply the desire to create a device exactly
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.400]   like the iPhone, to copy the iPhone,
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.080]   or to create brand confusion in the marketplace.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.520]   When a device comes along like that,
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.880]   and is an instant, huge success,
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.720]   that tells a company something about the consumer's
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.520]   expectations and the desire that they might not know before.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.480]   And if they simply say,
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.760]   "We're gonna pretend that we don't know this new information,
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.080]   "we're just gonna go move on ahead."
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.960]   It's the same reason why the BlackBerry
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.800]   was a huge success when it took off.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.360]   And after that, so many phones copied the form factor
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.200]   of the BlackBerry,
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.520]   'cause it taught everybody something about phone users
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.360]   they didn't know.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.840]   The trio also was a big leap forward,
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.320]   led to people imitating it.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.160]   - That's right.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.240]   - And it also taught these companies something
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.920]   about consumer expectations that they didn't already have.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.080]   And you can say naughty naughty
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.880]   that you decided to make something that,
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.800]   you decided to make a color screen with a thumb board
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.920]   underneath it, just like this previous device.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.640]   On the other hand, there's, I think it's reasonable to say
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.920]   that what are you going to create a device
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.360]   that leapfrogs the iPhone before you learn any lessons
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.200]   from the iPhone?
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.840]   I don't think that's really reasonable.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.720]   There's no reason why the station's gonna happen.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.560]   - Yeah, it is a signal from consumers.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.400]   This is something that--
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.440]   - I'm about to get on a rant, so I'll stop there.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.280]   That's just that I've been reading a lot of these arguments
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.920]   and just wondering, okay, so someone comes out
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.560]   with a car with four wheels.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:10.360]   So now nobody can make a platform with four wheels on it.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.280]   You have to make a platform with five wheels,
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.560]   just to make sure that you're saying it's different.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.040]   Or you have to make the wheels triangles with threads,
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.040]   just to make it different.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.480]   Or do you simply acknowledge that this works extremely well?
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.560]   It's extremely successful.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.400]   People are responding to this idea of an inexpensive,
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.080]   usable and gas-powered machine
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:29.080]   that has a really good reliability and good range.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.960]   And simply say, now we have to make something like that
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.600]   because that's the consumer base that we now live in.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.680]   I mean, anyway.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.920]   - The first draft of this follow-up was 5,000 birds.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.800]   I said, okay, now I have to actually delete all of that
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.800]   and start a lot of your notes.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.720]   This can't be a 5,000 word thing.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.640]   - It is complicated.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.200]   And I think it's a fascinating subject.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.120]   I don't know though.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.160]   And it's been painful going through this process.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.600]   But at the end of the day,
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.920]   I'm not feeling too bad about the process for either company.
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:04.040]   I almost feel like this is how it was supposed to work,
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.200]   that Apple got made whole.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.280]   Samsung is gonna pay a billion dollars,
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.640]   but that's not gonna break the bank.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.280]   They're gonna move forward.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.120]   And let's hope that we continue to see innovation from,
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.520]   that would be the only thing that concerned me,
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:20.840]   that this would have a chilling effect on other Android phones.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.400]   And I don't think it's going to.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.920]   We're gonna take, so anyway.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.560]   - As Rich is ready, by the way,
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.400]   two points go.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.640]   - We can get Rich Siegel on now,
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.880]   and we also have Renee.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.400]   Speaking of Rich, Renee Richie is joining us
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.600]   from iMoor.com from Montreal.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.760]   And actually it's good timing because iMoor has been absolutely,
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.400]   in this cycle, the leader on iPhone rumors,
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.680]   we are gonna stop talking about Samsung,
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:43.880]   which is going to give some people
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.480]   some real breath of relief.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.480]   And we're gonna move on and we'll talk about the new iPhone.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.320]   - Talk about Motorola.
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.640]   - Yeah, yeah, by the way.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.360]   The lawsuits, these are not going away.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.200]   I hate to tell you and we have to cover it.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:59.160]   And Motorola slash Google's suing, Apple now.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.520]   And so this is gonna continue on for some time to come.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.760]   And this is just, you know, what I found interesting,
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.960]   we had an Eli Patel from The Verge,
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.120]   who is an attorney on Sunday.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.000]   And he said, it just doesn't get coverage.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.280]   This is kind of a way of life in many businesses.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.840]   There's constant kind of suits back and forth.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.600]   It gets a lot of coverage 'cause it's Apple and it's Samsung.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.320]   But really, this is not that unusual.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:25.560]   And it is kind of the way of the world.
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.960]   And as long as everybody feels like they're getting made whole
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.720]   and business goes on, and most importantly for our consumers,
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.960]   we continue to have choice and innovation,
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.720]   I don't think it's so horrible.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:36.720]   We're gonna take a break.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.600]   Renee has been knocking it out of the park at imore.com
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:40.880]   with the iPhone rumors.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.480]   He is the king.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.160]   The king of rumors will find out what the latest is.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.200]   We've got some big announcements.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.640]   This is the next two weeks, next three weeks,
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.640]   are gonna be bringing everybody lots of news
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.560]   about lots of phones and other devices.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.720]   We'll talk about some of the rumors in just a bit.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.000]   You're watching Mac Break Weekly, Andy Enoco,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.560]   Renee Richie, and Mes will get Rich Segal on.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.760]   We got room for more.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.400]   We're gonna go from a two man show to a five man show
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.280]   in just a second, unless you include the I.C.E.O.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.200]   I say five men in a puppet.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.720]   But first, a word from our friends at Citrix
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.800]   and go to meeting summertime.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.320]   People are out of the office.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.040]   It's hard to have meetings, staff meetings,
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.160]   planning meetings, collaboration.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:24.520]   Hard to pitch clients, go to meeting makes it easy.
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:27.960]   Their online screen sharing is the easiest, most effective,
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.480]   and by the way, most secure way to meet.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.040]   And now, they've added HD faces,
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.160]   which means you can use your camera
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:38.120]   on your computer, Mac PC or your iPad to join a meeting
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.720]   to see who you're meeting with.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:40.800]   That is just so cool.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:44.280]   And the video you've gotta try it is so crystal clear.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.120]   They've really figured this thing out.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.920]   We're actually talking to them about using this instead
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.160]   of Skype 'cause it really looks so good.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.080]   I want you to visit gotomeeting.com
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.880]   and look at the features.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.880]   See if you might wanna use this in your business.
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.000]   If you do 30 day trial awaits you,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.480]   just click the orange try it free button.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.680]   The promo code for our show is Mac break.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.440]   So click the try it free button,
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.200]   click the promo code link there,
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:11.400]   and just do me a favor type in MACBREAK
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.000]   so that we get credit for that.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.040]   And you can try it free for 30 days
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.800]   as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.640]   It's really easy.
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.160]   You'll see how easy it is to set up meetings,
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:22.080]   how easy it is, and this is important for your clients
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.400]   'cause you don't wanna make them jump through hoops
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.840]   to see your sales presentation.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.520]   We use it all, literally, we use it all the time here
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.360]   and love it.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:32.240]   Go to meeting.com offer code is MAC break.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.680]   Renee, unless you're champing at the bit to say something,
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.680]   all right, I'll give you one paragraph
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.480]   on Apple's Samsung Renee Richie.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.600]   It's a nascent industry.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.120]   This stuff is all still shaking out.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.600]   There'll be a lot more patents to it,
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.840]   but hopefully some resolution
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.960]   in the entire industry can go forward,
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.320]   unencumbered by innovative blocks
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.760]   by either theft or by litigation.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:53.600]   There you go.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.080]   That's the right answer, by the way.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.240]   And TURSER.
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.520]   (laughing)
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:00.440]   Either Andy or I could manage it.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.280]   But I think that that's right.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.160]   It's a nascent industry.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.240]   I think we, I hope we get software patent reform.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:09.760]   These are clearly too long of a term for software patents.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.120]   Actually, we've got a guy who might have something to say
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.880]   about that, Rich Segal is very well known
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.520]   in the MAC developer community,
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:21.440]   the creator of Bare Bones software, YoGimbo,
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.440]   their database program.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:27.440]   And of course, the single most used text editor
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.760]   on the MAC platform.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:32.280]   In fact, I just downloaded the latest version of BBEdit.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.880]   It gets better all the time
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:36.920]   and so many programs and websites that you use
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.360]   were created in BBEdit.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.800]   And this is the man who created BBEdit.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:42.160]   Rich Segal, thank you for joining us with your,
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.040]   is it a macaw parrot?
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.080]   - This is Bruno, he's a great,
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.560]   I'm African gray parrot and thank you for having me.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.080]   - So your take on all of this,
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.980]   and in particular on software patents.
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:57.360]   - Oh, that's a delicate issue, isn't it?
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.640]   - Yeah, 'cause on the one hand,
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.200]   you'd like to protect your software patents.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.000]   Do you have any patents, Rich?
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.120]   - No, I don't.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.320]   I know some folks who do, but--
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.800]   - Why don't you?
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:12.800]   - Well, personally, I consider software
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:17.240]   to ride that line somewhere between art and engineering.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:21.720]   And it's a copyrighted work.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.560]   It's, you know, in some cases,
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:25.640]   you could argue a work of art.
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:28.640]   And most of the time,
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.920]   and I emphasize most because it's not all of the time,
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.040]   but most of the time,
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.680]   software processes are really more like math
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:41.760]   and they're not something I would personally consider
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.200]   to be patentable.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.240]   Now, right now, there are probably howls of outrage
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:49.080]   from people who have software patents or think otherwise.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.640]   And, you know, obviously everybody's got
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.360]   a different viewpoint on it, but that's mine.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.960]   - I think that's a reasonable viewpoint.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.920]   And there's also, to me, there's the issue of term,
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:04.560]   because after all, software is ages faster than fish.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.320]   I mean, it doesn't, you know, to say 17 years,
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:10.280]   nobody can use tap to zoom for 17 years
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:14.520]   is not good for society.
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.320]   And the whole point of a patent is to not merely protect
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:21.520]   content holders, but also to move society forward.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.840]   - Well, right, the point of the patent, really, as I see it,
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:29.840]   is to give the inventor of a device or a process
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:35.080]   the ability to benefit commercially from it.
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:38.000]   And now that doesn't mean that nobody else can use it.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.880]   You know, if there's a patent on tapping
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.480]   to do something in particular, then okay,
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.000]   all that really means is that if you wanna do the same thing,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.720]   you have to do a license with the original patent owner.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.120]   So there's nothing preventing anybody
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.400]   from doing the same thing.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.360]   Obviously, if they knowingly infringe on a patent,
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.120]   you know, like a trademark or a copyright,
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.000]   if you knowingly infringe on a patent,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.040]   you're gonna end up in trouble.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.120]   - Right.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.280]   And I guess to Samsung, 30 bucks a phone
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.840]   is not looking like such a bad deal now.
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:14.800]   - That's a lot of money per phone if you, if it was.
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.400]   - If it was heavily discounted out too.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:20.320]   - Yeah, if you look at somebody off for Windows Cross license,
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.320]   I think like it ended up being a $9 for a Windows phone
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:26.600]   and it was significantly less than $30
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.920]   after all the discounts.
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.040]   - It is said, no one knows that Microsoft gets five bucks
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.560]   on every Android phone sold.
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.200]   - And if you look at the cost of goods sold
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.880]   for any given phone, you'll find that 30 bucks
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.920]   is a significant fraction of that.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:41.760]   - Right, yeah. - Right.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.280]   - More than half probably, yeah.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.120]   - Supposedly, the breakdowns that I've seen
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.040]   is depending on the model of the Samsung phone
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.080]   that represents anywhere from a quarter
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.960]   to about a half of the profit they have on each device.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.160]   So that's-- - The judge busted her butt
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.320]   to get the two together twice she demanded
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:00.280]   that the CEO's talk was not able to get a settlement.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:04.120]   - Maybe now, both sides will inch a little bit closer
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.840]   to the center and we can get some sort of a resolution.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.480]   But we're gonna move on, I said we'd move on
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.560]   and I do wanna move on.
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.240]   But I'm glad we got you Rich Segal, Renee Richie,
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:17.240]   Andy Inaco, Shock, and I'm gonna let Renee talk about this one.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.240]   We've been staying, we've been assuming everybody thought
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.960]   their NFC near field communications capability
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.040]   be built into the next generation iPhone.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.120]   It's something that a number of Android phones have.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.240]   It is a great feature where you tap a pay point,
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.960]   we actually have little Samsung tech tiles
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:37.760]   out in our lobby if you tap a Nexus or a S3 against it.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:38.880]   It goes, "Bruh duh duh!"
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.480]   And it checks you in on four square.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:45.600]   This is a nice feature that if Apple were to include it
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.080]   in the phone with their Apple wall,
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.640]   it might really be a transformation
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.120]   in the way we pay for stuff.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:55.640]   But Renee, you're saying as of today, no NFC,
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.080]   what's the story?
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:59.240]   - I never heard there would be NFC yet,
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.000]   but I never heard there wouldn't be either.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.920]   And then Anand Tech wrote a piece about how the metal back,
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.240]   given the size of the glass radio panels,
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.160]   wouldn't really be conductive to NFC,
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.800]   and Jim Dalrymple of the loop gave it one of his famous yeps,
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:17.680]   which is industry jargon for confirming there's no NFC.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:19.600]   But the thing with Apple is they don't really talk
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:21.280]   about technology, they talk about features.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.560]   So they wouldn't say there's NFC in the new iPhone,
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.280]   they would say, "You can pay at JC and any of your starbucks
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.320]   "within your iPhone."
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:28.680]   And that doesn't mean NFC.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.720]   They already take payments at Apple stores
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.720]   using the Apple Store app.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.600]   If they have Bluetooth 4.0 on these phones,
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:37.160]   there's a huge amount of connectivity they could do that way
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.000]   for mobile payments.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.160]   It just means that they're not incorporating
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.840]   an NFC radio in this phone.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.400]   - Well, that's a big deal though.
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:48.720]   So Anand's analysis is NFC antennas are big inductors,
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.640]   and they have to be fairly large,
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.600]   that create a magnetic field coupled
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.600]   between a host and peer device.
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.280]   So the antenna is a big coil of wire
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.880]   with as many wires as possible, tightly wound together.
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:02.680]   And in fact, this is true.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:06.160]   If you put the tech tile that we have on a metal surface,
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.240]   it stops it from working.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.920]   It needs to be either on an non-conductive surface
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:15.920]   or in a special shielded container, plastic container.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:21.080]   And the issue is that having a huge ground plane,
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:24.520]   in this case, a unibody metal back case
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.640]   in the way of the NFC antenna
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.240]   will degrade its performance.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.920]   And based on where they're seeing the space for the NFC chip,
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:36.040]   and again, this is all based on these leaked pictures
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:39.920]   of what the body or the case will look like,
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.040]   they say that this would not work,
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.720]   that in fact can't be an NFC chip.
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.720]   - You need FITZ's law writ large for these things.
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.280]   If you have an NFC antenna,
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.160]   you don't want people having to put a millimeter big square
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.200]   on a tiny millimeter square,
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.600]   you want a fairly large radius
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:56.880]   so that they can wave it
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:00.240]   and not have a bad experience or a frustrating experience.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:03.960]   - So you're saying that Passbook doesn't require NFC,
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.320]   well, we know it doesn't, because you can use it now.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.240]   - Yes, Passbook would be a fantastic interface
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:10.000]   for mobile payments, but right now it's set up
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.600]   as a repository for tickets and coupons and vouchers.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.200]   And Apple doesn't always move quickly.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.040]   I mean, they've set a lot of stuff up now
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.720]   that they'll realize in a year or two.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.480]   So I think they've been predicting NFC in the iPhone
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:24.080]   since 2010, and it's always, oh, maybe next year.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.760]   So it just looks like this is the next.
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:28.200]   - What's the technology that they use in the Apple Store?
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.000]   Is it a QR code?
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.520]   - No, it's just the Apple Store app.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:34.080]   You come in, you--
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:34.920]   - Well, how does it know?
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.200]   - Enter your Apple Store password.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.480]   They use a lot of the honor system surprisingly.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.320]   I mean, they--
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.000]   - Yeah, there was a kid got arrested the other day
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.040]   for walking out of an Apple Store with a product.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.160]   - It uses location-based,
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.760]   they have a lot of geofencing technology.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.200]   I mean, it's a very roundabout way of doing what they're doing,
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.360]   but it's so far all they've been experimenting with.
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.960]   - An Apple Store customer was arrested for shoplifting.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:58.720]   He says, "I was trying to use easy-paced self checkout."
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:48:59.800]   He's a New Jersey teenager.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:03.520]   He was at the Fifth Avenue Apple Store in Manhattan.
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.640]   He was arrested for allegedly attending
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.200]   a shoplift to pair of headphones.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.040]   He says--
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:09.880]   - I don't know, and con, too.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.200]   I mean, a lot of people put their password in by accident.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.400]   Like, oh, I did it wrong by accident and then walk out.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.080]   - He says he scanned the barcode on a pair of Bose headphones,
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:20.520]   navigated the process, but failed to complete his purchase.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.440]   And then, of course, he was stopped by employees
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.440]   as he's going out.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:28.640]   And he says, "Oh, I realize this still showed the pay now button,
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:32.280]   so make sure you push the pay button."
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:34.480]   - But also, doesn't that make you think about
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:36.840]   exactly what's going on behind the scenes
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:40.520]   to make sure there's an analog component that says,
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.360]   did we get--
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:42.200]   - Yeah.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.040]   - Did we just get verification?
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.200]   - Yeah, I'm walking out with headphones.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:47.480]   Was there a verification of a product actually sold, if not--
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.640]   - They'll apparently pay attention.
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.560]   - I think the four-quarters is like, you know,
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:54.520]   it's like an Indiana Jones movie where there's like
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.080]   hidden blow darts on the sides of an automatically fire,
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:59.560]   if you don't pay it, like, "I can't bring him down."
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:02.040]   - There must be a big red sign over the door that,
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:02.880]   you know, they only--
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.320]   - It's pretty--
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.240]   - It could be as simple as why there was no 3G
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.200]   on the original iPhone that Apple's waiting
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:10.960]   for a critical mass of NFC support in all these stores
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:14.320]   or some form of standard mobile payment transaction system
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.120]   to be established before they enter the market.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.920]   - Well, I think it was also our hope
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.480]   that Apple would jumpstart NFC by including it
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.840]   and that, you know, if Apple put, you know,
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.480]   it's clapped behind NFC and put it in all the phones,
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.680]   then, you know, it's a chicken and egg, right?
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.520]   - Yeah.
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.240]   - If Apple's waiting for them, they're waiting for us
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.560]   or Apple or--
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:34.560]   - But also Renee really said it correctly.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:38.400]   Renee put it correctly and that Apple really does go
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:41.880]   for features as opposed to actually putting in hardware
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:44.480]   and given that NFC also has some problems with it,
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.640]   I mean, if I want--
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.080]   If somebody wanted to rewrite an NFC tag
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.160]   for most of the phones that actually use them,
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.320]   so let's say someone peels off the NFC tag
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.720]   at a certain thing, reprogram, reprogram,
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:57.680]   reprogrammed it to do everything that it was supposed to do,
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:01.920]   log you into four square, connect you to the office wifi,
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:05.480]   but also visit a URL that will basically load up malware
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.360]   on your device.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.960]   There's very, very little, very few safeguards on most phones
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.120]   to prevent that from happening.
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:13.200]   So it's not quite, it's not, it's, I use NFC tags
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.560]   in my house, my car, all the time, I love them.
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:18.440]   But there's, maybe it's not necessarily there yet.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:21.440]   And also for electronic payments,
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:25.200]   this concept of just putting in a code on the screen
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.280]   that can be read by a camera
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:31.480]   is a surprisingly muscular and effective way to do payments.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:36.200]   I've talked to people who build a point of sale terminals
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.680]   and they say that it's something that they already have
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.760]   systems that integrate cameras into the software.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.280]   So they already have hardware that does that.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:44.800]   They don't have to build and deploy new gear
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.400]   for these terminals.
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.520]   And it's, at least one of the engineers I talked to
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.640]   actually prefers that and that it's a lot less hassle.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.840]   It's a lot easier to read.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:54.440]   The code libraries are a lot more secure.
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.000]   And in terms of making sure this person actually paid
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.840]   for the thing that they're about to pay for,
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.000]   they feel as though there's a lot less hassle involved.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.640]   So it's not a definitive survey of people
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:06.080]   who develop the software, but I was surprised to find out
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:08.120]   that the somewhat low tech solution
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.640]   is actually very, very favorable for a lot of people.
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:14.000]   - So let's take a break and come back
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.320]   and I wanna get the rumor rundown.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.160]   The rumor rundown.
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:21.000]   And then, 'cause we're getting close.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.960]   The silly season will begin tomorrow
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:27.680]   with the IFA, the big conference in Berlin
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:31.040]   where Samsung will announce Galaxy Note 2.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:33.720]   And then I think September 5th,
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.880]   there's a Nokia announcement,
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.680]   there's a Motorola announcement of September the 6th.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:38.680]   - Amazon as well.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.320]   - Amazon, is that the 5th or the 6th?
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.840]   - 6th is 6th is Amazon.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:46.280]   They're gonna announce probably a new Kindle Fire.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:49.600]   And then I'm sure there's other stuff stuck in there.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:51.720]   I don't even LG and everybody else.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.760]   And then September 12th, we think.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:56.040]   I think, but I'm gonna ask Renee 'cause he knows.
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:00.000]   Or maybe Jim Dalrymple will just kind of materialize
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.520]   and say, "Yep."
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.320]   - Why Jim, what have you been, I gotta ask you,
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:06.400]   what is it about Jim Dalrymple that he is,
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.400]   he doesn't work for Apple?
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.600]   - The beard commands respect.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.560]   - What is it, here's a picture of him with Slash.
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.560]   So there you go, that's.
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:18.280]   - You should, you should have, Leo,
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:20.640]   you should honestly have Jim under contract
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.680]   where he doesn't have to appear on the shows.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.800]   You'll just have like a big green light on set
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.200]   with the word, "Yup, I'm gonna do it."
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:27.720]   - The Jim, the Dalrymple light.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.080]   - You have to simply push a big button.
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:31.200]   - That's a great idea, I could have a Dalrymple light.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.680]   - Three.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:35.200]   - Does he work, he doesn't work for Apple, right?
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:36.440]   - No, he runs the loop inside.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:37.880]   He worked for Macworld for a long time,
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.120]   but now he has his own show.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.720]   And he doesn't introduce a lot of rumors,
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:45.680]   but he will confirm the ones that he feels like confirming.
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:47.320]   - And he's always right?
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.360]   - He's got an incredibly good track record
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:51.360]   for Apple stories.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:52.680]   - Yup.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:54.000]   - He knows a lot of people,
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.080]   and he's got just unbelievably good connections,
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:04.080]   and he's got a perfect balance of well connectedness
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:05.360]   and discretion.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:07.600]   So he doesn't put a lot of stock in,
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.920]   just sort of blabbing about everything he comes across.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.960]   It's more a matter of,
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:15.000]   if he says something or confirms something,
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.760]   the odds are better than even,
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.440]   in fact way better than even,
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:21.560]   that he has a primary source.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:22.480]   - Yeah.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.760]   And they talk to him 'cause they know
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.240]   he's not gonna write the story.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.720]   The worst that'll happen is he'll go,
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:28.880]   "Yup, or nope."
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.680]   Does he ever go, "Nope."
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.760]   - He has on occasion gone, "Nope."
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.560]   It had to be a pretty unlander story though.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.400]   - Nope.
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.440]   - Yeah, in Rhode Island terms, Jim knows a guy.
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:39.440]   - He knows a guy.
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:40.280]   - He knows a guy.
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.120]   - Yeah.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.200]   - When there was a rumor that Apple had put out the iPhone
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.760]   in August, I believe he noped it.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.240]   - He noped it.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.840]   And he was right.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:48.640]   All right, well, we're gonna see what Jim has said,
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:51.200]   "Yup, too," in just a moment before,
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.760]   on a rumor roundup.
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:54.000]   This should be a new feature on the show
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.440]   'cause we only have a couple more weeks.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:58.520]   By the way, just a point of interest,
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:00.680]   we are presumably, we still, by the way,
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:01.520]   Apple's not set up,
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.240]   and my wrong Apple has not said anything yet
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.840]   about an announcement.
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:05.680]   - No, and they don't usually,
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:07.760]   I mean, Andy could really speak to this the best,
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:08.600]   but they don't invite people
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.280]   until almost the last minute.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:13.000]   - So Andy has learned, and he has already booked a flight.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.960]   - Yep.
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:18.320]   - We'll find out exactly one week
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.320]   before the date that they actually do it.
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.160]   - Well.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:23.320]   - I feel good enough to commit to flying out,
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.920]   but after that, who knows?
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:26.320]   - And we're putting you out.
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:30.200]   - As I said, I was asked to do one more iPhone 5
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:32.360]   rumor piece today, and at the end,
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.080]   the only smart thing to say is that the only thing
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:35.520]   I know that's gonna happen on September,
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.400]   and the week of September 12th,
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.040]   is that I'm going to get in and out burger
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:40.040]   at Fisherman's Wharf.
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:42.000]   (laughing)
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.840]   - That's confirmed.
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.680]   - Get it here first.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:44.520]   - That's confirmed.
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:45.360]   - And we're paying for it.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:46.200]   - And we're paying for it.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.400]   - But so we will, if they do it on Wednesday,
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.320]   the 12th will flip-flop,
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.680]   as we always do with security now,
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.520]   and we'll have live coverage of the Apple event,
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:53.440]   as we always do,
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:57.280]   and maybe we'll have the I-CEO sit in for Tim Cook.
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.960]   We need a Tim Cook doll, that's the problem.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:03.840]   And he can, and we can actually act out the keynote.
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:05.280]   You should definitely do that, Leo,
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.280]   'cause that will definitely
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:07.720]   repair your relationship with Apple.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:09.440]   (laughing)
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.880]   - I wanna do a dramatization,
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.600]   and it should say dramatized,
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.360]   and we can have a fake little stage,
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:17.120]   and I can get the puppet.
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:19.000]   Maybe I could get Brian Hogg.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:19.840]   - Yes.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.480]   - And make me a Tim Cook puppet.
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.680]   - Spectacular.
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.080]   - And we'll just act it out.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.720]   But Andy, I do have this for you.
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:27.960]   We're gonna review this a little later on,
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.800]   on the GizWiz show.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:33.360]   This is a feature we do on the GizWiz called Crap,
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:35.120]   I found at Sky Mall.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.120]   And what we do is we pick three things
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:43.480]   to review, and then we ask the audience to vote,
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:46.160]   and they voted that I should review the Skyrest pillow.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:47.920]   This is an inflatable pillow
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:51.080]   that basically takes over the entire row,
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.960]   that you then sleep on,
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:56.200]   and you just better hope that nobody wants to get up.
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.040]   So I'm gonna review it later today,
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.760]   but we realize that it needs to be reviewed
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:00.840]   by somebody in an airplane,
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.000]   and you're the next person
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.080]   who will be getting in an airplane on the Twitch staff.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:08.320]   So I'm gonna be happy to be glad that,
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:11.520]   and thought evil things by everybody else there in Route 12.
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:12.960]   - I'm gonna FedEx this out to you
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.520]   after we do our review.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:16.520]   I will not blow it up before I say this.
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:19.480]   I'm sorry, I have to review this.
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:20.640]   If anybody asks, I'll say,
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:24.560]   you mean you didn't pay the extra $12 for the airbag seat?
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:26.280]   Well, good luck to you.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:28.560]   If there's a crash, I pity you.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.480]   And I will air it out, 'cause I don't know,
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:33.360]   I haven't opened the bag yet,
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:34.480]   but I'm just getting the feeling
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.720]   this thing is not gonna smell that good.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:37.560]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.560]   A little bit of petroleum.
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:42.560]   - What I love about products like this is that
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:45.360]   I can see that this was somebody's dream,
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:47.160]   and they've been working on it for 10 years,
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:49.920]   and their spouses and their children are like,
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:51.960]   you're not putting another 40,000.
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:54.040]   This is not gonna, just you see,
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:55.840]   they said the same thing about the spank,
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:57.080]   and now look at it.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:59.080]   The blanket, I came up with that idea.
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:01.320]   Didn't support me, and now we're not rich.
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:02.320]   (laughing)
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:03.920]   To the moon, baby.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:05.640]   - As seen on Sky Mall Magazine.
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:08.520]   So it's gotta be airline approved.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:10.440]   Anyway, that's coming up a little later
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:12.560]   on in the show today, in the gizmos.
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:14.960]   - I'm well taken care of, but.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:17.040]   - Twit, you know, we'll send you a slanket too.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.360]   I've got a slanket running around, I can send you.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.240]   Then you really be, people will go,
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:23.240]   there's a nutcase in aisle 20.
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:24.680]   - Good way to get the whole road be making
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:25.760]   fun of the slanket.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:27.760]   - Oh, you're a slanket fan, Rich?
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:30.080]   - We have several in the house, I'm not saying anymore.
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:32.360]   (laughing)
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:33.200]   - I have.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.600]   - I have a Google slanket.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.040]   - It's pure polyester, and I just pray
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:39.600]   a Denver comes near open flame,
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:42.400]   'cause I will be not in good shape.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.280]   Our program today brought to you in part
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.600]   by Ford Motor Company, who wants you to know
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:51.600]   about their new social site, social.ford.com.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:53.440]   This is an interesting idea.
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:57.400]   I guess the idea is, and it's absolutely true,
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:59.160]   as a Ford owner, I know, that we,
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:02.520]   Ford owners are kind of fanatical about our vehicles,
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:05.680]   and want to share our experiences, our photos, our videos,
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:08.360]   talk with Ford engineers, read about what Ford's up to,
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:11.120]   get a badge, I've already got the Mustang badge.
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:13.960]   You can also get, there's a tech geek badge.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.520]   (laughing)
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:19.160]   So, I like it, that, I'm pretty sure is an NFC chip,
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:21.680]   but I could be wrong, but it sure looks like an NFC chip
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:24.320]   with a Ford Edge built into it.
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.560]   Lots of cool, lots of cool badges,
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:29.560]   and lots of actual useful information in the articles.
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:33.240]   In fact, I wrote one forum about a conversation I had
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.760]   with Jim Butchkowski, he's one of their lead technologists
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:38.800]   about new technologies that are coming in Ford vehicles.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.560]   You could find that in the technology section.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:44.000]   We talked a lot about my favorite Ford product,
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.040]   which is Ford Sync.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:48.480]   Just love, love my sync, so he's talking about
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:50.880]   some of the apps and so forth.
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.040]   There's also a place for your ideas,
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:55.320]   and you can read other people's ideas as well.
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:58.280]   So, if you have something you'd like to see
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:03.080]   in your next Ford vehicle, in a variety of categories,
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:08.440]   just go to Ford, social.ford.com.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.080]   And if you read an idea you like,
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.520]   convenience, green, infotainment, performance,
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:15.320]   personalization, safety, if you read an idea you like,
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.880]   you can vote it up or down too.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.640]   Great stuff.
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.760]   I think they've done a neat job.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.920]   This is a nice site, and there's a lot going on there.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.920]   Why don't you visit social.ford.com
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.800]   and then of course visit your Ford dealer and drive one.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:33.560]   Today, Snubs is driving around the 2012 Ford Focus Electric,
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.640]   and she's saying, "I love this car."
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:38.200]   She's only got it for a week though.
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.040]   I'm jealous.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.280]   I know.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.920]   I said, "Come up and give me a ride."
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.080]   Anyway, social.ford.com,
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.720]   and we thank Ford for their support of Mac Break.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.000]   Weekly.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.560]   Rich Siegel is here from Bare Bones Software.
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.120]   When did you come out with a new BB edit?
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.000]   'Cause I just, you know, I'm slow.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:56.840]   I just got it.
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:59.120]   And I love it.
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.320]   We did BB out of 10 a while back,
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.120]   but we had an update just this spring.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.360]   Maybe that's it.
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:05.200]   Yeah.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.040]   Yeah.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:06.880]   Love it.
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:07.880]   We're doing that kind of thing.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:11.240]   Turn updates, fix bugs, add features.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.080]   Life goes on.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.920]   You know my favorite, there's a couple of amazing things.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:15.840]   You know, the grep is great.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.200]   I use the search and replace,
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.040]   the advanced search and replace all the time.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.760]   It's a great way for text processing.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.120]   It's great for coders.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.320]   But I really love,
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.680]   and this was something that I love so much
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:29.280]   in the Mac programmer's workshop, MPW.
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.680]   They had worksheets.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.080]   I should show people.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.880]   They had worksheets that were basically command lines
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:39.040]   in the worksheet.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.600]   So you could select it and execute it.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.040]   And you've got it BB edit, and I just love it.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:47.520]   Don't ever take that out, okay?
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:48.360]   I won't.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:49.360]   It'll be there forever.
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:50.840]   Star Wars, as long as I can keep it.
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:54.120]   You must have used MPW,
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.400]   'cause it's just exactly what it is.
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.920]   Yeah, MPW was an important part of my tool chain
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.400]   when I was growing up.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.160]   Growing up great.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:06.360]   You know, the worksheets were an inspiration
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:09.600]   for the shell worksheets that are in BB edit.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:13.000]   And one of the things I use it for all the time is,
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.760]   once in a while I'll have a large-scale batch
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.240]   source control operation.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:22.880]   And doing that from the command line is just
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.200]   frequently painful.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:29.040]   I'll generate a bunch of output, throw it into worksheets,
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.520]   run searches and replaces and transformations on it,
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.560]   then select the whole thing and hit enter.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.920]   And it's saved, 'cause it's just a text file.
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:40.120]   So it's a really easy way to have some scripts
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.880]   that you do a lot available all the time.
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.240]   And I love the, I don't know,
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.240]   we're now doing a commercial for BB edit,
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.560]   but I don't mind 'cause I love it.
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:49.400]   Yeah, pile on.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.640]   - Every post that I do on IMOR is written in BB edit.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.480]   - No.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.040]   - Yes, I live in BB edit.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:56.320]   It's, the web stuff I do in CODA,
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.240]   but all the writing I do in BB edit.
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.440]   And it's just phenomenal.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:02.440]   There's, I literally don't think there's anything it can't do.
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.680]   If I find a new feature there every month or so,
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.640]   it's just a standard occurrence.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.280]   - BB edit, is there anything it can't do?
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:13.040]   - BB edit killed my dog.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.400]   (laughing)
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.720]   - You know, we get a surprising answer.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:16.560]   - I brought it back to life.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.480]   There's an OS upgrade.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.320]   (laughing)
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:22.480]   - Yeah, actually, I'll pile on too.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.840]   I use BB edit whenever I need a word processor
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.120]   that absolutely, positively just plain works
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.800]   without any appearance of a spinning beach ball cursor.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:32.120]   And so it's definitely the word processor I always use
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.280]   when I have to take notes during a phone meeting.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:39.280]   It's always open on my desktop and it's a wonderful power tool.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.800]   Here's to 20 years more.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:42.640]   - 20 years?
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.240]   Is it really that long?
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.760]   - Yeah, 20 years.
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.320]   - Wow, let me just, I'll show you this.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.840]   I don't know, we shouldn't be going on and on about it.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.400]   Show Unix worksheet.
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:55.160]   So this is just a text editor, right?
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:59.040]   But if you decide you wanna execute a line
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:01.720]   or multiple lines, like I can, I can do,
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:02.880]   this is hello world.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.960]   (laughing)
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.920]   - It just don't do R minus RF
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.000]   because you're gonna be--
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.400]   - It is here, I could do that.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.720]   And then it just, and then what is it?
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.360]   Command enter, I can't remember.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.720]   - Or just hit the Enter key.
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:15.560]   - Enter key, okay, let me do it again.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.040]   It executes this and then it puts the results,
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.520]   whoops, that's wrong.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.080]   Oh, I'm on a Mac, that's why.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:23.800]   I mean, I'm on a, air, there you go.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:26.360]   And so then it executes it and I did something wrong.
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:27.960]   There it goes, the hard way.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.760]   And it puts the result in the text.
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:35.680]   So this is a really handy way to keep your common
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:37.400]   command lines in here.
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.840]   - Right, and of course you can not only edit
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.280]   the command lines to do what you need,
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.800]   you can also edit the output.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.320]   - Right, so now I have the output
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.920]   and I could process that further and so forth.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.640]   - If you save to Dropbox, all that good stuff,
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.280]   you have them be better, just everywhere.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.320]   - Yep, very sweet.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.960]   Anyway, a free plug.
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:54.880]   (laughing)
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.080]   'Cause it doesn't suck, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.880]   (laughing)
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:02.200]   Moving along, let's talk about rumors.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:05.880]   - Little birdie told me, I never mind.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:09.600]   - Oh, did he, he's talking to you right now.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.720]   Does he know anything we should know?
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.280]   - Yeah, I don't know, Bruno, what do you know?
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:18.280]   Do they come, you go to the developer meetings and so forth.
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:22.200]   And so you can't talk about anything
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.560]   they tell you there, right?
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.280]   - Right, stuff at the developers conference,
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.200]   except for the actual opening keynote is--
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.040]   - Private.
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.760]   - The rest of it's all under non-disclosure.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.400]   - Right, so anything as WWDC is out.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.920]   Is that the only way they communicate?
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:37.560]   They don't say, I mean, look, people at Apple
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.400]   use BB yet like crazy.
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:42.360]   They don't go, hey, rich, by the way.
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.960]   - You might wanna-- - Well, you know, I know a guy.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.320]   (laughing)
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.960]   - Jim Dalryple.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:51.840]   - As with any large organization,
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:56.240]   you make friends in the company and they're honest
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.880]   and they stick to the rules and they don't tell you
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.040]   anything that you don't need to know.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:04.360]   So it's not like I can fire up an eye chat
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.640]   or pick up the phone and call a guy that I know there
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.360]   and say, so what's coming with the iPhone?
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.440]   What's the story on that?
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:13.200]   Nobody will tell me that anymore
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.080]   than they would tell anyone else.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:18.080]   But every once in a while,
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.640]   I might get a technical heads up on something like,
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.560]   we see that you're doing this,
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:26.880]   you might want to know that with the next version of the OS,
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.360]   if you make this code change,
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.240]   it'll work extra special better.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.640]   - Did Mountain Lion change?
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.640]   - Little things like that, which sort of,
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:39.560]   it's part of the professional collegial back and forth
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:43.200]   that you can have with not just Apple,
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.240]   but really anyone else.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.200]   - Did Mountain Lion change anything for you?
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.800]   Did you have to, was that a big difference in any way?
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:51.480]   - No, not a huge difference.
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:53.480]   There are some new features in the OS
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:58.480]   which we're gonna begin adopting as they mature.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:03.760]   Most of the really huge changes were in 10/7.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.000]   - Right.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.520]   - But they've been refined and improved in 10/8.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:10.480]   So we're sort of moving along with that.
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:11.880]   - If you're just tuning in,
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:14.760]   no, Rich doesn't have a slide whistle,
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.080]   he has an African gray.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:18.320]   - I have two of them.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.120]   - And they're talking to each other.
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.920]   That's cute.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.560]   I like it.
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.120]   All right, rumor around up, Renee, Richie,
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:29.240]   you really been, this has been I'mors year in terms of--
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:30.080]   - Thank you.
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.800]   - Yeah, amazing stuff, you've got great sources.
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:34.920]   What do we know, what don't we know about the,
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.960]   first of all, you seem convinced
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:39.320]   that there is going to be at least one announcement,
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.760]   September 12th.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.440]   - Yes, we heard about September 12th announcement
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:47.080]   back in July and then Dalrymple said,
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:51.200]   "Yeah, up and all things D confirmed it
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.480]   and other people have since heard likewise."
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:57.200]   I think there's a very high likelihood it'll be September 12th
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.560]   and almost certainly it'll be the next iPhone.
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:02.920]   It's about time for its product cycle.
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.760]   There's so many parts being seen now.
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:06.200]   I believe that's almost it.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:10.120]   Nothing is certain until Phil Schiller holds it up on stage
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.800]   but one step below that I think we're at right now.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:18.960]   - Then John Gruber last week performs a thought experiment.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:21.120]   I've been thinking, says Mr. Gruber,
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.760]   on daring fireball done that.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:25.960]   It makes more sense for Apple to hold two events.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:29.200]   An iPhone event focused solely on the new iPhone and iOS 6
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:31.720]   then the iPhone ships nine days later,
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:34.760]   a date you seem to also confirm Renee, right?
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:35.920]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:38.160]   - Then there's another wave of iPhone focused attention
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:42.760]   as the reviews come out then after it's all calmed down.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:44.960]   In the first or second week of October,
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.240]   Apple holds its traditional music event,
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:49.080]   normally the iPod event,
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.760]   exactly along the lines of events
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:54.080]   of which they've been debuting the new iPods for the last decade.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:58.840]   And it is that that Gruber in his thought experiment
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:03.040]   submits might be where a mini iPad might be released
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.600]   and then oddly enough the next day,
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.000]   John Pachowski in the All Things D says,
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.200]   yeah, as a matter of fact, there is gonna be two events.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:13.600]   And then in the loop, Jim Dalrymple says,
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.800]   "Oh, that Gruber is a smart fellow."
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:18.640]   (laughing)
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:19.680]   Is that a yep?
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:24.440]   - Yeah, that's his alternate version of a yep.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:25.640]   - Smart fellow.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.760]   - It's an interesting backstory.
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.960]   We originally, back in May, we heard that there'd be
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:31.760]   an October release for the iPad mini.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.760]   And then as it got into July,
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.520]   we started hearing that maybe Apple would do this one mega event
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:39.320]   and just kind of shock and awe or blot out the sun
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:41.640]   and release their entire product line.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.840]   But now it sounds like the October event
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:48.640]   will be the iPad mini and the iPods.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:49.480]   And I get the feeling,
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:50.600]   and this isn't anything I've heard officially,
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.520]   but I get the feeling that Apple might've thought
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.760]   that the Kindle Fire or the Nexus 7
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:57.560]   would've been much more successful than it's been so far
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.880]   and require more lead time
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.320]   so that people had an Apple alternative
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.080]   for the holidays rather than something else
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:06.280]   and more aggressive pricing to match the $200 price point
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:07.120]   of those devices.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.680]   But since they haven't sold an iPad numbers yet,
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.320]   there may not be as much pressure.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:15.960]   - So that second event,
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.120]   the other thing John says,
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:21.560]   it would be really nice if they announced a rewritten iTunes.
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:25.560]   I don't know if that's gonna happen or not.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.960]   Might that also be a content announcement?
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:30.160]   The day they announced their deals with the cable companies,
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:34.960]   maybe a new Apple TV or a set top box application for Apple TV?
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:38.840]   - Andy probably knows more about this,
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:41.480]   but the Apple television is one of those things
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:43.440]   that sits in a lab and one day if Apple gets
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:45.880]   a go to market strategy for it, they'll put it out,
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:47.480]   but I don't think it's imminent.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.880]   And negotiating with the cable company sounds
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.560]   just slightly less painful than the music industry.
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:56.120]   And that would probably be a significant long,
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:58.200]   drawn out, grueling process.
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.120]   So I don't know if we'll hear anything about that.
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:01.960]   Too quickly either.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:02.800]   - Yeah.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.280]   - I agree.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:07.200]   I don't think that the Apple, the Apple hyphen TV,
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.960]   as opposed to the Apple TV, is, I'm sure they've built it.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.880]   I'm sure they're thinking about it.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.000]   I'm sure they've got it ready to go.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.800]   If they decide they want to move on it,
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:18.920]   but I don't believe it's a scheduled product at this point.
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:21.120]   I think that they're putting more investment
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.000]   into improving the Apple TV more importantly
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.400]   and improving the content that's available
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.320]   on the current Apple TV box.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:30.680]   And you'll probably get more channels.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.920]   They put a little icon there and that icon becomes a channel.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:35.640]   Like today they pushed out the iTunes Festival apps.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.040]   So if you boot up your Apple TV now, there's a new icon there.
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.480]   And that'll probably be their strategy,
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.320]   making independent partner deals,
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.720]   almost like the original iPhone
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.480]   when they had the YouTube app on there.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.520]   They'll do specific deals with specific partners
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.480]   and push out those apps as they have them ready.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:53.280]   - Yeah, they added Hulu just last month.
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.560]   - It seems as though they can't even,
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:57.680]   they wouldn't even want to risk creating a whole new app
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.160]   and a whole new package of assembled
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.880]   and conglomerated content.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.200]   Because we've seen in the past two years
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.800]   that different cable companies, different content providers
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:10.000]   tend to come in and go out depending on what they're,
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.280]   what the whims of the CEOs are at any given moment.
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:16.200]   So if Apple were to simply create a brand new panel saying,
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.520]   "Here is your cable TV," that creates a problem
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:21.880]   if people decide to leave after a buddy,
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:23.240]   excuse me, if companies and providers
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.640]   decide to leave after a year and a half,
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.440]   I think it is going to be individual icons
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.080]   or individual content channels.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:31.400]   So that way they can have seven content partners
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:35.520]   on the day of launch, they can have five a year later,
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.000]   replace that with four more or three months after that,
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.400]   without it really looking as though
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.080]   it's either a total failure or whether or not
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.200]   this is not supposed to be something
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:47.920]   that is just an expected part of the Apple TV experience.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.600]   - I think it's also true that when you look at Apple,
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.360]   beyond the Apple TV hobby, they want to make devices
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:54.680]   that sell in a hundreds of millions of units.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.120]   That's what really interests them.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:59.640]   And that's why the iPad Mini, I think, is on their radar,
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.320]   because there are some people who,
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:05.240]   they look at an iPad and it is just either too large
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:08.120]   or too heavy or too expensive for them to buy
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.840]   and they don't necessarily want something else,
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:11.680]   they just want a lighter,
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.680]   and we've heard that this is going to be the iPad Mini
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.960]   is going to be about as thin as an iPod touch,
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.760]   which is kind of crazy thin at that size.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:21.360]   If you remove the barriers of size and price,
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.800]   then that becomes a very attractive thing
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:24.840]   to sell over the holidays.
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:27.640]   - Yeah, I think Apple has learned a lot about
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.600]   the relative successes of the Kindle Fire
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.720]   and the Nexus 7.
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.440]   It hasn't sold in iPad numbers,
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.920]   but it has demonstrated that there's a market for it.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:38.440]   And if there's people lined up with $250
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:40.320]   to spend on a smaller color tablet,
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.920]   I think Apple's going to want to go for it.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:43.840]   - I do admit that, and I've heard this from a lot of people,
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:47.040]   once you start using the Nexus 7, the iPad feels kind of big.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.480]   - Yeah, that's extremely true also.
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:54.240]   I do think that the iPad is, the iPad 10 inches,
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:56.520]   it's definitely a next generation device
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.880]   where five years from now,
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:00.440]   the majority of people's personal computers,
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.360]   like portable computers,
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.560]   could be devices exactly like the iPad.
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:05.640]   Until then, however, a seven inch tablet
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:07.800]   makes a nice bridge device between people
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.160]   who have a notebook at home
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.880]   that they don't necessarily need to carry with them,
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.880]   but they want something with a little bit more firepower
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:14.920]   than just a simple Kindle book reader.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:16.880]   So I think that's the sort of people
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:19.920]   that are going to be buying a 7.5 inch or 7.85 inch
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:22.880]   or whatever the size is of the new iPad.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:25.480]   And the thing that, at least from my understanding is
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:28.160]   that this is not going to be a big iPod touch.
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:30.320]   If you look at the Nexus 7,
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.120]   Google uses both smartphone and tablet interfaces.
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.640]   It's kind of a hybrid approach.
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:35.920]   Where Apple's going 100%,
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:38.960]   it is going to run the iPad iOS on that device,
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:41.200]   just scale down so that it's roughly the size
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:44.440]   of the iPhone buttons and interface elements.
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:46.880]   But that allows for a whole different class of software.
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.000]   You get iPad like,
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.360]   you actually get identical iPad applications,
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:51.400]   just running smaller,
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.200]   not smartphone applications blown up.
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:55.840]   And in my experience, that makes a huge difference.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:58.760]   - I'm a little bit curious if that's actually going to work out
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.200]   because I've got,
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.800]   and I'm not saying I disagree or I don't believe
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.280]   that there's going to be a scaled-out interface.
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:08.080]   What I believe is that they're going to use
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.880]   the scaled interface the same way
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.720]   that they use the scaled iPhone interface
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:12.560]   on the first iPad,
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:16.000]   where it's completely compatible with all existing iPad apps.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.840]   But the idea is that hopefully developers
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:20.400]   will start writing apps that are keyed
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.440]   towards the smaller display.
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:23.280]   I think it was Marco,
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:25.240]   who I'm meant to, yeah, correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:27.720]   who came up with this really interesting idea of saying,
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:28.720]   well, here's what you should do.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:31.280]   If you want to see what the interface on an iPad mini
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.120]   is going to look like,
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:33.760]   take a screenshot with user iPad,
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.280]   take a screenshot of an app,
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.120]   then turn it on,
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.240]   go open it up in the photo app and turn it on its side.
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:41.160]   It will be scaled down to almost completely the correct size.
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:42.600]   So what I then did,
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:44.320]   I'm sorry, there was Groob, Groob did that, yeah.
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.400]   My apologies.
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.040]   And so that was a cool idea and I tried that.
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:50.680]   And then the next thing I did was I said, okay,
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:53.360]   now I'm going to take a screenshot of this
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:56.520]   and then I'm going to open it up in an art app
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:58.960]   and choose a pen that's kind of small
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.360]   and choose a nice bright color
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:03.880]   and see how easy it is for me to hit all of these targets.
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:08.040]   And I was roughly 70% on every one of these targets.
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:10.520]   If you look at the resulting graphic,
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:13.800]   there's sort of a scatter plot of aimed and misfits.
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:17.160]   So I'm not sure if that's going to consider that as ideal.
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:21.000]   The second thing that I wonder about is that
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.840]   if these button sizes were in fact appropriate
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.560]   for this device,
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:29.520]   why did Apple choose not to use buttons of that size
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.360]   with the first generation iPad?
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.760]   I have no first information.
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.920]   This is just thoughts that sort of in my mind.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:37.960]   - I can talk to that a little bit.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.600]   So the iPhone and the iPad actually use
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.960]   the same size interface elements now.
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:45.400]   It's just because the pixel density of the iPad
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.480]   is lower than the iPhone.
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.760]   They are physically bigger.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:50.360]   They're the same dot size, but they're physically bigger.
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.880]   And when you go, when you shrink that down
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:54.280]   to 7.85 inches because the intensity
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:57.480]   of the device increases, it becomes the same size again.
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.640]   So the interface elements are the same as using an iPhone.
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.680]   If they go non-retin, it'll be exactly the same
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.840]   as an iPhone 3GS.
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:06.400]   It works great with an iPhone.
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:07.960]   It's basically Fittslog again.
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:09.280]   Because your hand is anchored
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:10.960]   and you're mostly using your thumb,
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.480]   it's very short distance to go.
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:14.880]   So you can be highly accurate with small elements.
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.880]   With an iPad, because you have to pick up your hand
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.480]   and move it, the accuracy drops.
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.480]   So the size increase becomes more important.
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.400]   With an iPad mini, you're kind of in between.
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.440]   So Andy's exactly right.
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:27.240]   It's a compromised solution, a different compromise
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:28.840]   than what Google chose with the Nexus 7,
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:32.000]   but everything in the end is a compromise.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.880]   People could tweak, it's my understanding
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:36.120]   that people are tweaking interfaces.
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:38.600]   Some things like the calendar buttons are too small.
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.040]   Right now, they actually are too small
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.120]   by Apple standards on the iPad.
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.160]   So that kind of stuff will probably change.
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:47.360]   The only concern I have is if Apple starts going
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:49.800]   to three interfaces, then those universal apps
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:52.400]   start getting really chunky because you have the iPhone version,
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:55.160]   the iPad mini version, and the iPad version.
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:58.560]   So my guess is Apple's gonna use things like auto layout
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:03.560]   and the general, sorry, UI, I'm losing my track.
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:08.000]   UI grid view, UI collect views and UI list views
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.480]   to make them naturally fit the size rather than have
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:14.960]   to individually code interfaces for all their devices.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.360]   - I'm glad I don't have to worry about this.
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.200]   (laughing)
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.040]   It is not obvious.
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.160]   - Rich, have you used the Nexus 7?
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:22.520]   Have you ever used a 7 inch tablet?
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:24.720]   - Yeah, we actually have an Nexus 7 in the house.
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:27.800]   And I have to say that it's a nice little machine.
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:31.520]   I still find myself preferring the iPad 7,
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:36.520]   but my wife has an Nexus 7 that she has wanted for a while.
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:40.760]   - So would you find a mini iPad compelling?
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.720]   - I would actually.
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:46.000]   I could see getting one for myself.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.320]   I find that the regular iPad, the standard sized iPad,
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:53.320]   occasionally is a little bit bigger than I like for comfort,
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:55.720]   especially when I'm reading, I'll read in bed
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:57.880]   and hold in the-- - Yeah, no, no.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:00.200]   It's a much better size for reading in the 7 inch.
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:01.240]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:02.720]   - But maybe, well, yeah, we'll see.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:04.480]   I could be interested.
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:06.360]   - I guess the question is what'll be the price point.
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:08.160]   Renee, have you heard anything about price point?
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.720]   That's a-- - Oh, originally we heard
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.760]   between $200 and $250.
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:13.960]   And I haven't heard anything different about that.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:15.720]   My guess is they are gonna be aggressive
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:18.000]   and they're gonna, it's that old Steve Jobs saying
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.600]   where he believes Apple made a mistake
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.880]   by going for profit instead of market share.
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.120]   Back in the early Apple days
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.160]   and they don't wanna make that mistake again.
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.840]   - I think you could be 50 bucks more than the Nexus 7.
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:30.760]   Your certainly perceived value is greater than 50 bucks more
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:31.600]   than the Nexus 7. - Yeah.
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.240]   - That would be easy. - Easy.
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:35.440]   An automatic buy.
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:38.560]   - If they go $200, it's a neutron bomb.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:40.760]   If they go $250, it's competitive.
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:43.360]   If they go significantly above $250,
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:45.600]   I wouldn't say it's a why bother proposition,
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:49.600]   but the value of increasing the price above that,
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:53.240]   relative to how successful that product can be,
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:55.800]   it's like it becomes a curve like this
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.480]   that every $10 they add to the price
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:00.200]   I think will significantly cut the success of the device.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.480]   - And just-- - We'll have to see
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:04.480]   because the iPod Touch starts at $200 for eight gig.
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:05.640]   - Right. - The sweet spot--
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.040]   - The sweet spot is it. - The sweet spot is three
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:09.240]   and the top of the line is four. - Right.
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:14.240]   - So, you know, are they gonna use the mini iPad
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:18.160]   as an opportunity to shake up the entire line?
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:21.720]   You know, maybe iPod Touch is, they say,
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:24.480]   "Okay, well, we're done amortizing our costs on that.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:27.320]   Let's just cram the price into the floor
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.920]   and make it an entry leader."
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.120]   - Yeah. - And then the iPad mini
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:35.560]   becomes, starts occupying those same price ranges.
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:38.200]   It's really, it's interesting how low can they go question.
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.040]   And Amazon has to be asking this right now too
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:42.400]   because if they're gonna put out a Kindle Fire,
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.680]   they're not going to have the price advantage they had.
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:47.560]   The Fire was really a sub-par product.
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:51.040]   It certainly can't compete at 200 bucks within XS7,
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:52.680]   let alone.
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:53.520]   - They don't go lower. - Amazon--
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.800]   - Does it subsidize it with content?
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:55.920]   - Yeah, how, that's the question is--
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.080]   - Also-- - Would they give it away?
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.560]   Do they make it 50 bucks, 100 bucks?
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:59.400]   What do they do?
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:00.840]   - Or they've had advertising on Kindle's before
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:03.200]   so there's an ad subsidy model that Amazon has explored.
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.040]   - Cheap as Kindle would do. - Which Kindle
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:06.720]   looks at subsidized that but that's the yink.
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:09.840]   - Also the big deal with the Kindle is that they're,
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.840]   that Amazon will tell you they're not making tablets,
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:12.960]   they're making Kindle's.
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:14.720]   They're not making a device that's designed to be
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:16.840]   even as complicated as an iPad.
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:18.440]   They're making a device that is designed to be,
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.520]   here are your books.
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:20.360]   You want more books?
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:21.520]   We will make it as easy as possible
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.120]   to find more books for you on apps,
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:25.040]   here are your apps, you want to find more apps?
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.600]   We'll make it as easy as possible
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:28.360]   to find more apps in order to get.
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:31.640]   If you, I think that the Kindle Fire has a lot of problems,
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:34.160]   not as well built the software or the hardware
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:37.680]   as an iPad is, but when it comes down to the simple case of,
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:40.840]   I've bought an album once, it is not on this device,
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.240]   how do I go get it?
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.560]   Boy, that's such a linear solution
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:46.960]   when you have a Kindle in your hands compared to the iPad.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:49.200]   The iPad isn't necessarily difficult,
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.920]   but man, there is no question as to where your stuff is
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:52.880]   or how to access it.
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:55.080]   So I really think that they're gonna continue to be
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:57.080]   the device of choice for people who don't even care
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:57.920]   about tablets.
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:59.480]   - I do think that Amazon's hedged its bets
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:01.200]   because they've made the cloud player available
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:03.280]   on all iOS platforms as well.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:04.520]   Which does exactly the same thing,
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.440]   anything you ever bought is there.
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:08.280]   So they're hedging their bets.
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:10.800]   You know, I think you're right, I think that
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.080]   the consumers, at least when they first looked at the
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:16.280]   Kindle Fire and then the Nexus 7,
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:19.360]   what they were saying is, can I get away with something
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.440]   that's less than half as expensive as an iPad?
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:22.520]   Is it how good is it?
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:24.160]   And they really saw it as a tablet.
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:26.720]   Amazon might want a reposition, very clearly,
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:29.080]   this is not a tablet replacement.
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.360]   This is a color Kindle.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.520]   - The other big difference is, I mean,
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:36.960]   the Kindle Fire is, I don't mean this to sound facetious,
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:39.480]   but it is mostly a front end to the Amazon store.
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:42.360]   And the problem Amazon has is that their store has nowhere
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:45.160]   near the international distribution that Apple has.
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:47.880]   If you look at Apple's numbers outside of America
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:50.200]   and rest of the world, they're fairly phenomenal.
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:51.960]   And the Kindle Fire outside America
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.320]   is still mostly a paperweight.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.240]   I mean, I tried to use one in Canada even.
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:57.720]   We don't have Amazon MP3, we don't have almost any
[01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:58.920]   of their services here.
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.600]   And that's Canada, it gets worse as you get further out.
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:06.200]   So Apple with an iPad mini, they are gonna take that
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.120]   on a world stage.
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.560]   They're gonna roll that out aggressively, internationally.
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:12.120]   And they wanna make sure that if you walk into an airplane,
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.640]   you see some iPads now, but you see some Kindles,
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:17.360]   you see some Nooks, you see some maybe some Nexus 7s,
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.440]   they want you to walk out an airport in an airplane
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.720]   and see mostly iPad devices.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:23.200]   - Wow, and I think they could do it.
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.680]   And this is what we'll find out next month
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:28.400]   because it's gonna be new iPhone 1136, right?
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.120]   By 640.
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.120]   - And the iPhone, yeah.
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:34.040]   - And then we'll see a new 7 inch, I mean,
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:36.080]   they might have across the line,
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:37.720]   they could own this at this point.
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.640]   They could, if they're aggressive, they could own it.
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:43.680]   - The phone is not about price at all,
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:46.200]   but tablets, it's all about price.
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:47.920]   - Well, it's also-- - It's also about socialized.
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:51.200]   - Yeah, it's also about finding the right person
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:53.040]   who wants to buy that thing.
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:56.760]   One of the reasons why the E and Kindles
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:58.760]   are so so successful is that for a lot of people,
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:00.920]   they come to it when they take a look at an iPad,
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:04.080]   or even when they take a look at an Nexus 7 or Kindle Fire,
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:06.240]   they come to a dead stop when they're told that,
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:07.720]   "Oh, I can't reuse this outside,"
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:09.280]   or, "Oh, there's a lot of glare on the screen,"
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:10.820]   or, "Oh, you mean they have to remember
[01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:11.640]   "to keep charging it?"
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.840]   No, thank you.
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:15.360]   And so that's why, that's their strength.
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:18.240]   And you can never really necessarily say that,
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:21.240]   "Gosh, this is an iPad, that's exactly the same cost
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.480]   "as a Kindle Fire."
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:23.920]   It's definitely gonna clean house.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:25.240]   Well, actually, it will clean house,
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:27.200]   but there will always be those people who say that,
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:29.200]   "I don't care, this is the best tablet on the market,
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.760]   "I don't care about the library of apps."
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:32.600]   All I care about is that I usually,
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:35.400]   I read on the bus, on the way to work,
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.800]   and if there's a big bright screen,
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.160]   I really can't deal with that.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:41.480]   - I do think that the world of purpose-built devices, though,
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:45.040]   is getting kind of, is disappearing.
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.320]   The people really are saying,
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:49.880]   "Look, I can now do everything with this device."
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:51.880]   And it's the same price,
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:53.560]   so I'm gonna just do it.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.520]   - Also, don't discount the fact that there are people
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:56.800]   who are aging out of the system.
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:57.640]   - Right.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:00.240]   - That there are people who could only really deal
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:01.440]   with the idea of an e-book,
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:03.520]   if they have one device that is their book.
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:04.360]   - That's my book.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:07.040]   - And that works in exactly the same way as a book,
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.080]   in exactly the same environment as a book.
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:09.920]   - That's gone.
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:11.560]   - There are people who are not necessarily,
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:15.440]   even as old as Methuselah, who are able to say,
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.600]   "No, this is a color screen that does a lot of different things.
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.560]   "Most of my media is not on a physical media,
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:20.880]   "it is actually in the cloud."
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:23.840]   And so I don't expect this to work exactly like a book.
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:27.680]   I still remember one of the most frustrating panels
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:29.280]   I've ever been on at any conference.
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:31.840]   It was on a panel on e-publishing this year,
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:32.920]   and I'm not young,
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.760]   but I was the youngest person on this panel
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:38.560]   by like 10 years, 15 years, 20 years at least.
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.080]   And these are all people about saying,
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.600]   "Here's why electronic publishing
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.600]   "will never replace printed books."
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:47.160]   And I'm like, "I'm waiting to hear the ironic twist
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.520]   "in which you say, 'Of course I'm lying about that,'
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:52.000]   "but that's the sort of stupid arguments that people make."
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.640]   So I really do think there's kind of an age thing here.
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:56.240]   - It's because these damned kids
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:57.400]   they just don't read anything.
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.520]   - They don't read any more.
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.360]   - Yeah.
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.360]   - Spider gives us a, a friend in our chatroom,
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:03.760]   gives us a price lineup.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:05.760]   iPod shuffle 49 bucks.
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.040]   He's making this up, but he's saying,
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.640]   "What about iPod Nano $99?
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:11.880]   "IPod Touch $149?
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:15.160]   "IPod Mini, iPad Mini 199?
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:18.640]   "And then we'd reduce the entry level iPad to $299?"
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.280]   That's certainly aggressive if they did that.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:23.480]   I don't think anybody buy anything but Apple stuff.
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:24.440]   - There's always gonna be,
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.360]   like there'll always be a not Apple market
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:28.000]   and there's always gonna be someone dominating that.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.440]   But I think to Andy's point,
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:33.040]   Apple is very good at introducing simple products
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:36.200]   that either build complexity or hide complexity.
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:38.600]   For my sister, her iPhone is a phone
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.960]   that plays her iPod music and takes photos.
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:42.560]   And my mom uses an iPad.
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:44.280]   My mom had a PC to over crazy.
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:45.120]   She had a Mac.
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.360]   She still found alienating and inaccessible.
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.400]   Now she has an iPad and she hits the home button.
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:50.240]   It's a nap.
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:51.080]   It's a home button.
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.440]   She doesn't know there's a fast app switch
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.120]   or doesn't know there's a notification center.
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.400]   It could care less.
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:57.440]   Actually play prefers that they aren't there.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.000]   And when I've given her the Nexus 7
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.560]   or I've given her other tablets,
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.680]   which are marketed on being more complicated
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:04.040]   and being more desktop-like,
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.680]   she's found them just as stressful as a computer
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:07.760]   and not like them.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:09.880]   So I think Apple and Amazon did this as well.
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.320]   With the Kindle Fire is they start off
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:12.680]   with a very simple experience.
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:15.360]   And that's probably the key to their success
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:17.720]   and something that other people aren't emulating enough.
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:18.960]   - We're gonna take a break.
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:19.800]   We'll come back.
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:21.400]   There's a big security alert I want you to know about.
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:23.800]   We'll talk about that in a moment, but first a word.
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:27.200]   We've got a great panel to a rich, rich, richy.
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.200]   (laughing)
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.320]   Now I can't do it.
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.880]   Renee Richie, rich seagull.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.640]   So it's rich and richy.
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:38.120]   And then the rich Andy Inaco, the rich tasting.
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:39.400]   Andy Inaco. - Richly dressed.
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:42.560]   - Richly dressed Andy Inaco are all here.
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:43.480]   Good panel.
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:45.040]   We started with nothing.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:49.080]   And we've built up a panel worthy of Mac break weekly.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.640]   - I'm sorry that I was nothing to you.
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:51.480]   - No, no, you weren't.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:52.400]   I was nothing.
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.400]   And then you came in.
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:54.560]   - That's all right, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:57.040]   - And then Renee came in and then Rich came in.
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:01.080]   It was started with me, I and my little doll here.
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:01.920]   That is all.
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.600]   - We don't need to know about that.
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.440]   (laughing)
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:09.040]   - This portion of the show brought to you by Squarespace.com.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.160]   Everything you need to create an exceptional website.
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:14.240]   Really, an incredible web host.
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:15.080]   Start with that.
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:16.000]   I mean, this is great hosting.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.680]   People often say, "I wanna do a website."
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.320]   And I always say, "Well, there's three things you need.
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.320]   You need a URL.
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.920]   You need a host and you need software to run on it."
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:27.040]   And Squarespace has put it all together
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:29.360]   to make it a completely simple solution
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:33.720]   that just happens to be no compromise solution, which is nice.
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:35.960]   Everything you need, no compromises.
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.800]   So when you sign up for the yearly plan,
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:41.120]   they will free and automatically set up your,
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:44.760]   you create your unique, don't-main-name, mygreatsite.com
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:45.640]   or whatever it is.
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:48.120]   They'll hook it up so it all works right with Squarespace.
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:49.240]   They'll give you the best hosting.
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:51.320]   You cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:54.040]   Our blog, our inside, twit-blog, inside.twit.tv
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:55.320]   has been running on Squarespace for years.
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.960]   Never a flaw.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:00.720]   I could tell you, we've got custom sites that cost
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:04.560]   a lot more that go down all the time.
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:07.040]   Never a Squarespace site, never a security issue.
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.700]   And part of that is 'cause it's a tight integration
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:11.980]   of the hosting and the Squarespace content management system.
[01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:13.700]   They keep it up to date, so it's always patched,
[01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:18.660]   always flawless, always secure, and always performing.
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:21.020]   I want you to try it by going to Squarespace.com
[01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:23.300]   right now that yellow gets started button.
[01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:24.340]   That's all you need.
[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:25.180]   It was you.
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:26.700]   Oh, you want to hover over it, it turns away.
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:30.860]   You can set up a site and this is the new Squarespace software
[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:31.700]   just came out.
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:34.180]   So it's got some nice, really kind of advanced features,
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:38.020]   things like responsive design, which means,
[01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:39.380]   and this is what you do nowadays,
[01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:41.700]   instead of having a mobile site and a desktop site,
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:43.300]   you don't know what, people come on an iPad,
[01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:45.380]   many at Nexus 7, you don't know what,
[01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:48.100]   so when you create a site, it works the same
[01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:50.980]   on all platforms, no matter what the screen resolution,
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:53.500]   they automatically, when you drag an image over
[01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:56.300]   to your page, they automatically process it
[01:29:56.300 --> 01:30:00.620]   into seven different sizes, so it automatically looks beautiful,
[01:30:00.620 --> 01:30:05.100]   whether it's a 27-inch iMac or an iPod touch,
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:07.500]   this is just the greatest stuff.
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.660]   Boy, it couldn't be easier to design your page.
[01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:12.820]   You start with these great templates, you drag, you drop,
[01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:15.660]   you can put in plugins that all of the social media sites,
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:18.820]   Flickr and Facebook and Twitter and all that stuff,
[01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:21.500]   Google Maps, I can go on and on, really,
[01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:22.620]   there's no reason for me to,

[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:26.660]   Dan Gooden writing today in R's Technica,
[01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:28.940]   Risk Assessment, Security and Activism
[01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:31.020]   is the security guide R's.
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:36.980]   There is a critical Java bug that is in the current version
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:39.140]   of Java on OS X.
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:41.140]   I remember OS X does not ship with Java,
[01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:44.460]   but if you install Java, as many will,
[01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:46.180]   you'll be installing Apple's Java,
[01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:49.440]   and that is not patched for this.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:53.740]   Online attackers have, it's a zero day vulnerability,
[01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:56.780]   it's on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:32:00.860]   So far, all the exploits in the wild are on Windows PCs,
[01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:03.220]   but according to a security expert,
[01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:04.820]   David Mayner of Erata Security,
[01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:06.980]   he says Mac and Linux machines,
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:09.500]   even with the latest version of Java from Oracle
[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.260]   are easily exploited.
[01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:16.100]   So the flaw became available Sunday night,
[01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:18.540]   by Monday night, attack code was out there,
[01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:20.340]   in fact, added to an exploit kit
[01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:23.100]   called Black Hole that's sold on underground forums.
[01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:25.140]   So be prepared, the best thing you can do
[01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:27.740]   is just turn off Java.
[01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:30.820]   And I have to say, I think on many systems,
[01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:33.380]   certainly on OS X, if you don't use Java,
[01:32:33.380 --> 01:32:34.580]   it just kind of disables it,
[01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:35.620]   and then when you wanna use it,
[01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:37.660]   it says I'm gonna turn on Java, is that okay?
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:38.900]   That's a good solution.
[01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:41.660]   If you have to use Java,
[01:32:41.660 --> 01:32:44.340]   but the quote from the security experts is,
[01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:46.260]   "Please, for the love of your computer,
[01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:49.180]   "disabled Java on your browser."
[01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:51.460]   - For the love of your ringing endorsement
[01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:53.180]   of a basic technology.
[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:56.060]   - For the love of God, turn it off!
[01:32:56.060 --> 01:32:59.700]   - No one ever says that,
[01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:01.340]   I find the problem with your house,
[01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:02.900]   you don't have enough radon.
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:04.700]   - Yeah, it's like that.
[01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:07.700]   - Yeah, F-Secure says there is no patch.
[01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:12.020]   The only solution is to totally disable Java.
[01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:16.340]   This is the most successful exploit kit plus zero day Q-R,
[01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:19.820]   please for the love of your computer disabled Java.
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:21.420]   - Q the harm music.
[01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:24.500]   - I left Java on installed,
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:27.300]   the flash uninstalled, it runs in Chrome if I need it.
[01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:29.300]   I think Adobe CS4 was the last time
[01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:31.900]   to ask me to install Java and since there's CS6 now,
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:34.020]   I haven't even seen a pop up.
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:36.160]   - Yeah, I think it's time.
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:40.460]   FAA studying, wow, who would have thunk it?
[01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:42.700]   Using devices on flights, they say,
[01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:44.580]   "Don't worry, we're not thinking about cell phones,
[01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:47.020]   "but they are taking comments starting today
[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:51.860]   "on using your iPad or your iPod or your Kindle
[01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:54.140]   "below the 10,000 foot mark."
[01:33:55.300 --> 01:34:00.300]   The FAA has formed a government industry study group.
[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:02.100]   Oh dear, that doesn't sound good.
[01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:06.180]   To study the use of consumer electronics devices on flights,
[01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:08.060]   the group will examine the testing methods
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.460]   aircraft operators use to determine
[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:11.940]   which new technologies passengers
[01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:13.580]   can safely use aboard aircraft
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:14.620]   and when they can use them,
[01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:16.860]   the group will also look at the establishment
[01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:18.700]   of technological standards associated
[01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:20.580]   with the use of these electronic devices
[01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:24.580]   during any phase of flight.
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:26.300]   The FAA says, "We're not gonna consider
[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:29.100]   "the use of cell phones, period."
[01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:30.300]   But I think there's a lot of people
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:32.620]   who would like to be able to read their Kindle
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:35.580]   in the first 10,000 feet.
[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:36.420]   - Yep.
[01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:37.780]   - Without getting a nasty paper cut
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:39.260]   for their turbulence troubles.
[01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:41.180]   - Exactly, yeah.
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:42.020]   So that's--
[01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:43.820]   - Although I should say that,
[01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:46.860]   I thought that that was sort of like a mental problem
[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:48.820]   of mine that needed to be corrected
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:51.580]   because in 2009, I decided I was never gonna buy
[01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:53.660]   any actual paper media of any kind
[01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:55.580]   and the only magazines I was buying at that time
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:57.580]   were like a copy of People magazine to read
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:59.100]   in the first 15 minutes of a flight
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:02.180]   before I could take out my Kindle or something else.
[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:03.980]   And then I just got me really nervous
[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:04.820]   'cause I realized that, wait,
[01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:07.740]   you're spending $4 only because you're terrified
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:09.220]   of what would happen if you were alone
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:11.900]   with your thoughts for 15 minutes.
[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:12.740]   (laughing)
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:14.540]   Right, so I'm looking forward to that
[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:17.340]   but on the other hand, I can understand why.
[01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:21.220]   We really are a faceted culture
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:23.580]   that we cannot five minutes of looking out the window,
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:24.660]   no!
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:25.980]   - Well, it's not just the five minutes,
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:28.340]   it's those are typically the most stressful parts
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:29.820]   of a flight to take off in the landing
[01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:32.180]   and the part where you wanna distract yourself the most.
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:33.380]   And that's the part where they're telling you,
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:35.620]   no pay attention to all the doomsday thoughts
[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:36.460]   going through your head.
[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:37.300]   So it's a bit of a--
[01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:39.380]   - And that clunking sound that they make.
[01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:42.660]   I don't know what that is, but it doesn't sound good.
[01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:44.060]   When you're in the plane, it's taking off,
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:46.060]   it goes boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:47.420]   You don't wanna know that.
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:49.860]   - We're cruising at altitude,
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:51.020]   and there's nothing else going on.
[01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:52.580]   I don't mind being bored.
[01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:54.380]   - It's a little of a shaky take off,
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:55.580]   I'd like to be distracted, thanks.
[01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:57.300]   - I just, you know, I just close,
[01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:58.780]   actually for some reason, I don't know why,
[01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:01.300]   I think it is, it's a psychological mechanism.
[01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:03.860]   I fall asleep during take off, always.
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:04.860]   I just go home.
[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:06.140]   And then I wake up later.
[01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:07.660]   I like sleeping during take off,
[01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:09.380]   'cause then you don't know what's going on.
[01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:12.580]   Last question before we get to our tips and picks of the day,
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:14.260]   and I think it's a very important one,
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:17.060]   posed by Quentin Fotrell and MarketWatch,
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:19.340]   who inherits your iTunes library?
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:25.260]   It turns out that you are licensed for your books,
[01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:29.620]   your music, your movies and TV show, only through your death.
[01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:32.700]   And, you know, if you had, he says,
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:37.420]   10,000 hardcover books, 10,000 vinyl records,
[01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:38.620]   you could put them in your will,
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:41.540]   you could say, I give these vinyl records to my nephew,
[01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:44.220]   who always loved the Count Basie Orchestra.
[01:36:44.220 --> 01:36:48.860]   But legal experts say passing on iTunes and Kindle libraries
[01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:50.700]   is much more complicated.
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:53.700]   I was once regaining consciousness, Leo,
[01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:54.660]   and the only thing I heard,
[01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:56.620]   the first thing I heard was my best friend
[01:36:56.620 --> 01:36:59.180]   standing over me saying, I get his iTunes like,
[01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:00.180]   what happened?
[01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:02.340]   Did you get clobbered on the head?
[01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:04.620]   No, I do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,
[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:05.900]   and I did not tap fast enough
[01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:07.260]   that I was choked on calling this.
[01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:08.260]   Holy cow.
[01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:09.100]   What was it?
[01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:09.940]   He was a...
[01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:12.700]   I might be misremembering,
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:16.700]   but wasn't there a Colombo in which the reason why he killed
[01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:18.980]   his rich uncle was to get his audible subscription?
[01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:20.980]   (laughing)
[01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:22.540]   I have 600 books in my...
[01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:24.980]   It was one of the Richard Kylie episodes, I think.
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:25.820]   I have...
[01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:27.380]   No, Jack Cassidy, you make it.
[01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:30.740]   I have to say that I have had audible books for 10 years,
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:31.900]   I have 600 books.
[01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:33.660]   It is a library now,
[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:35.340]   and it's kind of...
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:37.420]   In recent years, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Indiana,
[01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:40.420]   Oklahoma, and Idaho have passed laws
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:43.260]   that allow executors and relatives access to email
[01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:45.020]   and social networking accounts,
[01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:46.780]   but they don't cover digital files purchased.
[01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:50.380]   So Amazon and Apple did not respond to requests for comment.
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:53.620]   Maybe it's just me and the people I hang around with you,
[01:37:53.620 --> 01:37:55.900]   but the other thing that comes to mind is my seven-year-old
[01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:57.380]   God's, and he was six-year-old at the time,
[01:37:57.380 --> 01:38:00.020]   came up to me very quietly, whispered in my ear and said,
[01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:01.980]   "Don't worry, I know your iPad passcode
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:03.620]   "so I can keep using it after five."
[01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:04.580]   (laughing)
[01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:07.420]   That's what, for all practical purposes,
[01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:09.180]   that's what's gonna happen, right?
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:11.460]   Is it just pass along your password?
[01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:12.940]   Nobody's a wiser.
[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:17.620]   Well, it is actually part of modern estate planning,
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:19.980]   where who has electronic rights to all of your data
[01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:21.180]   and all of your information,
[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:25.620]   and that there, if you go to a sufficiently savvy estate
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:27.340]   planner, they will actually give you plans
[01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:28.780]   that you get a safety deposit box.
[01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:31.180]   You make sure that your passwords are on something
[01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:33.140]   that can be written by someone who has access to that box,
[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:36.740]   because who gets access to your safety deposit box
[01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:38.340]   after your diet, it's an old enough concept
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:40.300]   that it's completely unambiguous,
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:41.500]   and that's where you're gonna be
[01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:43.020]   giving people access to all that stuff.
[01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:45.860]   For me, the problem is it also kind of makes you think of,
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:49.060]   though, that if you're the one in the family
[01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:51.100]   who has all of the family pictures,
[01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:53.580]   like if you're the guy who keeps taking pictures at a time,
[01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:55.500]   you really wanna make sure that your family knows
[01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:59.420]   that this hard drive right here has 10 years worth of photos,
[01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:01.460]   don't just erase it and use it,
[01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:03.380]   and use it as an Xbox drive,
[01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:05.740]   because this is where all the born stuff is.
[01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:07.820]   So you get a little bit more of it about such things,
[01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:09.460]   but you have to realize that if you don't have
[01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:11.580]   the passwords set aside somewhere,
[01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:12.420]   someone can find it.
[01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:14.820]   You can have your master password to your one password,
[01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:17.580]   and other accounts, a lot of really bad things can happen.
[01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:20.260]   And another aspect is that how do you want people,
[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:23.700]   your friends, to really find out about how you pass on?
[01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:27.140]   I mean, people can find out that, gosh,
[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:30.940]   that this person usually is on Facebook at least twice a day,
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:33.380]   they haven't been on in five days.
[01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:34.980]   It's not as though you would want everyone
[01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:37.620]   of your Facebook friends to attend your family services,
[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:39.580]   but that's certainly an acceptable way
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:41.340]   of the people who would be interested
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:44.500]   and then want to know about your current state
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:45.420]   to get that information out.
[01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:48.420]   So it's, you know, death is just so damn complicated.
[01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:50.060]   I don't know why people mess with it.
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:51.300]   - The reason is we're all, you know,
[01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:53.300]   we're all assuming we're not gonna die.
[01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:55.780]   And as Savage Mike said in our chatroom,
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:58.820]   this is actually a phenomenally significant cultural shift
[01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:01.180]   going on, you know, no used bookstores.
[01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:04.780]   I mean, what, you know, everything is different all of a sudden.
[01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:05.820]   - I think after the Matt Honan thing,
[01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:07.980]   we've all spent the last two weeks putting two factor
[01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:10.500]   on everything, resecuring everything.
[01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:11.820]   And now we have to worry about how to give people,
[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:13.220]   how do people back in again?
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:15.180]   - Well, somebody's gonna have to die.
[01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:17.260]   One of us will have to die.
[01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:19.100]   And then everybody will freak out
[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:21.620]   and they'll share their passwords with their loved ones.
[01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:25.220]   Who wants to take the hit for the rest of us?
[01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:27.060]   Hey, good news.
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:27.900]   - You're really on.
[01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:28.740]   - No.
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:29.940]   Well, I am the oldest here.
[01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:31.940]   I'll probably be the first out.
[01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:33.940]   In fact, that's pretty much guaranteed.
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:38.380]   So, you know, I'll be the poster child.
[01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:41.500]   Good news. I think the Apple listened to us.
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:43.660]   We were bemoning the loss of Bob Mansfield,
[01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:46.700]   the last blue collar guy there on the Apple executive team.
[01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:48.820]   He's decided to stay on.
[01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:51.780]   He's gonna be, he's gonna be Tim Cook's right hand
[01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:55.940]   thought man, also Craig Federighi and Jan Riccio.
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:58.980]   Got a couple of Italians on the executive team,
[01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:00.420]   senior vice presidents.
[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:05.180]   - I can just hear Mansfield saying,
[01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:06.660]   just when I thought I was out,
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:07.500]   they put me back in.
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:08.940]   - They came rolling me back in.
[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:10.780]   He announced his retirement in June and steady
[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:12.540]   is gonna stay to work on future products
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:16.180]   we're reporting directly to Tim Cook.
[01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:17.180]   So.
[01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:19.180]   - Professor Leibed, but not at Apple.
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:21.500]   - Dan designated muscle.
[01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.100]   That's gonna be his new job.
[01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:24.140]   - Unsulliary.
[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:27.060]   He sleeps with a fishes.
[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:30.380]   I don't know where we got that from.
[01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:32.860]   - They have two software guys listed.
[01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:35.140]   They have Federighi from macOS 10
[01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:37.340]   and they have Scott Forestall, iOS,
[01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:40.820]   but they never had a Mac and an iOS device hardware guy.
[01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:43.900]   And even now both Mansfield and Riccio are listed
[01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:45.540]   as just hardware engineering,
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:48.300]   but not specifically for either platform.
[01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:51.260]   - At some point, Apple starts to think of itself more
[01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:53.780]   as a iPhone company than a computer company.
[01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:56.220]   In fact, they may have already made that transmit.
[01:41:56.220 --> 01:41:57.420]   - No, the iPhone is a computer.
[01:41:57.420 --> 01:41:58.260]   - Right.
[01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:00.700]   - I mean, that's their number one product, right?
[01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:02.500]   - Lately, I've been wondering if it's not so much
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:04.660]   of a case of iOS and macOS fusing,
[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:07.020]   so much as Apple really planning ahead
[01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:11.180]   and getting ready for the day when traditional
[01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:13.900]   desktop operating systems are relevant.
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:15.420]   That's not gonna happen the next two or three years,
[01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:17.020]   but it might happen the next five or 10 years.
[01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:18.900]   - And they have to be thinking about it now, right?
[01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:20.740]   - Yeah, and also historically, they've been a company
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:22.980]   that's never been afraid to jump off a horse
[01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:25.140]   that's about 10 seconds away from death
[01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:28.060]   and have a fresh horse and a fresh rider.
[01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:29.900]   - That's good stuff, too.
[01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:31.380]   - Well, I mean, if you look at Siri now,
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:33.500]   Siri's positioned a little bit like how Lisa was.
[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:35.860]   It's an introduction to natural language interface,
[01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:38.620]   which is after command line, after GUI.
[01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:40.340]   They're already experimenting with what's gonna be
[01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:43.020]   the next way to make computers even more accessible.
[01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:44.300]   And could Siri be an OS?
[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:45.780]   If you listen to Scott Forest, I'll talk.
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:47.780]   He says, "Watch the trailer in Siri
[01:42:47.780 --> 01:42:49.380]   as if it's its own thing."
[01:42:49.380 --> 01:42:51.020]   And there's just no telling where Apple's gonna be
[01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:51.980]   in five or 10 years.
[01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:52.900]   - Wow.
[01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:54.900]   - Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:57.180]   I just hope they don't get ahead of the public.
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:43:00.620]   I think they generally spend some time being ahead
[01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:02.500]   of where the public is at any given moment,
[01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:04.060]   which means that they're right where they need to be
[01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:07.900]   when people's attitudes start really becoming trackable.
[01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:10.580]   The problem is that nobody has really ever embraced
[01:43:10.580 --> 01:43:13.420]   natural speech interfaces for computers before.
[01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:15.220]   And it doesn't matter how good the technology is.
[01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:16.340]   If the society is not ready,
[01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:17.860]   if that's not the way that they hope to interact
[01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:19.740]   with the computer, if it's not relevant,
[01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:20.820]   all the commercials in the world,
[01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:21.860]   they can get Martin Scorsese.
[01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:25.420]   You can even dig up Alfred Hitchcock
[01:43:25.420 --> 01:43:26.700]   and get him in a Siri commercial.
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:28.300]   It's not gonna sell it.
[01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:30.180]   - We talked to, and I'm sure you guys have done this too,
[01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:32.220]   but at CES, we spoke to Ford and they said,
[01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:34.300]   "You wouldn't believe what we can do with cars now,
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:38.660]   but people are completely scared about cars driving themselves,
[01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:39.580]   parking themselves.
[01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:41.340]   So we have to very carefully and deliberately
[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:44.340]   introduce one new technology, get everyone used to it,
[01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:45.620]   and then do the next one."
[01:43:45.620 --> 01:43:47.620]   And I think Apple is doing similar things
[01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:49.140]   with their product, where they give you Siri
[01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:51.340]   and it's a little cute Pixar character
[01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:52.860]   and you play with it and it tells you jokes,
[01:43:52.860 --> 01:43:55.260]   but at the same time, it starts to see the culture
[01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:57.140]   with that kind of interactivity.
[01:43:57.140 --> 01:44:00.540]   - And meanwhile, Rich Seagull's still making,
[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:02.620]   basically, the bed liners for trucks.
[01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:06.300]   - Well, I'm sort of, I'm listening to this
[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:08.260]   and I'm sort of thinking, yeah, this is all great,
[01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:12.220]   but software, at least for the foreseeable future,
[01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:14.180]   software still has to be written,
[01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:15.900]   and there still has to be a platform on it.
[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:16.820]   - Somebody's gotta do it.
[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:17.820]   - Yeah.
[01:44:17.820 --> 01:44:19.780]   - Well, you write, and not just somebody's gotta do it,
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:22.380]   but somebody's gotta do it using some set of tools.
[01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:23.220]   - Right.
[01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:27.420]   - You know, iOS devices, I don't see them being functional
[01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:32.260]   for the sort of software development that is required.
[01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:34.660]   I mean, really the question is,
[01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:38.540]   what is Apple going to use to develop their own software?
[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:40.980]   - Yeah, they have to use BBEdit and a Mac Pro.
[01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:43.460]   - That's pretty nice, my fault.
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:46.140]   - I'm not getting at least half of that is accurate.
[01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:47.580]   - I have to say though, the Retina Mac,
[01:44:47.580 --> 01:44:48.420]   and I'm starting to say,
[01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:49.740]   who was it, just wrote an article?
[01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:50.940]   Was it Marco?
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:51.780]   Yeah, I think it was Marco.
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:52.620]   - I'm not sure both of them.
[01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:53.540]   - Yeah, saying, hey, you know,
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:54.660]   this could be my only computer.
[01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:56.380]   It's actually better than my Mac Pro.
[01:44:56.380 --> 01:44:59.180]   - I think that Retina, and we've heard of rumor,
[01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:02.580]   Renee, have you heard this of 13 inch Retina Mac Pro?
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:03.980]   - I have.
[01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:06.900]   My understanding is that when you go to larger screens,
[01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:09.500]   like the 27 inch display and the I-M-A-2 display,
[01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:11.740]   the yield becomes, the cost and yield rate
[01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:13.300]   are just nowhere near commercial pro.
[01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:14.900]   - Also, we're seeing even in the Retina,
[01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:17.300]   it's hard to move that many pixels around on the screen.
[01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:20.100]   - It is bleeding edge for the GPU in the current--
[01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:21.260]   - Already.
[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:23.980]   - When you go smaller though, your problem is that you need,
[01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:25.620]   like the 13 inch MacBook, sorry,
[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:28.580]   the 13 inch MacBook Pro does not have a discrete GPU yet.
[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:29.780]   So Apple would have to add one,
[01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:31.740]   and then you've got to figure out how to have enough battery
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:33.940]   to drive the display and the GPU.
[01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:37.100]   So they'll do whatever, like 15 inch was a sweet spot.
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:39.660]   That was the one they could put the GPU in
[01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:42.260]   and the battery in and power that display,
[01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:44.860]   and I think they're gonna factor down, get that right,
[01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:47.380]   and then start branching out to other products.
[01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:49.820]   - And now we see why Bob Mansfield has stuck around.
[01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:52.500]   - Yeah, you're going anywhere, Bob.
[01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:53.340]   You figured this out.
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:54.780]   - You're very good at solving problems like that.
[01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:55.620]   - Yep, yep, yep.
[01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:58.300]   - The real question, Leo, is are you in the same boat as me,
[01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:00.220]   as we both bought 15 inch Retina MacBooks,
[01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:01.980]   and now we're gonna be tempted by the 13 inch,
[01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:04.100]   but we're gonna know the air might be coming eventually.
[01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:04.940]   - No, I'm not tempted.
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:06.020]   - And are we gonna just have to buy all of them?
[01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:06.860]   - Yes.
[01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:08.980]   - I'm actually not tempted.
[01:46:08.980 --> 01:46:13.300]   I think the 15 inch Retina is the sweet spot.
[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:14.140]   Perfect.
[01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:16.500]   I love the size of the screen.
[01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:18.900]   There is lag, you know, when you do things like slide the screen
[01:46:18.900 --> 01:46:19.660]   is a little bit of lag,
[01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:22.380]   'cause you're moving massive amounts of pixels around,
[01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:24.980]   but I am just so happy with it.
[01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:25.820]   And...
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:27.500]   - Best Mac I've ever owned.
[01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:28.980]   - Yeah.
[01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:29.900]   Really nice.
[01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:30.740]   - Again.
[01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:31.580]   - Again.
[01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:33.020]   How dare they?
[01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:33.980]   We're gonna take a break, come back.
[01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:35.260]   We've got a picture of the week.
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:37.940]   If anybody wants to do a pick, rich, and Renee,
[01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:40.140]   you can prepare one, and he's got one.
[01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:43.100]   And we'll wrap this thing up,
[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:47.020]   but first, the gazelle always does this, you know,
[01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:49.980]   there might be a new gadget in your future.
[01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.140]   You ever think about maybe finding out
[01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:53.300]   how much that old one's worth
[01:46:53.300 --> 01:46:54.620]   so you can buy the next one?
[01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:56.940]   Why put it in a closet or a drawer?
[01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:59.060]   How much is your old iPhone worth,
[01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:02.860]   or your iPad, or even that old iPod or MacBook?
[01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:04.740]   When it's time to get a new gadget,
[01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:08.660]   go to gazelle first and pave the way.
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:10.140]   And make it very easy too.
[01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:13.100]   You say, oh, you know, I'm looking at an iPhone 5.
[01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:15.460]   Now, by the way, what's great about these
[01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:17.900]   is these quotes are good for 30 days.
[01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:20.300]   So you can get an offer right now.
[01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:23.180]   This is the 32 inch 4s worth 251 bucks.
[01:47:23.180 --> 01:47:25.420]   See, that's gonna pay for your new phone right there.
[01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:26.980]   Get that offer and you don't have to send it
[01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:27.820]   to them right away.
[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:30.100]   You could say you got 30 days, by the way,
[01:47:30.100 --> 01:47:31.220]   that's if it's a good condition.
[01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:33.620]   What if it's perfect condition, 271 bucks,
[01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:36.180]   and I'm gonna show you can add another 5% onto that.
[01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:38.660]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:41.540]   This is the way to kind of keep everything moving forward.
[01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:43.460]   In a way, it's a form of recycling, isn't it?
[01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:45.540]   Somebody's gonna love that old iPhone,
[01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:47.460]   and you're gonna get some cash.
[01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:49.460]   Well, the way it works is you go on here,
[01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:50.860]   you get quotes for all your gadgets.
[01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:52.020]   You might as well get as many as you want.
[01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:54.140]   You throw in a box, they will send you a mailing label,
[01:47:54.140 --> 01:47:56.940]   they paid the postage on anything worth more than a buck.
[01:47:56.940 --> 01:48:00.380]   And then they send you a check PayPal.
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:01.580]   You can get an Amazon gift card.
[01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:02.620]   And by the way, I would do that
[01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:04.900]   'cause they add 5% to the value.
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:07.100]   Kind of, I guess they're rebating the affiliate fee,
[01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:10.620]   whatever, but 5% more if you use an Amazon gift card.
[01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:11.940]   And since, you know, Amazon's,
[01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:13.780]   we're all spending a little money on Amazon these days,
[01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:15.100]   I think that's a good deal.
[01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:18.540]   If you've got an iPhone, a cell phone, an iPad, an iPod,
[01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:22.660]   a MacBook or a Mac, and you were ready to move on,
[01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:24.300]   get that BlackBerry out of your system.
[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:25.740]   That can't be worth too much.
[01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:27.740]   (laughing)
[01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:28.580]   Ow.
[01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:30.100]   How about that Samsung Galaxy S?
[01:48:30.100 --> 01:48:32.060]   How much was that worth?
[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:33.180]   Actually, I'm just curious.
[01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:35.020]   1.05 billion dollars.
[01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:36.020]   A billion dollars.
[01:48:36.020 --> 01:48:36.980]   (laughing)
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:39.340]   You know, maybe I should get rid of my S3
[01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:44.100]   because it is time perhaps to switch back to iPhone
[01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:45.860]   free of water damage you bet.
[01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:47.660]   Let me just see how much that's worth.
[01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:48.740]   Calculate my bet.
[01:48:48.740 --> 01:48:49.980]   Oh yeah, baby.
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:50.980]   See?
[01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:52.660]   That pays for the next phone.
[01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:54.420]   You got four new colors to choose from today, Leo.
[01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:55.860]   You can get a brown one if you want.
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:57.740]   A brown Galaxy S3?
[01:48:57.740 --> 01:48:58.900]   Yeah, the announced brown--
[01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:00.100]   That's a Zoon color.
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:00.940]   Yeah.
[01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:01.780]   I like the red.
[01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:02.620]   The red AT&T cells are red.
[01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:03.460]   It's pretty.
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:06.020]   Anyway, when it's time to move on, gazelle it.
[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:06.860]   That's the way to do it.
[01:49:06.860 --> 01:49:10.300]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com, recycled easy way.
[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:13.220]   You can join the 300,000 happy customers
[01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:18.060]   you've received nearly $50 million from gazelle.
[01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:21.780]   All right, anybody wanna do a pick of the week?
[01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:23.020]   Sure, I will.
[01:49:23.020 --> 01:49:24.580]   All right, Rich.
[01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:26.580]   Well, first I must maintain carmic balance
[01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:29.860]   since you were so kind as to give me an unsolicited placement.
[01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:30.700]   I love it.
[01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:31.900]   I'm going to do it for somebody else.
[01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:33.220]   All right.
[01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:38.220]   There's an outfit called TagStand, T-A-G-S-T-A-N-D.com.
[01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:46.740]   And they are an outfit that specializes in producing and selling NFC tags and readers.
[01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:51.500]   Oh, because I bought the Samsung TechTile, and it's like expensive.
[01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:53.660]   It's like $5 per $450 per--
[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:56.300]   These guys sell cheap NFC tags.
[01:49:56.300 --> 01:50:00.900]   Yeah, and it's really neat stuff, and they'll do custom prints for you
[01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:03.340]   if you wanna do something like that.
[01:50:03.340 --> 01:50:07.220]   They have kids for hobbyists and businesses
[01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:13.020]   who wanna produce tags and quantity, and just a lot of really sort of neat stuff
[01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:13.820]   to fool around with.
[01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:15.340]   This is a neat company.
[01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:17.860]   This is why I wanted Apple to put an NFC in the new phone,
[01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:19.620]   because I really want this to take off.
[01:50:19.620 --> 01:50:24.020]   She's showing an NFC business card, so that you could put a tag in the business card,
[01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:27.180]   and then people just pass their phone in the business card.
[01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:31.380]   Yeah, we actually have a couple of NFC tags in the house.
[01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:36.100]   My wife's a web developer, and she has a Galaxy S2 with the NFC on the phone.
[01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:37.100]   Right.
[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:44.740]   And so there's an NFC in the house where she walks in and puts her phone on it,
[01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:47.820]   and it logs into the access point in the house.
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:52.980]   There's an NFC in her car that she holds the phone next to,
[01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:57.140]   and it pairs the Bluetooth with her car and changes, turns the Wi-Fi off.
[01:50:57.140 --> 01:51:01.700]   And there's a lot of everyday practicality here.
[01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:06.060]   And this is a standard, so you don't have to buy the Samsung TechTiles.
[01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:13.260]   You can get the NFC tags for as low as a buck 50, I think, from tagstands.com.
[01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:14.260]   Correct.
[01:51:14.260 --> 01:51:19.140]   And so I just wanted to kind of throw that placement out there for that.
[01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:20.140]   Thank you.
[01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:21.140]   Yeah.
[01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:27.220]   My own pick of the week is non-technical.
[01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:29.620]   You got me starting the black blood of the earth now, why?
[01:51:29.620 --> 01:51:31.580]   I got started on something new.
[01:51:31.580 --> 01:51:33.980]   Oh, biscotti spread from the look.
[01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:35.860]   Biscof, where's my glare?
[01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:36.860]   Biscof spread.
[01:51:36.860 --> 01:51:39.380]   Now, is that like Nutella?
[01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:40.540]   What is that made out of?
[01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:42.380]   Well, it's made out of cookies.
[01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:43.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:43.380 --> 01:51:47.140]   Biscof is a brand of cookie.
[01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:50.900]   They call themselves the airline cookie because they're very popular.
[01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:56.340]   The cookies are actually very popular as airline food on some airlines.
[01:51:56.340 --> 01:52:01.460]   And so they've figured out a way to blend them into something which sort of resembles
[01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:02.820]   Nutella and its texture.
[01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:04.620]   It's very smooth and spreadable.
[01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:09.020]   And it's-- you may never actually end up spreading it on anything.
[01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:11.620]   You may just start shoving a spoon into the jar and just eating it all.
[01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:13.540]   Does this not seem like a good idea at all?
[01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:14.780]   They have two types.
[01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:17.380]   They have the regular, the smooth.
[01:52:17.380 --> 01:52:18.380]   And recently--
[01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:19.380]   Oh, no.
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:20.380]   Please don't.
[01:52:20.380 --> 01:52:21.380]   Crunchy.
[01:52:21.380 --> 01:52:22.380]   No.
[01:52:22.380 --> 01:52:24.380]   You curse you, rich seagull.
[01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:25.380]   Curse you!
[01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:28.460]   Crunchy, the crunchy is-- they're both really delightful.
[01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:30.500]   The crunchy is just a whole new level.
[01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:33.940]   You sent me a great care package of Rhode Island.
[01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:36.060]   Was it you who sent me the Rhode Island stuff?
[01:52:36.060 --> 01:52:37.460]   I think that might have been me.
[01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:38.540]   That was so sweet of you.
[01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:42.860]   I got two different kinds of coffee syrup because there's competing brands.
[01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:47.500]   Yeah, you got the good kind and you got the autocrat I remember.
[01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:49.140]   Some people are autocrats.
[01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:50.620]   And what is the other one?
[01:52:50.620 --> 01:52:51.620]   Eclipse.
[01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:52.620]   Eclipse, that's right.
[01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:53.620]   And you're one or the other if you're in Rhode Island.
[01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:55.420]   You can't be both.
[01:52:55.420 --> 01:53:02.620]   And then you sent me an amazing mix for clam cakes, which I miss terribly.
[01:53:02.620 --> 01:53:06.420]   I don't-- maybe they don't serve clam cakes anywhere but on the shore of Rhode Island.
[01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:09.900]   But basically it's a fritter but instead of like a corn fritter but instead of corn it's
[01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:11.100]   got clams in it.
[01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:15.220]   And they come in a brown paper bag that's just covered with grease because of course
[01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:16.980]   they've been steeped that fried.
[01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:19.260]   And it's the best thing you ever ate.
[01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:20.500]   No, no, Leo.
[01:53:20.500 --> 01:53:23.940]   The best thing you ever ate would be a clam cake with that spread on it.
[01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:24.940]   Oh!
[01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:25.940]   The best toss spread on it.
[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:29.540]   No, no, no, no, this cup does not go on clam cakes.
[01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:32.540]   Anyway, you've tried it.
[01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:34.860]   It was very kind of you.
[01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:35.860]   So thank you.
[01:53:35.860 --> 01:53:37.980]   Yeah, wish you hadn't showed me this biscuit.
[01:53:37.980 --> 01:53:42.740]   So yeah, this is fortunately or unfortunately.
[01:53:42.740 --> 01:53:44.260]   A lot of grocery stores have it.
[01:53:44.260 --> 01:53:45.260]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:47.580]   A lot of grocery stores have it but you know what else?
[01:53:47.580 --> 01:53:48.580]   Amazon has it.
[01:53:48.580 --> 01:53:49.580]   Oh, even worse.
[01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:50.580]   Amazon has it.
[01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:51.580]   And if you're an Amazon Prime member.
[01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:53.580]   You could have it tomorrow.
[01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:55.580]   You could have it tomorrow.
[01:53:55.580 --> 01:53:57.580]   Amazon yesterday.
[01:53:57.580 --> 01:53:58.580]   Oh, God.
[01:53:58.580 --> 01:54:00.380]   Yeah, when Amazon started selling.
[01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:03.620]   That was something I was sort of curious about listening to you guys talk about the
[01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:04.620]   Kindle and the Kindle Fire.
[01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:09.860]   I was thinking, "Chee, I wonder if you can use a Kindle Fire to buy stuff from the Amazon
[01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:12.940]   store using your account?"
[01:54:12.940 --> 01:54:13.940]   By the way.
[01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:18.860]   Oh, oh, oh, I can't see the listing from there but I was highly amused the first time
[01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:25.380]   I found it because it was actually listed under medical supplies.
[01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:26.860]   That's what you're going to need if you buy it.
[01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:29.220]   No, it's in Gourmet and Grocery.
[01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:32.740]   Now, this is a pack of two for $13.10.
[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:34.500]   Does that seem like a good deal?
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:37.100]   It's a reasonable price.
[01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:39.460]   I guess if you have to ask, you just shouldn't.
[01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:40.900]   It's like five or six bucks a jar.
[01:54:40.900 --> 01:54:43.020]   I forget exactly how much it is.
[01:54:43.020 --> 01:54:44.020]   All right.
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:45.020]   Here's the crunchy.
[01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:46.020]   13 ounces.
[01:54:46.020 --> 01:54:50.700]   Do you have an idea how many packs of cigarettes you'd have to smoke to have that same sort
[01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:51.700]   of health crisis effect?
[01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:54.860]   It's a bargain.
[01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:59.620]   By the way, apparently, John Slanina says, "Don't push that ad to cart button.
[01:54:59.620 --> 01:55:00.980]   I already bought it."
[01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:04.140]   So I guess we're getting some shipped instantly.
[01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:09.300]   What we should do is to be fair is to try the competing product, Trader Joe's.
[01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:10.300]   This is so successful.
[01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:17.100]   It's already made its own fake Biskoff spread called Trader Joe's Speculos cookie butter.
[01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:18.100]   Okay.
[01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:23.140]   So the thing about Speculos, and I have not tried the Trader Joe's, but the thing about
[01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:31.140]   Speculos is, Speculos is another brand of similar cookie like Biskoff.
[01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:35.140]   I've tried the Speculos and I prefer the Biskoff, but that's really just a matter of
[01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:36.140]   personal taste.
[01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:37.140]   Wow.
[01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:39.260]   If you look for the Speculos brand.
[01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:44.140]   You know, Leo, we just expect you to try them all on your report.
[01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:46.340]   I like the ingredients list.
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:48.340]   Made with crushed biscuits.
[01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:50.940]   And that's very rich.
[01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:52.540]   Curse you, rich.
[01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:57.460]   You got me on the black blood of the earth kick and now this and I don't know.
[01:55:57.460 --> 01:55:58.460]   It's not good.
[01:55:58.460 --> 01:55:59.980]   It's very popular with the birds too.
[01:55:59.980 --> 01:56:00.980]   Oh, I bet.
[01:56:00.980 --> 01:56:01.980]   Why wouldn't it be?
[01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:05.700]   I don't think he wants to show this beak in the jar, but I feel happy he eat it off my
[01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:06.700]   finger.
[01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:09.180]   Renee, Richie, something you've been using lately, you kind of like.
[01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:11.900]   You want to share with our vast listening audience?
[01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:15.060]   Well, I already did the bare bones be at it once.
[01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:16.540]   I'm going to go on to something else.
[01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:17.820]   Otherwise, I would be doing BBI.
[01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:18.820]   I do.
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:19.820]   I agree.
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:20.820]   BBI.
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:21.820]   Oh, no.
[01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:22.820]   It clips.
[01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:23.820]   Wait a minute.
[01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:24.820]   It clips was purchased by autocrat in 1991.
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:26.260]   My whole world is crumbling.
[01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:31.140]   Autocrat owns both brands, but they are still manufacturing them both using their respective
[01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:32.140]   recipes.
[01:56:32.140 --> 01:56:38.540]   And they're truly disgusting, but it's that kind of thing that like Biskoff spread that,
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:41.500]   you know, it's disgusting, but good in a good way.
[01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:42.500]   Go ahead, Renee.
[01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:43.500]   Sorry.
[01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:48.820]   So, Drafts is an excellent text editing program for the iPhone.
[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:50.340]   And now it's available for the iPad.
[01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:53.060]   It's gone to Drafts 2.0.
[01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:54.580]   Drafts, you just type things in.
[01:56:54.580 --> 01:56:58.740]   You can use it just to store ideas, to store text lists, anything.
[01:56:58.740 --> 01:57:03.180]   And you can easily take anything you've written, tweet it out from any account you have, send
[01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:07.980]   it to Facebook, email it, add it as an event, turn it into a message, put it on the clipboard.
[01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:12.780]   It integrates with other applications you might have, like, to do or writing kit.
[01:57:12.780 --> 01:57:18.380]   It is just, using it for the last week, it's just become my go-to place to put any text
[01:57:18.380 --> 01:57:22.780]   in iOS that I want to do anything with at any point in the future.
[01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:27.860]   It is by Agile Tortis, $1.99 for the iPhone version.
[01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:28.860]   Drafts.
[01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:30.860]   I think the iPad version's not much.
[01:57:30.860 --> 01:57:34.100]   I'm just going to make it a 2.99 for the iPad version.
[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:35.100]   2.99.
[01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:36.100]   Cool.
[01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:37.100]   I'll try it.
[01:57:37.100 --> 01:57:41.220]   Andy, you got a recommendation for us before we wrap this puppy up?
[01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:45.500]   Mine is a fun little photo app for Mac OS called Color Strokes.
[01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:49.900]   It is a simple photo app that does only three things.
[01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:53.580]   You've seen, oftentimes, you've seen, like, these effects that people will sometimes do
[01:57:53.580 --> 01:57:58.060]   to, they'll take a color photo and put it into black and white, but then restore the
[01:57:58.060 --> 01:58:01.780]   color to, like, the part of the picture that you want people to actually see to sort of
[01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:03.340]   attract attention to it.
[01:58:03.340 --> 01:58:04.340]   Color Strokes does that.
[01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:08.220]   It's similar to a lot of different iPhone and iPad apps like that.
[01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:09.500]   It also lets you do other things.
[01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:13.380]   They're kind of similar, the similar sort of thing where you use a simple paintbrush to
[01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:16.580]   mask a section of the photo and say, "This is the foreground.
[01:58:16.580 --> 01:58:18.260]   This is the thing I want people to see."
[01:58:18.260 --> 01:58:21.740]   They can make the background all blurry, make the black, brown, black, and white, add
[01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:24.980]   certain, like, post-processing film effects to it.
[01:58:24.980 --> 01:58:28.420]   It's the simple, simple, simple way to do something easy that you would normally need,
[01:58:28.420 --> 01:58:32.940]   like, a more expensive photo app for, like Photoshop.
[01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:36.020]   You think that this is kind of a waste of time because it only does these two things, but
[01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:39.820]   the good news is that it only costs $2.99 for a Mac app.
[01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:42.020]   And for that amount of money, that's, "Yeah, let's get that."
[01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:45.220]   And if I only use it, like, twice a year, I'll definitely use it.
[01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:50.340]   And the thing is that it's also, in addition to being useful for actual times when you have
[01:58:50.340 --> 01:58:53.980]   sort of, like, maybe a midlin sort of photo that's kind of there, but not quite there,
[01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:57.660]   but you want to, like, sort of make it more interesting and control people's focus, make
[01:58:57.660 --> 01:59:00.660]   sure that the surface of it really pops out.
[01:59:00.660 --> 01:59:02.580]   It's also kind of just fun to play with.
[01:59:02.580 --> 01:59:05.220]   Just put a photo in there and just mess around with it and see what happens.
[01:59:05.220 --> 01:59:08.780]   Or even if you never share that photo out and use it to anybody else, it's kind of fun
[01:59:08.780 --> 01:59:09.780]   just to play with.
[01:59:09.780 --> 01:59:11.980]   And for $2.99, that's a good amount of entertainment for $2.99.
[01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:13.580]   That's a neat effect, actually.
[01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:14.580]   Yeah.
[01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:15.580]   Yeah.
[01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:20.180]   So this used to be Color Splash Studio.
[01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:25.380]   Because I have the original version for Mac fun, so they've renamed it Color Strokes.
[01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:26.380]   Got it.
[01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:27.380]   Got it.
[01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:29.540]   On the Mac App Store, as well as the iOS Store.
[01:59:29.540 --> 01:59:32.900]   And the Enoco is on the internet at CWOB.com.
[01:59:32.900 --> 01:59:37.860]   You'll also find him in newsprint at the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:59:37.860 --> 01:59:39.420]   Always a slice.
[01:59:39.420 --> 01:59:40.420]   Thank you, sir.
[01:59:40.420 --> 01:59:41.420]   I do not discriminate.
[01:59:41.420 --> 01:59:43.420]   I want anybody who can read anything on any surface.
[01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:47.340]   Your Skyrest pillow is on its way to you.
[01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:48.340]   We also...
[01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:49.340]   Sorry.
[01:59:49.340 --> 01:59:50.340]   Go ahead.
[01:59:50.340 --> 01:59:51.340]   No.
