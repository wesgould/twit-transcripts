[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.480]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.320]   And we're back in studio, which is good.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.160]   We've got Scott Born back with us, which is even better.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.920]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.280]   From the Apple phone show, I'm sure it's been very busy.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.320]   With all the news, we'll get to that in a second.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.360]   Also here, Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.080]   Hello.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.400]   Back from Cany Duh.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.520]   And on my backs from Baston.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.680]   Andy, Excella, Ignatko.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.560]   I'd just like to report that the surge in downtown Dorchester
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.160]   is working.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.440]   We put four more cops on East Street and Broadway.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.840]   And those kids are not hanging up by the candy store.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.880]   We're welcomed as liberators in that neighborhood.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.480]   And how is the Dorchester Coalition
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.160]   government working out?
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.080]   Oh, that wonderful.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.920]   The thing is, though, you've got to get on the good side.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.960]   If you get into the East Street Brownie Club,
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.460]   you're in.
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.040]   You're in like a plan for clock pick.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.520]   Well, God's sake.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.120]   You do that well.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.720]   I haven't heard you do that before.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.360]   Maybe you're a little nervous about doing it
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.840]   in the environments you live.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.120]   But the question is, Leo, which one is my fake one?
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.160]   It's right.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.720]   So look at--
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.880]   Look at good accent.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.120]   Are you from that area?
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.880]   No.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.960]   My mom was born in downtown Boston.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.080]   She packs a cat, have a yacht.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.200]   My dad was born in Western Pennsylvania.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.960]   So he parks the car in Harvard Yard.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.520]   My theory is that the two accents,
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.200]   the two Rs, canceled each other out, leaving me with normal Rs.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.160]   It's like signs.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.480]   It's like waveforms.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.360]   It's like two Legos.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.080]   Two Legos interlocking to form one hole.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.240]   I try not to think about that.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.640]   So ladies and gentlemen, we are here.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.960]   We are gathered together to talk about all things Mac.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.640]   And actually, Scott's been giving us a little tutorial
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.640]   and getting ringtones working.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.040]   So because you said it just started working on your system
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.400]   now.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.600]   No, it started last night.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.800]   They kind of rolled it out.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.040]   First, there was like-- you could see that you could do ringtones
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.160]   and then-- but you couldn't actually download them.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.640]   And then it just-- they seemed to roll it feature by feature.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.280]   And then sometime this morning, it was all working.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.720]   And most people don't know that it's working
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.600]   because they don't know what to look for.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.400]   There's a new field that you can put on your library list.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.880]   You've got time.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.840]   Let me open iTunes here.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.960]   And everybody should follow along.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.880]   Everybody follow along, children.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.640]   Follow along with Mr. Applephone Show.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.720]   So what you want to do is make sure that you've got--
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.280]   to make it easy to see, go to your music library.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.840]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.720]   Reopen iTunes.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.120]   And it says, you can create iPhone ringtones
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.400]   from many songs produced from the iTunes.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.640]   Do you want to check to the iTunes store?
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.680]   And then it says, check songs.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.320]   So this did this when I opened iTunes after talking my phone.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.160]   And what that does is that seeing if any of the songs
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.040]   in your current library are being tonable.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.000]   So the first time you dock your phone with seven,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.560]   with the current version of iTunes,
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.040]   there's 712, 741.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.040]   I mean, 741 parentheses to parentheses.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.800]   So the first time you dock your phone, that's the thing it says.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.560]   That's what it says.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.680]   Now, but that won't help you, though,
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.960]   because you probably don't have that field enabled in iTunes.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.880]   So you need to enable that field.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.840]   So those of you on a Mac, first of all, Ben Down1E.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.840]   Thank God you're on a Mac.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.960]   And then hit Command J. And you will
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.280]   see that you have several selections.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.680]   Those of you on a Windows machine,
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.680]   I feel sorry for you, hit Control J.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.440]   Help to get to different options.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.920]   Jeez.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.480]   And by the way, let me tell you something.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.080]   The Control key makes a lot more sense
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.200]   than the Command Fan Apple key, which nobody, but nobody,
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.520]   who first gets a Mac, can tell.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.160]   When you say the Command key, they say, where's that?
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.240]   I don't see Command on my keyboard.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.320]   Well, that's by the way.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.520]   I just want to point that out, Scott, that the Control
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.880]   doesn't make a little more sense than Command.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.120]   My reference wasn't actually to the key.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.480]   Oh, it was to the rest of the experience.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.200]   Oh, look, there's a little bell.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.040]   There's a little bell.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.080]   And I have no ringtone.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.680]   So you select Ringtone.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.320]   You select Ringtone, click OK.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.400]   Now the bell comes up.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.440]   So anything in your library that's ringtoneable,
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.240]   you'll see it fall in that category.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.760]   OK.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.600]   I hear the bell in the category for you, Leo.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.720]   Yeah, Uncle Cracker, drift away.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.680]   Yeah, unfortunately, it's only 500,000 songs.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.000]   Now, when I first heard 500,000 songs, I was like, wow,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.160]   that's a lot of songs.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.160]   Turns out, only about eight of mine are in those 500,000 songs.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.160]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.400]   Well, on mine-- and I have 7,000 songs in my library,
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.920]   but it looks like only about 25 are ringtoneable.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.880]   So who are the ringtoneable songs?
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.080]   Well, it's just deals that they're
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.120]   trying to still work out with music publishers
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.080]   to get them to accept the additional deal
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.640]   to make a song a ringtone.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.040]   So as more music publishers come on board,
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.320]   we'll see that round out.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.480]   Now, Alex, you've been using iToner
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.040]   from the Great People of Ambrosia Software, which is--
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.520]   I love-- $15 program that eliminates this whole silly thing.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.120]   Yeah, the only issue that you have
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.800]   is that there's kind of right now there's a bit of a--
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.400]   and you don't know whether it's a cat and mouse,
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.560]   or whether Apple's just kind of squishing people by accident.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.520]   But the Apple's changing the way it's blowing away,
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.760]   a lot of the ways people were getting ringtones
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.400]   onto their iPhones.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.120]   So when I haven't actually upgraded my iTunes,
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.680]   because there's nothing in the new iTunes except for ringtones
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.880]   that I really need.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.680]   And so I haven't bothered because right now I can sync quite
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.040]   nicely.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.360]   So iToner, iToner, I can make anything I want.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.440]   I can go in to GarageBand, edit any piece of music,
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.680]   something I've sampled, any of my songs, anything
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.480]   that I want.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.360]   I get that set up the way I like it.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.880]   I then save it out as an MP3.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.160]   I drag it onto iToner.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.000]   I hit sync, and it's on my phone.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.600]   I have to say, though, I'm looking now at the interface
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.760]   in iTunes.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.880]   Once you say it-- so I've picked Hungry like a wolf,
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.000]   Duran Duran.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.840]   You now can select any 15-second portion of it.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.880]   Actually, you can make it longer than 15 seconds if you want.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.480]   30 seconds.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.640]   Have you seen the interface to this?
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.520]   Yeah, 30 seconds right, Scott is the max.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.120]   This is pretty slick.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.760]   So you choose fade and fade out.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.720]   You select whatever portion you want,
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.440]   and you can make it anything from three seconds to 30 seconds.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.200]   You can have a gap from half a second to five seconds,
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.280]   and then you can preview it before you buy-- I have to say--
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.280]   let me preview it.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.880]   This is Duran Duran My Ringtone.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.040]   Oh.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.560]   See, too bad.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.760]   Merlin's not here.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.560]   Now, that's a pretty--
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.160]   OK, so maybe I don't want-- maybe I don't want them singing
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.360]   so I can resize this.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.200]   I have to say, that's pretty impressive.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.600]   And I want to point out what's interesting about this, Leo,
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.840]   is that these are customizable, meaning
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.880]   you're picking which part of that song
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.240]   want it to be, whereas many of the other cell phone companies,
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.360]   you get to listen to the 30 seconds they want.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.280]   Most of the time, this is the first time I've ever seen this.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.080]   Can you do that with I-Tone or that, right?
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.240]   Because you're kind of ending.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.880]   Same thing.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.200]   You can do anything you want with it.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.480]   And the point is, is you can use any music that you want.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.680]   You can do it anytime you want.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.560]   And you're not paying a dollar every time you want to do it.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.160]   And that's assuming you have the song.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.240]   Now, I think that-- I will say that I think
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.120]   that the ringtones on iTunes are better
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.960]   than any other ringtone option commercially available.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.600]   But most of the people that I know
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.040]   don't use even the ones that the other--
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.640]   that the other phones are using.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.480]   They're uploading ringtones to some website
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.000]   that sends a picture mail.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.200]   You know, it's smart geeky people, though.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.280]   I think kids, like my son, bought dozens of ringtones.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.760]   Well, and the thing is, I guess I just--
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.440]   Well, I guess I had body, I might add.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.720]   Well, I mean, for me, I just-- I feel like it's fine.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.440]   I just-- I'm hoping that Apple will, once they settle in
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.080]   and they get whatever fix they fix,
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.720]   they just leave the applications that make it alone
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.880]   and let us just keep on doing what we want to do.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.120]   And then they can do whatever they want.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:13.880]   I don't think they will.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.920]   I think we're seeing the new Apple.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.560]   The Monopolist Apple.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.200]   No, I think they're going to start getting aggressive
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:20.960]   about this kind of thing.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.600]   What do you think--
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.240]   What do you think, Andy?
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.800]   --the concern of it.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.600]   Well, on-- I have two different reactions.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.480]   I mean, I've always thought that commercial ringtones
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.320]   are like those little coin-operated,
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.960]   horsing machines in front of the supermarket.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.280]   I mean, there are some little kids who seem to enjoy them.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.280]   I can walk straight by them without being tempted at all.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.320]   In terms of Apple locking people out of ringtones,
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.280]   again, it depends-- I think that they're not
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.080]   terribly interested in stopping a tool like that from working
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.840]   because you need a certain level of sophistication
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.880]   in order to make it work.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.480]   Even if it's a very, very simple level of sophistication,
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.880]   you always-- it's hard to keep in mind
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.720]   that one of the reasons why the iTunes store took off
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.680]   the way it did was because so many people didn't want
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.000]   to bother ripping CDs.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.560]   There were some people who don't want to do a conversion
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:06.920]   like that.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.200]   They want to simply say, oh, when buck
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.120]   can I get to have this ringtone?
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.720]   Cool.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.920]   I got a buck.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.800]   And I'm financially well off enough
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.400]   that in the future I'll be making another dollar.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.120]   So it's so cool for me.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.800]   I have to say, the interface is--
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.120]   I have a mixed feeling about the interface
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.240]   because on the one hand, that basic user you're talking about
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.920]   isn't going to want to slide this around and choose
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.840]   a waveform.
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.320]   It might even be intimidating to actually even see a waveform.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.000]   On the other hand, it is pretty slick.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.800]   It kind of makes you want to make a ringtone just
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.640]   to play with it.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.440]   It looks like a little garage bandy, actually.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.240]   I mean, I really do like the app.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.400]   It's one of those things where--
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.400]   it's kind of the same broad category for me
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.760]   as getting a tattoo.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.960]   For the amount of effort, I'd have
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.720]   to put it to figuring out exactly what I would pick,
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.880]   far exceeds, whatever benefit I would get from actually having it.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.400]   So let me see how this loops.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.040]   This is my Duran Duran, hungry like a wolf.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.960]   I'm just going to cut out the singing
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.720]   because I just want to come on, right?
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.840]   That's got to really annoy everybody in the 7/11
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.720]   when my phone goes up.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.760]   Don't you think?
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.200]   Isn't that what you learned from?
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:15.720]   What are you learning from?
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.360]   How happy could they be to begin with?
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.600]   I have to admit, I didn't really think that--
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.240]   I mean, I've never added any ringtones until I got the--
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.920]   until I got itoner and started testing it,
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.480]   I hadn't added ever a ringtone to my phone
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.320]   because most of the time it's just on vibrate.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.480]   And I have to admit, I started having so much fun with it.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.600]   I think partially because I could edit it myself
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.280]   that I have like 30 of them on there.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.080]   Show of hands now.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.400]   I want to hear different ringtones.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.560]   So what are you using right now, Alex, is your primary iPhone
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.480]   wrong tone?
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.360]   Hold on, I got to open it up.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.560]   And Andy and Akko, you, you, you, my friend, lucked out.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.760]   Just when you had to give your iPhone review unit back,
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.440]   they dropped the price 200 bucks.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.600]   You make-- that's looking like jumps.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.360]   Just for me.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.640]   So this is what I have right now.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.640]   This is the one that I'm--
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.840]   [SINGING]
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.800]   So anyway, so that's--
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.240]   Well, he leave for pick up the phone, you bozo.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.640]   So-- and then when my wife calls, you know, it's--
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.320]   wait, hold on.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.480]   Don't you hate them?
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.800]   You cannot quit me so quickly.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.680]   Is that Dave Matthews?
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.200]   That's good.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.080]   I like that.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.680]   That's a good question.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.360]   It works really well.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.960]   I mean, both of them, you know, I--
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.920]   I found songs that will sound really, really good.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.040]   Well, that's a good play we've all had,
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.080]   is that you can't hear the standard iPhone ring tones.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.680]   Well, I've solved that problem.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.360]   What do you use?
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.840]   Me, my-- my standard ring tone--
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.480]   [SINGING]
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.600]   Yeah, you can hear that.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.800]   Why can't this be loved by Van Halen?
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.280]   You can hear that.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.920]   You can definitely hear that.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.960]   All right, Andy.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.280]   Well, I-- because the phone interferes with recording,
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.720]   I, of course, turned off my phone and looked
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.600]   on the other side of the office.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.640]   But it's the standard--
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.880]   it's the standard analog ringing phone tone.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.080]   Because--
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.400]   Yeah, that's what I've been using.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.640]   Partly because-- for two reasons.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.640]   Number one, because I'm of that generation
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.200]   where a ringing telephone actually gets my attention
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.000]   very, very quickly.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.640]   So as a kid, that's your reason for jumping up
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.880]   from the dinner table and running into the living room.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.520]   But also because it's a loud, piercing, distinctive sound
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.280]   that penetrates your shirt pocket
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.360]   and cannot be mistaken for anything else.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.920]   I did play around with custom ring tones, you know,
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.200]   a couple of-- two or three years ago.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.480]   But I'd find myself in a store thinking, oh, wow,
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.080]   Tony Bennett, I really love this song.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.120]   Oh, wait, it's my phone.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:26.640]   Holy crap.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.480]   Plus, there is a high annoyance factor.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.080]   Well, that's-- Chris Brien has a great saying about this.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.120]   When we first were talking about the iPhone
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.520]   and people were complaining about lack of custom ring tones.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.840]   He chipped in and said, you know what?
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.040]   I consider that a feature.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.560]   Yeah, that's a plus.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.060]   Yeah.
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.440]   Now, if they just could take the phone out,
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.040]   that would really be something.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.480]   And then Andy and I were talking the other day
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.480]   about how the people who have custom ring tones
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.400]   tend to take a lot longer to answer their phone,
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.760]   because they want to make sure you hear the song.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:56.840]   How annoying.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.520]   I think we're going to get-- everybody--
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.560]   we're going to give everybody the ultimate custom ring tone.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.280]   Everybody start your edit points in two seconds.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.360]   I'm going to give it to you.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.320]   OK, ready?
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.120]   Hi.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.280]   I have a much better ring tone than yours,
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.080]   because it's so unique.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.400]   Boy, what a unique-- and current-- what a unique person I am.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.360]   We're having a ring tone that's so different.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.640]   I'm better than you.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.640]   I like it.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.520]   I like it.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.640]   Actually, I hate those talking ring tones.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.000]   Those are really annoying.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.360]   Those are really--
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.720]   Those wrap ring tones cost $30 a month.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.800]   Hey, you.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.520]   Answer the phone.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.960]   Answer-- I hate that stuff.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.400]   But that's the kind of thing it's like.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.160]   I mean, people are not happy with Apple lately
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.200]   for some of their decisions.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.120]   But let's give them credit.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.000]   They didn't put one of those deals in place
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.320]   where you've got to pay monthly to have the same ring
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.320]   at least you own it for $0.99.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.400]   And $0.99 is actually lower than the going rate.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.320]   So there you go.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.240]   Some rumors that Apple actually wants
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:59.040]   to do lower pricing on video too, on TV shows down to $0.99.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.600]   And that might be one of the reasons NBC was a little miffed.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.440]   And what's the latest on the Apple NBC Rift?
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.200]   Well, I think that all the stuff is going off the year
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.320]   next week, isn't it?
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:11.760]   Quick kill.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.360]   Or soon, I mean, all the NBC stuff.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.360]   They're not going-- I know the Apple's
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.520]   going to let NBC cash in on a new season of Heroes
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.440]   and so on and so forth.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.600]   And then leave, I think, that they're planning to--
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.160]   Didn't NBC say, though, no wait a minute.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:22.960]   We've got a contract.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.480]   We insist on staying through December.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.960]   Yeah, but for all that, they've already
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.520]   put all their content on Amazon, so--
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.120]   Right.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.280]   And this new Hulu.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.280]   Hulu.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.280]   [LAUGHING]
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.720]   So do you think this is a rumor that Apple wanted to reduce?
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.360]   I love the idea of a $0.99 TV show.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.600]   I don't know if I like that.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.640]   I mean, there's a point at which you really
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.240]   have to realize that you're in business with other people.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.480]   99 cent TV downloads would be great for Apple
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.040]   and would be great for me.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.080]   But it's really more of a play that makes it easier
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.880]   to sell iPods than a play that makes it easier for NBC
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.800]   and CBS and Bravo and all these other companies
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.640]   to make money.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.960]   Well, wait a minute, though.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.520]   Let's say a million people--
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.080]   If you left it to them, they charge $5 per half hour
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.440]   episode, I realized that.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.440]   But at 99 cents, I have to--
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.040]   I really want to talk to the TV people to figure out,
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.920]   do they think they can actually make money off of this?
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.520]   Well, remember, it's incremental income.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.960]   They didn't have a year ago.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.400]   They've already been making-- they're already
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.080]   making their money on advertising, cable deals.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.120]   Yeah, but Leo, if NBC said, by the way,
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.560]   we're putting your podcast on our website,
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.760]   we're going to give you one penny for every million downloads.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.520]   Hey, it's a penny you would have had before.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.320]   You probably would say, well, no, I'd actually rather
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.080]   go to this other guy who might give me a dollar.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:36.800]   OK.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.960]   So if there's a-- you're right.
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.240]   If there's a choice.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.480]   But excuse me, who buys video?
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.720]   Who buys-- who uses Unbox?
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.680]   Does anybody use Unbox?
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.400]   Everybody will, if all the networks
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.360]   decide to start good Unbox instead of putting their stuff
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:49.960]   on the iTunes store.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.120]   This is the Amazon.com video store.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:52.560]   I mean--
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.480]   I don't know if they will, though.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.720]   The problem is, is that a lot of this
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.760]   has to do with being easy.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.840]   I mean, and the thing is, is that if it's--
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:03.960]   I just don't think a web page-based store will ever work,
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.920]   as well as--
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.720]   iTunes has some advantages, doesn't it?
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.600]   You know, just being able to click on it and boom, it's all--
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.240]   it's all there.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:10.920]   It's all handled.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.040]   It's all taken care of for you.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.760]   The web pages are rougher.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.920]   And what happens is, it's a very, very small--
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.760]   I think there's a very small barrier for entry for people
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.480]   to just go, you know what?
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.240]   I'm just going to torrent this.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.080]   Plus, the biggest advantage that Apple has
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.760]   is that they control the hardware.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.640]   They control the software.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.920]   And they control the service.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.520]   But I'm just concerned about--
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.520]   there's a point at which, if Apple
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.600]   tries to cut the price more aggressively,
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.960]   then, again, Bravo will continue to put
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.640]   like the sort of crap shows that no one's
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.240]   watching up on the iTunes store.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.440]   But when they have a prestige show,
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.200]   like the new series of Project Runway,
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.760]   they're going to start asking around to say,
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.200]   well, who's going to give me three bucks for episode?
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.320]   Who's going to give me a minimum commitment of $20
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.600]   for the entire series?
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:53.560]   And it's difficult to imagine that Apple can just dictate
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.640]   whatever price they want.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.800]   And it'll all come out OK.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.960]   There's a point at which things start to break.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:58.600]   We should--
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.040]   We have a theory that it has nothing
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.640]   to do with what they expect it to be.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.520]   I think it's an negotiation tactic.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.040]   Well, and we should point out that Unbox requires windows
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.160]   or Tivo.
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.120]   It does not work on a Mac in any way, shape, or form.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.840]   I go jogging with a Tivo on your wrist.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.080]   Well, you can put it on a creative Zen.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.800]   But excuse me, how many creative zens
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.520]   are there and how many iPod videos are there?
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:21.880]   That's--
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.200]   I think there's one more--
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.840]   I think there's one more creative Zen than there are zoons.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.600]   Zen plus zoom equals nothing.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.960]   So you have to watch this on your PC,
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.200]   or if you've got a Tivo, you can get it to your TV, I guess.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.120]   I think that the other thing that you're--
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.560]   I think the other thing that these networks are going to be
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.560]   running up against, not right now, but probably another 12
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.960]   to 36 months down the road, is that as money starts--
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.640]   more and more and more and more starts rolling into what we
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.600]   used to call podcasting and what we're really calling
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.600]   just online media development, as those shows
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.960]   start to pick up in quality, the big question
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.880]   is whether Apple starts to really make their marketplace more
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.400]   open to independent producers.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.480]   And when they do that, it really starts to go more head
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.760]   to head with-- if Steve gets tired of dealing
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.160]   and wants to have 99-something--
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.960]   You've been saying this independent producer
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:14.880]   thing for a while, though.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.320]   I don't see any evidence.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.920]   No, I think it's coming, though.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.960]   I mean, I think that Apple--
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.040]   it's not going to come until Apple gets--
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.600]   if things break down.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.160]   It's Apple's last choice, though.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.720]   It's not Apple's first choice.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.400]   I think it's an Apple's eventual choice.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.760]   I don't think that the quality of the videos
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.800]   are high enough yet.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.840]   I don't think that the producers are ready for it yet.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.360]   I don't think Apple's in a corner enough yet.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.720]   But I think that if talks break down, the next step--
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.240]   I mean, Apple has, once again, a vertical market
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.760]   from the very beginning tools all the way to the distribution.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.480]   If they open that, they open that stream up a little bit.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.760]   It causes a lot of trouble really, really fast.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.480]   And when we look at the quality of the shows,
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.920]   I mean, the shows aren't that good right now,
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.080]   but we're only inches away from producing
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.320]   shows that are the same quality of what
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.880]   we saw on Discovery Channel 10 or 15 years ago.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:09.080]   And that stuff, especially in niche markets,
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:13.320]   it starts to, once again, divide up the viewership a lot more.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.360]   And that's really bad for the broadcasters.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.400]   I don't know whether-- I don't think it's going to happen.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.480]   I think we're just slowly going towards that.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.440]   I think that by having podcasting in iTunes,
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.200]   I mean, I think it's a way to slowly kind of keep
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.640]   that moving forward.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.240]   Apple's also pulled a nice one, a fast-- another fast one.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.440]   You get a lot of attention for the $200 price cut,
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.560]   which people were howling about.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.800]   And I'm sorry, Scott and Andy, you didn't get to weigh in
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.200]   on that last week when we had our roundtable in Vancouver.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.600]   But please, you have anything to say about it, do.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.360]   But also now, I mean, a lot of heated email
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.920]   from people who've discovered that the iPod, the new video
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:54.000]   iPods, require a special chip-enabled cable, $50, $50
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.320]   cable from Apple and no longer work with standard multimedia
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.840]   cables.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.200]   And many people, most people, everybody who I've heard from
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.440]   says this is just a monopolistic move, a greedy,
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.520]   monopolistic move on Apple's part.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.280]   Discussed.
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.320]   It's the old Silicon graphics.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.040]   The computer's $25,000 and the cable's $14,000.
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:14.600]   Right.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.920]   Had it's very frustrating.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.280]   I have to say, you have to buy a new cable.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.120]   Yeah, I got to tell you.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.600]   I know that I get a lot of heat for it.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.800]   I tend to think Apple makes more good decisions than bad.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.040]   I think this is a bad decision.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.320]   And I think this particular decision
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.680]   will potentially anger some people
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.960]   because it is so blatantly clear why they're doing it.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.800]   There's no technological reason for them
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.280]   to create this proprietary cable.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.120]   Is it blatantly clear while they're doing it?
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.760]   They're doing it.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.120]   I'm waiting to hear back from Apple
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.120]   on if there was an actual technical reason why
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.040]   they wanted to do this.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.800]   If the fact that they're putting a chip in the cable
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.480]   means that this video feature can do something really,
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.720]   really good that the previous version couldn't do.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.840]   Believe me, I am on the side of the proletariat on this one.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.880]   The idea of having to replace a cable to get no new features.
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.120]   There's just no excuse for that.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.480]   No more than when Epson and Cannon
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.640]   put chips inside their ink cartridges too.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.080]   As a safety feature, to make sure
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.800]   the people are getting their quality--
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.960]   --quality printouts when actually--
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.240]   Are there $5,000 gallon ink?
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.400]   Yeah, that's obviously rubbish.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:26.320]   But I want to find out exactly why this decision was made first.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.360]   I mean, I do think that if we learned anything
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.040]   from the price drop last week, it's that, man,
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.360]   our affection for Apple can turn on a dime.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.840]   We think that Apple loves us.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.080]   And any time that something happens that we don't like,
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.840]   we're very, very quick to decide if they're out
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.240]   to just screw us over.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.240]   Well, I said that on the show last week
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.920]   that the Apple, Cult of the Mac, is a double-edged sword
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.400]   for Steve.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.840]   And I think while he's been getting a lot of benefit
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.880]   from it for a long time, last week proved
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.240]   that it can go both ways.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.840]   Well, I think I'm--
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.760]   I think Scott's right that Apple doesn't screw up very often.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:10.200]   And so we don't see that upset very often.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.680]   And I don't think-- I mean, I think
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.000]   that as someone who bought one on the first day,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:14.960]   it didn't really bother me.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.320]   The price change didn't really--
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.120]   I felt like I got $200 a lot out of it for the first two months.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.320]   And so--
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.680]   but I have to say--
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.920]   $200 worth of $200 worth $100 worth $100 worth $100 worth $100
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.920]   worth $100 worth $100 worth $100 worth $100 worth $100 worth $100
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.480]   worth $100 worth $100 worth $100 worth $100 worth $100 worth $100.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.000]   Yeah, but this is last two months.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.600]   There's a difference.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.000]   You know, but the--
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.960]   I will say that as soon as I saw that that video wasn't working,
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.040]   I was actually going to go out--
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.120]   I tend to sample a lot of these players.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.000]   And the only player that I didn't have really in the form
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.320]   factor was that little man with little nano.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.320]   And I was planning to get it.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.680]   And I was like, well, it's a really small screen,
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.560]   but at least I can plug it into a lot of the--
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.080]   and as soon as I saw that go out, it was a no-go.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.320]   And I was just like, well, we'll just
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.680]   wait and see if Apple sorts this out.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.320]   Because I'm sure it's a software fix.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.280]   They could run an update and make it better.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.480]   In fact, a hacker could probably run an update and make it better.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.600]   The lawyers at Coglin, Stoya, Geller, Rudman, and Robbins--
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.840]   and I'm sure that those words cast a chill at this,
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.360]   got born's heart.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.080]   They're suing Cupertino saying Apple's a monopoly.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.800]   And they're saying the inability of the new line
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.360]   to play competing formats is just part of the case.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.400]   This is more evidence that the company is acting
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.520]   like a monopolist and not competitive.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.240]   And they're going to--
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.760]   Sounds like one of Robbins's ideas.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.720]   Ever since he made partner, he's been really--
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.720]   Let's go out to Apple.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.840]   Let's go out to Apple.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.880]   Neen and Neen and Neen.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.360]   Actually--
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.720]   Here's the thing.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.040]   I say, sigh.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.600]   That's all I have to say about that, sigh.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.200]   It looks slowly brown like sighs when
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.000]   he's leaning on the little wall of tennis.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   You know, it's like--
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.440]   we've come into this world where the minute you got $1.99
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.760]   in your pocket, somebody's got $1.98 going to sue you.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.160]   Well, yeah, I'm not a fan of lawsuits.
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.120]   But I do think that they're making a point that--
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:02.560]   Microsoft got a lot of heat because it had 97% or 96%
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.040]   of the operating system market department of justice
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:05.880]   sued him in '98.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.480]   And that thing's still not over.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.600]   Apple has maybe not quite the market share on the iPods.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.320]   But I would say they're pretty close to a monopoly.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.880]   And I think many people have said,
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.520]   oh, Apple's better than Microsoft.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.960]   I think when you see-- when Apple has as much of a monopoly
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.280]   as Microsoft, I think you'll see they're no different.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.880]   It may be even worse in some regards.
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.960]   I think this should be the providence
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.520]   of the United States government, not private law firms.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.560]   Well, I agree.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.400]   If there's actually monopolistic tendencies
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.160]   on behalf of any company, the government
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.440]   has a duty to take care of it.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.600]   You've got to remember who's in charge in Washington right now.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.600]   I don't think there's--
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.080]   Well, we've got a government that's monopolistic.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.080]   So what are we going to do?
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.320]   There hasn't been an antitrust case in some time, I think.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.880]   I think it's much, much better if this be the result
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.280]   of the will of the people and not the will of the government.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:00.400]   We already see in the FCC what happens when the FCC 10 people
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.600]   decide that something needs to be removed from the air.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.240]   If people really care enough about this cable idea,
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.720]   they will fund a class action suit.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.080]   And they will put enough heat on Apple
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.160]   that they have to roll it back.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.240]   Or they just won't buy it.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.240]   Or they will buy it back.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.800]   I think we jump topics there, Andy.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.040]   I mean, I'm not-- on the cable, I agree.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.960]   But I mean, in terms of Apple being a monopoly,
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.160]   like in the terms of the Microsoft--
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.560]   Well, being a monopoly is meaningless
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.520]   unless you use your monopoly--
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.120]   wield your monopoly power.
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.560]   I'm saying when you start to affect the market
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.480]   as opposed to what consumers can do,
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.840]   that's when the government steps in.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.720]   When you start making it impossible for anybody else
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.000]   to hook one piece of sand to another piece of sand
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.960]   with a piece of copper, which defines every piece
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.720]   of electronics out there, then, yeah,
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.200]   I think the mighty hammer of justice
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.960]   needs to smash down in your head very, very quickly
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.480]   and very, very repeatedly.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.440]   But I mean--
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.880]   But all these private lawsuits, for the most part,
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.720]   they fail, for the most part.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.480]   They eat-- either they generate a quick payoff,
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.920]   which is what most of them are designed to do.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.920]   Or they end up in court for 10 years, and nothing happens.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.360]   And it's just-- all I can say is I repeat sigh.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.160]   Here's something that'll cheer you up, Scott.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.160]   Thank you.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.320]   The iPhone SIM-free unlock is causing
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.440]   all sorts of problems for people who have used it there.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.960]   You know, by the way, they decided to sell this
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.560]   as a wholesale unlock.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.680]   They're not selling to end users.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.440]   They're going to sell to cell phone vendors
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.360]   and people who will wholesale unlock it.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.040]   Probably that way they don't have to deal with end users.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.520]   But according to a number of reports,
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.560]   people are having trouble with the unlock.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.400]   They're having--
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.400]   You think?
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.440]   As Gizmodo reported, not my favorite,
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:39.000]   but they reported that there's pin security
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.680]   and when there's a pin protected SIM card, it doesn't work.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.120]   The pin has to be disabled well.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.200]   OK, that's fine.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.200]   Anyway.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.560]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.840]   We don't know a lot of people are using it yet, so that's--
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.200]   I guess we'll have to wait.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.520]   I just want to point out that I would love
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.960]   to see an unlock phone.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.320]   And if somebody has an unlock phone--
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.600]   Well, I got to point out Ryan offering a chance for you
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.100]   to see it.
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.280]   You insisted he do it on the show, and et cetera, et cetera.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.560]   And you didn't want it.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.520]   I asked Ryan to bring his unlock phone to my studio
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.720]   so that I could video an audio tape for posterity,
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.000]   say, in a record, that it existed and it worked.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.360]   And I make that offer to anyone, not just Ryan.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.720]   Well, he offered to do it a neutral middle ground
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.920]   and you turned him down.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.640]   I turned him down because I couldn't verify the authenticity
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.240]   without my assets in place.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.080]   So I want--
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:27.440]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.080]   --amazing Randy of this podcast.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.720]   I want anybody.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.320]   Let's take Ryan out of the equation
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.600]   because that's a hot button.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.640]   Let's anybody bring me an unlock phone, please.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.000]   And I will--
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.400]   listen, I would think that if you're an unlocker,
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.160]   the ultimate thing to do is to get in front
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.640]   of the largest iPhone audience in the world, which I have
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.640]   on the Apple phone show.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.120]   So bring it to me and I will tout your skill.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.880]   Well, remember, they don't have any incentive.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.320]   It's the iPhone SIM-free people.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.160]   Have they contacted you?
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.040]   Are you kidding me?
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.960]   Listen, I saw their ad right next to the guy that's
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.640]   selling Oceanfront property in Phoenix.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:58.920]   Really?
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.080]   So you're skeptical about it.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.840]   Did you see the details of how that thing works?
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.720]   I mean, you've got to be ridiculously out of your mind
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.480]   to believe that this thing is for real.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.600]   You have to buy all this stuff side unseen.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.600]   It's from some guy at-- come on.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.480]   Look at the details and tell me, Leo,
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.040]   you really think that's a real deal.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.320]   Well, I think that's probably why they're doing it
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.360]   through resellers, right?
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.720]   Because it is complicated and the reseller can
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.680]   automate the process.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.880]   Scott, the fact that they're able to do it in software
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.360]   is mind-boggling in the first place.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.160]   I'm not surprised to take some hoops to jump through.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.400]   I just want to see somebody prove it to me.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.320]   And then I will promote it.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.520]   I'll put it like that.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.480]   Well, I've talked to two people who have--
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.680]   in fact, I've had calls from two people who
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.640]   on an unlocked phone.
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.480]   So I know it works.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.640]   What is your skepticism?
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.400]   My skepticism.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.480]   I mean, if they're calling me on a T-Mobile network
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.800]   with an unlocked phone, is that not sufficient for you?
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   Well, I just want it to be somebody I know and trust.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.040]   If you said, Leo, I have an iPhone in my hand that's unlocked,
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.640]   I would believe you and that would be the end of it.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.520]   Maybe Ryan to lend me his and then how about that?
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.440]   If you, to your satisfaction, believe
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.760]   that Ryan's is truly unlocked--
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:09.480]   Oh, I do.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.040]   To my satisfaction, he's called me on it.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:11.880]   No, no, no, no.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.520]   I mean, if you have it in your hand.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.200]   But I know Ryan, as--
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.720]   trust him as much as you say you trust me.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.160]   OK.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.400]   Well, I don't see why he would even lie about it.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.080]   Anyway, let's not get in this subject.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.160]   Just to be sure, make sure you get the one that
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.800]   requires you both that big household dimmer switch
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.800]   in fact of it.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.480]   We'll see.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.800]   The hardware unlock, I know no one's going to do that.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.680]   I mean, that's a cool thing.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.480]   And by the way, we don't know what
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.360]   happened to the other software unlocking company.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.520]   They seem to have disappeared off the face of the map.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.960]   Yeah, well, that's another big surprise.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.840]   Here's the thing.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.240]   If this thing works, there's a subset of people
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.120]   in the US that need it, the people who are totally
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:55.720]   committed to T-Mobile, who've got four or five family members
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.360]   on the D&E.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.160]   After what we're hearing from AT&T,
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.240]   I'm surprised anybody would want to move to AT&T.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.240]   What a ghastly company.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.160]   Why?
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.560]   Oh, have you heard about the massive overseas cell phone?
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.560]   Oh, from me.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:13.280]   I mean, there's all sorts of reasons to loathe AT&T.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.400]   Oh, I don't have to.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.240]   I've been loading up for the first time.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.200]   OK, Alex, go ahead.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.680]   I have been hit by not $4800.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.240]   I'm not a big heavy phone user, but I've gone--
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:25.000]   I've made international--
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.960]   I made a bunch of calls from Heathrow one time.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.280]   I came back and it was $400.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.520]   From-- that was Verizon.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.440]   When you go outside of your continent, bad things
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.680]   are going to happen.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.600]   I use the iPhone the whole time when I was in Zimbabwe.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.960]   But I didn't use any of the data.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.600]   Yeah, you have to be careful to turn off the data.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.360]   In fact, this family that they're talking about,
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.760]   they had three phones.
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.040]   They did nothing to protect themselves.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.360]   But they didn't make international calls,
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.640]   and that's what surprised them.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.200]   It was all data.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.520]   Well, and that's the whole thing.
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.480]   You've got to be aware.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.600]   I mean, I don't think that-- I think that to me,
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.440]   it seems a common sense, but I guess it wasn't for them.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.840]   I mean, this may sound good, but if you're in London,
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.000]   you also have to realize that they're
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.840]   going to charge you for water unless you actually
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:08.760]   ask for tap water.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.280]   If they refill your glass without asking,
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.960]   they're going to charge you for that refill.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.320]   I mean, this is all--
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.280]   oh, yeah.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:18.560]   I actually had the one time that I used my American privilege
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.080]   of being poor saying, no, thank you for the free water
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.680]   you gave me because I ordered one glass,
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.120]   and you gave me 41 free ones.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.200]   So why not leaving here until you take off the bill?
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:26.700]   Yeah.
[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.000]   And so I'm an American.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.560]   I'm out of this country in three days
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.920]   whether you get arrested or not.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.680]   I'm perfectly fine to ruin the dining experience of 30 other
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:37.000]   people and decrease your tips by 40%
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.920]   across the entire room, or you can just
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:43.200]   take this $40 charge off my bill.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.400]   Anyway, I feel sorry for someone who
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.240]   got hit with a clobber with a huge bill,
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.920]   and I would hope that for some people,
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.320]   AT&T would have long conversations and realize that, OK,
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.120]   well, what if we take some money off of this
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:00.120]   because we realize that you weren't trying to close a huge business
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.200]   deal with Sanoco across the United Arab Emirates?
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.080]   You're just a kid who just forgot to turn off his data plan.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.160]   But anybody who leaves the country with their cell phone
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.280]   enabled and doesn't know that they're
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.560]   going to get clobbered with fees, they
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.440]   should have read both sides of that pamphlet they got when
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.760]   they signed up for the service.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:21.320]   And the thing is, is that AT&T is paying someone in Europe
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.800]   to-- they're paying a provider there.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.160]   So it's not like if AT&T gives you a full refund,
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.560]   it would cost them probably $2,000 or $3,000
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.520]   to give you that refund.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.080]   It's not just like, oh, they're just writing it off.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.440]   It's literally like they owe some provider in Europe
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.560]   for that usage.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:39.360]   And they have given a lot of refunds,
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.560]   but they've slowed that down.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.960]   Their position being, according to an AT&T spokesperson
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.120]   I talked to, that, hey, this has been in the news quite a bit.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:50.120]   So nowadays, we're not really being forgiving.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.280]   People should know.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.240]   I agree, Leo.
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.840]   They should come up with a different system,
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:33:00.120]   so it's terrible to be even subjected to that possibility.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.080]   It's just a click through.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.600]   Even just a click through just warning you that you're roaming.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.360]   Yeah, often I will get a text message
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.640]   when I go out of the country saying,
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.120]   and a lot of this-- it's interesting,
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.560]   because this obviously is a problem,
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.080]   because on other phones, the third party software like Shozu
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.120]   will turn off roaming.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.040]   We'll turn itself off saying, you're international,
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.920]   unless you explicitly tell me, you probably
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.760]   don't want us doing what we do.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.640]   Now, here's the interesting.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.800]   Is this Apple's problem or AT&T's problem?
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   Both are problem.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.280]   Well, maybe Apple should have put this warning in.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.240]   Yeah, I think they both share some culpability
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.440]   for lack of information dissemination.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.560]   This might be Apple showing its lack of experience
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:43.840]   in the cell industry here.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.960]   Yeah, they're new at this.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.840]   They've never done it before.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.120]   They would have been--
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.280]   it probably happens to every company the first time
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.840]   they make a cell phone, and then they learn.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.680]   Well, isn't this like the--
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.600]   doesn't Apple's responsibility here sort of end
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.400]   with anticipating this problem and then putting in that pop-up
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.000]   saying, oh, by the way, you're going to roaming.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.920]   Do you want me to turn off all the expensive features?
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.920]   Because after that, because you can't simply tell them
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.280]   that if someone runs into a billing issue
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.600]   because they went over their minutes
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.160]   and they didn't realize that they're going to be charged
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.640]   at $0.89 per minute, don't go into the genius bar
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.760]   at the Apple store and complain, because--
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.720]   like, complain to the waiter that the chocolate cake they
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.800]   bought from next door was too tart.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.160]   No, I think that it would be nice to have a little switch
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.320]   in the settings that said international.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.360]   Turn off all the data.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.920]   Well, I think that it would be great to also have in the settings
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.000]   just to have it--
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.040]   one thing I was looking for while I was in Zimbabwe
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.160]   was I was looking for somewhere that was telling me
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:40.200]   what charges over my standard billing was happening.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.280]   It'd be really great if that was in real time
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.600]   or something that within a day you have it somewhere--
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.000]   Well, you do have a usage meter.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:47.760]   I mean, you can--
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.480]   I reset that.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.200]   That's how usage meter, but for instance, like the SMS,
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.360]   my data showed up, but it didn't tell me
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.320]   whether I was getting charged for SMS or not.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.200]   And so even though it's free SMS, I am in Zimbabwe.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.240]   I was expecting to pay a certain amount per every SMS,
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.840]   but I never saw anything come up.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.040]   And I haven't gotten my bill yet, so I don't know--
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.920]   I really don't know how much it cost me to do that.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.280]   This is another reason--
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.400]   go ahead.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.400]   That's it.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:12.900]   OK.
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:16.840]   I was going to say this is just another reason why not having
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:20.280]   the iPhone in a SIM unlocked state is just a real bummer,
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.320]   because I've made--
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.480]   I've made-- I've made 20-- when I switched from my first Sony
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.440]   Ericsson Bluetooth phone to something better,
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.520]   I paid the $20 to somebody to have it unlocked.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.240]   And now every time that I travel to London,
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.800]   every time I travel to another country,
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.360]   the first stop I make at the airport
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.920]   is to buy one of those $30 prepaid SIM cards.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.480]   You pop it in, and now you've got $30
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.680]   where the local calls going for you,
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.000]   because it'd be great if I could still use my iPhone overseas.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.480]   And I haven't traveled overseas yet, but man alive.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.680]   I'm almost at the state where I would consider leaving it
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.760]   behind, because the last thing I want to do
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.960]   is get distracted before I board the airplane
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.960]   and forget to turn it off completely.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.800]   Here's a question mark that I got from Bob Turner, who emailed us.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.560]   He was reading the fine print, something nobody seems to do.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.760]   It is AT&T agreement.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.960]   And by the way, it does say this.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.320]   Number one, international messages
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.160]   not included charges for international messages sent from the US
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.240]   are $0.20 for text messages, $0.50 for picture video messages,
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.720]   two, and this is, I had not seen this.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.120]   Of course, I didn't read it.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.000]   And I'm curious what you say about this.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.800]   Additional charges for premium messages and content apply.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.680]   Here's the key.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.680]   Messages over 300 kilobytes build an additional $0.50 per message.
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:35.200]   Ooh, MMS coming.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:39.760]   I don't know, I have to look at the full agreement.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.240]   Maybe this section is about SMS, maybe.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.600]   Maybe it's just boilerplate that they cut and paste
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.040]   and every phone they sell.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.760]   But of course, if I were writing for it
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.840]   and one of the rumor sites, I'd say,
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.280]   "Oh, there's a smoking gun, dude.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.680]   We're gonna be able to attach pictures."
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.480]   Oh, wait a minute, it's more than a tear case.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.320]   It's gonna be pretty good.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.080]   What happens if I get an email that's over 300K?
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.600]   They're gonna bill me 50 cents a message.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.880]   Now I want my itemized box bill in a box.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.720]   Maybe that's, maybe now I'm in talk about conspiracy theory.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.520]   Now we know why they sent out the bill in the box
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.800]   'cause now they could say, "Well, you turned that off."
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.920]   Step two, put it in a box.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.840]   You've got a bill in a box.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.320]   Hey, you know what this whole exercise
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.360]   makes me realize I am so very glad
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.040]   I am not in the cell phone business.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.560]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.880]   'Cause you just can't please anybody.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:29.400]   Well, well, first of all, you'd have to get by
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.080]   without a human heart.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.720]   I think it's one of those three bell bovine hearts
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.800]   that they put in there.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.280]   And that means that the jogging is out,
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.920]   the tennis is out, running for a cab is out.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.000]   Well, the reason I actually talked to an AT&T about this
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.640]   is because somebody else pointed out, unrelated to this issue,
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.640]   the 300K limit to me, and I call them and ask about it,
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:52.480]   and their defense is, look, I mean,
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.880]   we have rev share agreements with networks.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.320]   We've got all these bandwidth issues,
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:00.360]   and we pay more when we pay a lot more
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.200]   when the files go over that size,
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.200]   so we've got to recover.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.440]   That's what they say.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.640]   Now I don't know if it's true, but that's what they say.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:13.160]   I can't wait till Apple buys into this 700 megahertz frequency.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:17.800]   Choynes up with Google, puts out the iPhone as the goof phone.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:21.560]   You think that by making a $7 billion purchase
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.880]   on their American Express card,
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.080]   they're gonna keep dropping the cost of TV shows
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:26.920]   on the iTunes store.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.760]   No, you're right.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.360]   That's gonna see $10 for episode of Sanford and Son.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.200]   What was I thinking?
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.960]   Businessweek says that they've heard it
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.960]   from two different sources that Apple is looking at.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.200]   I don't know what that means.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.360]   They still have to, if they wanna do it,
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.680]   they have to put up a $4.6 billion bond as Google did.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.520]   The 700 megahertz auction that's coming up January 16th,
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:50.680]   of course that's that prime spectrum that could be used
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:55.800]   for all sorts of things, including kind of a new wireless network.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.240]   That's what Google seems to be looking at.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.240]   They're working on their own goof phone.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.720]   Maybe, I mean, is Apple gonna bid against Google,
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.480]   or are they gonna bid with Google?
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.480]   I don't see them bidding with them.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:13.120]   Maybe Apple puts up some and Google puts up some.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.920]   Remember Google was going, it's insist,
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.360]   one of the conditions Google had was that this be sold off
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:22.920]   to a wholesale rate to other participants.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.320]   So maybe that's what Google's, maybe Google's gone to Apple
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.440]   and said, I mean, look, Eric's on the board.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:30.920]   Hey, you know, got an extra $5 billion?
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.800]   Wanna buy a third of this?
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.960]   Yeah, it's like that episode of the Honeymooners
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.000]   where Ralph and Ed bought a TV together.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:38.840]   That doesn't work out.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.640]   (laughing)
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.760]   But Apple's gonna need a hell of a partner to make this work.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.440]   I mean, it's tantalizing to think of,
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.640]   Apple is the king of exploiting the fact of controlling
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.160]   the entire experience and for end.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.920]   If you give them control of not just the hardware,
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.600]   not just the software, not just the desktop,
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.440]   but also the wireless network,
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.160]   that's just, you know, drool inducing to figure out
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.320]   how that's gonna work.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.680]   But they would need a hell of a major partner
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.040]   to get this up and running.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.600]   It might be five, six, seven, eight years before
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.160]   they start really taking advantage of it.
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.000]   I say we continue to cause Apple pain
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.960]   in this cell phone relationship.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.920]   Make them wanna, you know, do it themselves.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.860]   Just make it so painful for them.
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:18.480]   (laughing)
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.880]   It's like paying my bill in pennies.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.440]   Canadian, Canadian.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:24.000]   One, three, four, five.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:24.840]   Let's hurt.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:25.920]   I know there are people behind me at the Apple store.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.760]   I don't care.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.680]   Five, six, oh, last count, gotta start again.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.120]   One, two, three, four.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.560]   Okay, maybe not going that far.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.520]   But, you know, I mean, there's certainly feeling pain
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.800]   in this relationship, aren't they?
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.240]   Well, it's AT&T, and I said from the very beginning
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.480]   that that was potentially the big bugaboo.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.160]   And I still think it said that.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.800]   I still think it's the big bugaboo.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.960]   And, you know, here's the deal.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.160]   This contracts five years long.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.640]   And you look at the run up to making this new spectrum
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.360]   into something real bad.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.320]   Just so happens, that's about five years.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.160]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.960]   I predict Apple find a way out of this contract
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.600]   before five years is up.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.440]   They might.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.040]   Could they make, I mean, we haven't,
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.640]   nobody's seen the paper, maybe you have Scott.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.480]   But.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.320]   I have it, I have it.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.520]   But I mean, I have some.
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.400]   Could they make a different phone
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.360]   and sell it on a different network?
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:17.040]   Or does AT&T have an Apple exclusive like all phones we own?
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:17.880]   They couldn't do that.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.480]   Apple would never do that.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.840]   No, but you gotta imagine there's some pretty tight language
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:22.680]   there.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.800]   And I mean, nobody outside Apple's legal team
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.000]   seen the contract.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.640]   Apple and AT's legal team seen the contract.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.080]   But there are a lot of analysts who've stepped up
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:35.040]   and these are analysts at big companies like Piper Jaffrey.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.080]   And they're talking about what it looks like the contract says.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:41.600]   And most people agree it's a fairly exclusive contract
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.240]   for about five years.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.200]   That's the closest number we've gotten.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.440]   And it does include Revshare.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.400]   And I know everyone loves to scream whenever I say Revshare.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:54.280]   Well, you know, get on the web and go to Piper Jaffrey
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.560]   and see what they say about it.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.200]   I mean, it's not Scott Born saying it.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.120]   These are well respected Wall Street analysts saying it.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:03.080]   And I think that that's gonna come to an end.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.720]   And then this spectrum deal might make sense
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.760]   because they would build something like that.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.600]   Yeah, that people think the spectrum deal's gonna yield
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.840]   a new phone in a couple of weeks out of their mind.
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.600]   Well, Google's, you know, everybody seems to agree.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:18.080]   Google has been working on a phone for a year.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.880]   Now, whether Google's officially working on a phone
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.520]   or somebody's, you know, 5%, I mean, it's unclear,
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.040]   but there's clearly development going on.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.440]   And Google has network resources.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.880]   Yeah, I mean, most of their Boston office here
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.840]   is pretty much devoted to phone research
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.760]   going to things that I've heard in an article,
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.120]   really good article in the Boston Globe last week.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.480]   There you go.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.560]   Apple has sold 1 million phones.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.400]   It's official.
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:45.120]   They've released the press release or whatever.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:49.200]   They have sold a million units.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:52.760]   And that means are they on track for 10 million?
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.760]   I don't think so.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:58.880]   It depends on how the Christmas season typically
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.280]   can be very, very heavy.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.960]   They have to have the same kind of run up
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.880]   that they had in the first two months, right?
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.080]   Yeah, you're gonna sell as much over the holiday season
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.360]   as they did when everybody had like six months
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.360]   with a pent up, you know, corniness over the next one.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.160]   They may be counting though on European
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.040]   or international sales too to make that 10 million, right?
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.440]   I mean, presumably there's the same kind of pent up demand
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.560]   everywhere else.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.800]   Yeah, that's not a US number.
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.400]   It's a total number.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.960]   So, all I can say is the day after the announcement,
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.200]   the Apple store in downtown San Francisco
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.280]   was full of people's just hovering around iPhones again.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.600]   There was a bunch of guys in the office
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:37.800]   that bought one immediately.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:38.880]   I mean, they were just boom.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.480]   That was the magic with the ice point.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:46.400]   A survey you which is a company that just does college
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:50.800]   student research, researched college kids
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.600]   all over the country and apparently their decision
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:57.000]   to buy an iPhone that was pretty much hemmed right in
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.800]   at the 399 price point, which would cause like twice as many
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.840]   to want to buy one as it was before.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:07.480]   As soon as I was watching the keynote presentation,
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.480]   kind of like Oracle on DC Comics,
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.600]   I had like four screens everywhere with operatives
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:12.520]   giving live coverage.
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.520]   As soon as I saw the 399 price drop
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.400]   and saw it appear on three other screens
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.320]   like being confirmed, my next step was to call
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.760]   the local Apple store to see if that would affect
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:22.840]   current stock.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.480]   And then the next step after that was to desperately wait
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.040]   with my hat, my coat, my shoes on or for the conference
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.440]   to answer I could drive down to down to the mall and buy one.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.400]   And I wasn't even the first one there.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.960]   Someone bought right before me, but seems like every single
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.520]   Ford gig model they had.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.520]   And I would have been surprised if they had any left by the
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.280]   time the normal people with the real jobs got out of it.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:44.680]   You've all had now a week to take a look at the new
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:45.760]   iPods.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.920]   Has anybody picked up a nano?
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:49.760]   Yep.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.640]   I took one on that trip to New York.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.680]   Oh, yeah, I saw it on your sell up picture.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.840]   Sell up picture.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.800]   So what do you think?
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.120]   Oh, it's wonderful.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:01.080]   It's not nearly as chunky and unwieldy as the pictures
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:01.880]   make it out to be.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:02.600]   The wine that I've been--
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.760]   Once you see it sideways, you realize, oh, this is really,
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:05.520]   really small.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:06.960]   It really is a wafer thing.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:12.120]   It's as if like Sun Rio made an iPod, big eyes and no mouth.
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.960]   The screen--
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.400]   The detail on the screen is really is incredible.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:20.520]   I had some ITV shows that I recorded and converted to.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:23.640]   And I could actually read, make out at least, the small print
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.960]   at the bottom of one of those fly-by-night mortgage ads.
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.720]   So it's better than an iPod with video?
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.320]   I wouldn't say it's better than an iPod with video.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:34.400]   I think the screen is exactly as small as you can possibly
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:37.160]   make it and still make it a credible screen for watching
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.160]   video, because this is definitely the thing where I'm even
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:40.640]   on the train.
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.920]   I was just holding it like at a round like breastbone level.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.560]   And if I had left it on the tray, it would have been more
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.200]   of an audio experience than anything else.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.880]   The big story, though, is the tweak to the user interface,
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.680]   because they have really given an extra coat of polish,
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:55.960]   an extra coat of pain.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.680]   It's the familiar iPod interface, but it looks like it was
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:04.120]   written by people who had finally had as many resources,
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:07.480]   both inside Apple and inside the actual iPod hardware,
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.080]   as they could have possibly wanted.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:12.160]   Everything is fresher, everything is more fluid.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.640]   It's a real treat to work with.
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.720]   The impression that I got was that if Apple had decided not
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:19.680]   to go with a touchscreen interface for the iPhone,
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:21.880]   this is what the iPhone interface would look like.
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:22.760]   Interesting.
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:26.280]   Didn't Apple end their contract with a company that provided
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.560]   them with the original OS about a year or two ago?
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:30.680]   Yep, that died out.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.280]   Pixio.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.560]   True Pixo, right?
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.800]   Yeah, as a matter of fact, it was such a big difference
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.800]   that when I had my briefing, I asked Greg Josswieck,
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.880]   now is this running OS 10, like the iPhone?
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.880]   Because it's doing things I'm not used to seeing an iPhone
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:43.120]   doing.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.560]   The cover flow feature, it's a little bit jerky,
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.000]   whereas on the iPhone, it's perfectly smooth animation
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   on the iPod nano at least.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.320]   It's a little bit jerky, but I'm not used to an iPod
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:58.600]   having computing power that I'm used to seeing on a PDA.
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.400]   And of course, any answer to that turned out to be no,
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:03.160]   but it sort of says something that I wondered what kind
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:04.880]   of system resources were under the hood today.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.320]   Somebody told me there's to-do lists as well on the nano.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.520]   I didn't see them.
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.600]   Maybe I just didn't have anything to sync to it.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:13.880]   But they're all kinds of little touches,
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.040]   like the stopwatch feature.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.640]   This is the sort of thing that impresses me.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.040]   I don't know what that says about me.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:24.120]   But it has a stopwatch feature, but it has the right-hand side
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.480]   of the screen is given up with little like 60 minutes type
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:28.480]   icons to show you what you're selecting, album art,
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:29.440]   and that sort of thing.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.600]   So when you activate the stopwatch,
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.400]   you see the numeric display, hours, minutes,
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:34.680]   seconds, fraction to a second.
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:38.280]   But then you notice that the full color icon of the stopwatch
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.200]   is also going.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.240]   And the time on the stopwatch also reflects the current time
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.240]   that you're actually recording.
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.040]   And I'm like, oh.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.040]   It's little things.
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:48.640]   Somebody decide I'm not cutting corners here.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:49.480]   How about that?
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:50.320]   I'm going for brokenness.
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.320]   Are they still using PicSote?
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:55.640]   Do you think this is a symptom of a move to OS 10?
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.040]   Or just more processor power, and so they can do more?
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:00.280]   There must be more processor power,
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.800]   because it was refreshing the screen a lot.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.520]   There must be more processor power there.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.160]   It's not running OS 10, because I asked that specifically
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.880]   and was told no.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:11.240]   But I really want to see with a technical spec.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.480]   I want to see with a breakdown.
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.720]   I think that actually someone has already, of course.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:17.120]   It may just be that there's so many resources,
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.400]   but people who are going to take their first $200
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.240]   buy an iPod for the sake of carrying it down.
[00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.440]   And being the first to post this assembly fix.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.360]   God bless them.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.120]   There's also the site that buys one
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:27.840]   and hits it with a hammer in the parking lot.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.120]   But that's a difference.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:31.560]   I'm going to buy one and put it in a blender.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.560]   And that's right.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.240]   That's a third site.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.160]   A site like that.
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.640]   Pretty much Apple can guarantee three copies of anything
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.600]   will be sold for three different--
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:40.360]   Everybody, but I'm going to buy one
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.320]   and give it to poor orphan children who
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:44.760]   have no music in their lives.
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.720]   Because I think there should be more pleasure.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.760]   And I'm going to fill mine with books on tape
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.960]   and send them to certain politicians.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.160]   Speaking of books on tape--
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.160]   Illiterate politicians.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.800]   I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.040]   I did that, didn't I?
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.080]   You did that.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:02.240]   I want to thank our friends at audible.com as always.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.680]   They have sponsored the podcast for the last three months.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.960]   And I'm proud to say we thought it was going to end in September.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.560]   They've decided to stick around.
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.560]   Because they're so happy.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:11.360]   They're so happy.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.560]   And they ought to be because we are Audible Lovers,
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:16.960]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:20.160]   If you are an Audible listener, you already know.
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:25.560]   But if you haven't tried it, I invite you to go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:26.840]   And sign up.
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.040]   You get a credit for a free book.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:29.960]   No cost.
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:32.440]   And we always recommend good books for you to read.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:35.160]   In fact, I'm going to put together a page of all our recommendations.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.760]   Because there's-- now there's quite a few.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:39.160]   There's something that almost 100 recommendations.
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.240]   So I think we need to put together a page for that.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:44.880]   I've been promising to do that for a while, but I will.
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:46.240]   I was thinking of recommending it.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.160]   I haven't read it yet.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.560]   And so I'm going to ask our panel, what they think.
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:55.680]   The second coming of Steve Jobs, Alan Deutschman's book about Steve Jobs.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.400]   Is it a good book, do you think?
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:01.080]   I just downloaded it and haven't had a chance to listen to it.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.440]   Then there's also icon.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:05.200]   There's a couple of good-- I know good.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:08.360]   There's a couple of books about Steve Jobs on Audible Worth reading.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:14.000]   Jeff Young, who wrote icon-- remember, this was the one that got their books banned from
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.840]   the Apple store.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.560]   Certainly, we'd worth reading to find out why their book got banned.
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:25.680]   But I'm just curious if either of these books give you any insight into Jobs, why he is
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:27.280]   the way he is.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.360]   Deutschman's going to be a little bit less technological.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:33.120]   He's a dream editor at Vanity Fair.
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:36.200]   So maybe not, he does cover technology.
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:38.200]   Nobody's read that one.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:39.920]   Anyway, a couple of books--
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:43.840]   Especially when it comes to books about Steve Jobs, every time I've read a section of a book
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:48.600]   that tries to get into his head or tries to tell the whole story, I see a lot of things
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:52.040]   that have been cut and pasted from really publicly available stuff.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:56.200]   I yet to see something that has real insight because Steve takes--
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.200]   He's so close.
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:00.400]   --a tight frame on that and also makes it very, very clear to people inside his inner
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:03.080]   circle that, you know, you want to talk to that guy.
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:10.480]   Because hey, if you don't want to get free iPods and iPhones, if you want to see that
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:13.240]   bulge in my shirt pocket and say, hey, Steve, what's that?
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:15.800]   And I say, it's something secret that I'm not allowing you to see because I'm still pissed
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:16.800]   off about the book.
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.320]   Hey, go ahead and talk.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:24.360]   But the first time someone really manages to crack that, and it's going to be a fascinating
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:28.440]   book, but I really think that's not going to happen until Steve sees the--
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:32.040]   Here's the hoof beats of the mighty steed of death behind him and decides to leave a
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.040]   legacy behind.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:37.200]   I might actually know Steve Jobs better than many because I've actually spent a long weekend
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.360]   with him and his family.
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:43.280]   But it was before he went back to Apple, so I don't know if it applies.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.600]   What was it when it was Disney vacations?
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:48.840]   You were in the magic teat-- teat cups together and decided to expand and did--
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:49.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:50.840]   No, no.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:51.840]   This is--
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.920]   We have a mutual friend, and it was a Fourth of July weekend.
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.240]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.960]   And I think I did get some insight to Steve, but I don't think I got--
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.280]   And I certainly didn't get any--
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.800]   He's not the kind of guy that opens up.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:08.240]   Although we had a long conversation about what Apple should have done--
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:11.040]   This was again, when he was at Pixar, and not hadn't rejoined Apple.
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:12.040]   It was just before.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:13.280]   It was like a year before he rejoined Apple.
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:20.040]   But what they should have done and how Microsoft basically caught up with Apple, with Windows.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.040]   And he was a little bitter about that.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.200]   It was very interesting.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.640]   He actually said they should have licensed the operating system.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:28.840]   Clearly changed his attitude after that.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:31.120]   But anyway, there would be a couple of good books to try out.
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.480]   There's a lot of good technology books.
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:35.680]   Another good one would be the nudist on the late shift and other true tales of Silicon
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:36.920]   Valley, Pope Bronson wrote that.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.080]   And that I could vouch for.
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:39.080]   It's a really interesting book.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:40.080]   But it's a little old.
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:42.080]   It's about eight years old, but fascinating.
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:47.080]   Some great books at Audible, A-U-D-I-B-L-E dot com.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:48.880]   That is the website.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:54.120]   And if you want to get that free book, that credit to our free book, go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.480]   We thank Audible for supporting the show.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:58.200]   And I can't tell you how much I love Audible.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:01.520]   I'm just finishing up Anne Rice's latest blood and gold.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.680]   Oh, man, it's good.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:07.560]   And I mentioned on Twitter, I'm returning to the Master in Commander series, the Aubrey
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.560]   Matron series.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:09.560]   And I've got three more left.
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:10.560]   And I'm so sad.
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:13.480]   Oh, I wanted to mention somebody said, don't-- now, when you steer people towards the Aubrey
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:17.760]   Matron, make sure that they know to get the Patrick Tull versions.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.640]   There are three different readers.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.560]   And there's only the best one.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:24.080]   Awesome is Patrick Tull.
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:31.320]   So if you just do an Audible search for M-A-T-U-R-I-N or Patrick O'Brien, get the Patrick Tull
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.960]   version and Master in Commanders of First One.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.400]   So there's a few Audible recommendations.
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:39.400]   We thank them for participating in our show.
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:40.400]   Let's see.
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.960]   We got the millionth iPhone sold.
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:45.240]   I'm trying to remember what other stories I wanted to bring up.
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.000]   Anything else?
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   People were hot to talk about.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.440]   Oh, I still want to talk about the iPods.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.440]   That's right.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.640]   We'd begun our conversation.
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:55.160]   The iPod touch won't be out until later this month, right?
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:56.160]   Right.
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.160]   So nobody's had a chance to play with that.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:00.240]   Now, the big thing with the iPod touch is that people have been talking about is the
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:05.440]   fact that Apple has, for some reason, once again, this is one of those things that you
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:07.640]   can't figure out what's going on.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:13.920]   The reports are is that you can't add appointments into your calendar on the touch while you can
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:14.920]   on the iPhone.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:15.920]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:16.920]   That's--
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.720]   That appears to be correct.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:19.720]   What?
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:20.720]   That is correct.
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:25.600]   That it said that you could on the site and then it was removed.
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:26.600]   Can you--
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:27.600]   Is there a notepad?
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:28.600]   Can you type notes?
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:29.600]   Can you--
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:33.600]   There's no notepad, but there is-- the code for the virtual keyboard is there.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:37.400]   If you're on a web page and you want to post-- you want to use a webmail or if you want
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:41.720]   to post to a message board, any instance in which the on-screen keyboard would pop up
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:46.000]   in Safari on the iPhone, it will work on the iPod touch.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.920]   I did ask that question specifically.
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:51.640]   But the big question is, why would they take out being able to add stuff to your calendar?
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:53.640]   Make you buy an iPhone.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:59.000]   Probably because it's not a feature that's built into an other iPod.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.480]   So maybe there just aren't any hooks for supporting that.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:04.640]   They just don't want to mess around with that at this stage.
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:05.640]   I played with--
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.880]   It's an iPhone with the phone--
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:08.880]   Part not in it.
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:11.720]   I'd probably like to see a 16 gigabyte iPhone.
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:19.200]   Well, I played with the iPod touch at the press announcement on the 5th for about 15
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.400]   minutes.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.440]   And I was pretty impressed with it.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:26.920]   I did-- the first thing I noticed was it doesn't have a recessed headphone jack.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:27.920]   Yay.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.800]   It's on the bottom instead of the top.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:31.680]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:32.680]   No edge.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:33.880]   So you're going to surf via Wi-Fi.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:34.880]   No camera.
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.480]   No microphone so you can't talk on it.
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:38.680]   No speaker so you can't hear on it.
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:42.040]   It's just a little bit lighter, just a little bit smaller.
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.040]   They say it's a little thinner.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.040]   Is it thinner?
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.040]   It is definitely thinner.
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.200]   It's considerably thinner.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.960]   I think it's a very-- especially the 16 gig.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.400]   I think that's very attractive.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:55.000]   Yeah, there's so many people who are on the fence who said, gee, if you just delete
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.960]   the phone features and knock some money off the price, I am so there.
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.760]   So I was really surprised.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.680]   It's not a PDA though.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.880]   And that's kind of-- I mean, if you can't enter appointments--
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:08.200]   Well, because a lot of people wanted the ultimate media toy and they also wanted the
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:10.120]   ability to surf the web while they're gone.
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.800]   And actually, I'm sort of in that camp.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:18.400]   I mean, I would certainly miss-- I would certainly miss the email features on my iPhone.
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:25.040]   But the greatest use I get out of my iPhone is just access to blog lines and access to
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:27.160]   the mobile editions of so many different news sites.
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:29.440]   Still has a photo album.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.400]   Still has YouTube.
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.560]   You've got your clocks, of course, contacts, calendar.
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:36.800]   Obviously, you'd have-- well, maybe not obviously.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:39.800]   Or can you enter new contacts in?
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.520]   Maybe not if you can't do anything on the calendar.
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.240]   Maybe they're both read-only.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:49.000]   It seems like it's an iPhone when it's running Safari and it's an iPod under all of the
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.160]   circumstance I see.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.160]   So that's the only time you have access to it.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.160]   Just so you have access to it.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.160]   It's another one of those things that seems artificial.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:54.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:59.040]   It doesn't seem like the phone's really not capable of doing it.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.960]   It's like Apple's differentiating it with software.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:03.960]   And I-- I always have to do a little thing.
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:04.960]   I hate that.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:11.480]   I would-- when Intel artificially limited its chips by turning off the cash that was in
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.280]   there, that just bugs the heck out of me.
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:17.640]   Well, I mean, I wouldn't judge them too harshly at this stage because I have a whole box full
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.480]   of media players by Sandisk right now.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:24.360]   And they're wonderful, wonderful things, especially if you want to get the most number
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:25.840]   of features for the least amount of money.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:31.400]   If you want to get essentially the basic features out of the iPod Touch, Sansa can sell it to
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:33.040]   you for 100 bucks less.
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:35.840]   But it does show the difference between the philosophy of saying, we're going to-- if
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:39.200]   there's a feature we can think of, we're going to put it in here versus the idea of
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.880]   saying, no, we have a story to tell with this product.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:45.560]   This is a great interesting little tidbit, but it doesn't belong in this story.
[00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:48.160]   So we're not going to color things up.
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:52.880]   The Sansa players are really, really wonderful, but they don't have that same level of elegance
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:54.760]   that the iPods do.
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:55.760]   That's a good point.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:56.920]   Apple's very good at stripping it down.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:57.920]   I guess.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:01.920]   But I just don't-- I don't see how-- how meaning would add stuff to your calendar would
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:05.520]   really make it much more cluttered or much more complicated.
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:08.640]   It's one of those things where we're all very happy with the way they designed that story
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:09.640]   for the iPhone.
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:13.520]   And we just want to do a couple of other things, because you really do want to do all those
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:14.520]   things on your iPod.
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:16.480]   You really don't want to carry a PDF.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:18.160]   You really want to be able to input that stuff.
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:22.640]   So I get that it's to push you to get the iPhone, but I just think it's crap.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:27.080]   Well, also, you want to make sure-- this is Apple's good at learning from its mistakes.
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:30.920]   There are so many times in Apple's history where if someone walked into a store and said,
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:35.920]   I want a Mac, they would say, OK, which one of these 14 different models with negligible
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:37.400]   differences do you want to get?
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:42.680]   Whereas right now they say, OK, do you want a desktop and iMac, a PowerBook, a MacBook
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:48.120]   or this little hot plate model, which are easily and carefully differentiated from each
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.120]   other.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:51.320]   It would be great if a lot of these things-- these models could do things the others once
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:53.560]   did, but it does simplify things greatly.
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:57.240]   And then I don't deny that there's a profit motive, but there is an advantage-- there
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:01.680]   is a tactical-- excuse me-- there is an advantage to users to having a streamlined product line
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:03.640]   that's very, very easy to get.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:08.360]   Well, I think when there's clearly something different, when you're clearly paying less
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:11.480]   for something because there's not as much RAM or there's not as much.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:13.160]   There's a different video RAM or whatever.
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:18.640]   But when you're looking at something that looks almost identical to the one that does
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:22.240]   it and it just simply was turned off, that's the part that it'd be like making a little
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:27.680]   less of an OS and be like, well, you're only using an iMac, so we're going to turn off
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:29.320]   a bunch of the stuff to the OS.
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:34.200]   As everybody on message boards have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt, Apple exists.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:36.640]   Their joy comes from pissing off their existing users.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:40.080]   So if they put all the features into the first version, think of all the millions of early
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:44.200]   doctors who would not get pissed off in December when a software update comes out.
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.080]   I almost believe you.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:47.080]   Read their business plan.
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:48.240]   It's all there in black and white.
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:51.600]   I almost bought that.
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:54.760]   Are you ready for your picks, ladies and germs?
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:56.240]   I know we are.
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:01.520]   All right, sounds like you're ready, Scott Born, so why don't you start kicking us off?
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:08.040]   Well, my pick is a hardware pick.
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:11.560]   I know that that's a little more expensive than a software pick, but I think it's a good
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:12.560]   one.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:18.000]   And it is the new Shure adapter cable that lets you use your existing headphones on the
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   iPhone.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   I want it so badly.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   I have to get to the Apple Store.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   I have it.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   I put it on the Amazon.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.720]   I put it as a pre-order and it still hasn't come.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.080]   So I think I have to go to the Apple Store.
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.760]   They had them at the Apple Store and they sold out like instantly.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:35.120]   Now originally you said it maybe was a little adds a little cordage, a little too much cordage.
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:40.680]   It does, but I've made it a pick now because I've used it enough to realize that that is
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:44.400]   a small price to pay to get to use my good headphones.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.720]   And what I do like about it is the fact that I can click to call, click to answer type of
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.200]   stuff and it all works.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.200]   I love that.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.200]   I like to be able to double click through songs I don't like on my iPod.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.160]   Of course, I could just remove them from my iPod, but I haven't gotten it that way.
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.960]   What headphones are you using with?
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.040]   Oh, I got like three or four different kinds.
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.280]   I'm using Animonics.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.280]   I'm using...
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.280]   What do you like?
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.280]   I got it.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.440]   I don't like any of them.
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.440]   I'm trying to find...
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.440]   You know what?
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.440]   I really want...
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.840]   I want those kind where they...
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:12.840]   I think you've got them.
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.480]   Where they form them into your ear?
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.480]   All tears.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:21.560]   I have them for TV, but you have to go to an audiologist and he has to make molds.
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.560]   Yeah, Ultimeneers will do it.
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.560]   Edomodics will also do it.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.200]   My musicians do that, obviously.
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.880]   Yeah, I'm looking to get some of those.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:32.160]   If I were you, if I were made of money like you are, Thurston, I'd be out there right
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.160]   now.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.400]   It's the time that's not the money.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.400]   It's a little weird.
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.840]   By the way, I'll tell you who does it in San Francisco.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:40.360]   It's a San Francisco audiological center.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.560]   That's where we get our molds made.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:45.240]   You go in, they pour this rubbery thing into your ear.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.680]   And they keep a string in it, by the way.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.880]   So it looks like you get a tampon in your ear.
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:51.200]   Which is an attractive look, I think.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.840]   And then you have to sit there for a little while while it hardens.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:58.200]   But the most fun is when they pull on that string and it goes...
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.680]   It's really loud because it's in your ear.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:03.800]   You know, I have a picture in my Twitter feed.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.920]   I have a picture of my footer feed from Mac world Expo of somebody having that done.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:11.720]   And the expression on their face, it's like they're trying desperately not to think of
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:17.880]   that scene from Star Trek 2 where Chekhov is in the sand cave with the con.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:18.880]   That's kind of what it's like.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:23.800]   On the other hand, I should say, if you were properly prepared for it, it could be pleasurable.
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.600]   You just don't know what to expect.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.800]   It's not an extra 30 though.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.080]   I have to be with mine.
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:32.520]   You know, I decided I liked the base response from my ultimate years better than the Shurrs
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.000]   that I had.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   But the Shurr...
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   Really?
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   Those $600 Shurrs, really?
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   No, no, no.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   I didn't have a $600 Shurrs.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   I only had the $200 Shurrs.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   Okay.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.240]   The $600 Shurrs are nicer, but the ultimate years were $250 or something like that.
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.160]   And the ultimate year ones, they...
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:51.720]   This slightly larger opening and just with the base was a little better than the little
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:54.120]   $200 Shurrs that I had.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:58.080]   But the Shurr comes with that three level flange.
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.480]   And I found that if I took the three level flange from the Shurr, then I stuck it on
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.480]   to the ultimate years.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.480]   Because the ultimate years, none of the little...
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.160]   That's what I don't like about ultimate years.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.960]   They just have those little rubber knobs on them.
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.160]   And it didn't work for me at all.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.160]   I just can't find it.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.160]   They just have flange knobs.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.160]   Right.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:15.360]   So I took the Shurr ones and I stuck them onto the ultimate years and then shoved them
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.360]   in my ears.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:21.160]   And admittedly, for the first day or two, it was...
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:23.080]   My ears had to kind of expand to really...
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.400]   You can't go a little bit, don't you?
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.400]   Because it's pretty...
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.280]   No, this is just not sounding very pleasurable.
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.680]   But I got tight now.
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:31.920]   Now it's all our years.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.720]   I mean, those things are on me all the time.
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:34.720]   That's all the time about it.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.320]   Can we get anything?
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.440]   Can we get recommendations for the second best choice?
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.440]   Now, there is a company...
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.520]   I think I'm the second best choice guy.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:48.520]   What does this solution do that Belkin's like little $10 pass through, stubby connector
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.520]   doesn't do?
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:55.600]   Oh, in terms of this thing, it gives you the ability to use the click functions.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.600]   Has the button on it.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.600]   Has the button on it.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.600]   Has the mic right?
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:03:59.600]   Has the mic right?
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.600]   Has the mic right?
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.600]   Has the mic right?
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:02.600]   Has the mic right?
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:03.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.600]   Has the mic...
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.600]   Has the mic...
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:07.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:08.600]   You can talk into it when you're on the phone and you can click to, you know, hang up.
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:11.000]   Better, better than the one that you get from Apple.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.200]   Do you want to call us?
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.400]   No, we'll do that later.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.400]   Okay.
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.000]   Just if you place a call, I can give you a number.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   You can just place a call.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   That's all right, Dormit.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   He doesn't do the one who's really phone over here.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   I'm hearing your caller ID.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.960]   I now have Scott Born's number.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.320]   That was my plan!
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.320]   More!
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:31.720]   Actually, I sent the phone out of the room because I was afraid it was making those noises.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:34.520]   There's a company called Ultimate Buds.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:36.480]   Ultimate Bud.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.320]   That you send them.
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.760]   This is pretty funny.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:45.400]   You send them your iPhone headset and your, you know, shores or whatever you got.
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.040]   And they do the soldering and it's not very expensive.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.040]   It's 39 bucks.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:53.440]   And they'll turn, you know, they'll merge the two into Ultimate Buds.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:55.640]   They send you a box of a tetrahytenapinal.
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:57.640]   That makes me want to do that.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.360]   Yeah, I'm a little nervous about it.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.680]   If anybody's used Ultimate, has done this, please let us know.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.280]   You can, by the way, they have new products as well.
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:08.600]   You know, you could buy it for 150 bucks to get the whole thing.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:12.800]   Well, next week they're going to start shipping a number of different, you know, headphone
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.120]   solutions that are already pre-configured for the iPhone.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.120]   But if you don't want to-
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.120]   Who's they?
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:22.720]   You know, there's three or four companies that have promised to have product to us next
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.720]   week, in fact, for review.
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:24.720]   I have a Rivet.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.720]   Rivet sent me theirs.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:26.720]   And it's fine.
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:27.720]   It's just, it's okay.
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.520]   It's not, they're not, they're cheap.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.000]   They're 30 bucks.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.240]   The only advantage really over the Apple thing is they're a little bit more in here and they
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.840]   have a land, their lanyard style.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.440]   So you hang around your neck, which I do.
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:42.160]   Yeah, I mean, it's just some people don't want to spend the money on a new set of headphones.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:45.680]   So I thought this little deal for, I think it was, I think it was 40 bucks or whatever
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.680]   I paid for it.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.400]   But it's, it's good.
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.400]   It works.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:50.400]   Excellent.
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.400]   That's my pay.
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.400]   The sure, what do they call it?
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.400]   The sure.
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.080]   The sure iPhone headphone adapter.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:56.080]   Sure.
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.080]   iPhone headphone adapter.
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.040]   It has a product number, but I have no idea what it is.
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.040]   People know it.
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.040]   People know it.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.040]   People know, this is, this seems like the best way to go because you've already got, especially
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.040]   got really good headphones.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.040]   You know why?
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:08.680]   And by the way, it does work with the, actually I do think my favorite pair of headphones for
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.920]   flying are the, are the Bose noise canceling.
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:12.440]   That's what I use mostly.
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.440]   Really?
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.920]   And it works with those.
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:15.920]   And these sounds skeptical.
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:20.520]   No, it's, it's just that I just don't get, I see these people with their, those Princess
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.280]   Leia noise canceling headphones.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:26.000]   You have to take a motorcycle battery for an hour and a half of those canceling stuff.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.520]   Meanwhile, I've got my nice, Adam on a gersh or shore, like silicone earbuds and it does,
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.520]   I've tried both of them.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.280]   I've tried like four different kinds, like for column ones.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:37.960]   And I just couldn't tell the difference between an audio quality.
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:42.160]   The, the, the silicone earbuds were just as, were even better at, at making, giving me
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.160]   a quiet environment.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:47.600]   And on top of everything else, I mean, I can put both my iPod and these headphones inside
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.240]   an Altoids case and put in my pocket.
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:55.200]   I don't know what I'm going to do with this big, this big Mac case size, size case and
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:57.240]   then I'm going to lose or leave behind on a plane.
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:58.840]   I have two words for you, Andy.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.840]   First, your, your fatigue.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:02.840]   Your fatigue.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:03.840]   Now you're right.
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:06.200]   Having those stuck in your ear does take a little getting used to.
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.200]   I agree.
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:12.240]   I have to say, you know, I go on flights and I, and I will literally have my, my, my, my
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.280]   headphones in for 15 hours.
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.680]   You know, and I do it on air.
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:21.320]   Because the air Canada repeats every announcement in English and French.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:26.120]   So it's, it's in volume is like four times louder than the loud.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.120]   They talk a lot.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:31.000]   They give you a lot of excess information as most Canadians do.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.080]   So I love Canada.
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:33.080]   I love Canada.
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:34.080]   I love Canadians.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:39.680]   They're, it's just friendly, but it's in French and they do it again in bad French.
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.720]   That's what, you know, that I was trying to explain to someone.
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:43.080]   I was actually talking to a stewardess about this.
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:46.440]   I was like, you know, the only thing I want to know is how long when you, when, you know,
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:49.200]   we're about to land put on your seatbelt or about to take off.
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.680]   I don't really care what's out the window.
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:53.280]   I really don't care about how much closer we are.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:56.720]   You know, I just want you just, you know, let's minimize all of this.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:00.040]   That's when I jam in my edomatics because you can't hear a bloody thing.
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:04.000]   Well, the big problem I have is if I plug in and I decide to watch anything on the, on
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.480]   the actual screen, then you get annihilated, you know, with your little, with your little
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:08.480]   earphones.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.280]   The other thing that's annoying is that they actually make you take them out.
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.440]   They think it's a safety hazard.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:16.320]   So when they're talking, you know, at the beginning, once you're, once you're, you know,
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:19.120]   10 minutes in your life, but, but at the beginning, you have to listen.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.120]   I like it.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.120]   I like it.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.120]   I like it.
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:25.160]   I like it also because you can, you can actually use it as long.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:29.400]   You can use your electronic devices actually much longer if you have the earphones in because
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:33.120]   you always have a good reason for why you didn't hear the announcement.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:37.080]   I'm actually, I'm actually, I'm actually playing good with my, I'm actually, I'm actually
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.560]   playing good with my, I'm covered in, you'll be, you'll be looking really good covered
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:44.280]   in jet fuel, telling the news reporter, well, I want to hear the end of the song.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:47.000]   The worst, they never give you peanuts when you do that.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   That's the problem.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   They just go right by you.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   Oh, you wanted the beverage?
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   Sorry.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   Didn't hear you.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.320]   Even if I'm from people with a good over the ear headphones, like they want to pay for
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:58.320]   a pause.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:00.840]   You have to buy from buzz if you want that fun.
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:01.840]   All right.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:02.840]   Thank you, Scott.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.920]   Born Annie and I go a pick of the week.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:09.760]   Pick of the week is one of the, one of the best finds of the past six or seven weeks,
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:15.960]   really, because I was in a just an evil, evil mood after a really, really just one of
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:19.320]   those really awful days that says, you know, there's only one solution for this.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.720]   I need to lay down on my couch.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.000]   I need to put on the headphones.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.120]   I need to listen to some classical music for an hour and try to get again, you know, that
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.120]   sort of thing.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.440]   So I went to the, went to the iTunes store, did some search for some Mozart that hadn't
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.000]   already heard a million times.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.240]   And I discovered the podcast from a company called Magnitude.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:37.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.640]   NA, T-U-N-E.
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:44.280]   And I start downloading these hour, they're, they're music company, they're publisher
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:48.520]   that have, you know, all these recordings of classical jazz, pop rock, all these sort
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:50.480]   of independent recordings.
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.360]   And they just give the damn things away.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:57.120]   You can subscribe to the podcast and a few times a week, another hour of brilliant music
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.520]   will land on your iPod.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.000]   It'll be wonderful stuff.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   There are no ads.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.040]   As a matter of fact, every podcast begins with another podcast for Magnitude.
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.440]   We're not evil, which is a lot to live with.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.640]   But, but, but a great thing.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:12.680]   So not only, but not only is it a great thing for getting free music on your iPod, but it's
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:18.400]   also, they also have an open license for anybody who wants to use their music in their podcast
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.120]   so long as it's non-commercial.
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:23.560]   So if you're looking for interstitial music, intros, outro, something to make it a little
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:26.600]   more, a little more interesting, they'll give it to you for free.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.160]   And if you're doing a commercial podcast, they'll sell it to you at, you know, pretty
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:31.240]   damn cheap.
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:36.960]   If you want to buy, walk through their library on magnitude.com, their downloads are unlocked,
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:40.120]   no DRM MP3 files and they're dirt cheap.
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:43.760]   So I've been, boy, I haven't, I can't tell you how much, how many hours I've spent just
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.480]   drifting through the magnitude catalog because every, it's like Santa Claus arrives several
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.960]   times a week delivering some immensely great music that I often, as often as not wind up
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:56.960]   buying just to get the discrete tracks because it's just such great stuff.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:57.960]   I think they do the podcast.
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.120]   I'm going to have to get that.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.520]   If you do, if you do a search in the iTunes store for magnitude, I've got in front of
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:06.920]   me right now, they've got a hundred and fifty podcasts, medieval flute, space music, great
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:12.680]   pianos, renaissance, Philharmonia, choral, new age pianos, sitar, a sitar podcast.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:16.800]   How many people are saying, gee, I really want another hour of sitar music on my iPod.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:17.800]   Well, here you go.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:18.800]   And it's free.
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:23.000]   I'm going to talk about John Bookman, the guy, a Buckman, a guy who founded the magnitude.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.080]   We interviewed him about a year ago on Inside the Net.
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:29.080]   If people want to listen to that, Inside the Net 33, he has another site called Bookmooch.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.520]   You probably would like Andy where people swap books.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.200]   Yeah, I've heard about that.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.200]   That's neat.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.200]   So I'm going to subscribe to that.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.200]   I didn't know.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.200]   I had no idea that a podcast.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:43.360]   What a great way to get new music on your iPod or whatever device you use or Sansa.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.920]   It would work on a Sansa.
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:50.440]   You know, Alex Lindsay and I were talking the other day, the meme, the Alex meme has really
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.440]   spread.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.440]   It's everywhere.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.800]   In fact, I saw a cartoon the other day where somebody was it used?
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:57.520]   I mean, that Scott or somebody would said, oh, it's only one Alex.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:00.120]   No, I did not, but I saw it.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.120]   Yeah.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:05.960]   Well, I want to give credit to the cartoon, but I can't remember who did that.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:12.040]   But anyway, it's amazing that the unit Alex, which is $700, by the way.
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:13.040]   Yeah, it's one unit.
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.520]   It's a one Alex.
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.920]   How many Alex's today, Alex?
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:20.120]   It's about a third of an Alex.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.120]   Oh, wow.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.120]   Maybe a quarter of an Alex.
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.120]   It's about a quarter of an Alex.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:28.040]   And so, and this is a program that I'm just starting to play with.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.960]   And but I think it's pretty cool.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:33.040]   So one of the things that we do in all these projects and we're trying to keep track of
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:37.440]   all the projects and we play with lots and lots of productivity tools, you know, how
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:40.880]   to keep track of a project and a whole bunch of them and who's all involved and what they're
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.400]   doing and everything else.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:46.320]   And so a program that we're starting to play with right now is by a company called Market
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.520]   Circle and it's called Daylight.
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.520]   Very familiar with it.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:55.720]   And it's, and daylight, you know, it's something that I have to check back in a couple, in
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.840]   a couple of months to say whether it really works because with productivity stuff, it's
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:00.560]   not whether it looks good when you start.
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:03.480]   It's whether you're still using it two months from now.
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:08.080]   But the, but the, it really, you know, it's nice because it's really a Mac app.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.480]   You know, it's, it's, it's not trying to be cross-platform.
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:14.400]   It's taking advantage of all the things that Coco gives you and all the libraries and
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:18.640]   it looks pretty and it integrates really, you know, really well with your mail and with
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:22.560]   iCal and, you know, all those other things you're like, you can really attach a lot of
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.720]   the stuff to it.
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:27.960]   So it is, you know, right now it looks, you know, you can, you know, do tasks, you have
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:33.000]   schedules, you can, you know, you know, look at your workflow, you know, you can manage
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.760]   the projects, you know, overall.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:38.320]   So a lot of this stuff looks like it's something that we're going to have a lot of fun with
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.320]   and so far.
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:43.640]   You know, we just haven't been really that happy with just about anything we, we try.
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:49.160]   So, you know, we, we end up back in, you know, you know, pages just laying stuff out of who's
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:52.560]   going to do what and file maker, you know, building our databases.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:53.560]   Wow.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:54.560]   We've run a lot of...
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:55.560]   That's primitive.
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.560]   No wonder this would be a big improvement.
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:00.920]   When we used it, I would say we, we built some fairly complicated file maker databases
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:02.080]   to make, to maintain those stuff.
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.840]   But daylight really is designed for team management, which is...
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:07.840]   That's what we're really looking at.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:11.360]   We kind of runs all the stuff that... or we have databases for different shows that really
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:14.720]   are customized to the show and keep track of what needs to get done and what doesn't
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:16.880]   need to get done and how it needs to get done.
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:21.840]   But we're not good enough to really integrate it with mail and I-Cal and everything else
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.040]   from our, from file maker.
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:26.520]   And so, so it's a little limited that way.
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:29.920]   We want to really get it to where all the communications, you know, stay piped into the
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.080]   system.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.440]   And it looks like this is going to be something that allows us to do that.
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:35.440]   Very cool.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:36.640]   It's not cheap.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.640]   There is a trial version.
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:41.240]   So you can try it for 30 days.
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:42.240]   Yeah.
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.240]   No, I usually enough.
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:44.840]   I used it, but I don't have a team.
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:47.680]   So, but I was very impressed with it.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:52.680]   It's probably the most powerful kind of contact manager and organizational tool on the Mac.
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:54.880]   Who bigger on your team, Leo?
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:57.240]   You're on my team, but I don't need to keep track of you.
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:01.120]   I'll let you wonder it will.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:05.240]   And by the way, I want, we should mention that Paul Mason has that great MBW picks site.
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:08.320]   So if you're, we don't keep track of our picks there in the show notes, but we don't,
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:11.760]   we don't really do a good job of keeping track of all of our picks, but you can go to
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:15.200]   mbw picks.com and get your picks there.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.200]   Actually, there's two sites.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:19.200]   There's also mbw picks of the week.com.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:22.000]   So take your pick of the bigs.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.680]   Oh, and I guess I have to pick a pick something, don't I?
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:30.600]   I have so many things to choose from.
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:36.160]   You know, I think one something I'll mention that I haven't mentioned before and everybody
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:39.320]   probably already knows about, but it really is something you should be using if you're
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.320]   not.
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:41.960]   It's called growl.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:43.640]   You all know about growl.
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.120]   Growl.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:48.600]   It's a free kind of growl.
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.640]   It's in the system preference pane.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.840]   It's free.
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:54.760]   What I like about growl is actually maybe it's not in the system.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.200]   I thought, well, yeah, it is.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:59.240]   It integrates in with a lot of applications.
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:04.720]   I mean, pretty much any real Mac application supports growl.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:09.520]   And what growl does is it allows you, it allows that application to send you notifications
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:10.960]   and you can customize the notifications.
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:14.280]   You can have them up on the window in a variety of beautiful ways.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.360]   You can do sound.
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.800]   You can take over the window if you want.
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:21.720]   You can have the notification stay there so that, for instance, I use it all the time
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:25.600]   when I'm FTPing, growl will let me know when the FTP is done.
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:29.080]   And if I've wandered away when I come back, I can see in a second what's going on because
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:33.920]   that's because it works with panics transmit beautifully.
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:37.040]   If you don't have growl, get growl.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:39.560]   It's fantastic and it's absolutely free.
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:45.200]   And the Christopher Forsyth, Kevin Ballard, James Van Dyne, Ingmar Stein, and the growl
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:50.760]   team deserve a lot of credit for its growl.info, g-r-o-w-l.info.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:55.560]   And if you have a Mac and you don't have growl, this is a zero Alex.
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:56.560]   I really honor.
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:02.120]   I've been playing a lot with WordPress and I've been very impressed with WordPress's
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:03.120]   plugins lately.
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:04.920]   I've read on my blog at leoville.com/blog.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:07.640]   I'm starting to sound like the VORAC.
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:10.120]   leoville.com/blog.
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:17.200]   And I found a really, this is my second pick, but I found a really cool template that you
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:21.240]   can integrate into any other template for the iPhone.
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:29.000]   It does a really nice job, I think, of making an iPhone version of your site.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:36.280]   It's from the iwphone.contentrobot.com.
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:41.720]   And if you go on your iPhone to leoville.com/blog, you'll see it's got a completely different
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.360]   design that's specific for the iPhone.
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:47.840]   And you know, it builds a, how does this work?
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.440]   It's just a separate template for WordPress.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.040]   So it's a plugin basically.
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:55.120]   Install it and the theme and what it will do is it queries the user agent.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:59.040]   You know, when you see, when it sees iPhone in the user agent, it says, "Okay, you get
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.040]   a better template."
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.960]   And it's a very nice one.
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:05.480]   Now obviously the iPhone handles the site fine as a regular website, but this is a little
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.640]   lighter weight and it uses the...
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:08.640]   Web 2.0.
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.640]   Yeah, it's very...
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:10.640]   It's very RSS-y.
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.640]   Yeah.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.880]   We're installing it as we speak on Apple Phone Show.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:15.880]   Oh, you are.
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:16.880]   Yeah.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:17.880]   I think it's a really good idea.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:22.800]   You know, obviously the iPhone can look at any Safari page and webpage with Safari and
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.800]   it looks fine.
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.080]   In fact, my site looked absolutely fine.
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:28.320]   You zoom in and Safari is very smart about where to zoom in on.
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:29.320]   But this just gives it more of a...
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:31.640]   Yeah, more like an RSS feed look to it.
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:35.240]   Yeah, there must be something in the air because I finally, after like three or four
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:38.880]   months worth of looking at different content management systems, I finally decided upon
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:45.680]   WordPress as the CMS I'm going to use to replace my 15-year-old Apple script custom-made
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.680]   blogging system.
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:52.920]   And actually, this is as good a time as I need to make a certain plea to the God bless you
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:53.920]   listeners.
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:54.920]   You are Americans here.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:58.720]   You're the world's heroes because you are gentle, giving, intelligent, good looking.
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:18:59.720]   Did I say good looking?
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:00.720]   Good looking.
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:01.720]   Great looking.
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:02.720]   Nice teeth too.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:03.720]   I'm a total...
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.200]   I'm a person who...
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:06.720]   I understand all the web technologies.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:09.440]   I've written software for managing web technologies.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.000]   I have never used WordPress before.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:18.720]   So if you have any advice on a really good book, a really good tutorial, a really good discrete
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:22.480]   resource, discrete in terms of one thing I can click on as opposed to, well, go to this
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:25.280]   message board and look for this thread and look for this thread.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:28.040]   I'm looking for something that basically says you're an idiot, we will help you to become
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:31.680]   less of an idiot with WordPress, especially when it comes to creating custom themes.
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:33.560]   I would love, love to hear it.
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.560]   I did something.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:35.560]   It was funny.
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:39.760]   There's obviously a lot of interest in this because I put up something on my Twitter basically
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.480]   with the exact same message.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:46.960]   As of 24 hours later, the ratio of people with actual advice versus the people who are
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:50.360]   saying, "Hey man, big up a listen to me because I'm interested too."
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:53.000]   Currently sits at about 1 to 18.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000]   I have to say...
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.480]   Of all the...
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.040]   And I've used a lot of CMSs.
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:01.920]   Of all of them, the WordPress is the easiest install, the easiest to grok, the easiest to
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:02.920]   change.
[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:04.280]   Just get a good template and work from there.
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.880]   I think you'll find it...
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:06.880]   It's not that difficult.
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:07.880]   Yeah, it's quite lovely.
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:08.880]   Much easier than Drupal.
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.880]   I know you had trouble with Drupal.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:14.680]   I'm still got scars from my forehead where I was improvantly banging my head against
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.160]   the hard part of the desk.
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:19.920]   Yeah, WordPress must feel like a breath of fresh air after Drupal.
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:23.880]   The first time I was able to actually put a picture in a blog post without having to
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:28.120]   run anything on the command line, I thought, "Yes, WordPress is greater than Drupal."
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:31.040]   WordPress gets a lot of attention for being a blog program, which it is.
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.160]   It's probably the best blogging software out there.
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:35.560]   But because you can create pages of any kind...
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:38.840]   Yeah, with the 2007 editions, that's what really put the first...
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:39.840]   I'm not finding it difficult.
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:21:01.920]   It's the good type of difficult where I can see what I can do if I just become a little
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:06.560]   less dumb as opposed to Drupal, which at times said, "No, this is not for you.
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.360]   You think you're a nerd, but you're not a nerd."
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.360]   You have to be a hard-goer.
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:12.800]   You'll fail to build a nerd test and I have nothing but contempt for you.
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:16.280]   The idea that you want to use a picture to blog post without you knowing how to program
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:17.280]   it, Pearl.
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:26.560]   I can recommend and I'll send you a list of the plugins that I've used effectively.
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:29.000]   I'm using about a dozen plugins that are just excellent.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.840]   In fact, I have a link, a post on the site that has a few of them, including that IW
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:35.320]   phone, which is really nice.
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:38.840]   What I really like is on this day, which shows...
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:39.840]   Because I have...
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:40.840]   Now, you probably have the same thing.
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:44.160]   I have posts going back to 2001 on this blog.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:48.840]   When you go to the blog, you'll see what I was saying on this date in the past, which
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:49.840]   is kind of fun.
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:54.000]   Basically, the theme of my blog is going to be backpedaling.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.720]   I'm going to be posting my columns from the SunTimes.
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:00.160]   When I find out that I got something wrong, I'll just change it and pretend that it never
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.160]   happened.
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:03.520]   What are you talking about?
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:11.440]   I need a phrase translated into Latin as well as the slogan for the site.
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:16.960]   What it means in Latin is the First Amendment only applies to me.
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:17.960]   That would be good.
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:18.960]   There you go.
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:21.920]   Any Latin scholars out there, and I'm sure there are quite a few.
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:26.400]   From Denmark, I'd like a recording of to-be or not-to-be in Danish.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:27.400]   That's another...
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:28.400]   Oh my God.
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:31.760]   My daughter's doing Hamlet, and for some reason they've decided to...
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:35.640]   It's a multimedia Hamlet playback to be or not to be in Danish.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:39.280]   So here's your chance to be immortalized in Sonoma County.
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:42.880]   Welcome to this week in obscure Mac West.
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:43.880]   What's different?
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.520]   So what's new?
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:50.000]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, I think we're going to wrap this up.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.000]   We'd do it in Latin and Danish if I could, but instead I'll just say another Mac break
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   is broke.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000]   Thanks for joining us.
