[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.960]   from Apple. Lori Gill is here not for long she's gonna have to do you have to transfer.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:57.200]   You look like this looks like Mr. Ed now. You look like a horse is gonna stick his head through the
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.160]   bar and door. It's like hello Lori. Lori Gill is managing editor of i-word. No it's still too
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.720]   bright though. I don't think that's me either. I think somebody else did the brightness. Somebody
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.600]   turned the light up man they turned that light up. We got a earning call at 2 p.m. Pacific 5 p.m.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.320]   Eastern. Lori you have to do yeah are you the transcriptionist now? I know Mike. I am doing
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.440]   the transcribing. Yes Mike taught me how so yeah yeah type really fast. Is that you can you keep up
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:34.800]   with them? No no not at all. It takes me it takes me quite a while after they're done before I get
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:43.040]   the all of the trans. There's a great Android app. You call recorder that google now does it's
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.440]   available on the Pixel 4 and I think they just made it available on the Pixel 3 that transcribes
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.760]   really really well. You can record it and transcribe after the fact or transcribe as you go. And I the
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.680]   reason I thought of it is I just was listening to a book and I thought that's a great passage and I
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.200]   rewound it and turned this on. Now I have the text that I can edit. Anyway just just a thought. You
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.760]   don't have to type it by hand do you? Oh no I use a program anyway. I have a program that helps me
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.720]   get it all out. Also here and he'll probably have to go then too. He's a bit richy from my more
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.680]   managing editor there. What do you do? Now what's your title? I just I just do vector now and I do
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.600]   whatever Lori tells me. Oh he says do this by Monday and I do it. Vector guy. Yeah I do it. I get
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:31.680]   a beautiful shot is oh my god. Yeah. Oh thanks Alex Lindy. Alex Lindy. You recommend stuff. I do
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.880]   it. Alex says I do it. Lori says I do it. You say what Andy says it just it makes my life easy. Alex
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:44.960]   is our video guru from the Pixel Core and he told us to get an ATEM Mini from Black Magic.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.400]   Mine came and I apparently started. I have a feeling so it's sort of a nice.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.080]   Do you but you only have one camera hooked up into it so you can't play with the dissolves and the
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.960]   and the keys and all that stuff. No but I have I have a C stand so I will have something above me
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.760]   and probably a B cam at some point too. It really looks good. That's very sweet. Thank you.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:13.200]   Yeah and then there's Andy and not co. Still doing video the artisanal bespoke way
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.840]   using using stuff that was basically meant for grandma talking to the kids across the stores
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.120]   from temporary at the Arizona. Hey you created the crane cam 2000. You're no slouch my friend.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.360]   And I open sourced it by the way. Oh even better. Even better. I didn't tell
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.840]   them how to make it but if they figure it out they're not going to get sued. What are we expecting
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:42.080]   Laurie in the quarterly results. Apple this is their Q1. Yes this is the first quarter 2020.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:50.400]   Which is calendar Q4. Yes yes. So this is the big this is the big. Well I know it. Me apples
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:59.280]   confusing you. So their fiscal year begins in October and but it's our calendar fourth quarter.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.520]   Yes. So October November December. And that of course is the big quarter for them right.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.840]   Because there's a new iPhone. Yes. Yeah. So are we expecting incredible numbers.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.760]   Well I do. I think that we're going to see an uptick. I think that we're going to find out that
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.760]   this year Apple did better than last year. If you remember they Apple kind of preempted their
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.880]   their predictions right before their earnings call to lower that and that kind of like threw
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.280]   everybody off and freaked everybody out. And I think this year it's not only is it going to
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.680]   they're going to meet what they were what their expectations were from the last earnings call
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.760]   but I think they're going to exceed it a little bit. I think the iPhone and I think wearables in
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.760]   particular with Apple Watch and with AirPods that's going to help them kind of shoot up their overall
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.840]   how much money they make this for this quarter. I'm going to get a call from my dad.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:02.000]   Because thanksgiving 2012 I think it was I said Steve's gone sell your Apple stock.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.160]   I mean now calls me every quarter and tells you how much says I didn't sell it.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.440]   Yeah. Thank God because this year they doubled they doubled in value.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.240]   Oh he didn't sell it. He didn't. No no he didn't listen to me. Thank God.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.680]   But he does rub it in. Thank God. Yeah you should never listen to me for stock advice.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.880]   So it's been a good year for Apple anyway even with the you know the headwinds from Asia and
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:38.240]   elsewhere they've done all right. In fact people were thinking in fact Apple was thinking the Wall
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.280]   Street Journal said Tim Cook slashed guidance a year ago because of sluggish iPhone sales
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.480]   and instead of a slump investors got one of the biggest one-year stock rallies in history.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.640]   Now I will point out that we don't stock price isn't something we really should care about that's
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:58.720]   not has nothing to do with it. But the Holy smokes $750 billion. Holy smokes. Yeah.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.640]   Yeah I mean that's a thing. Yeah that's a thing that's a lot of money. Apple stock $318.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.080]   It would be hard for Apple to announce anything this afternoon that would make the stock go up
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:16.480]   more wouldn't it Renee? So I think at this point it's like you said what their results are have
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.560]   never been a good indicator of what their stock is. They had the most valuable product the most
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.640]   income rich product in the history of products and the stock was continuously
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.720]   pummeled and there was leaks every time right before earnings that the iPhone was doomed and
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.320]   it would crash again and it's more of a systematic controlled mechanism I think where people
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.560]   and famously there have been people who've confessed to doing this they'll plant rumors
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.760]   that do all these things so that they come out ahead they're short to do well they're going to
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:47.440]   do well there. That's what happens and I think what happened this time and it's been covered a
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.080]   couple times is that people felt that they weren't they didn't have enough of Apple especially
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.480]   longer term investors and they started buying and buying. Yeah they wanted to get deeper into
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:02.480]   Apple and now we're getting the rumors about Wuhan virus affecting production and no but this
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.800]   year it's really going to be doomed and you understand this year the iPhones are going to be terrible
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.040]   like anything they can do to try to push the stock back down before earnings but you're saying
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.200]   that's short sellers that's not Apple that's not any reasonable analyst that's somebody
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.160]   shorting it. Yeah it's market manipulators. Yeah so there is one thing that we should probably
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:26.080]   mention that has a lot to do with Apple's Boosted Stock price Apple took all that cash it repatriated
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:32.080]   and bought a lot of it went to stock buybacks that increases that increases the stock value too
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.920]   does it not? And they employ retention which is huge for them because they don't
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.600]   they're not a new company they're not an IPO you know about to go IPO they're not a startup where
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.000]   you can get equity and they're competing with a lot of companies like that that have massive
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.960]   reserves or massive upsides and so they've got to be able to provide employee units that those
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:56.640]   employees can then buy houses with at some point in the future. Yeah I mean but it also helps stock
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.920]   price it does because it reduces the number of shares in being the public and then therefore
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.280]   increases the value of the price so it's not really clear from even from this journal article
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.000]   you know they're talking about air pods help juice the sales and blah blah blah and maybe
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   there was just a buyback. I mean the numbers haven't been bad either I mean they're still
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.560]   making a lot of money. They sold a lot of air pods. Yeah I mean I think that that's it so there are
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.120]   fundamentals are still good from a just a business perspective and the stock is probably doing better
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:30.160]   than it normally would because they're doing buyback and so it's kind of a combination of both
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.880]   but I think that they're definitely they're hitting on cylinders still. Isn't that a amazing
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.160]   perspective? And this is holiday quarter too. Yeah this is a big quarter.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:46.160]   Do you know you mentioned this Wuhan the coronavirus issue? Yeah. Apparently suppliers are
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:55.200]   this is from Nikkei.com. Suppliers are saying we could we got to warn you this coronavirus
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:03.920]   impact production. I don't trust the coverage simply because Nikkei is one of the companies
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.160]   along with Wall Street Journal that always puts out those iPhone delayed or screens won't be ready
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:13.360]   or the cameras are all happily false. It's great link bait. So maybe it will but it'll have
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.840]   nothing to do with the Nikkei's report. Suppliers warned that the blistering pace of production
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:23.440]   could be complicated by the outbreak of the coronavirus in China's Hubei province given that their main
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:31.120]   manufacturing centers are in nearby Hanaan and Guangdong provinces and those both had 100 confirmed cases
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:38.480]   Shanghai 50 confirmed cases of coronavirus as of yesterday. The same article though points out that
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:48.800]   just the flu seasonal flu it hospitalizes in the 40,000 to 800 and 10 hospitalizations every year
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:56.160]   that's globally 12,000 to 61,000 deaths worldwide. The flu is nasty. And coronavirus is everything
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:02.640]   yet as nasty but has the possibility. So it's not a reason to say there's a possibility but it's not
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.680]   at this point. Yeah. Yeah and there's it's clearly it's there's a lot going on that there's a lot of
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.120]   people that should be worried. We don't want that to spread and I don't want to be dismissive of
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:17.440]   that but I think when you start throwing in those kind of um be afraid kind of sentiments you're
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.680]   sort of misdirecting what's actually happening and kind of creating a little bit of fear
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:27.280]   monitoring like this article alone you know could could be the thing that like dumps some of the
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.520]   stock pricing of Apple down just because they said something like this which might not be true at
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:36.960]   all because you know people get sick and they keep working and you know that that's just what
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:43.840]   happens. The stock was down yesterday 2.9 percent and of course Nikke says due to virus-related
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:49.440]   fears but it could also just be the market preparing for today's. Right. Well and it's also a lunar
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.640]   new year and all manufacturing shuts down for 10 days during lunar like just shut everything shuts
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:02.160]   down. It is the case that some employees who leave China may not be able to get back in China.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.320]   That's the holiday. It's chaotic. Yeah. I mean. Well and also people who have left San
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.880]   Jen won't be able to get back to San Jen because a lot of transportation shut down. Right. So you
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.680]   know it's not a reasonable say that. What other headwinds might affect the announcements this
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:22.080]   afternoon is Tim Cook gonna say it's augmented reality. What does he just did? He loves that so
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:27.600]   much. He did it just recently. I think he'll bring it up again. I think he'll mention it again.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.400]   You know when when they start asking the question he'll start talking about being bullish on on
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:39.840]   the augmented reality I think. Yeah. What else will we be looking for cars? No. No. I don't think
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.360]   I'm going to tell you anything about. I think he's definitely going to want to talk about
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.680]   about services. He's definitely going to want to talk about Apple TV Plus. He's definitely
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:53.920]   going to want to talk about success at the SAG Awards and other award shows. This is a the
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:59.520]   this is the second year of Apple TV Plus in which they he will be expected I think to point out
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:05.200]   here is how well this is affecting our business. Here's how here's soon enough they're going to
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:10.960]   have to be talking about people who are actually paying to subscribe to this service as opposed to
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:16.240]   people who got a free sub because they bought Apple hardware. So I'm curious to see how he decides
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:22.880]   to whether how quickly he goes from his engineering and operations hat to studio entertainment studio
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:30.160]   Hollywood mobile hat when he's talking about those kinds of results. Yeah. I was looking over
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.840]   Neil Seibart and Horace Deja is consolidated or estimates because I always find that they're
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.320]   very rational and they tend to be very accurate and they're both very similar for them like the
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:47.840]   iPhone Mac, iPad, iPad, all those probably constant down a little bit wearables up there up 11 billion
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:53.600]   up 55 percent revenue to around 60 62 billion. So I don't think it'll be a surprising quarter
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.880]   by any stretch of the imagination. It's too early to assume that the Mac Pro will have any impact.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:05.760]   Even if it was small, it's small, niche market. I mentioned that's a halo thing basically as
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.160]   as an indication of their commitment to the Mac platform. But yeah, I don't think those
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.280]   show any results. It's always the most interesting part of these talks is what does he choose to
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:22.640]   actually share numbers about that if if if a product or if a service or if a segment is doing gang
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:27.200]   busters, Apple never shies away from saying exactly how well it's doing and how well it exceeded
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:32.800]   expectations. If it's something that is still a growing thing and it hasn't really been impressive
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.440]   yet, it gets lumped in under other categories. So that's in itself is a way to find out what
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:42.880]   is underperforming, what is what is there, a whole them sort of bet, and what are they really,
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:48.000]   really bullish about it. But we shouldn't gloss over augmented reality. I think it's fascinating
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.880]   that this is Tim's go to answer whenever he wants to talk about something that Apple doesn't talk
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.840]   about, meaning Apple doesn't talk about future plans, but he is willing and open to talk about
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:07.200]   specifically augmented reality, whereas before we had seen things like like the the earnings call
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.720]   before AirPods, he would say we are going to be unveiling some exciting new product categories
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.920]   instead of saying we think there's a lot of opportunity in consumer audio. It's so very
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.320]   very nebulous. Yeah, so yeah, he likes to talk about categories. It's like a screen to him.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.320]   Every product has a screen to talk about. Screen is not a big deal because it's a non specific
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:32.720]   product. Cyber, you have AR everywhere. This afternoon, watch for wearables. That's going to be the
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:39.760]   success story of this quarter. And yeah, AirPods Pro used are still four week back ordered.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:47.520]   Yeah, I mean, we're $150 device. Yeah, unbelievable. He's predicting a 55% year over
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.840]   your growth in wearables home accessories. And that's got to mostly be AirPod.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:59.680]   Maybe watch the Apple watch after the the the latest Apple watch was announced and they
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:05.520]   dropped the price of the third generation Apple watch. I think that really opened up a huge
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:10.560]   door for people who didn't want to spend the amount of money that they were going to be
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:15.280]   spending on a brand new one and gave them that entry level Apple watch. And then there was some
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.840]   sales around the holiday season that dropped it even lower. So I think Apple watch is actually
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:27.760]   probably a significant number in that increase. Interesting. He does also predict a 20% increase
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:32.960]   in services up to 13 billion. That sounds about right. It's been very steady. A couple of billion
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:39.440]   every quarter for some time now. Earnings for sure. This year, which is interesting. Mac revenue
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:45.840]   and iPad revenue down five and seven percent. This is all predictions. I and iPhone revenue flat.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.240]   It's interesting. He does say he's assuming a $2 billion impact from coronavirus.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:55.360]   Yeah, he was all about the coronavirus. He apparently cares a lot about coronavirus.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.640]   I'm sure there'll be a warning from Apple about it. Right. They'll say something about it.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:06.160]   It'll be a headwind. I don't know. We could. Yeah. Or they may just upgraded the headwind.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.520]   Right now it's not. It doesn't have a lot of effect. But if it gets out of control,
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.000]   it'll have a huge effect. Well, that's the problem. That's a big gift.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.360]   Yeah. Exactly. Well, not not that country. Right. Well, not not only that, but if it means that
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:23.440]   every single con every single client of manufacturers is going to be upping their orders, kind of wanting
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.960]   to build inventory and build stock against the time when they think that over the summer,
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:31.040]   this is going to be much more difficult. And suddenly they have over capacity problems that could
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:36.480]   you could have a very serious problem without there being a larger health problem than we're
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:41.920]   looking at right now. Do you think he will say anything besides we're very happy with the success
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:49.200]   of Apple TV plus and congratulate our stars on their Golden Globe and their SAG Awards and or will
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.760]   he start saying and we're going to spend $11 billion because right now Apple's a severely
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:59.600]   underspinning Amazon and Netflix. I think Netflix, I thought the last number I saw was $17 billion
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:06.640]   dollars for 2020. I thought it was really interesting how in their trailers app on the Apple TV,
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:11.600]   they're just showing in Apple TV trailers into it with all the other movies.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.360]   I saw the Beastie Boys one. I saw the Beastie Boy one. I was like, "Ah, I want to see that."
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.680]   Then I was like, "I can't." Well, I find it incredibly frustrating. I added, "What's the new game,
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:25.680]   the new Silicon Valley type show?" It's a gaming thing.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:33.520]   I wanted to see it. It comes on February 7th. I'm excited about it. I added it to my Apple TV,
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.920]   which was a mistake because now it shows it as if it's something I can watch and I keep hitting it
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:43.280]   and it's on now. It's a stupid trailer again. I actually saw an ad for that on Hulu. I was
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:48.720]   watching always sending them to Philadelphia and an Apple TV exclusive TV show I had popped up.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:54.000]   So Apple's spending and this isn't very Apple-y, probably as much on marketing as they are in production
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.520]   at this point. I just thought it was interesting that they were just sewing them in and you just
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.960]   start watching trailers. They just get seen as in some of the more- That's the scene with the-
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:08.800]   The strategy behind the Apple TV app. Amazon did this for a long time. It becomes a promotional
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:13.040]   vehicle for the company. I can't just see it mixed in with it. That's where they can play
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:17.200]   their strength right now because Netflix and Hulu, they have the libraries. Disney Plus has the
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:22.960]   libraries. Apple does not have a substantial library. Their job right now is to create producing
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:29.120]   series akin to the Mandalorian and akin to cheer. The sort of the Seinfeld shows that
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.600]   everybody is talking about and that so that the people who do not subscribe are thinking,
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.080]   "Well, geez, everybody's talking about Baby Yoda now. I feel left out. I'll
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:43.840]   at least sign up for a trial to see what this is all about." So Baby Yoda is the icon of the
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:49.520]   Disney Plus app. They're not holding back either. We should point out.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:54.320]   I can't believe the car doesn't have a Baby Zmok. One thing that I that I
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:59.760]   Baby Yoda I asked people on Twitter over the over the last week was, you know, I feel like the more
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.360]   and more contents available, the less and less I'm watching it. Like I'm just kind of like scanning
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.920]   through it and then not not watching any of it. I think it's it's it's hit driven.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:13.760]   So there is this wash of content and then you wail your friends and others and you see this in
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.160]   social or whatever it is. Wherever those signals are till you see the hit surface up.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.520]   Well, one of the first is Mythic Quest, which is the game show we were talking about.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.160]   Right. Mythic Quest. If we start talking about that a lot,
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.160]   that's going to rise up and then so that's how people get through that.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.000]   That's the same thing with YouTube. There's an infinite amount of content on YouTube.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.480]   It is. I wonder like one of the things that other people have tried but I think would be more
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:42.240]   successful on these platforms, all of the platforms, not just Apple TV, is a basically
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:48.640]   being able to set your start time for your show. So I want I want my show to start at 9 p.m.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.880]   or at 8 p.m. on Sunday. And the reason for that is that you could watch it and tweet and
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.880]   text with your friends. I would, but that's what Ed Sullivan's on. I can't.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:01.360]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you could but like you tell more like a fashion network TV.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:06.080]   No, no, no, no, no, that users could say I want to start at 7 p.m. Let's all watch together at
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.680]   let's all. So then what happens is socially you have a whole bunch of people that say,
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.560]   let's all turn this on at 6 p.m. and watch it because then you can text each other on messenger
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:19.360]   and you can talk about it and you can do whatever every time in your life. I can't even watch it.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.480]   I don't watch anything. No, like I'm making TikToks. You know, like, like, I don't.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:31.600]   That's all watches TikToks at 9 p.m. folks. No, no, I I I um I have a TV that's been a little bit
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:36.240]   of a disappointment. I have they there's not as much as we thought maybe the morning show would be a
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:40.960]   breakout hit. I don't think it is. I feel like a lot of them have been really heavy.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:45.120]   And so I look at them and I go servant was disappointing. I get to them and I just go, I don't know if I
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:50.960]   want to commit to it's getting very soapy. They're going to make a podcast out of Little America,
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:56.080]   which is an interesting that's an interesting feel good play, right? It's all about immigration
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:01.040]   in America. It's almost a it's a quasi documentary. Again, that's the best reviews of any show so far.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:05.360]   Has it? Is that Little America? Yeah, it seems like that's Oprah. What happened? Oprah? Didn't she?
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.400]   Wasn't she going to be doing book club? But is any I mean, I don't hear anybody.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.320]   She had a documentary coming out on survivors and she had a split with a production company over
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:18.720]   the timing of it. So that that dot wrote she goes removed from that production or she removed
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:25.840]   herself in that production. I don't hear a lot of buzz for anything. See, I'm waiting on foundation.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:30.560]   I'm very excited for that. Foundation the foundation trilogy Isaac has a yes. Yeah.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.960]   Yeah. Apple's going to make that win. That's not till 2021. I don't know it was on the first
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.200]   show's announced, but I don't know what the timeline is for it to come out.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:43.600]   They've announced a lot of acquisitions and partnerships. They've really started to
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.560]   ramp up the production, I think, right?
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:55.520]   Yeah, because this is a film festival season. I think Sundance was just recently.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:00.480]   And so this is where all kinds of acquisitions and deals were made. This is where they're buying
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:05.680]   inventory. It's not as bad as this guy, John Coaster says, it's time for Apple to kill
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:12.320]   Apple TV. Plus this is yesterday in Forbes. Yeah, of course, it's Forbes paid content.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:16.800]   It's D.O.A. The sooner Apple realizes it, the sooner the company stops wasting billions of
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:23.200]   dollars chasing failure. That's a glimmer look than I would maybe assume. I have to say, though,
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.600]   it hasn't been a massive success either, right? Well, but it doesn't have to be.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:32.160]   Remember that they're sitting on how many hundreds of billions of dollars they have the ability to
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.560]   grow a business. And even if they even when Apple was less successful, they had no problem saying
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:41.040]   that we're going to continue to build this thing called the Apple TV, even though it's kind of
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:45.520]   an even though we the only times we talk about it is to reassure people that we're not canceling
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:49.680]   it. So this is this is absolutely insignificant. What about and the watch? You've talked about
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:54.480]   a lot. The watch was a failure when it came out. Apple is a port apparently in preliminary
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:59.040]   acquisition talks with MGM. What if they bought a studio? I still think it should be Disney.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:06.800]   Disney already got sold. It's too late. Oh, they bought they bought whatever they bought. They
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:11.120]   sold it's too late. They're too big to swallow now, right? Apple could swallow them. Apple's
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.040]   probably one of the few companies that could swallow them. But what's what's the upside for
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:19.840]   Disney? Why would why would they agree to that? MGM's gonna be asserting things are gonna get
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:25.120]   really competitive. And you know, the bigger you are, you know, and the integration with the technology,
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:32.640]   you know, what Apple could do with their hardware at Disney parks, you know, that the tie ins would
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:37.680]   be profound. You know, so it would be, you know, like there's there's, it's one of the few matches
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:43.120]   that would make Disney spent 70 billion to buy Fox. I would say, I like the studio,
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.480]   probably what I'm saying, what Apple could afford. It's on the edge, but it's some it's
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.840]   definitely and it's the right one. It has all the content that Apple would want, but they could
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.000]   have done it sooner for less than they should have. So I don't know if they're really open. I guess
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.360]   that you know, there are rumors that it was very close. And then we forced the E-Pest.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:02.320]   I think it may have a mistake for Apple at this point to buy a studio unless you want to buy a
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:07.280]   library, a content library. I think that Disney is the only one that makes sense. The rest of them
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:12.000]   don't know because for Apple from their type of content, having Star Wars and Marvel and Pixar.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.920]   It's the right library. It's the right library for Apple to go down the path with.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.320]   Do you know how angry Android users would be, Alex?
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.480]   What happened to my Disney Plus app?
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:31.760]   Well, I'll be interested here. Clearly, there's a there's a positive spin which Tim will use about
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:38.400]   the awards season and doing well in awards season. It's how everyone began. They got an award.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.440]   You know, I mean, Netflix got like a number one. Yeah, remember when it was a big deal that a
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.040]   streaming service got anything? And then Netflix is like, has two or what are they?
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:49.200]   Two two? I think they were nominated for like 23. Yeah. And the best picture category.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.800]   Yeah. Does he get even at Ricky Gervais? Does he? He's this opportunity to strike back?
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:26:01.600]   Somebody told me, I think one of you that Dickinson is actually the breakout hit of Apple
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.200]   Dickinson is really good. It's millennial Shakespeare. What I was surprised at is the breakout hit in
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:13.200]   Netflix is The Witcher. 75 million views. I think it's pretty bad. But if you were a Witcher fan or
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:18.160]   it's bad in the wrong in the right ways, it's good. It's good bad. Yeah. Henry Cavill is a
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:23.040]   Superman is a very it's Zina with a. It's good. It's good crossover. You get you get the you get
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:27.040]   the female audience and the male audience will watch anything that has swords. And so it's a good
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:33.840]   my wife likes it actually. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. All right. Well, so we'll watch it's coming up.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:39.360]   The Apple quarterly results. We'll talk about them next week. But of course you can read all
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:44.800]   the analysis at imore.com and Lori Gil will be transcribing. She's amazing.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:49.600]   Because she has to suffer through the analyst and goes, Steve, can you tell me if the next iPhone
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:55.760]   will have five cameras and he's like, my name is Tim and you know we don't talk about future products
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:02.800]   and hanging up now. And then the next thing. It's my favorite part actually of the earnings call
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:09.440]   is the way the call ins try to they try to like position the way they ask the question to see
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:15.440]   if they can trick somebody into saying something as if I wouldn't. Some color on this. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:20.240]   Yeah. Also, sometimes sometimes it really is like a game with 20 questions where
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:25.360]   it's not it's not so much that they can't tell you anything. But there are rules to how they can
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:30.960]   tell you something. So you you can't say you can't ask a question like, will you be opening up
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:38.080]   watch will will be able to will I be able to create third party software on sign for the Apple Watch.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:46.000]   But you can say, what are you what are your feelings about developer APIs and access to hardware
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.640]   and then translate for that. But this but Lori Lori's right. This is always the most interesting.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:56.320]   One of the most significant things that Apple does because this is one of the rare rare
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:02.320]   opportunities where Apple does not have a lot of control over what happens. You can ask any
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:07.680]   you ask any question. And if they pre varicade in any way, there are legal repercussions to
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:13.360]   making a lie. So anything that they say, even no matter how not that you're expecting anything
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:19.440]   daring or outrageous to be said. But if they say something like, Oh, yeah, well, we switched all of
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:25.920]   our our autonomous car people into a transporter team. And then you have to say that's ridiculous.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.680]   But they will get sued. They'll believe if that were not true. What does this mean?
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:36.640]   I did not. This is interesting. So many of the chatroom passes along the rotten tomatoes ranking
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:43.360]   of Apple TV shows. I think that's I believe rotten tomatoes, right?
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:49.920]   I've gone to so many movies that they said were good that were bad. And so many of the words they said
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:54.480]   were bad that were good. Top 12 Snoopy in Space, then Helpsters, Ghostwriter,
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:01.760]   Oprah's book club number nine, see number eight, 43%, a splat on rotten tomatoes. Morning show
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.320]   number seven, 61%. Oh, but they're getting they're getting what's his name? David Batista next season
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:12.560]   Leo. So that's going to be all the hunks. They're getting yeah. For all mankind, number six, 73%,
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:18.720]   Dickinson, number five, 74%, servant, number 484%. I bet they didn't watch the last episode yet.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:30.400]   Hala number three critics consensus very strong, 88%. The elephant queen, 90%.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:37.040]   Number two, and the number one show, as you were saying, little America, 93%. Somebody
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:41.440]   that chatroom says, Apple's just making shows for the liberal filter bubble.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:50.400]   Okay. You mean there's nothing about the Donald in here? We could do a little celebrity apprentice
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:55.120]   make everybody happy. I don't know if people are aware, but the word liberal is not like an insult
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.560]   everywhere else in the world. Like there's just there's liberal parties and conservative parties,
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:04.960]   only every other country is like an official name for a party only in America. What else?
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:10.800]   What else is hot and happening here? Let's actually let's take a break. There is a lot more story.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:16.560]   Apple spent a record amount of in Washington lobbying, but less than the other guys.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:23.120]   Apple's selfie camera falls to 10th place in the DXO mark charts.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:29.600]   They didn't pay for their consulting. Apparently not. Shipboarders up to cope with
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:35.120]   iPhone 11 demand and then rumors about the SE 2 coming this spring. We'll talk about all that
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:41.120]   and a lot more. Renee Ritchie from imore.com Andy Inaco from Boston Public Radio. Lori Gelfam,
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:48.320]   imore, Alex Lindsey on his own recognizance. A minister without portfolio at Alex Lindsey on
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:53.200]   the Twitter and the Pixel. A rodent masterless samurai. Are you a Ronan? You cut a
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:58.960]   Ronan. You are a Ronan, a mercenary that works for anybody who can afford the sword.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:05.120]   I hit the kitty butt to his eye. But they're storming a village. They're storming the village.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:12.960]   Let me know. You're the guy. I just I just put a seven samurai and thrown a blood on my plex
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.640]   server. Great movies. You can just watch Mandalorian. They take that.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:22.000]   They've never used all those movies. I thought everything has to be Disney's. Get your entertainment
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.400]   from someplace other than Disney. Last night I watched at Astra the space opera with Brad Pitt.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:34.720]   It was Apocalypse Now. Think about it. It's narrated the whole time. He's going through this trip to get
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:41.440]   to his father who is Colonel Kurtz because he's gone mad. It's really Apocalypse Now. I watch
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:45.760]   this going. I know. I was complaining about this Leo and my mom. Well, hard to not. You said you
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:50.320]   know how many times I've read on Shakespeare. I just could. I had no answer. Well, I had no answer.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.320]   The truth is Shakespeare is all just the Bible. So we had an English teacher in eighth grade who
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:58.000]   said you read the Bible. All the stories are in there. Bible in a Homer. If you get a Homer in the
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.120]   Bible, you got them all. All the twins. All the twins. In the Odyssey, Leo. If you read Grand
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.960]   Odyssey, you're all. It's all. Grandal, man. They all. Grandal all the time.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:09.200]   Beowal. Sorry, Beowal. Yeah. Sorry. I'm with the bad guy.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:14.000]   Grandal was a book, which was great. Yeah. Taken from the point of view of the bad guy,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.520]   which I thought was a great idea. And then there was the wicked witch. Your wicked. Yeah.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:27.600]   That's become a thing. See, you, I think my fine friend, my listener, our watcher, our viewer,
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:35.840]   you like this kind of witty repartee, right? Sophisticated people talking about intelligent
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:40.880]   things. That's why you watch the show. That's why I think you'd be really interested in masterclass.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:46.560]   Imagine the greatest minds, the greatest directors, the greatest actors, cooks, chefs,
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:53.120]   writers, teaching you how about when you like to learn screenwriting from Aaron
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:33:00.640]   Sorkin for crying out loud. He actually has two good writing habits, writing captivating dialogue
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:08.160]   in the West Wing writers room. This is actually one class 35 episodes long. Aaron Sorkin, a master
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:13.920]   class, Samuel L. Jackson, a master class in acting. My favorite is his Pulp Fiction workshop where he
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:18.720]   breaks down the first scene from Pulp Fiction and explains what's going on and has real actors
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:26.000]   doing it. It's amazing. Judd Apatow, how to write comedy. It goes on and on. Arm and Van Buren
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.720]   on dance music. They have David Mamet talking about stories and screenwriting and writing.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:36.960]   Thomas Keller, one of the great American chefs, the most decorated Michelin star chef in America.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:41.360]   How did they get him to do a cooking show? He's really good. Oh, man, he's amazing.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:46.800]   French laundry. You want to learn chess? How about from a world champion Gary Kasparov?
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:53.760]   How to make a joke with Steve Martin? Just this little one, how to tell a funnier story.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:34:00.000]   Nerves, hecklers, and bombing. His is one of the best. So many things that he says that you'll
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.040]   think about over and over and over again. You don't think about why you're watching it and then
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:09.040]   you find that you're rewinding it over and over and over. He's a super smart guy. Mexican cooking
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:14.080]   from Cabarela Kamara, Neil de Grass Tyson on scientific thinking. And the production value on
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:18.960]   this. Oh, I'm beautiful. I'm pretty picky about production value. It's outstanding. You want to
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:27.760]   learn ballet from Misty Copeland? Oh, sure you do. I got me up on my toes. This is really an
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:33.840]   amazing thing. Masterclass. It's an immersive learning experience accessible on your phone,
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:39.760]   on the web, on Apple TV. They've got a great app. Classes on every, you could just tell on every
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:44.720]   topic taught by the people who are the best in their fields. Individual video lessons,
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:52.880]   downloadable materials shot professionally, gorgeously. The lessons are short too. They're 10 to 15
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:57.280]   minutes, although there are many of them. I think Steve's is 35 lessons. So you can watch
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:03.840]   in little bites as convenient. And you also get downloadable lesson recap, supplemental materials,
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:08.480]   the cooking classes, for instance, come with a downloadable guys that are like a high-end cookbook.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:15.280]   I just, I don't know why everybody doesn't subscribe to this. And it's really affordable.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.360]   You don't buy the don't buy individually. No, buy the whole thing. You're going to want the whole
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:24.800]   thing. The year, the year, I have the, I bought the the one year subscription. Yeah, the all-access.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.480]   And that's what makes way more sense than people look at these individuals. They're like,
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:32.240]   $59, but it's like, it's not, it's not nearly one of their negotiation.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:38.160]   Presidential historian, Dara S. Kerns Goodwin, on the secrets of presidents on Bob Iger,
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:46.960]   CEO of Disney on how to run a company. The founder of Spanx, I love my Spanx, Anna
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:54.160]   Winter, the EIC of Vogue on fashion, Jane Goodall on conservation, Howard Schultz of Starbucks on
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:36:01.440]   leadership, Paul Krugman on economics, Bob Woodward investigative journalism, Carl Rove and David
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:07.520]   Axelrod, that would be a great, the two of them together, the architects of Obama and Bush's election
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:15.840]   victories. That sounds just like a fantastic masterclass in politics. 24 episodes. Look,
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.640]   you're going to want this. You're going to want every one of them. Right now, you can get a great

[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:35.280]   guarantee. So there's absolutely no risk. If you didn't get it for, for the holidays as a gift,
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:42.000]   and by the way, it's a great gift, masterclass.com/macbreak. Get that all access passes. Very
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.480]   affordable. Masterclass.com. Look at that. Steph Curry on three pointers.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:53.600]   Annie Liebovitz. I mean, talk about inspiration. Ron Howard directing, making a movie.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:37:01.760]   Masterclass.com/macbreak. We're all, we're all big fans. I'm jealous. I wish I'd thought of it.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.920]   Yeah. I don't know. Some of the best, some of the best entertainment I ever see is an expert at
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.680]   something just tell talking about that thing they're an expert at without trying to make people
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.520]   laugh. I thought they've just, they've just accumulated 30 years worth of understanding,
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.520]   and they're as excited to share that knowledge as anybody is to acquire it.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:27.840]   India is turning out to be the number one cell phone market in the world, and Apple has
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:35.680]   found some sort of masterclass in success. It was the sales in India, according to I'm more,
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:40.080]   was down 43% last year. Up 6% this year. What do they do right?
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:47.680]   Was it having a less expensive phone or an A? Well, yeah, according to Bloomberg, it was the
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:52.720]   10R. Yeah. Yeah, and the 11 is. Oh, the 10R that nobody wanted. I remember that.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.200]   Bloomberg every time they wrote about it, it was the beleaguered, unsuccessful 10R.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:02.400]   Is this a lesson though for Apple that maybe the price of the phone has gotten too high that maybe
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:08.080]   they really depends on the market. And what's happening is the market's maturing. We're not used
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:11.760]   to a place where the smartphone market is mature. If you look at cars, nobody says, oh, you know,
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:15.760]   that car is too expensive or why there's so many cars, it's just you there's cars you like.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:20.160]   The car is going to forward. Yeah. And that you like and you make you do a little matrix and the one
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:24.320]   that falls on that is the one you get. And phones increasingly have to become that. It's not like
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:30.240]   Apple's mistake a couple of years ago was making the iPhone $1,000. And that just really pisses
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:35.760]   people off. You want you so okay to have an iPhone like a premium iPhone $1,000. But you always
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:40.480]   want the normal iPhone, the iPhone that everybody wants to be somewhere around $500, $600. Then you
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:44.160]   can have an entry level iPhone like an SE or something else. And then you can have how much is the
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:52.320]   money a foldable one? $699. Okay. $700. Yeah. The SE is also but it's the iPhone. That's the
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:57.440]   important part is not the iPhone is not $1,000 and you get the iPhone lesser than the iPhone is
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:05.280]   that yeah. Yeah. The SE two, which is a lower cost one is rumored that it will be out this spring.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:10.800]   Or at least by the end. iPhone nine. Yeah. Why would they call it the nine?
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:19.520]   Is this below 10? But we have 11. What doesn't that send a bad message? A 13. This is the rumor
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:24.960]   A 13 chip 4.7 inch display. People really like small, you know, there are people who really like
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:29.600]   smaller and it's also durable. Like I'm waiting for this because I don't want to give my kids even
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.280]   my own my larger ones because I'm afraid they're going to break it. And so I do I have gotten to
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.000]   the point where I want to give my kids we have to pick them up and drop them off. And I'm like,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.400]   I got to give them a phone. But I I'm waiting for this because I don't want any of the other
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:45.120]   phones to be something that's thrown into their backpack. This is durable. You also want two markets
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:50.080]   like modern processor and relatively inexpensive. 399 according to the rumors. Yeah.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:54.800]   The magic with the original SE is that it hit two markets really, really hard. It hit the
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.880]   market. People who wanted less expensive iPhones, but still new like not an old iPhone. They wanted
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:02.800]   to have all the features, but just less expensive. And then people who just wanted to have a smaller
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:07.920]   iPhone again, not a phone with older features like having to buy a five they wanted the latest
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:12.240]   features. They just wanted to be smaller. And the conflicts of those markets was magic. And this
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:17.760]   is the same thing. This has the internals of very modern. The most modern iPhone that's but
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:23.440]   have the A 13 chip so that you can keep up with the software. The iOS updates. Absolutely. And
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:27.520]   people don't feel left behind. But it's also got a home button because you can no longer get a
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.960]   modern home button iPhone and some people still prefer the home button. Does it have a head phone
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:35.440]   check? People who want the classic? No. I mean, we're not going that far back. Don't be crazy.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:41.280]   But it's a it's a difficult time because we're definitely at the point where you've got the
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:45.200]   you've got the majority of people who just want a functional device. In the Android space, we've
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:50.160]   seen so much people having success, including Google with phones that are $500 and below.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.320]   So it's an interesting problem for Apple to have where there's so many advantages to having an
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:41:00.000]   Apple phone, particularly when you get to the low cost phones, you know that an Apple an Apple
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.520]   phone, whether you whether you buy it new for $500 or $1,500 has the same amount of security,
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.960]   the same amount of trustworthy, you know, says anything else. When you start getting into budget
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:13.360]   Android phones, you start wondering, Okay, how much how much Adware has been pre packed onto this
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:17.440]   thing, through apps that can't be deleted. But you have to try to convince people that
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:25.280]   no, this does not have 3d face unlocking. No, this does not have the best in class camera with all
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:30.320]   the skin toning and background blurring and all this other sort of stuff. But please spend an extra
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:35.440]   $125 for our entry level phone instead of another competitor's mid range phone.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:40.320]   And I think it becomes an ecosystem thing. People who start with something tend to stay inside
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:45.680]   that ecosystem. And so Apple giving up that whole entry level market, whether it's my kids or college
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:50.640]   students or folks that are, you know, coming, you know, can't afford to spend $1,000 on a phone,
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:56.080]   those are that's a whole ecosystem they're giving up for a long time potentially. And so it makes
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:00.960]   a lot of sense for them to have a more cost effective solution. Well, remember that for a lot of
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:07.440]   people who are again, not so not so much brand aware, a phone is just the device that they run
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.560]   the Facebook app on, or they they run their social media apps on these, they run their their
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:17.520]   messaging apps on. So it's not there are a lot of people that are walk on to the dealer a lot,
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:24.000]   and they're willing to buy any Ford or sedan that gets a good gas mileage and isn't and they
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   recognize there aren't any oom-lots or anything in the brand name. They want something that's just
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.240]   functional and just simply works. It doesn't it almost doesn't seem that Apple has been able to
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:40.640]   hit the entry level market though. If you think about the low cost phones that they put out in the
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:48.640]   past like the 5C and the SE, they've just kind of disappeared. But what has been successful is just
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:54.720]   dropping the price of one of the phones that's a year or two old. That seems to be something that
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:43:00.960]   Apple has done right. But having a phone that's specifically designed to come out of the gate as
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:06.560]   an entry level phone, they haven't really succeeded at that yet. Yeah, that's not their strength. They
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:11.360]   don't know how to do affordable and inexpensive. They also don't know how to cut corners and make
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:16.240]   something terrible, but they also don't know how to make a really, really good like $500 phone.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.880]   But you're right. That's that's one of the things I really, really like about Apple in the past
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:25.040]   three or four years. They instead of just saying instead of committing to the no, no, no, we need a
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:29.520]   lean and mean product catalog. We don't want to have we don't want to give lots of confusion to
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:33.280]   people by having so many different models of whatever that don't have that subtle differences
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:38.720]   between them. It really is a very, very big deal to be able to buy a two or three year old phone
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:45.840]   for a $1,000 phone from three years ago for five or $600 today, particularly when those phones
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:50.640]   are still really, really competitive with a brand new out of the box. Very nice $500 phone
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:56.000]   you could buy today. It's the longevity of these devices that is the big, big payoff for Apple and
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:04.880]   the users. January 27, 2010. A day I'll never forget the last Apple event I ever got to go to.
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:10.480]   I was I think I was seeing your seat for that one. And that's when you had the Skype,
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.040]   where you were skipping back to us. Let's not bring that all up again.
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:19.360]   We were covering it live. We were down there. We even had lawn chairs out in front of
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:27.200]   Urban Bueno Center. We were talking about the release of a very hotly anticipated Apple product,
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:35.040]   the iPad, 10 years old yesterday. And 350 million devices sold, but it's been down.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:38.000]   Sales peaked in 2013. It's been down for seven years now.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   Is the iPad a success? I love my iPad, but people aren't flocking to buy.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.560]   I think it's a metric. I think what's the metric? I think 150 millions a lot.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:57.840]   I think one of the things about it is that is actually the durability and the fact that
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:01.680]   I think a lot of developers, never really, including Apple to some degree, never really took full
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:06.640]   advantage of whatever was being upgraded from one iPad to the next. I noticed that like for
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:12.400]   until recently, my kids were able to use iPad 2s for a long time and do everything they wanted to
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:16.800]   do with it. There was no feeling like they were. It wasn't like an iPhone where you felt like
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:21.440]   all these new features are there. If I don't upgrade, I won't get them. It was kind of like,
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:30.560]   oh, this iPad works. My iPad 1, I think, ran for five or six years. There were a lot of apps
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:40.000]   that were really driving me to feel like I needed to upgrade. I think that drove me to get new
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.760]   iPads where the kids were the pencil. The pro one was because I decided I was really going to use
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:50.720]   this more than my laptop. Do you? Oh, yeah. I barely. My laptop sits in my studio. I don't really
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:55.920]   take it out. So I mean, take it out if I have to go to like do work somewhere. I'll take it out,
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:04.800]   but otherwise I'm pretty much on my iPad. We were still in the old brick or a cottage to the
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:10.240]   private point of center. I think when we were doing this January 27th,
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:16.000]   I was just the one because this is I don't know what this open is because I was there. So I don't
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.560]   know. This is the one you turned your laptop around. You got the yeah, yeah. Here we are in the
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:26.960]   lawn chairs in front of the. Oh, look at that. Yeah. Technology at its best. This is what it's
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:32.720]   all about. That's Jennifer Jolly from channel 11 interviewing me on channel 11 while I'm interviewing
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:41.200]   our Twitter. Very confusing. There we are. The lawn chairs out front. Colleen had built
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:46.000]   some sort of crazy gadget that was a lot of us to get on and we have some great people coming
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.680]   up behind Jason Snell from Macworld Magazine. Ryan Block from GDGT Tom Merritt is here from Buzz
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:56.080]   Out Loud. Everybody's here. This is a huge event. I do want to mention one more sponsor, a great
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:59.440]   sponsor. We love that. I don't know who they are and they didn't pay for it. So I'm not going to
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:06.240]   give them the free ad. We won't show the part. Wait a minute. Who's that guy?
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:11.840]   With the hat there. But when you. I should press funny back.
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:20.240]   That's Ryan Block on the left. As I mentioned at the time GDGT, which is his successor to
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:26.160]   Engaget and Andy Enoco there with the. Exactly. You look you. You have unchanged.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:30.480]   No, no, I have a slightly different style of eyeglass frame.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:37.360]   So do I for that matter. It looks like I'm wearing corduroys, which I haven't worn since 2010.
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:43.040]   So but that was that was that was those were fun. That was a fun event. That was that was a.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:50.960]   Go ahead. That was a great time because we knew that Steve Jobs was fading. Yeah, he was
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:56.160]   real looking at the time. Yeah. And that's that's why when I attend these events,
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:03.280]   I know that I can always I know that there's a video of it that's going to be streaming. We're
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:09.120]   on on the web somewhere. So I'm not necessarily focusing on what's on the stage. I try to see
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:15.600]   things that are not being covered by cameras. And what really, really affected me was watching Steve
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:22.080]   like whenever there'd be like a video, he would be off stage, but just enough on stage that he was
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:28.560]   watching the screen with his arms folded and this big old smile on his face. And back at time,
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:32.480]   where you would think that no, he's probably going to be sitting down and he gets this probably
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:38.320]   reason why was I bet there was that was probably one of the reasons why his presentation was in a
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:45.520]   very, very nice looking, comfortable chair for like a modern living room set. But no, he was just so
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:51.920]   beaming from side to side happy as a clam. And you could tell exactly how much faith he was
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:55.920]   putting in this device that this was going to be. He was, he couldn't wait to see exactly how it
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:02.720]   played out. Isn't that great? Yeah. And it was, I think, a very exciting event because we the
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:07.280]   iPhone had been such a success by then three years old. And we just couldn't wait to see what
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:10.400]   the next thing was going to be for now. Well, we had a pretty good idea. It was going to be
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:15.360]   something. Well, the iPad came first, right before the iPhone is from a developer
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:19.680]   development perspective. That's a weird thing. Yeah, it came out after three years later,
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:23.920]   but they had been working on it longer. I think this is when we got it. I don't know what this
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:29.440]   is. This is me. I had a, I had a re-release and this was okay. This was this was my one set of
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:35.360]   videos that has more than a million million views. Really? Wow. Wow. Nice. So is this when it had
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:41.360]   just arrived? This was prop, I posted it on launch day, I had it for a couple of weeks before
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:47.440]   launch day. Oh, you did. And this was this was before this was before the days of I'm going to make
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:51.920]   so much money off of YouTube on this. It was more like there are things that I need to choose
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:59.440]   some things that will that will that will that will go with my copy. What's young Alex saying?
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:02.960]   So Alex was hosting this. Oh, no, no, that's that's right. That's what you were. Right.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:06.640]   Right. And then I guess I was out in the field. You were there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:11.680]   It's so you look so young. Everybody looks so young 10 years ago at the door.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:17.040]   Except me because I was already old. Go ahead, Lori. Tell me, tell us that you were in junior high
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:22.720]   at the tide. He didn't have a driver's license. And that's fine. No, no. But it really, I think
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:27.200]   regardless of how many they sold, it really changed the direction of what we thought of as kind of
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:31.520]   portable, portable, cheap computing, you know, or inexpensive computing. I know. We're really going
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:37.440]   down cheap laptops and this kind of shifted the whole all the gears. And I know that tablets
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:45.280]   existed before the iPad came out, but the iPad is what made tablets popular. And I think there
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:51.120]   really did change the way everybody can not everybody, but a lot of people compute. And when
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:56.320]   we're in our little tech bubble, we are like, Oh, well, the iPad couldn't possibly be a replacement
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:01.520]   for a computer. But we kind of live in a special environment where we need our computers for a
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:07.440]   lot more than a lot of people do. Most people didn't need a home computer. Most people needed
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:13.520]   something that was more like an iPad or a tablet. And so, you know, Apple brought that to the table
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:18.880]   and said, you can still have computing in the home, but you don't have to have a full blown
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:24.080]   computer to do it. And that replaced a computer for a lot of people. I know a lot of people who
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:29.840]   just have an iPad in their house because they don't need the extra that a computer brings.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:35.440]   Doesn't you know, it's not as expensive. It doesn't take as much space. It's a better in between.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:40.640]   Yeah, I think that the what I noticed was is that the only people that really couldn't use an iPad
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:45.760]   alone are people who are computer natives. You know, we grew up with computers. We worked on them
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:50.960]   every day. And we were kind of used to how that works. Kids, I noticed just use iPad. My kids
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:56.320]   just use iPads. And then I also found that retire, you know, like folks that were that left the
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:01.760]   workforce before computers were their everyday bit, they just jumped right on iPads too. So,
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:05.200]   it was only the people who we spent all the time with our mouse and all the time with our
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:09.920]   keyboards where we really felt like we couldn't get away from it.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:15.120]   There's an amazing spread from Steve Sinofsky. He was talking about Microsoft's internal reaction
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:19.280]   as they were watching. Steve Sinofsky, for me, was not familiar, was running Windows in office at
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:24.160]   the time and was charged with Windows 7. And they had a whole tablet PC initiative. And they were
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:27.840]   just watching this presentation going, oh, Apple's going to announce a tablet. It's going to be a
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:31.920]   Mac based tablet with a stylist. We know exactly what they're going to do because that's going to be
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:35.920]   running because that's what Microsoft would have done. And they were just watching going, no, no,
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:40.560]   and they just every expectation had to be changed immediately.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:45.040]   Yeah, we forget that there was this wasn't this didn't come from out of the blue, just like with
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:51.040]   the iPhone. For a year, everybody knew that probably by the end of the year, maybe in January,
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:56.880]   Apple is going to be introducing a tablet computer of some kind. The only surprises were exactly what
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:02.320]   form it was going to take. And I remember and I remember the biggest speculation was was not so
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:06.720]   much about what it would do, but how much it would cost. And I remember just this gasp in the
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:12.640]   audience when they said $499. Yeah, the smart money was $79. Remember that?
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:16.560]   Yeah, the four on nine fell down and destroyed it. Click, click, click, click,
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:24.000]   all everywhere. Also, watch the video and pay really close attention to how,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:32.480]   I don't want to say vague, but how amorphous Steve's and Apple's explanation of the iPad was.
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:36.720]   They wanted, I feel as though they knew that they had something really, really different and
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:41.280]   kind of like with the first generation I watch, they didn't, they knew that it was going to be the
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:46.320]   software environment that was going to define this device, but they didn't have the software and
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:50.720]   they didn't know what people are going to be using it for. So they kind of, they tried to avoid
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:55.840]   referring it to making, they wanted to avoid giving people the impression that this is going to be a
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:00.640]   really good color ebook reader, or this is going to be a really good movie player, or this is going
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:05.520]   to be a productivity device. They covered their bases everywhere, but they wanted to, they knew
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:10.720]   that if anybody really pressed them on any one of those points, particularly the people who
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:16.000]   wanted to insist that this was a competitor for notebooks, competitor or competitor for previous
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.080]   Windows tablets that ran the full version of Windows, they're saying, well, clearly can't be a
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:24.080]   computer if it doesn't have a USB port, it clearly can't be a computer if it doesn't have a keyboard
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:32.080]   or a mouse. And so these are the sort of things they're trying to head off by trying to present
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:39.040]   sort of a digital Rorschach test to say, whatever it is, you really wanted this tablet to be,
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:43.280]   this presentation has to convince you that this is the perfect thing for that thing.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:47.520]   So it's interesting, I put together a whole, I put together a whole video on this, the secret
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:53.680]   origins of the iPad, I got to interview a bunch of people about the whole process of making it.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:57.680]   And the interesting thing is the brief for the iPad was just I want a glass service that I can
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:01.680]   use to read email anywhere, like anywhere. I want to be able to pick this up, no keyboard,
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:05.680]   strip it down, I want to be able to sell it for like 500 bucks and just go anywhere and read my
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:10.400]   email. And they added a few other things to that, like Steve Jobs said, no one reads books anymore,
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:15.680]   and then he's like, Don, make me, make me iBooks, I need iBooks by launch. And so they had to add
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:20.000]   a few features to it. But it really, it was, and Jobs called it the most important product of his
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:24.880]   life, but it was never meant to be a computer. And there have been these huge battles inside Apple.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:28.400]   Like a lot of people say like, was Steve Jobs passed away the iPad lost direction, but no,
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:32.960]   like you can clearly see that he had a direction for it that probably would not make many people
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:37.920]   happy right now. But they really did not want it to be complicated at all. It was supposed to be
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:43.280]   this, this thing that made computers even more addressable, comfortable, approachable by people
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:48.640]   who were still put off even even by Max. And that's what that's what the initial iPad delivered.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:52.480]   And especially the second one. And I just remember all my retired, exactly what Alex
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:56.480]   thing, all my retired high school teachers were lining up on launch day. I went down the line,
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:00.880]   when hey, Miss do this, hey, Miss is, and they were all there to buy a computer, because it was finally
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:06.400]   a computer that didn't make them feel stupid. I remember saying at the event, this is the computer
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:12.560]   Apple was created to build. Yeah, that this was what they couldn't do in 1977. But this was what
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:21.440]   they always wanted to do. John Gruber, though, has a piece in which he essentially says he's
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:26.800]   disappointed with how the iPad has turned out. And I'm wondering what you guys think he says the
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:32.640]   iPad at 10 is to me a grave disappointment, not because it's bad. It's not bad. It's great even,
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:39.120]   but because great, though it is in so many ways, overall has fallen so far short of the great
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:43.680]   potential it showed on day one, he's particularly unhappy with the multitasking, you know, the slide
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:48.720]   in windows. He's not wrong. To reach that potential, Apple needs to recognize they've made profound
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:54.640]   conceptual mistakes in the iPad user interface mistakes that need to be scrapped and replaced,
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:57:01.040]   not polished and refined. I worried that iPad OS 13 suggests the opposite that Apple is during the
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:04.960]   iPad full speed down a blind alley. You agree, Renee?
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:11.280]   So the thing is, this has been a problem inside Apple for years. And everyone inside an Apple says
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:16.320]   this that the iPad could just be so much more, but literally nobody has got an answer to how to make
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:20.480]   it that yet. And they've got like the amazing marketing people, amazing engineers, they're world
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:25.520]   class developers. And I think there's sort of two pressures. One is that dual mandate to keep it
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:29.840]   simple. But also, so the big danger was they never wanted to make it a Mac. They didn't want to
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:34.800]   visit the mistakes of the previous generation of computers onto the iPad. But there is a very
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:39.440]   small and very loud segment of people who would say, just give me a finder, a mouse and a keyboard,
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:43.360]   and make the iPad my screen. And they really have fought against doing that for years, and they're
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:48.480]   doing it a bit now, which might be part of that mistake. The other problem is that we live in a
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:52.240]   time now where apps are a very different ecosystem. There were a bunch of people saying, you know,
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:56.320]   the app store is never produced in Adobe. And to me, that's like saying YouTube has never produced
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:02.240]   a Disney. We went from a climate of incredible scarcity, which made all of applications incredibly
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:06.800]   valuable. And the people who control them or could make them incredibly wealthy to a time when
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:12.480]   anybody can produce them, there is vast abundance. And the return on investment in those apps is
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:16.320]   very different than it used to be. It's the same way they return on a YouTube video is not the
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:21.520]   return on a Star Wars movie. And those sort of those, the iPad, I feel is really trapped
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:26.000]   in between those two things. Absolutely tear down the multi window interface. I don't like it. I've
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.800]   complained about it in every review I've done since it was announced. There's ways to make it better.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:35.680]   It's not discoverable. It's confusing. Goober says my mother calls me all the time saying,
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:40.320]   how do I get this double pain with Safari? And how do I get rid of it? And it's full of collisions
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:43.520]   because there's just not that many gestures. And if you overload them, people make mistakes and
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:49.920]   they stop using it. Yeah. Yeah. But to say that that multitasking on the iPad is why the iPad is
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:57.040]   a failure or why it's a disappointment. That to me, it just, I respect Goober, but I don't think,
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:02.720]   I think that he wrote two different articles. He wrote one article about the 10 year old iPad,
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:06.640]   and then a different article, which is about how much he hates multitasking. I don't think
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:10.080]   they're one and the same. I don't think that you can put the two in the same category like that.
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:16.000]   That's one feature of an entire device. And this also goes back to what I was saying,
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:23.360]   which is that most people don't use multitasking windows. We're out there trying to multitask
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:28.560]   because we're trying to make our iPads more like a computer. But there are lots and lots of people
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:33.360]   out there who never, they don't want to use multitasking. They're not trying to use multitasking.
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:37.760]   They want to open an app, close an app, open a browser, close a browser, open their
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:41.600]   mail app, close their mail app. They don't want to do those extra things. So they're not concerned
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:47.360]   with that. So I do think, I agree with everything that he said, except for that, I don't think that
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:52.320]   you could say that multitasking is what makes the iPad a disappointment.
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:58.000]   I think that the big problem is that we still have the same problems we had during that first demo.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.920]   It's very hard to explain to somebody why you would want to, if you come into a store with X
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:08.240]   hundred dollars to spend on something that is going to solve computer problems in your life,
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:13.360]   why would you buy an iPad instead of, if you leave the Apple Store? Inside the Apple Store,
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:19.520]   the iPad is an amazing thing because for hundreds of dollars less than their cheapest MacBook,
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:27.360]   you get something that feels years beyond what a conventional notebook is. If you leave the Apple
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:31.680]   Store and go to Best Buy with the same five, six, seven hundred dollars, and you see that you can
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:35.280]   buy things that are familiar to you, that you know that your existing apps and your existing
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:38.480]   tools are going to work, that you're going to have a keyboard, that you're going to have a mouse.
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:43.600]   In many cases, you will even be able to fold it in on itself and still have a touchscreen
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:47.040]   and still have those sort of things. When you talk about delivering value for the
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:54.080]   eight hundred dollars, the iPad is great for people who recognize in the iPad the whole in their life
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:59.920]   that the iPad perfectly spackles in that no other device can fill in. But when you talk,
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:04.000]   when you have someone who's just walking in with, I've got X hundred dollars, you're things that I
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.600]   need to be able to do with a computer, I can do it with, I'm not prejudiced against one thing or another,
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:15.120]   I think a lot of people will be better served by a conventional seven or eight hundred dollar
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:20.640]   notebook, then if I another manufacturer, then they will be with an iPad Pro. Now,
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:26.800]   the, I will say though, that I, to, to ping back on something you said a little bit earlier,
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:34.800]   the, I do think that the three hundred fifty three hundred twenty nine dollar iPad is what the Macintosh
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:39.760]   was originally meant to be. It is, I think it is Apple's VOCS computer that anybody can afford,
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:44.640]   anybody can carry around. It's the most personal thing they have ever made. And so that's why I
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:49.760]   think that the biggest successes in Apple and the iPad line are the least expensive ones. The iPad
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:54.880]   mini and the entry level iPads, amazing devices that kick the butt of almost anything in its price
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:02:00.480]   range. So long as you're okay with not having a keyboard or tooting around a Bluetooth keyboard.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:06.320]   And I also think that it definitely is a what you're, what you're used to and trying to maintain
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:11.840]   that or let it go. You know, I look at my kids, like my, my kids, my son has a Chromebook, I guess,
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.400]   that comes from school. And he does a school work on it. He doesn't do anything else on it.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.200]   Like he opens it up. He doesn't school work. The school wants, by the way.
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:24.560]   Right, right. But he doesn't like, he's like, uh, no, like the idea of that, it doesn't attract him.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:29.600]   And he'll go over and he works on the, he builds stuff in Roblox on the iMac. Right.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:34.000]   You know, so he'll go over and use that for that thing because it'd be only because it doesn't
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.400]   exist on the iPhone. Maybe how it's going to be in the future though is machines that I use this
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:44.000]   for this and this. You're on an iPad Pro in the chat room, but you wouldn't edit videos on it.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.480]   I, well, I'm actually playing with that in videos on it. But I, and I playing is the operative word.
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:56.080]   Well, yeah, I mean, I need a lot. I mean, again, this comes back to knowing what you, what you're
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:00.400]   missing. Whereas, you know, I think that when you're used to it, like we had this problem a lot
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:06.000]   when Apple had shake app. It's a nodal compositor for those of you who don't remember 15 years ago.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.040]   There was a nodal compositor that we use in film and Apple bought it. And this is before,
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.880]   you know, they got a lot of money with iPods. And the interesting thing was, is if you had
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:18.640]   already used that, if I was teaching someone who would already used After Effects, they couldn't
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:23.360]   understand shake. They were like, I didn't, it took me six months to figure out like to think like
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.320]   that, because I didn't have any layers. You know, you just had little noodles and you're just
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.320]   putting things together and you didn't understand how it worked. If you, I could take an eight-year-old
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:34.400]   and teach them how to composite on shake without any problem at all, because they didn't know
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:38.320]   anything about layers. So as soon as I just told you how that worked, they were like, oh, this is
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.880]   mixed. And then you'd take into After Effects. And they're like, I don't understand all these
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:46.880]   layers. Like, why do I have to do this? And so, sorry. Final cup. Final cup. Final cup. It's like
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:50.640]   that. People don't like leaving for me. Or premier. Right. And started with iMovie. They're easy
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:55.200]   to move to Final Cup. Well, once you're used to Final Cut, like, I, you know, I'm, I still go back
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.280]   to After Effects to do like, I, I would, I did that little effect shot that I put up on Twitter.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:04.800]   I didn't do the After Effects by team back to it. To make it the ultimate computing device that
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:09.680]   you do. I mean, I don't know if we need one device to serve them all. I mean, in fact, the way the
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:13.840]   world is moving, we have, you know, Amazon Echoes, we have televisions, we have iOs.
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.120]   Cars and trucks, Leo. Don't say cars and trucks. Cars and trucks. Cars and trucks. That's
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.600]   to over simplistic. Where computing is at the edge and computing power exists everywhere. Our
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.200]   data is in the cloud. So that means our computer, if you've got a phone, you've got an iPad, you've
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.120]   got a computer, you've got a TV, you've got an echo. I think where I see myself go back to my
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:34.400]   computer is one is complex operations that are hard to do with my fingers. You know, I just can't,
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:39.200]   you know, like, I can't quite, I need them, I need the mouse to get to do precision stuff. And that
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:42.480]   comes down to editing. You know, you can only so much you can do with your finger when you're editing.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:48.640]   And so computing is cheap now, though. That's my point. And so you can have a watch.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:52.400]   Right. And make, do you not have to make the watch the be all end all? You know,
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:56.720]   to make the iPad, the be all end all. Each has its own place and purpose in the ecosystem.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:02.240]   And because computing is cheap, data is in, is shared in the cloud. You can have hundreds of
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:06.400]   devices. And I think we will eventually. That's, that's clearly the trend. But like, you know,
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:10.400]   like for me, it's that it's video input. Like I can't have a video digitize it.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:14.320]   But doesn't have to. Oh man, it would, it would really, what I'm saying is why are we trying to
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:18.960]   make this an all in one device when it does a few things perfectly? And we'll just use it for that.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:23.840]   I'm in between a full and left top Leo. Well, right. That's where Steve position.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:28.320]   But then in areas where I think it could, it could do these things like one of the big reason I go
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:33.920]   back to if I'm doing research is I don't know if cut and paste will work on an iPad. Like I don't
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:38.400]   know if I'm gonna be in the cell zone sit down at my iMac Pro. There are times when I'll use my Mac
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:42.640]   book Pro. There are times when I'll use my iPad. But what I say is the one that I really go,
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:48.320]   this is stupid is on my computer anything I can see I can copy on the iPad depending on what the
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:53.680]   developer did I can or I might or might not be able to copy what I'm looking at. And it is literally
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:56.400]   the number one reason I don't do research on my iPad. But do you think your kids have the same
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:01.760]   consideration or is that just because you come from a background of yeah, well they ubiquitous.
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:05.040]   Yeah, I don't know. They don't they don't care. They don't care. I think they'd say this is what
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:09.280]   I use my Chromebook for. Right. This is what I use. I use my backbook for more oblox.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:14.960]   They're they're just tools to them. It'd be silly to say I'm gonna have a hammer in my toolbox and
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:21.760]   that's all I'm gonna use all the time. Yeah, see it's it's also we're we're on balls as we as our
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:27.760]   viewers and particular viewers know timers that well no not all timers but but we but we it means
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:33.440]   it makes perfect sense for me to have three different like portable devices that I know joke I have
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.880]   on any given day depending on what I need to do I might take a full blown laptop I might take a
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:44.240]   Chromebook or I might take an iPad with me and it makes and it doesn't seem insane to me that I've
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:48.800]   got what must be four thousand dollars worth of stuff that does exactly the same thing pretty much.
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:53.840]   Most people they have if they're lucky a thousand dollars to spend in a notebook it might be closer
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:58.080]   to five hundred five hundred six hundred dollars and they can't they not it's not even a case of
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:02.160]   them not having the money to have a secondary device it just doesn't make any sense for them to
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:06.640]   have a secondary device and so this is this is where I think that apple has a certain case of
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:13.360]   myopia where it comes to the iPad I really think that they have that emotionally they have a lot
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:20.320]   invested in the iPad that if or in iOS that if they have if they were to create a really next
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:28.560]   generation operating system for the desktop or a really next generation consumer grade Mac
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.280]   even something as simple as let's have a notebook that has a touchscreen on it I feel as though
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:41.200]   not explicitly but subconsciously they feel as though they they feel like they've lost if they
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:45.760]   don't say that this is the old style computer that we will continue to make because our customers
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:51.040]   love it and we love Mac and want to continue to make Macs but every time we have a really amazing
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:56.480]   idea for how to push the needle forward we're going to put that idea into an iOS device I really think
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:01.280]   that that is a limitation of their thinking I can't I can't I obviously can't prove it this is just
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:08.720]   a subjective opinion but I think that explains why it was so easy for the rest of the computer
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:14.560]   industry to not necessarily catch up with iPad but say wow those are really great ideas in this
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:20.880]   iPad let's figure out ways of taking those ideas and making them really really useful for our desktop
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:26.240]   offerings for the more practical again the Toyota Corollas of the computing world which is the most
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:30.880]   they're in the most popular cars are the ones that just get the job done and apple is not
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:36.000]   putting that kind of faith in that kind of uh that kind of excitement into Macs and again I think
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   it is a singular focus on iOS uh by the way 13 what is it point 3.1 came out today anything we
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.720]   need to know about it Renee is uh I actually haven't looked at it I was busy setting up this whole
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:54.880]   camera thing you said I know I know I think my job and stuck it up on it I saw I saw the update
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.560]   doc and it really is just nothing but updates I think the only thing that's really new is
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:04.320]   if you have a home pod there is an Indian English I think yes interface board but other than that
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:10.000]   it's like uh fixed a fixed a problem where occasionally people would type an oomle out and a
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.400]   Unicode character that looks like an oomle up but is not actually an oomle out got typed instead so
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:20.000]   I have to think there's something they're patching because they patched iOS, iPadOS,
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:28.640]   tvOS, Catalina, WatchOS and the HomePod all today so there's something more than their
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:32.000]   their taught you know there's got to be something more so we'll see we'll see we'll see we'll see
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:39.840]   a little change to screen time for um allowing like how you can allow children to um call people
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:44.960]   and receive calls from people and chat with people on Facebook and stuff which I know um that was
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:49.840]   something that was discovered a month or two back that um kids were able to circumvent the
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:55.040]   screen time or the the parental controls and I think that's one of the things they just added to
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:10:02.240]   uh maybe another indicator that it's got a security uh component 12.4.5 for those of iOS users
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:08.240]   that are still on the old iOS 12 also got updated today that to me is a strong indicator there's
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:14.480]   a bunch of them there's uh an application maybe will execute arbitrary code with privileges and
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:19.840]   audio a FaceTime issue with handling local users self-view image IO iOS accelerator
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:24.160]   IPsec kernel kernel kernel kernel kernel kernel kernel this is all in apples I'm curious to have
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:29.120]   any if it had anything to do with it's very long the WhatsApp hack for bezos yeah you wonder you
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.480]   know because because that was terrifying the idea that the amount of taxes he pays he should be
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:40.560]   terrifying to think that that someone can send you a video on WhatsApp and then start downloading
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:45.120]   everything from your phone oh a nation's day can't yeah well nation I anybody I mean that's what we're
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:51.600]   trying to yeah and then by the way that story is not we don't know the whole story on that there's
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:56.000]   there's still some evidence that even even fti consulting which came out with that port said they
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.040]   have medium to high confidence right that's not bad but even if that story is true like that's a
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:05.680]   million plus dollar two million dollar exploit they were willing to burn right on jeff bezos which
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:09.760]   is interesting just politically apparently they didn't burn it because one of the problems fti had
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:15.360]   is they couldn't find the malware payload at all so they didn't have any way to analyze it
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:20.320]   and they weren't they did not take the trouble to unlock the to examine the bootloader for some
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:26.320]   reason so I don't know it's a you know what this is uh this is in the realm of gossip at this point
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:30.880]   not something you're exactly right as a grassy know in front of his yeah not something we should be
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:35.120]   saying oh my god I got to get rid of WhatsApp at least not for that reason there's other reasons
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:37.680]   you would have been something else it would have been whatever is vulnerable at the time they need
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:47.200]   it exactly yeah Neil Young says the Macbook Pro is a piece of crap uh Neil i price Neil i Patel
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:54.320]   did his best he's interviewing uh Neil Young uh and Phil Baker about their new book to feel the music
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:58.800]   of songwriters mission save high quality audio Neil Young of course has been pushing his pono
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:04.400]   player his high bit uh high res music player uh which i bought uh and he's very big on that
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:09.040]   uh tell the difference Leo because i might i'm not very good at audio at all no i am good at
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:15.360]   audio but i'm old my ears are old i think CD quality there's a lot of evidence because of the
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:24.560]   nakquist theorem that CD quality or maybe 14 uh rather 44 1 by 24 bit at best is all you're
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:29.520]   going to be able to do well it's just there are a lot of there are a lot of variables involved let's
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:34.720]   just say that and also the human ear can hear 20 Hertz to 20 000 Hertz at 22 000
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:39.040]   20 000 Hertz and unless you're superman you're not going to do better than that and if you're above
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:43.360]   22 you're going to do far worse than that well that's the nakquist theorem which says if you have
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:49.040]   that frequency range you can represent that perfectly without your in a certain and keep bits and
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:53.280]   also keep in mind also keep in mind that the engineers know the live engineers who are mastering
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:58.000]   the stuff they know what a CD can do they know what a streaming file can do and they're very very
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.920]   good at making their foot music sound as good as a possible channel and those things a huge
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:06.240]   psychological component and what you think how good you think the music is and if you're told
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:12.080]   oh this sounds better especially by a legend like Neil Young you might go oh yeah it sounds
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:16.480]   better but there's also we're also talking about a money you can pay for audio right millions
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:21.840]   and millions of dollars for anyway let me give you the only one the only one you remember he went
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:28.560]   out into a robo in a in a pond and had his right one one his house was one speaker and his barn was
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:33.680]   the other speaker i mean the the guy really is into his into his audio so it's different i don't
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:37.520]   think that's the ideal listening environment i'm just saying but okay i don't buy i would i i'd
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:43.280]   like to try it yeah like a lot of people who are like spending lots of money like i want to i'm buying
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:47.600]   nothing but hire his audio files and then they plug in like the cheap plastic earbuds they got
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:52.400]   free of the phone that's like yeah maybe instead of a thousand dollars for new music and for a new
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:56.960]   deck but as just to show us there is no limited amount of money we'll pay to feel like we have
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:01.520]   something super valuable and precious i just like a bit of jade i can stick up my huva
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:06.560]   uh your drugs another valuable netflix acquisition thank god they got the
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:10.480]   food but we like to feel like we're special and this stuff makes us feels oh oh you guys don't
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:17.360]   appreciate it but i i get the value again dollar headphone i i will say that i my final
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:21.840]   my final conclusion after spending like a month and a half like buying and listening to high res
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:28.560]   music is that i do think it's worth it for certain select albums that are my favorite albums of all
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:35.360]   time simply by virtue of the fact that um i'm when i buy an album i'm buying it for 10 years from now
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:40.640]   not just a month from now and i would like i don't mind spending an extra five or ten dollars if it
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:47.280]   means that maybe in 10 years from now the standard uh the standard mid-range or low-range audio thing
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:51.920]   that i will be i'll be buying and using is capable of resolving stuff i would much rather have the
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:57.280]   most data i can possibly have but yeah you have to it's if you if you want the most most entertaining
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:03.600]   rabbit holes you can find on youtube again go to not just the high-end audio channels but i'm talking
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:10.320]   about the decepticon level audio where you'll see you'll see like these people who are also
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:16.000]   engineers and they they they have totally redone the floor ceiling and walls of their house they've
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.840]   got they've got not just file cabinet speakers that's just one of the elements of the speaker and
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:25.120]   then they take you into the shop because oh what what's your turntable and they'll take you into
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:30.080]   the machinist shop they have the basement where they have like a turntable with i'm not joking a
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:36.400]   60 pound platter to make sure that you get the inertial or whatever on it and it's there's
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:41.120]   there's there's just like i take a certain amount of pleasure in not only listening to my music
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:46.160]   but also curating my music and like organizing it there's some people who do get extra pleasure
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:50.640]   on understanding all of the engineering and mechanics of sound reproduction and they're getting
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:56.400]   pleasure out of creative makes you happy that's fine the extra point but i gotta point out one
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:02.960]   of my favorite albums miles davis kind of blue beautifully recorded on analog tape so you can buy
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:09.840]   and i did foolishly a 192 kilohertz 24-bit recording of that but it's taken from an analog
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:20.320]   tape which doesn't have anywhere near that kind of resolution so perfect replication of an analog
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:24.560]   tape is what it is yeah go back to vinyl that's all i have to say about that there's a lot of
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:31.120]   music and she's a musician so i believe you so so is nia there's a lot to be said for issues and
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:36.800]   i've seen sound engineers say this that higher resolutions higher sample rates bring up issues
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:41.680]   create artifacts that actually damage the quality of the same with computer screens the hdr gives
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:49.120]   you more right color space to hang yourself yeah niel young says so nieli nieli doing doing his
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:57.680]   valiant best says um he's talking about people recording music in their bedroom on a mac bro
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:05.280]   macbook uh and niel says i'm looking at the new uh i'm sorry nieli says i'm looking at the new 16
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.360]   inch macbook pro apple gave me a review unit they said look at all the artists who use this thing
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:14.320]   with garage band to start but niel you're saying that shouldn't be where the recording starts
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:20.160]   it's a piece of crap are you kidding that's fissure price quality that's like kept in kangaroo your
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:24.960]   new engineer a macbook pro what are you talking about you can't get anything out of that thing
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:28.800]   the only way and on and on the only way you get it out is if you put it in and if you put it in
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.880]   you can't get it out because the deck is no good on the macbook pro so you have to use an external
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:35.920]   deck and do a bunch of stuff to make up for the problems of the macbook pro has because they're
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:43.040]   not aimed at quality they're aimed at consumerism that's what steve jobs told me pre 2011 i guess
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:47.280]   he told me the exact thing we're making products for consumers not quality they don't want audio
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:51.040]   quality they don't want to spend a lot of time on that audio quality for your reference and for
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:56.640]   anyone else's listening is deeper than visual quality uh i don't know well i don't disagree
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:00.880]   with the game you absolutely have you can't use app i don't know what he's talking about like you
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:05.280]   of course you're going to use a a different and external that external yeah like that would be
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:10.880]   an obvious thing and and evidently it's really hurt billy eilish you know to not to do something
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:16.480]   really good example how many grammys that she went uh she went on sunday she went four four or five
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:21.520]   she started on in her bed she still records in her bedroom with her brother on set and put it up
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:26.960]   on soundcloud that's a great story to me because it means some individual 16 year old girl could
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:32.800]   get a massive hit when five grammy awards for her first album and do it in her bedroom on a macbook
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:39.200]   yeah yeah that is the real power of music and whether it's perfect resolution or not well most of
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:43.280]   us have never spent any part of our life i mean i've definitely had the opportunity to listen to
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:47.680]   million dollar speakers and they do sound completely different it's way better um i think that atmos
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:54.960]   is actually more more interesting than than high high resolution rate um but but the uh but what
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:58.240]   most of us listen to all day is not going to get anywhere near that and we're none of us and we're
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:03.120]   never going back like we're not going to actually go back to those things and i used to spend a lot
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:09.440]   of money on not million dollars but i mean i spent a lot of money on my uh my audio and some very
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:15.520]   nice planar magnetic headphones they do sound a lot better and they sound better with 24-bit sound
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:19.040]   if you can get it right but but that's a whole environment and then the whole environment has to
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:27.680]   be there so htrex also sells a uncompressed version of band on the run of pomekartney's ram album
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:34.080]   versus and i'm talking about dynamic compression versus uh the the one that was distributed and
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:38.880]   without the dynamic compression it sounds phenomenal yeah but most of the records you're getting are
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:42.720]   highly compressed dynamic one part of it is when you're listening to radio it's compressed on the
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:47.920]   way out and then again so it's so are audio is highly compressed you should see how good we sound
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:53.760]   in 24-bit audio and for the benefit of people who aren't or audio engineers i barely understand
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:58.640]   what sound compression is and i always default to oh you mean mp3 right yeah there's there's
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:02.800]   digital compression in this dynamic compression and we're talking dynamic compression bringing
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:07.120]   in everything and then yeah digitally compression at lossy digital compression and just craps it up
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:13.760]   even more right so the results are out and uh tim cluck is focusing on install base 1.5 billion
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:18.080]   devices is what he wants us to take away from it yes that's exactly what the shift was about
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:23.360]   three or three quarters ago right we're going to talk about installed base and revenue per user
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:26.800]   instead of how many we sold okay that means we're going to get out of here because you guys have
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:32.880]   work to do uh but the call doesn't begin for another 20 minutes is that right yep okay fast

[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:34.560]   uh as an example a million dollar life insurance policy thirty six dollars a month
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:42.720]   the reason this is is is it's all based on statistics right actuarial tables but those tables are not
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:47.440]   very granular they don't understand a lot of things for instance we'd look at aunt who's you know
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:53.040]   buff he lifts his body mass index is through the roof but it's all muscle the life insurance company
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:57.280]   looks at his BMI and says well we're not going to give you a very good rate but aunt's healthy
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:02.800]   you need if you're a runner a cyclist if you're into crossfit if you get a eight hour sleep every
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:08.080]   night you eat right maybe you're vegetarian or a vegan you should be rewarded for all that work

[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:50.800]   typing typing typing in the chatroom what are you talking about we're just talking about
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:56.720]   Billy. Someone was asking Billy. Is that I'm back with logic yeah logic is great by the way. Logic is
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:00.480]   amazing. I've got I've really gotten into it because I was teaching my daughter is really good at
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:06.080]   garage band like frighteningly good and she's learning how to play keyboard. I think garage
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:10.400]   band you could probably point to Billy Eilish in a many that say that that whole generation garage
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:15.120]   band yeah turned them on to making their own music assuming it and by the way if you're near an apple
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:21.360]   store their what got my kids into it was taking garage band classes at the apple store for free
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:24.480]   and they suddenly understood how to arrange and they put all the stuff together they're great
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:30.800]   classes and so anyway so I wanted to move her to logic because why not you know and so I started
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:35.200]   getting her to you know he started learning logic so I had really had to dig into logic deeper
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:41.120]   because I'm kind of used to Pro Tools and anyway so it's really a great app and it's super easy to
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:48.480]   use and anyway so she says we can't work in studios we're touring all the time well but I think
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:51.200]   originally they were just hanging out and they're in their bedroom she even said that in her
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:57.680]   Grammy accepted speech these are these are socks I made my bedroom right which I think is fantastic
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:02.080]   well if you listen to big head Todd in the monsters like is there you ever heard of big head
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:06.480]   off course yeah with if you listen to this this I know when they were small head Todd in the
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:10.720]   monsters but if you listen to the original one that he did in his bedroom it's way better than
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:16.640]   the over produced honestly didn't studio a lot of times when I get those special editions like
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:23.280]   David Bowie and they put the demo of Space Audity on their him and his bedroom with a guitar I think
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:27.520]   because it has the spirit the soul right that was kind of produced out of it as they made it a
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:32.480]   big production it's so great I have that and it's an amazing recording I think it was on change
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:38.240]   the changes box that I think yeah anyway what's your pick this week so I'm really into short video
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:43.200]   like if you haven't noticed I was talking mr. Tick Tock but what is your kid's tick tock again
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:46.480]   my kids my kids are the Mc Mc uh
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.880]   Duffy's Mc phew duties
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.480]   all right hold on I'll find it again I just
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:52.240]   Mc Mc uh
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:57.120]   you forgot your kids you're a terrible hype man Alex you're a terrible hype man
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.400]   the Mcdubbies Mcdubbies DY-S right
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:04.960]   yeah Y-S yeah and and uh we have a lot of fun making them but that's not my pick
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:13.360]   my pick is the new kid on town in in town is bite so bite oh it's shorter over tick tock
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:17.680]   it's six seconds yeah it's so it's six seconds it's basically made by one of the founders of vine
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:22.720]   so if you're in the vine uh bite it's just getting started so this is this is your opportunity if
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:26.640]   you want to be in and on the ground level and the number one reason I mentioned this is for two
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:31.360]   reasons one is this is the time to go get your URL like you know I did immediately you know like
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:36.240]   as soon as I saw Megan put it up and I was like and I'm gonna go get uh I'm gonna go get my bite
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.480]   and get my Alex Lindsey you know lined up and throw a video on just feel like after we've had
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:45.120]   these longer tick tock videos going back to six seconds it seems so retro I'm I'm trying
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:48.720]   there you go I'm playing with it I did I did one
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:53.760]   I did one so far they're over like that I know yeah exactly
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:27:00.160]   that's it they're fast yeah so maybe that's a good thing in this space
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:05.040]   I don't know you know like so the thing is is that I I put up a loop that I thought was kind of fun
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:12.320]   and um uh but it's more of a just to watch this space whether it's tick tock or bite or looper or
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:17.440]   whatever ends up there I think that this this short the super short space of less than a minute
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:22.240]   is going to continue and it's not it's there's a lot of silly stuff on it but when you look at
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:25.920]   some of the educational things people are putting up on how to build things or I like your new
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:32.080]   McDummy this newest one is hysterical it's called missed it by that much so I oh it's loading
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:37.120]   hold on loading loading what's the why is this why would this might be brave blocking
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:40.080]   video or something because I could see it in the thumbnail
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:45.120]   I my kids want to do that I can go green screen
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:50.880]   while I did a drone shot that's a drone shot that I added shake to and then that's a green
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:55.200]   green screen of him so it's actually him falling it's not like a dummy well it's green screen of him
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:59.760]   just on a if you look at my Twitter you'll see he's not moving I am just animating that and then
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:04.080]   that's a stir and then I had to roto out her and this this is why I don't tick tock because there's
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:10.640]   people like you well anyway the kids wanted to do more effects than what they were doing and I
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:15.440]   of course they didn't have some skills there why would daddy's a special effects guy yeah so
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:21.040]   so anyway so it's um but it's not done with like the phone app you know I just used after effects and
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:25.840]   a bunch of red giant stuff and made it put on I wonder what daddy's back end is on this
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:33.280]   my son's commentary on uh apple cinder apple cinder apple cider vinegar
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:46.320]   someone else cat offstage the funniest one that was the funniest one is the we'll see we
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:52.320]   the one with a lot of those Alex's facial expressions this is that one that's the that's my
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:59.680]   we're eating there I think we saw this last week didn't we show that one yeah so Mcdubby's the
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:04.480]   Mcdubby's but anyway so but what I'm gonna go back to with yes is bite is just to pay attention to the
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:09.280]   space I think that there is a there is a value to the short space I think that what this space is
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:14.400]   replacing is when we used to surf on channels looking for something to watch yeah but iGTV
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:20.800]   yeah but but iGTV was in its own little space and it wasn't um they were asking people who were
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:25.760]   already instagrammers to go think about how another format this is it gets back to the whole like
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:29.760]   using the format for what it is um I think that you had a bunch of instagramers didn't know how to
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:35.680]   deal with video um right you know and so this is it's too long yeah it can be an hour long yeah
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:39.440]   yeah and and so I think that there's something about it and and there's something about the browsing
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:43.920]   method for these where you're just kind of oh I don't like this and I always and androids I think
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:51.120]   bite bite yeah bite.co anyway Andy Inaco your pick of the week uh real quick one uh there's one
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:55.280]   terminal command that I think that would help everybody if they knew how it worked it's rsync r
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:30:02.720]   s y and c it is just the standard Linux command for copying stuff from one place to another and
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:06.880]   potentially syncing them together to make sure that one thing contains the same elements as the
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:12.160]   other thing anytime that you're trying to you need to find your copy something that has lots and
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:16.240]   lots of things with it you should think about using r sync instead because it'll work so much
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:21.920]   faster so much more reliably and so much easier to repeat it and skip it I was reminded of this
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:27.200]   the other day because we were talking about music and I'm sort of redoing my music library at this
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:34.320]   point to accommodate devices that I own and things that I do in 2020 as opposed to 2011 2012 the
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:40.800]   first time I really did things and so it's really important for me to take uh the like 190 gigabyte
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:45.920]   music library that I have on my plex server and copy it make sure this regularly copied onto this
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:52.400]   flash drive and onto this micro SD card and r sync makes that a really really simple thing to do
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:58.240]   with just one command so whenever I I mean I just bought uh filling in gaps my collection just bought
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:03.760]   uh my my first full copy of the car's debut album after having only like three tracks of it in my
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:08.960]   library uh I rip it and then I put it on the server and then do one command and now it's on
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:13.840]   everything very very easily whereas other solutions would require a lot of thought and I don't have a
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:19.440]   lot of bandwidth for thought on a Tuesday morning so learn how to our how r sync works because it
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:24.880]   will be the sort of thing where you'll wonder wow why was I doing that such a laborious way before
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:29.600]   this is great and if you if you uh if you know how to use automator if you know how to use other
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:34.160]   automation stuff that means that suddenly a three a three line like automator
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:40.080]   procedure or three line apple script can now automate and schedule something that just happens
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:44.800]   automatically for you so it's one of the not everyone needs to know a lot about command line
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:49.520]   stuff uh how Linux works but this is one of the things where as much time as you put into it you
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:55.280]   will make back a hundred times and efficiency and simplicity laurie gill pick of the week
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:32:01.600]   wait a minute didn't you do this already no see you're you're confusing because I ordered one last
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:08.960]   week yeah last week was 12 south and so I want to bring this up because if you don't like the
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:15.840]   snapover case version here's another one that I love a lot the rugged case um from no mad it's a
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:23.360]   nice beautiful leather sleek looking case I actually prefer the the the overflow snap that
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:28.400]   that uh the 12 south has but this one it's great because it's simple it'll fit in your pocket it
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:33.440]   doesn't take up any extra space um so it kind of meets all those standards of like the minimalist
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:43.520]   version um this is a silly little addition but the the hole where you can see the um status light
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:49.920]   they actually have this like really distinctive engineering technology that they've used where
[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:57.600]   they put a little tiny glass pipe into that hole to allow the status light to just sort of be more
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:03.520]   present so at any angle it's really bright instead of it looking kind of dim or not noticeable and
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:07.840]   I I wrote a review about this and that was kind of one of the things I was talking about was
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:11.280]   it's the little things it's those little design things that you don't really
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:15.680]   take into consideration that when you know I'm just holding in my hand it doesn't seem like a
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:21.280]   big deal but when someone points it out to you like oh wow that's really amazing that they did
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:26.640]   this one little thing you know I see five bucks it's beautiful horn ween leather no mad loves that
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:32.000]   horn ween leather it is a beautiful beautiful leather out of chicago and they have it in the
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.360]   black or brown so if you um if somebody if your wife is complaining that you always order brown
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:40.880]   there's blacker she doesn't like the brown yeah shall always get the brown well I already ordered
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:47.600]   the 12th south it's fact you should come today I think uh Renee Ritchie pick of the week uh sure
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:51.920]   just really really quick so apple actually beat on iphone eight percent up they ended up selling a
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:57.120]   uh a large time what 11s yeah uh and they made much more money than people thought they'd make too
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:02.560]   so it was a good beat um for apple i bet that's time rice is gonna start to kick it up man
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:08.560]   should have bought it when it was down yesterday so well unless people start profit taking but
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:13.520]   that's a whole other that's a whole other show um my pick of the week is an app that we actually
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:18.960]   all saw demonstrated at the iphone 11 event when phil siller had the philmic pro team up on stage
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:23.600]   now this this will be integrated into philmic pro but for now they're putting it in a standalone
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:29.520]   app called double take and it uses apple's multi clan multi-cam api to let you record from up to
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:35.440]   two cameras it it works as a single camera with earlier iphones because apple says i you can't
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:41.280]   discriminate between devices but if you have a ten s a ten r uh or a ten s max or if you have one
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:48.160]   of the 11s you can use two cameras simultaneously up to 1080p uh up to 30 frames per second they
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:52.640]   push the bit right over 30 it's got a really high bit rate for the video you get to choose any two
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:57.680]   sides that you'd like to from it uh so you can have for example i could put it between me and lori
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:02.400]   and we could see both of us or me and a pip or side by side and it's recording off the back
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:07.200]   camera and the front camera or we could be at ces and i'm getting a view of the entire table
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:12.320]   i'm so mad that they didn't come out with this before i went to ces i know it's so useful
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:16.960]   it's free and they're gonna if this is free uh some people were upset because they
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:22.480]   they paid a lot for the pro version the pro version of this will come to film it later in the spring
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:29.680]   yeah thanks a lot filmic anyway there's uh it's kind of cool it gives you all the
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:33.120]   all the cameras and you picked two i was hoping they'd be able to pick more than two
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:38.160]   and they're recorded you can record a picture in picture side by side or stand alone i soad so
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:42.880]   you can have i just recorded a video of me and alix and i have two videos as a result
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:47.680]   one from the front camera one from the back camera that's that's pretty cool yeah and Neil
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:51.680]   yong still isn't happy about it though Neil yong still says it's a pressure price here
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.760]   it looks like an s-sketch it looks like an s-sketch that's mean
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:36:00.080]   but i used i've been using it for the last few days i was in on the bait and i had a lot of fun
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:05.120]   with it it works it is limited to again limited 1080p but it does really nice 1080p
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:08.800]   and you don't get the stabilization because they can't they had to choose between the stabilization
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:12.160]   and the bit rate and they went for bit rate because that's their sort of their reputation
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:15.920]   uh but if you know what it is if you put it on a tripod if basically it gives you two cameras
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:19.600]   for the price of one and we got to see a couple setups they had with like two three
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:22.880]   four iPhones all pulling double cameras and that's when you guys start again to like
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:27.360]   steven saudberg sort of territory with these things pretty amazing yeah that's pretty amazing
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:31.680]   i'm i'm really pleased by it yeah it's cool yeah but Alex the film star wars on it now
