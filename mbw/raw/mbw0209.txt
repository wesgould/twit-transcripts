[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.040]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly, episode 209 in studio with me
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.400]   today.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.160]   It's lovely to tell Alex Lindsey of the Pixelcore.com
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.360]   and Pixelcore.tv where those podcasts live.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.400]   Hey, Alex.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.760]   I tracked successfully across the Petaluma Tundra.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.040]   I always wonder where you've been over the week,
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.360]   because you go all over the world.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.400]   But in this case, you were just down the road.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.120]   This whole month, I'm not traveling.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.960]   Oh, that must feel good.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.760]   That's because I'm traveling all over the fall.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.840]   So I had to kind of--
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.320]   Any word on Rwanda?
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.160]   It looks really good.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.920]   So we're working on-- we're trying to finalize the proposal.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.800]   The proposal is-- our little trip to Rwanda
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.560]   is part of a very big proposal.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.960]   So over five years.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.000]   You're doing other stuff there.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.280]   And so we're just trying to finalize all of that.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.360]   We're going back and forth with them almost every day.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.320]   And hopefully we'll know in the next couple weeks.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.720]   And would it be that Twitch spends a week there?
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.160]   Or--
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.680]   That's the game.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.080]   God, that would be so great.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.000]   I mean, it's quite a country.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.320]   Can we go see the gorillas?
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.960]   We are definitely going to go see the gorillas.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.760]   I know it's a hike.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.260]   It's a trek.
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.160]   It's a long way to go.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.920]   But I would really like to see--
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.000]   We're absolutely going to go.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.840]   We're trying to--
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.800]   They have 3G where the gorillas are.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.960]   They have 3G where the gorillas are.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.200]   But we've already talked a live view.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.840]   And they don't have-- we're trying to work out a--
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.800]   It doesn't work with--
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.960]   Well, they don't have a context.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.440]   So I'm working with the Rwanda government--
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.160]   So we could actually stream live from the gorillas in the mist.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.160]   What I'm working on.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.960]   That's what I'm working on.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.920]   Wouldn't that be fantastic?
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.160]   I don't know how possible that is yet.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.000]   But we're doing that research right now.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.680]   Speaking of gorillas in the mist, Andy's the gorilla in the garden.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.680]   Good to see you, Andy, and Akko of the Chicago Sun times.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.480]   Leo Alex always a slice.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.480]   I'm here in the secret garden.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.240]   It is my secret garden.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.720]   This is where he brings young orphans
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.360]   to learn the skills of gardening.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.520]   Well, it takes kids off the streets and into the eats,
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.520]   as we call it.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.480]   They learn organic farming techniques.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.120]   No pesticides, no mountain bioxin, any kind.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.760]   And they come over the full belly.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.160]   There may be a different perception
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.520]   about what their future can be like if they just say no to the rock.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.960]   Off the streets and into the eats.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.280]   I love it.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.480]   I love it.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.960]   Story number one.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.280]   That's what it says on the head.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.640]   Oh, wait.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.720]   Does it really?
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.880]   No, it says Colorado University buffaloes.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.360]   But they're on order.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.280]   And story number one, the federal agents
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.000]   have more than $150,000 in cash when they
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.360]   searched the House of Apple manager Paul Devine earlier
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.880]   this month in shoeboxes.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.800]   Why would you do that?
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.720]   Why?
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.720]   Because you don't trust banks.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.520]   You get a further $20,000 in foreign currency, foreign.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.000]   You never know where you need to break it.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.600]   Could be rubles, could be bots.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.920]   We don't know.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.120]   I'm thinking Chinese money.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.520]   That's where he was working.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.600]   Could be.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:10.560]   And we have identified a significant number of counts
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.720]   overseas and a significant amount of money in those accounts.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.400]   This is the guy who was charged a couple of weeks ago
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.320]   for taking kickbacks from Apple suppliers.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.680]   It turns out to be quite a lucrative profession.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.000]   I'd say so.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.720]   Apple's doing well.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.440]   Who's going to notice?
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.640]   Everyone wants to work with him.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.320]   He's a good position to be in.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.000]   He's the Apple supply manager must transfer
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.200]   the unknown amount of cash held in foreign bank accounts
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.840]   into the US and post it plus $600,000
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.000]   in bail before he can be released according to the judge,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.920]   US District Court for the Northern District of California
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.840]   because he is, they say, a flight risk.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.040]   He pleaded not guilty to the charges last week.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.320]   He's also being sued in civil court by Apple.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.320]   He's in a peck of trouble.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.320]   Yeah, it's not going to work out.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.960]   You know, I think he's the guy who stole the iPhone 2.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.800]   Might as well just throw the book at him.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.920]   He's the one that's been leaking
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.320]   in all these things to Vietnam.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.160]   Mike, and this.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.640]   Yeah, you're supposed to think different,
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.360]   but not quite that different.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.320]   A little too innovative there.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.400]   Outside the box, but inside of prison cell.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.240]   Not good.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.960]   I will follow good journalistic precept
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.240]   and point out that he's only accused.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.440]   And of course, innocent until proven guilty.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.680]   However, his face has been posted on Facebook for all to see.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.960]   No, I just made that up.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.840]   I'm most surprised that any sort of a scam
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.840]   like that would work as well inside Apple because I'm shocked.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.280]   I mean, they're not the sort of company
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.520]   that gives us employees a lot of free hand.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.480]   No, it's kind of amazing that he got away with it.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.520]   I mean, if he had that much money lying around,
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.200]   he must have been doing this a lot.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.040]   Yeah, unless it was a couple.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.240]   Well, I get the impression that especially folks
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.640]   that are over in China figuring out
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.880]   how these things are going to get built
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.120]   are anytime you get into another country
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.000]   that like China or India or other things,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.600]   there's a lot of wheeling and dealing that's going on
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.440]   to get this done.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.520]   It may well be a legal traditional thing to do.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.640]   There.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.480]   Right.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.080]   And I don't know if it's a legal or traditional thing to do,
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.040]   but there is definitely a lot of wheeling and dealing
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.720]   that gets done just in general,
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.400]   not even just not even kickbacks,
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.000]   but just lots of deals that sometimes I think
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.560]   that corporations here in the United States
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.840]   don't want to know about.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.320]   No truth to the rumors that he's the guy
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.800]   who stole my salad, however.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.000]   Well, we're not sure.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.960]   He's a he's in a sense.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.840]   Allegedly, he did not steal my salad.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.160]   Now, here's an interesting note
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.440]   from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.840]   Steve Jobs is watching you.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.880]   This is an interesting interpretation of this Apple patent
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.200]   that would allow Apple to, they say,
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.000]   identify and punish users who take advantage
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.840]   of well, steal iPhones.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.400]   But it does allow you to spy on your customer.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.960]   So the patent provides for a device
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.840]   to investigate a user's identity ostensibly
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.360]   to determine when and if that user is unauthorized.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.160]   In other words, if the phone is stolen,
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.200]   however, how do you feel if you knew your iPhone could,
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.400]   one, take a picture of your face without a flash,
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.200]   any noise or any indication that a picture is being taken
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.760]   to prevent the current user from knowing he's being photographed.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.640]   That's a quote, two, record the user's voice
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.160]   whether or not a phone call is even being made.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.160]   Three, determine the user's unique heartbeat signature.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.760]   Now, there's an application out there
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.000]   that actually will measure your pulse.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.080]   You hold your finger over the camera
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.400]   and somehow it measures your pulse.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.600]   So maybe this isn't, you know,
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.440]   maybe this is something that can do.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.160]   Four, to determine if the device has been hacked, oh, oh.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.520]   The device can watch for a sudden increase in memory usage.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.520]   (both laughing)
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.120]   - I don't have that much RAM.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.520]   (laughs)
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.800]   - You know, five, the user's internet activity
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.040]   can be monitored or any communication packets
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.120]   that are served to the electronic device can be recorded.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.080]   And six, the device could take a photograph
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.340]   of the surrounding location to determine where it is.
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.880]   - And just in case the GPS that can pinpoint
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.520]   the location within three feet is not working, yes.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.040]   - So it's, I don't know if they're planning an app or what?
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.920]   Or, you know, sometimes these packets are meaningless,
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.760]   right?
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.120]   - Well, also it's patent filing,
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.120]   which means that it's just all encompassing of here's
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.840]   everything that we think we'd like to be able to do with this.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.560]   It's, it doesn't even necessarily have to reflect
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.240]   any product that they even technologically feel
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.080]   as though they can build.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.560]   It is one, being sure they own the idea.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.560]   And I think the difference between laughing this off
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.600]   and thinking that this is okay, a sensible thing
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.280]   for an organization to write about
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.400]   is that this is the electronic frontier foundation
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.880]   of their job and their service they provide to the community
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.040]   is to be the people who says,
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.560]   well, what if the worst case scenario comes out?
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.960]   They're, they're not saying that Steve Jobs personally
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.000]   wants to know what brand of underwear you wear by the,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.880]   by virtue of the fact of activating the camera
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.520]   while you've gotten the iPhone in your back pocket.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.720]   But the question as always as they state is,
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.920]   well, even if the phone has the ability to collect this data,
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.240]   just to act as sort of a built in low jack feature.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.400]   So it can find out who is, is this being operated by someone
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.120]   who has this phone been stolen, is it being operated
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.400]   not by its regular user?
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.720]   And can this phone then make that decision independently
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.240]   to stop, to cease functioning and alert the,
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.520]   the mother to his presence?
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.400]   But they're saying that, well, if it can collect this data,
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.720]   who gets to track this data?
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.840]   How long do that, is it collecting this data all the time?
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.640]   And if so, how long is that data being kept and tracked?
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.040]   And who gets control that data?
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.360]   - Well, I think it's a reasonable thing to say, you know,
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.920]   I don't care if my, I don't care that much
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.920]   if my phone gets stolen.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.120]   I don't want it to have those features.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.080]   - But if it, but if it had a feature, let's say that there
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.280]   was no extra option to find my iPhone.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.120]   - Yeah, that's what I was saying.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.000]   - I've lost my iPhone. - Well, there is.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.400]   We have that now.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.000]   - Well, no, what if, what if those next buttons
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.720]   say get my iPhone back?
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.840]   That's why I will, I will authorize you to take the safeties
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.160]   off this phone, collect any data you need to collect.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.640]   - Or what if I say, what if I could log in
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.640]   and get that information?
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.000]   But you know, so I could log into my own iPhone and say,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.600]   hey, I want to know where my camera is right now.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.920]   You know, like, you know, just turn the camera on right now
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.920]   'cause someone took my iPhone.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.760]   - Wait a minute.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.600]   - Let me just.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.440]   (laughing)
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.760]   - The good thing is he's on that.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.040]   - I don't know what that's, where that snout is coming from.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.720]   - Where is that sound coming from?
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.800]   - I don't know, but it was scary.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.040]   I think it was daring fireball.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.880]   I launched something in dairy fireball.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.880]   So this, this, this is a application that currently is on
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.800]   my iPhone and is on many people's iPhones.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.360]   You can download it if you have an iPhone.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.560]   There's my daughter's iPhone, my son's iPhone,
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.200]   my wife's iPhone, my iPad, my iPhone.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.960]   It, it locates where it is.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.360]   Isn't that sufficient?
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.840]   It could also, what are you laughing at?
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.680]   It could also--
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.480]   - No, no, I just, I just got an idea for an extra $5 per month
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.240]   mobile me feature where if you suspect that your wife is,
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.880]   is having an affair with your tennis instructor,
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.640]   you could say, alert me whenever her iPhone is within three
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.000]   feet of my, my tennis instructor's iPhone.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.640]   (laughing)
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.520]   - Wouldn't be such a, you know, I mean, these all have to be.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.360]   - Well, but I think--
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.960]   - And I think, I could display a message or play a sound.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.000]   I can remotely lock it or I can remotely wipe it.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.400]   I mean, and this is exactly where I am, by the way.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.840]   I mean, it's down to the few feet because of the GPS.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.080]   - I was playing with it last weekend.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.440]   It's just, it's really interesting to find out that yes,
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.640]   it got, it got the wrong side of the street,
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.360]   but definitely got exactly where it was.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.760]   - So we already have that.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.600]   What do we need?
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.960]   - Well, but because that's just, I think people understand
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.240]   that GPS is GPS and people also understand that this is
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.440]   something that I myself have control over at a Macivating.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.600]   They don't understand, they don't understand that in general,
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.400]   law enforcement has the ability to access this sort of data
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.680]   if they want it and if they work with a compliant service
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.120]   carrier, the difference is that I think this is the first time
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.080]   we've seen a patent application that said,
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.720]   "Here's everything that we think we can do with all the hardware
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.200]   "that's built into a phone to identify the user
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.800]   "and locate the exact device and decide,
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.680]   "is the does this person have authority to use it?"
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.240]   - And Chiro is pointing out quite rightly
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.080]   that this is just a patent application.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.920]   - Right, exactly.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.960]   - Apple, you know, there was a lot of talk this weekend
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.000]   about the iMac with touch built-in transformer print.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.560]   - Yeah, I mean, it's normal to patent everything you can
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.240]   to protect it, but I don't see an advantage to patenting this
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.160]   unless you really think you might wanna implement it.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.160]   And let me just ask you, I mean, Alex,
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.840]   would you buy a phone that had that capability?
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.160]   - I probably would, actually.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.280]   At first when I saw it, I was like,
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.560]   "Oh, I wouldn't even wanna have a phone that could do this."
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.800]   But the reality is, is that most phones
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.040]   could be hacked to do this anyway.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.160]   You know, you could build a hack if you wanted to
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.480]   to do this.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.200]   Number two is I think that this patent has more to do
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.360]   with what Andy was talking about,
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.840]   which is allow an extension to find my phone
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.120]   than it is for Apple to have a central control over it.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:39.120]   I think maybe dealing with people who are jail-breaking
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.920]   their phones might be a minor piece of this,
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.920]   but I don't think it's the major part.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.320]   I think that it's really someone takes your phone
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.600]   and you're able to, 'cause there's one thing about
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.760]   having GPS information, but if you wanna build a case
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.040]   on theft, you know, being able to turn the microphone on
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.120]   and the video on and be able to see who this person is,
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.600]   who's got it, is gonna put them in jail much quicker
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.920]   than just knowing where the GPS location of the phone is.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.680]   - Okay, so maybe it's for enterprise purposes,
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.920]   maybe it's for government, maybe it's just a defensive patent,
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.440]   maybe Apple, I mean, let's look at the other side of it,
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.120]   maybe Apple just doesn't want anybody else to do this,
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.120]   so they're gonna patent it.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.440]   - Right, I mean, there's a tech test.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.480]   - I mean, you can imagine if, you know, in some countries,
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.040]   not in, you know, for instance,
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.480]   kidnapping is something that is a pretty, you know,
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.320]   relative to a common thing. - True, true.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.280]   - That's a pretty common thing, yeah.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.880]   - If you had an iPhone that was able to do this
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.200]   and someone was able to hit one button
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.240]   and suddenly just starts, you know, exporting that,
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.960]   or if someone else could do that remotely
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.040]   when they find out, you know, that could help a lot
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.520]   in tracking you back down again.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.760]   So there's, I think there's a lot of advantages,
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.600]   obviously there's huge security concerns
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.680]   that would have to be addressed.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.640]   I think that there's a little bit of common sense
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.280]   inside of the fact that if Apple abused this,
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.520]   it'd be the end of the iPhone.
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.520]   - Andy, would you buy a phone that had this capability?
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.600]   - If it were marketed to me as a feature,
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.920]   where if the phone's stolen, this will help you get it back
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.480]   and I've full control of it,
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.360]   this is essentially a box that's locked up inside the phone
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.960]   that only I can unlock and let those features be activated.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.600]   Then sure, partly that's because I'm already all too aware
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.720]   that anytime that I use the internet in any way, shape,
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.320]   or form, unless I'm gonna manage my cookies,
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.120]   so in such a fine-tuned way to turn off the decline,
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.920]   every single cookie that comes in,
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.840]   I can't be on the internet for more than 20 minutes
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.360]   before I have given up so much personal information
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.960]   about who I am and what I do,
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.960]   that it's just futile to worry about the possibilities
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.880]   of a company remote activating a phone
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.720]   to turn on the microphone,
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.720]   especially when there's such a non-benefit
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.960]   to them using this as a way of customer surveillance.
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.800]   - But you would never know, that's the beauty of it.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:44.200]   It's like this high school in Lower Meridian in Pennsylvania.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.480]   - You'd never know.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.120]   - It's also a thing that can also be done
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.680]   with many, many other phones.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.080]   Again, if law enforcement wants to know where a phone is,
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.320]   if law enforcement wants to turn on a microphone remotely,
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.440]   it is possible on many phones for them to do that.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.240]   - Really? - So, right.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.800]   - Well, and I think that we, now I wanna throw away my phone.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.520]   - Well, I mean, I think that I'm scared.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.360]   I don't like that.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.440]   I'm not saying that it's a point-and-click sort of thing,
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.840]   but if a person is of sufficient,
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:18.720]   a person I need to navigate the margin between things
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.200]   that I know for things that I've been told,
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.400]   things I can't talk about,
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.880]   and things that I know and can talk about
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.600]   and fully understand.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.840]   This is one of those areas.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.800]   But when a person is of sufficient importance
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.240]   to law enforcement, it is possible to get that kind of a warrant
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.280]   and that kind of approval.
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.880]   It's not the sort of thing we're just some guy
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.920]   and some suburban police department can click a button
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.480]   on some Windows app and get that sort of surveillance.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.120]   But it is possible with cooperation through the carrier
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.160]   to make that happen.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.400]   - And we know how hard carriers make it
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.520]   for the federal government to access anything personal.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:56.920]   So in effect, 'cause in the past, the wiretap laws
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.920]   where you had to get a warrant
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.760]   and what you could do was listen in on phone calls
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.120]   and there were some strict rules about what you could do
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.000]   while listening on those phone calls.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.760]   I know this from watching the Sopranos.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.360]   If it becomes a personal call,
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.600]   they have to hang up for 30 seconds and let, right?
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.680]   (laughing)
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.400]   That's what it said in the Sopranos.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.160]   Okay, anyway, let's assume it.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.320]   Either way, it doesn't matter.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.440]   But now I'm carrying, it's not just my calls.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.960]   I'm carrying a bugging device with me at all times
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.960]   with a camera.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.800]   - Like I guess I'd argue that we already are.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.040]   - Well, I know I am.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.040]   - And that's what Andy's saying.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:26.880]   - Yeah, it's in.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.680]   - No, but I'm saying that the chances,
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.920]   the chances that it's hard to phrase it.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.760]   - I understand, you're hypothesizing it.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.600]   - Well, no, I'm saying that the level at which
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.560]   that feature would be, have that quote feature, unquote,
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.080]   would be enabled on a phone with my, up my knowing it.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.560]   Would be so bizarre and so impossible to think about.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.200]   That, and the amount of safeguards
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.360]   that would have to be put into the device
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.280]   to ensure that that could never possibly happen,
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.160]   would so hinder the other operations of the device.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.880]   That's not something that I really worry about.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:02.440]   I mean, right now, my home has windows that let light in
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.960]   and also let light out.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.840]   And that is an invasion of my privacy.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.800]   And someone wants to set up shop, you know,
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.360]   a block away with a parabolic microphone and a telescope.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.800]   They can see what I'm doing.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.440]   I feel as though the advantages of having natural lighting
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.280]   and being able to see out of my house,
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.360]   outweigh the risk to my security.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.760]   - This is a little more than a parabolic microphone
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.600]   in the camera though, Andy.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.040]   Let's face it, you carry this everywhere.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:24.880]   You got in the bathroom.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.720]   - No, all of it.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:30.000]   Anybody with $120 for the credit on their MasterCard
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   can buy the equipment to spy on me inside my house
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.680]   legally from the street.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.640]   Whereas the ability to turn on that microphone is so difficult.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.480]   - You need the device recorded.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.320]   - Right.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.600]   - I mean, it's not something you actually have to be.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.440]   I make it happen.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.480]   - Mine hummus or something to really trigger that kind of,
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.400]   we're highly protected.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.520]   - I don't, you'll forgive me if I don't fully trust
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.800]   the US government after the Patriot Act.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.360]   - Okay, but yeah, there's what can be done
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.520]   and what is rational to believe would ever be done.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.320]   Right now we're looking at as a patent filing
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.680]   in which Apple has outlined various technologies
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.480]   that they can use to exploit the features
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.120]   inside your existing phone to identify the user
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.080]   and possibly remote disable it.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.200]   That's all we have right now.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.200]   - And with a lot of these corporations.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.040]   - It's gonna,
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.120]   I was gonna say with either Apple or IBM or Microsoft,
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.280]   a lot of times a lot of these patents are protective
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.760]   as you were talking about earlier.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.760]   It's anything that you can think up right now.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.960]   You don't even know if you're gonna use it.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.560]   You just patent it so that no one else patents.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.520]   It's so that you can, you have that freedom
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.480]   because you may think of something that is not
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.640]   even related to this patent,
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.160]   but it touches on this patent
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.240]   and you don't want somebody else to patent that idea.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.960]   - Which is why we don't often don't report
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.920]   on these Apple patents like the 27 inch touchscreen.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.480]   - Although I think that one's really cool.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.320]   - Yeah.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.560]   - That's off that really great site,
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.560]   - Patently Apple.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.400]   - Yeah, Patently Apple.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.800]   - And it's both, it'll both show you the alpha
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.080]   and the Omega of Apple patents where you see things
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.240]   where you can then sort of connect the dots later on
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.720]   and figure out that, yeah, that's exactly what they're
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.600]   working on for the iPad.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.400]   But then you also see things like,
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.720]   and a patent for an idea of a special kind of display
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.800]   that can actually, it's actually that the parts
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.080]   of display can actually raise themselves up to form buttons
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.460]   and form active controls while still remaining
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.120]   full display characteristics and full touch interaction
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.640]   characteristics, but yet they're now they're raised bumps
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.360]   that form a keypad or a keyboard.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.840]   And you wonder, well, I'm not aware of any sort
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.440]   of technology that would make this work,
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.240]   but clearly somebody had this idea,
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.560]   thought that, well, maybe the system's quite so far off,
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.880]   but maybe we should, it would cost us, you know,
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.400]   six pack of beer in an afternoon
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.600]   following our paperwork to get a patent on this.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.440]   Let's get the patent.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.360]   - Yeah, yeah, you can't blame it for that.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.040]   All right, I'm sorry, I guess I should have known
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.200]   that this has all been capable.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.540]   I've gone from being mildly worried about an Apple patent
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.820]   to complete terror that the government could do this
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.100]   anytime anywhere, all they needed to see.
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:47.940]   - Like a new acceles, Leah.
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.300]   - Yeah, really.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.220]   Oh my God.
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.380]   - Okay, well, you know, it isn't really.
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.020]   - There's just something to be said for someone who says
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.740]   that the government can't do anything
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:00.860]   without totally screwing it up.
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.260]   And that's why we can't let them be involved
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.500]   with healthcare, but yet they think that they're capable
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.020]   of running such a mind-ew precise spiring to figure out
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.920]   that, well, Andy's paid eight cents too much
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.640]   for Charmin this week.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.820]   He should have known it was on special
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.560]   at the Shaw's market right up the street.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.960]   - No, I love an ineffective government.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.000]   I love me that.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:19.840]   That's good.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.280]   You don't want the government to be effective.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.240]   When governments are effective, it's always bad.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.320]   So, you know, I always remind myself
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.760]   when I watch the legislative process
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.760]   and see how badly flawed it is that that's better
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.960]   than the alternative, which is an effective legislative process.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.440]   - I've always had the opinion that if the either
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.680]   the Republicans or the Democrats were in complete control,
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.620]   like pass whatever they wanted for 12 years straight,
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.940]   the country would fall into revolution.
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.340]   - And there are those who would like that.
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.460]   - Yeah, I'm just saying that both sides, you know,
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.180]   it's the tension there.
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.140]   - They're all very important.
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:54.500]   - So this is the masterful irony of ironies.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:59.420]   Brian Lamb of Gizmodo, the editor who got the iPhone 4,
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.380]   the stolen iPhone 4 or lost iPhone 4,
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.260]   lost his phone the other day.
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.780]   He tweeted, left my phone at lunch.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:08.500]   Lady turned it in.
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.220]   Good thing we were nice earlier and gave her the jail.
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.120]   She had, chair, she has for karma.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:18.420]   - Without any sense of irony at all, Brian Lamb of sweet.
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.060]   Nothing like boy, it's a good thing that didn't happen
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.600]   at the Hofbroul hut.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.100]   (laughing)
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.100]   Holy cow.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:26.940]   - I know.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.020]   - It's like, I know.
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.340]   - And by the way, immediately after he tweeted that
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.500]   and he locked his Twitter account.
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.020]   - Yeah, 'cause I'm sure everyone went.
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.660]   - Oopsies.
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.860]   - Oopsies.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.660]   It would have been funny if the lady kept the iPhone
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.100]   and sold it to the highest bidder.
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.380]   - With all the contacts and information and everything else.
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:47.220]   - Or she should have sold it to Apple for $5,000.
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.060]   (laughing)
[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:49.300]   - Steve Jobs would have known what to do with it.
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.140]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:50.980]   - I'll trade.
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.380]   (laughing)
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.020]   - All right, we're gonna take a break,
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.380]   come back with more great guests
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.860]   or Andy and Ico from the Chicago Sun Times
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:03.860]   and his website, the Celestial Wish to Band with C-W-O-B.com.
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.380]   And Alex Lindsey of the Pixelcore at Pixelcore.com,
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.860]   the great guild of multimedia artists.
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:10.780]   Before I go much farther,
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.460]   I wanna talk about Go To Meeting.
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.500]   We were talking before the show about meeting,
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.180]   you said you're using it more and more.
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.020]   - Like crazy.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:17.860]   Like crazy.
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.140]   There was some kind of breaking point
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.780]   where I was supposed to be down in LA last week
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.020]   and I just said, you know, we're just gonna do this
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:24.860]   on Go To Me.
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:25.700]   Like I'm knocking out.
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.940]   - You want some irony?
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.220]   I met with Citrix in LA and I'm on the plane.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.540]   Somebody tweets me, what the hell are you doing?
[00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.380]   Flying to LA?
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.740]   You should have had a Go To Meeting.
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:34.740]   Right, right.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:35.580]   - Right.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:36.660]   - And it's gotten so good.
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.700]   We're using both Go To Meeting and Go To Seminole.
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.780]   And so the, and-
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:40.620]   - Go To Webinar.
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.460]   - Yeah.
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.300]   - Or Go To Webinar.
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.420]   And it is, and both of them, I mean, it's just so easy.
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.740]   And we were having a Skype meeting
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.380]   and the Skype was constantly breaking
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.660]   and wasn't working and everything else.
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.780]   And we were like, you know, let's just move this over
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.460]   to Go To Meeting and BAM, everything is clicking
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.340]   and we're able to show our desktops and talk
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.220]   and it's super clear and we're gonna be running
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.780]   a lot of our training in Africa from San Francisco.
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:02.620]   - Really?
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.820]   - Over Go To Meeting, yeah.
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.500]   - So you'll be in Africa, there's enough bandwidth
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.340]   to do that from Rwanda?
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.540]   - Well, Rwanda has got fiber going in.
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.820]   So the connection, the location that we're,
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:13.020]   if this all happens and the proposal goes through,
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.420]   they'll have 50 megabit connection there.
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.220]   So we'll be able to sit there and log onto their computers
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.500]   and talk to the students about what they're doing
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.340]   and everything else.
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:24.180]   And this is a huge, you know, future of just not having
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:25.500]   to not having to leave home.
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.580]   - I love it.
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.420]   - Yeah.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.140]   - When I was in LA, I don't know how they conned me into it.
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.780]   They have a series of Go To Meeting ads
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:36.740]   where you can see people like from the chest up
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.180]   and they look like they're naked saying,
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.380]   "I'm having a Go To Meeting right now."
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.060]   Like the idea being you never have to get dressed
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.780]   to go to a meeting, they talked me out of my clothes.
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.460]   I thought that only happened in LA
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.900]   just to lovely young women.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.140]   I, they said, "Just one more button, Leah.
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.340]   I'm not kidding, I did one."
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.780]   And it's gonna show up on a webpage at some point
[00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:53.780]   where it looks like I'm naked.
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.580]   In fact, what they had me do is take off my shirt
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.420]   and roll up my trousers and they said,
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.940]   "Don't worry, there'll be a big banner in the middle."
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.620]   And you'll walk off and it'll look like
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.540]   you're not wearing anything.
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.500]   The things I do--
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.340]   - And they've got it all figured out.
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.020]   Obviously they've done this many times before.
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.500]   - Yeah, it's a green screen.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.020]   So the things I'll do for a sponsor I love, I'll tell you.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.620]   Go To Meeting, they've saved me enough time,
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:17.100]   I guess it's worth disrobing for a commercial.
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.940]   I won't do it now though.
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.420]   If you've ever been on a conference call
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.100]   that just dragged on and on and on
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.660]   'cause there was nothing to look at.
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.380]   You couldn't see the spreadsheets
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.580]   or the keynote presentation.
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.140]   You just were sitting there in space
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.380]   looking at your Facebook page.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.820]   That's where Go To Meeting can help.
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.020]   Keeps everybody on the same page
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.660]   and it's not Facebook during,
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.940]   unless you're talking about Facebook,
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.260]   then it would be.
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.340]   What happens is you start a Go To Meeting.
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.060]   You could do it ahead of time,
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.380]   send out an email invitation
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.980]   or you can even do it while you're on the conference call.
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.980]   You tell everybody on the call,
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.380]   go to the website, go to meeting.com.
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.620]   And here's a meeting ID.
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:51.700]   As soon as they enter it in,
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:52.980]   even if they don't have the software installed,
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.300]   the software takes about 30 seconds,
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.140]   it'll be on their system,
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:57.180]   then they'll see your computer.
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.940]   Up to 15 people at once, even better,
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.140]   if they have something they wanna show you now,
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:03.500]   they can just say, well, let me show you this
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.180]   and they take control of the meeting.
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.260]   And you can control their computer.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.420]   And you can control their computer.
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.180]   You could collaborate.
[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.660]   You could both control the computer at the same time.
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.860]   It's really cool for sales, for product,
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.980]   demos, training sessions, collaborating.
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.060]   Any kind of conference call.
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.100]   Stop the deadly boring conference call
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.500]   and start having Go To Meetings instead.
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.740]   Now you can do it free for 30 days
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.540]   by going to go to meeting.com/makbreak.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:30.540]   30 days of unlimited meetings, go to meeting.com/makbreak,
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.740]   those great folks at Citrix.
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.540]   Yes, I'll take off my pants for them.
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.900]   Thank them for their support.
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.780]   That's pretty much, that's a demonstration of my devotion.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:41.940]   There it is.
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:42.780]   Right there.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.420]   Go to meeting, I take off my pants for them.
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.780]   I don't know what they're gonna use as tagline.
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.940]   It's something like, I'm having a meeting right now.
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.540]   I don't know, I don't know what they're gonna do with it.
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:52.380]   I'm scared.
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.380]   A full meeting.
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:54.340]   The full meeting.
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.420]   That's what I think that's what I said.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:59.460]   I said, something like, it's such a freeing.
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.300]   (laughing)
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:07.300]   Oh dear, so the guy in charge of the Apple App Store,
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.700]   his name is Philip Shoemaker,
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.220]   but that, all he's making, apparently he's also making
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:17.980]   fart and urination applications for the iPhone.
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:18.820]   - Mind.
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.100]   - He sells his own iPhone apps under the company name,
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:26.100]   Grey Noodle, such classics as Animal Farts.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.380]   Go ahead and download it.
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:32.300]   And the urination simulator, I Wiz.
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.700]   Why would you, I don't, I must, anyway.
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:39.060]   - Most people get the hang of that after what, three years?
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.820]   - What do you need a simulator for?
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.900]   - Exactly, I mean, it's possible to put too much
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.260]   of your life on your iPhone.
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:48.460]   - So now he says, oh no, I made all those apps before
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.020]   I came to work for Apple.
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.260]   And that's how he got his job.
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.660]   That's how he got the job.
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.500]   - No, Apple employees are forbidden from selling
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.140]   their own apps on the App Store.
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:02.340]   And Apple's spokeswoman told Wired Magazine
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.740]   that broke this story.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.500]   Shoemaker's apps were published before he started
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.860]   at the Apple, but several including I,
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.460]   Wiz were placed on the App Store after he began his job
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.100]   in March.
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.420]   Philip's apps were written, submitted, and approved
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:17.620]   before he became an Apple employee, just before, apparently.
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.140]   His experience and perspective as a developer
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.020]   is one of the valuable things he brings
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.740]   to the Apple Developer Relations team.
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.220]   There's a screenshot.
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.340]   This is really what Apple, this is the kind of expertise
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.220]   Apple was looking for.
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.300]   This is from the Bandapudu.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.980]   This is from the Eye Animal Farts.
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.820]   You can fart, poop, drop, or whiz.
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.460]   He's apparently a little obsessed
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.820]   with the bathroom humor now.
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.820]   He probably made a lot of money.
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.260]   You know, that's, you know, I mean, they must have known,
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.100]   right?
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.660]   That must have been on his resume.
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.220]   Yes, I created such applications as Eye Wiz and Animal Farts.
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.300]   He has also, this is gonna be the new thing
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.260]   that everybody does, deleted his Twitter account.
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.580]   This is like, I'm getting rid of it.
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:02.940]   It's like, that's the--
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:03.780]   I don't wanna talk anymore.
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.620]   I don't wanna talk about it.
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.740]   It's the new no comment.
[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.620]   La la la la la la.
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.620]   He's also deleted his LinkedIn account,
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:14.340]   both of which led Wired to discover this.
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.660]   And the tech bloggers now are having a great time.
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:20.060]   The Valley WAG found that Shoemaker was following at least
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:23.180]   on his Twitter account, 16 porn stars and escorts.
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:27.020]   I hope, I maybe should delete my Twitter account.
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.300]   I know, I'm like, I think I gotta go through
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.420]   my Google Reader account.
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.140]   Isn't this the new, this is, I mean, forget the camera
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:36.420]   in your phone, you got Google Reader and Twitter.
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:41.100]   I'm just, no, I'm not, I don't think I'm doing anything freaky,
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.860]   but you know what?
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.860]   I would like to point out that in his defense,
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.140]   his account was set up to follow anybody who followed him.
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.060]   There you go.
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:51.900]   So he--
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:52.740]   And the stars were following him.
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.540]   The start, the porn stars, they found out
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:55.900]   he was the guy behind--
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:56.740]   I was.
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.580]   I was--
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:58.420]   They're like, I wanna follow that guy.
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.060]   This is the guy I gotta follow.
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.020]   The I was app, according to the Gray Noodle website,
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:04.860]   let's users make a nonstop urination sound.
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:06.620]   So that's good, you know.
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.500]   I know, I can get it, I get it, I'm not a prude,
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.740]   I get it, you go in the bathroom,
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:12.060]   your buddies are playing poker,
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.380]   you turn on the application and you let it go for 10 minutes.
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.900]   And they're starting to--
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:17.740]   (chuckles)
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.860]   Wait, I didn't, did he have a lot of--
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.300]   I just don't know if it'd be loud enough.
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.380]   No.
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.540]   You'd have to have a speaker in there.
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:24.700]   You'd have to set up some speakers
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.020]   or are you, where you let it--
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:27.460]   (laughs)
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.900]   But you know, if you're at one of those Starbucks
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.020]   where they keep, they won't, they won't,
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.020]   they won't let you set up like at a table like all day
[00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:35.660]   unless you buy something.
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.620]   If you just, you know, find a stall,
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.460]   get the sound going, you know, for like four, five, six hours,
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.020]   no one's gonna come in on you.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.100]   Just give them a little like you,
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.700]   oh, it's like those Japanese toilets
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.500]   that make the running waters.
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.940]   You got one of those little portable speakers
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:50.780]   that, you know, those little ones
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.660]   that kind of pop open with a little base.
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.140]   You probably could put those right against the door
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.580]   and just turn it on and then people would
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.780]   think you were in there.
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.620]   I finally got to think creatively.
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.500]   I finally got to use one of those toilets
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.380]   when I was back east.
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:02.580]   We stayed at bed and breakfast.
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:03.420]   I had one of the--
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.340]   Japanese badeys?
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:09.100]   Yeah, I was like, I sign those in there and tries it.
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.540]   I don't know if I should say this.
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.540]   He says, I just got my butthole detailed.
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:17.980]   And he loved it, didn't he?
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.180]   You kept going to the bathroom.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.860]   We don't have a show title.
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.060]   No, I don't think so.
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.940]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.740]   Oh, God, already from the other room.
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.780]   From the other room, did you hear that?
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.900]   I'm just telling you.
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.420]   Lisa, my CEO said Leo.
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.500]   I'm getting, I'm getting, I, I,
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.580]   I just called attrition to have an outlet.
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.420]   Are you gonna have one?
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.100]   Oh, yeah, I'm adding one.
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.540]   It blows hot air at you.
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.460]   It has different, it has pulsing oscillating.
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.540]   I think we see Japan.
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.580]   And by the time I got back, I was pretty addicted to,
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.220]   you know, technology.
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:56.780]   That's all I gotta say.
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.260]   This part wasn't in the show notes.
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.100]   I'm not prepared to become stuff.
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:30:59.940]   It's not in the show notes.
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:00.900]   It's not in the show notes.
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.820]   We've gone off script badly.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.740]   But just think your iPhone could control it.
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.100]   See, I thought you'd bring it back into the,
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.980]   you know, just think of the nots.
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:08.900]   Oh, I didn't think of that.
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.900]   There's an app for that.
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:10.740]   There is an app for that.
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:12.340]   Maybe this guy Shoemaker has a future,
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.100]   ever. Exactly.
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.620]   Yeah, after his job, it is now probably going to end.
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.500]   Do you think, though, Apple won't let go?
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.940]   Let's go to, let's go to the patent search now.
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:21.780]   Exactly.
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:26.060]   I wanna see one of those like outline diagrams of usage that
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:28.780]   all right, rumors are coming in from Mac news network.
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:34.580]   Just came in five days ago, so it's exactly not exactly pouring in.
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:39.380]   The option of a contract free iPhone in the US has vanished
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:41.900]   from the Apple and AT&T websites previously.
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:42.980]   I didn't even know you could do this.
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:47.580]   You could buy an iPhone if you were willing to pay $699 for the 32 gig
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:50.100]   or $599 for the 16 gig without a contract.
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:55.180]   Apple now says all US iPhones require a two year AT&T contract.
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.700]   I think I really think that that has to do with Verizon
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:00.260]   coming in next year.
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.460]   And AT&T wanted to make sure that they lock in as many people as
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.380]   they can to two years.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.420]   AT&T says, "No, you could still do that."
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.380]   Oh, they did?
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.060]   Yeah, so it's kind of a stiffer.
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.060]   I'm actually regretting I even brought it up.
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:15.420]   Do we are all in agreement, though, the January Verizon iPhone?
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.700]   Highly likely, better than the 50% likely.
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.540]   What do you think, Andy?
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:21.300]   You'd probably even know, so if you wanted to accuse yourself.
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:26.660]   As usual, I will believe, I'm not doubting this.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.460]   I'm just saying that we've had so many false rumors about
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:33.100]   Verizon phones, although I will say that this looks better
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.780]   than any other rumor that I don't believe.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:38.580]   You have seen the boy Genius report, man,
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:40.300]   these guys are really on top of this stuff.
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:46.980]   You have seen their dump of field testing.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:51.900]   What happens is they take these new devices and they field test them.
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:55.460]   We know this because that's how the gizmodo phone got out in the wild.
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:00.620]   We've seen field test reports that there are some new Apple devices
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:04.260]   being tested now, including an unknown device.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.700]   We'll get to that in a minute.
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.940]   Then a boy Genius report had this story way down deep with an iOS 4
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.420]   and intriguing block of code.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.420]   Look at this. They disassembled this thing.
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.420]   This is assembly language.
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:22.180]   Our source says the code queries device.
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:27.460]   If the device is either a CDMA phone or something called an iPad,
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:32.620]   actually they call it I-Prod 2, which is the code for iPad,
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:37.140]   the device will auto-activate bypassing the need for iTunes.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.980]   We're told this block of code has appeared every year consecutively
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.980]   right before a major iPhone device release,
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.780]   released and then removed after launch.
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:48.540]   So it allows products to be field tested by carriers or partners
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:51.420]   without having to activate.
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.100]   So there's the signs. These are the signs.
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:56.700]   These are the little little little little tenors that happen.
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:00.900]   The dogs barking, the cows leaving the field that happened right before.
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.700]   Something big.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:08.740]   And this is for those who want to believe.
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:12.340]   You know, the thing is, remember, we had these rumors that Apple was running
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:15.900]   OS 10 on Windows platforms for years.
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.980]   You know, they kept on coming up that they're practicing for years.
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.220]   They're doing them for years and they're like, oh, well, this is never going to happen.
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:22.500]   But Apple definitely likes to keep its options open.
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.180]   I think even if they even if they don't have any agreement to move to Verizon,
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:28.580]   they would make sure that the phones were working on CDMA so that at any moment,
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:29.580]   they could move.
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:32.220]   I think it doesn't necessarily say they're going to,
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:34.460]   but I think that they're always going to keep those options open.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.180]   Yeah, I agree with that.
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:40.100]   The number of products that Apple has built but hasn't let out of the barn
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.700]   is but would fill the barn.
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:42.700]   So, right.
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:49.300]   According to analyst Charlie, Wolf, Max sales way up in business.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.300]   This is good.
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.980]   This is always a good sign when Apple can say we're not only selling to consumers
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:58.860]   and schools, but shipments to government grew 200% last quarter,
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:04.500]   16 times faster than the tepid 12% growth the rest of the market is seeing.
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:10.220]   And apparently a good amount of that is government is a federal government.
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:14.940]   In other words, Obama likes Max.
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:16.940]   I think he likes his blackberry though.
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.780]   I don't know if it has anything to worry about.
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.780]   But his blackberry, you can't turn the camera microphone on.
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.780]   I'm just thinking.
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:26.620]   Well, that's the whole thing with blackberry is that they're pretty careful about
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.340]   who gets access to the, well, at least to the texting.
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:30.780]   Isn't that the big issue?
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:31.780]   Yeah.
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.620]   In Saudi Arabia and UAE.
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:34.140]   That's right.
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.820]   That's why blackberry actually gave source code to India and will do so,
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:38.860]   I'm sure, to these other countries.
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:43.780]   Now, here's the question is, are they giving them source code or are those...
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:46.860]   You know, they said we've come to some kind of agreement, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:47.860]   And I'm not totally clear.
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:48.860]   India, they did give source code to you.
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:49.860]   Did they?
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:50.860]   UAE, I don't know what they...
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:51.860]   It sounded like they all said...
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:56.340]   To me, when I saw the way that they talked around what actually happened,
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:01.500]   it kind of sounded to me like blackberry agreed to allow the countries to say they've come
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.300]   to an agreement so they can say face and make people feel like they're out there somewhere,
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.140]   but blackberry wasn't going to actually...
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.420]   Then they could go back to the US government and say, "No, no, no, we're not."
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.740]   Something's going on.
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:12.740]   There's something.
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.300]   They want to be in those markets, right?
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:20.540]   They do, but I think that's a huge selling point for a lot of government and corporations
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:23.580]   is to have that super secure solution.
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.820]   They take that away and I don't know if blackberry has any future anyway.
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.220]   The storm, or what is it?
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.220]   Not the storm.
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.220]   The torch is a flame out.
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.220]   Did you ever get a torch handy?
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.100]   Did you ever look at it?
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.580]   No.
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:38.220]   Blackberry isn't really on my map right now.
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.620]   It's on the list of things I will take a look at to see if I can get interested in blackberry
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:42.620]   again.
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.940]   But it's just not a consumer phone.
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:49.100]   I think that blackberry has really given up the idea of developing consumer devices.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:53.500]   I feel that to be fair, I should review the new Windows Mobile 7 when it comes out and
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.620]   the blackberry is the same as when it comes out.
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:37:00.260]   I'm definitely reviewing the Windows Mobile 7 phone because that's a really, really interesting
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.260]   device.
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.260]   I agree.
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:03.740]   I knew you were getting the hands on it.
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.340]   Well, let us know when you can to talk about it.
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.340]   It's in the wild.
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:11.100]   In fact, Paul Therod has, when he's talked about it quite a bit, he's got either Samsung
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.060]   or an LG Windows 7 developer version, Mobile 7.
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.780]   But yeah, it sounds pretty cool.
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:23.940]   Does not sound like it's going to kick Apple or Android off the birch, but it sounds pretty
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:24.940]   cool.
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:29.180]   What I like about it is that from what I've seen, I've used one for about 30 minutes.
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:33.380]   I don't have much experience with it, but it really looks like they're the first ones
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:38.580]   that are not trying emphatically to go after the iPhone, where they're trying to decide
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:40.540]   what is iPhone and Android not.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.140]   What are they not doing very, very well?
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.020]   How can we do that better?
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:48.980]   And it really is the first 2011 looking interface that I've seen.
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:53.460]   It makes the iPhones interface look a little bit chinsie.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:54.460]   And that's an amazing thing to say.
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:58.140]   I'm not sure if it's as flexible as the iPhones interface because the iPhones designed to not
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.380]   only make phone calls, but also be a really robust app platform.
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:05.300]   But there are so many things about the way that the Windows 7 works that I instinctively
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:09.460]   said, "Ooh, it'd be nice to have that on an iPhone."
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:15.100]   If I had the ability to pin things to the margin like that, I'd use the hell on that
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:16.100]   feature.
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:20.980]   I still think it's a two-worse race now.
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.740]   I'm going to get email all for the next week saying, "You shouldn't actually have somebody
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:27.020]   who's tried Windows on the Mac break show."
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:29.300]   It's just not okay.
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.100]   I still think now it's a solid race.
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:36.820]   It's a neck-and-neck race, but I think it really is this between Android and the iPhone.
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.820]   I don't think so.
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:43.700]   Android is already starting to lap iPhone, which is fine.
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:44.700]   Nobody cares.
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:45.700]   Apple...
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.740]   Well, I mean, I know Apple would love to be number one, but look, Apple's been very happy
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:52.100]   chugging along with Macintosh, making very nice margins.
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.100]   Thank you.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:57.660]   4% of the market means a virus attacks are non-existent.
[00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:02.340]   I think we're going to start seeing lots of attacks on the cell phone platforms very soon.
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.780]   Unfortunately, the iPhone will be the number one target right now.
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:06.780]   I think Apple's probably going, "Come on, Android.
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:07.780]   Come on, Android.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:08.780]   Come on, Android."
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:13.260]   Now, I want to talk about that because there was some debate.
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:17.660]   TechCrunch accused Apple of causing this iTunes flaw.
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.780]   John Gruber says, "It ain't that way."
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:23.540]   John Pichowski in All Things Digital says, "No, no, no.
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:25.700]   We'll get the story in just a bit before we do, though.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:26.700]   Take a break.
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:27.700]   Smoke them if you got them."
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:33.300]   Because it's time to talk a little bit about our good friends at gobonite.com.
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:38.100]   But just the other day, checked my carbonite account.
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.180]   Don't tell Abby this.
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:44.700]   The reason I check it is because I put carbonite on her laptop that she took to college.
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:47.420]   I just want to make sure it's backing up.
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.420]   It is.
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:51.340]   One of the things I really like about carbonite, by the way, Mac or Windows, let me just tell
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:53.660]   you what it is first and I'll tell you why I like this.
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:56.980]   It is an automatic backup solution you put on your computer.
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.060]   It's unlimited backup.
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:01.020]   All the personal files on your internal drive are great for a laptop, for instance, or
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:08.580]   an iMac, for less than $0.15 a day, $0.55 a year.
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:10.220]   It's to the cloud.
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:14.300]   It's no matter even if your house burned down or you lost your laptop and the backups or
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.780]   whatever, you'd still have that data available to you.
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:20.380]   AES-256, BitIncription, SSL, all the buzzwords.
[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:22.580]   This is a really good solution.
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:23.660]   Great for a laptop.
[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.100]   They do get stolen.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.700]   Really great for a college kid's laptop because I put it on there.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.700]   Abby knows it's there.
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:29.700]   I didn't sneak it on there.
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.660]   She doesn't have to think about it.
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:33.940]   She doesn't have to think, "Do I have a backup solution?"
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:37.660]   As I'm writing this paper, do I have to worry about losing it?
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:42.460]   Every time she's online and they have Wi-Fi all over the campus in most colleges nowadays,
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:45.180]   including her dorm room, including the coffee shops, because it's SSL, you don't have to
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.380]   worry about security there.
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:51.260]   It's always backing up.
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:52.260]   This is the beauty.
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:53.260]   She loses the laptop.
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:57.060]   She can go online in the library or a roommate's computer anywhere and get that file.
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:01.500]   She's even an iPhone and a BlackBerry app, so she can always get those files.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:07.900]   I know I'll get that late night call the day before the term papers do, saying, "I lost
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.100]   it, I raced it," or whatever.
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.260]   A lot of human error gets involved, too.
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.100]   I don't have to worry.
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.100]   Carbonite.com.
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:17.340]   That's my pitch for getting it for a college kid.
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:19.140]   You might want it, too, for yourself.
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:24.700]   Automatic backup that's secure, it's easy, it's affordable, and you can get it anywhere
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:25.780]   you can get online.
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:27.660]   My important files are in three places now.
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.580]   Yeah, in three to one.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:34.100]   The internal drive that I have that I'm working on, so my aperture file or whatever, and then
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.180]   it's on a Drobo, which has got a backup.
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:40.100]   That's getting served up, and then it's going on to the cloud to make sure that those are
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.100]   the three places that it has to do with.
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.740]   If it's in those three places, I feel like I'm as secure as I'm for the important files,
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.940]   my kids, my important everything.
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:51.140]   I go through too much data to put everything on the cloud.
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.140]   I literally can't.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.140]   We're debating that.
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.780]   My podcast account won't allow that.
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:58.740]   We were debating that here because we weren't sure if we should put all of our work files.
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:03.860]   I mean, we got gigabytes a day, and we decided not to back those up, just back those up for
[00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.100]   a month.
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.100]   But then we don't have to worry.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:10.260]   We're not going to re-edit it.
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:14.580]   We figured we won't back that up, but we got to back up all our business stuff.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:17.500]   Peter Krogh, you know Peter Krogh, great photographer.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:21.980]   He worked with the Library of Congress to create a site called DPBest.
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:22.980]   That's fantastic.
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:23.980]   Have you seen this site?
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:25.180]   It's great for photographers.
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.620]   DPBestFlow.org.
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:31.820]   Highly recommended if you've never been there.
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:35.860]   In there, he talks about all the work flow for photographers, but one of the things he
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:38.980]   does, and this is what you should read, is he talks about backup.
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.700]   Peter calls it 3-2-1 backup.
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:42.940]   It's exactly what you just said.
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:46.660]   Three copies of every file, two different forms of media.
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:47.860]   You don't commit them all to DVD.
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.700]   You don't commit them all to hard drive.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.460]   One of them in the cloud, 3-2-1.
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.900]   If you don't have that, you're not really safe.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:56.900]   Carbonite is the one.
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.100]   It's the key in the 3-2-1 backup.
[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:00.260]   Carbonite.com.
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.020]   If you use the offer code Macbreak, you can try it free.
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:04.020]   You don't even need a credit card for 15 days.
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.260]   Just see how it works for you.
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:10.860]   If you decide to buy, when you check out, use the coupon code Macbreak for two months.
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.900]   Free Carbonite.com.
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.500]   Highly recommended.
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.620]   Again, this is the site DPBestFlow.org.
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:20.980]   Have you talked to Peter on a trip?
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:21.980]   We got him on a trip.
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:22.980]   I love you.
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:23.980]   He's great.
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.220]   I think you have to search for it.
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:29.300]   I don't think it's linked from the front.
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:33.660]   There's a whole page on what 3-2-1 backup is.
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:37.300]   You don't have to be a digital photographer to read this.
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:39.820]   Everybody should read this.
[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:44.780]   This is with the ASMP, the American Society of Media Photographers and the Library of
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:49.180]   Congress funded this, which is a really good site.
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:53.660]   You don't just upload to Flickr and say I'm done.
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:54.660]   I presume.
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:59.300]   No, it depends on the kind of file.
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:04.380]   Everything that I write is, every client, so to speak, every publication I write for
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:07.020]   is a different scrivener binder.
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.860]   Those all go to my Dropbox automatically.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:10.860]   Photos that I can't afford.
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.500]   That's a good way to do it.
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:13.500]   Sure.
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:18.220]   As a matter of fact, one of my favorite apps is an iPad app that automatically uses Dropbox
[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:21.460]   as your storage mechanism for whatever you write.
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:25.180]   That's going to be future pick of the week because it hasn't actually been released yet.
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:30.940]   For photos, there's a three-layer sort of thing where there's definitely goes on to
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:31.940]   my Drobo.
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:36.580]   I keep buying these three and a half-inch pocket drives that are my aperture work drives.
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:42.060]   Those actually, when I'm done, get actually labeled just like the Kodak Carousel saying
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:43.060]   trip to Yosemite.
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:47.780]   Yes, this $130 Firewire hard drive is now going to be stored away.
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:51.260]   The third place is things that are really, really good, things that have been good enough
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:55.900]   to be selected from the Scrum and actually edit in Photoshop, those things go into the
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.140]   cloud as a third copy.
[00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:59.940]   So you definitely need to have three.
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:00.940]   You've got to have three.
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:05.660]   Bell suspenders and have a barrel around yourself at the same time.
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:07.100]   Those pants are coming down.
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:09.140]   That's a point of the weather.
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.980]   That's in reality, because I travel a lot.
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:16.020]   I am constantly worried about losing my content.
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:19.300]   When I'm traveling, anytime I get a fast connection, I start uploading all the stuff I was shooting
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.460]   in Africa, for instance.
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:22.140]   I don't care about the cameras that much.
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.060]   They're expensive cameras and I'd like to keep them.
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.780]   But what I really care about are the photos and the videos and everything else.
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.100]   That's the irreplaceable thing.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.100]   You always buy another camera.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:30.740]   You cannot replace a photo that you took.
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:31.740]   You won't be there.
[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.380]   I had these great little, little, one-terabyte drives.
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:35.380]   You can't have been buying those.
[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:37.420]   So I got those little ones and I got two of them.
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:41.940]   What I do is I have my aperture library on one of them and the other ones have vault.
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:42.940]   So they're mirroring.
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:43.940]   It's the same.
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:45.420]   Every night, I just let it run the vault.
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:46.780]   So I got two of them and I keep them separate.
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:50.060]   So when I'm traveling around, when I'm walking around in my hotel room, there's one and in
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:51.260]   my body there's one.
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.580]   So I'm hoping that I don't lose both at the same time.
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:54.580]   But anytime I get the irreplaceable connection.
[00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.020]   That's what it's most precarious is when you're traveling.
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.580]   Because then you're taking these pictures.
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.060]   They're really important pictures.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.380]   And you're not really connected to your home network.
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:03.900]   So you really don't have the opportunities to back up that you would.
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:06.900]   And having a cloud that you can put them to is really neat.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:07.900]   It's useful.
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:08.900]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:12.020]   Well, I'll give you one story just to show you how bad sometimes these problems get.
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:17.500]   I have one archive from three years ago that's on a simpler tech, sorry, simple tech hard
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:20.980]   drive and the drive is all there on the drive.
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:25.980]   But the drive has been separated from the power supply and nothing on the on the drive
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:30.220]   or inside the drive says what kind of what what the rating of the power supply is.
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.860]   And I'm sure they have a power supply somewhere in my box of power supplies.
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:37.580]   I'll plug into it, but I'm terrified to like guess wrong plug it in, short out the the
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:39.820]   logic board for this drive.
[00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:41.940]   The mechanism unfortunately isn't a sad mechanism.
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:47.580]   So now to figure out, look, see that's that's where I just simply that was before I got
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.340]   a little bit more paranoid about storing photos.
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:53.420]   Well, that's I've been backed up to two different places when the fact that I have this working
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:55.940]   drive without any power to it wouldn't make any difference.
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:59.140]   I think that's why Peter says two different forms of media.
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:03.380]   You don't want to kind of rely on zip disks only, right?
[00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:06.980]   Because at some point they're going to go away.
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:11.020]   And so if you have two forms of media, at least chances are better that one of them will survive.
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.380]   And part of that's kind of an organic growing experience.
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:16.620]   What I like about the mixture of the cloud and the Drobo and everything else is that you
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:17.940]   just keep on updating all that stuff.
[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:20.060]   You keep on putting new drives and you keep on building it.
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:24.500]   And it's like a cloud of data either at your house, at your house or your business or online
[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:28.500]   or both that you're constantly, you know, there's just a lot of data that you're constantly
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:32.180]   kind of moving this big snowball forward rather than having it in a bunch of little
[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:33.500]   pockets of places.
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:36.540]   I just set up a Drobo FS.
[00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:38.700]   I think it was lying around the studio.
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:42.140]   I think we had some extra ones because we're trying different solutions for backup.
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:43.140]   So I just set it up at home.
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.620]   That's their network attached storage.
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:45.620]   And it's cool.
[00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:47.660]   So now it's on my network.
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.740]   It's visible to all the computers in the house.
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:52.740]   And then I put Chronosink on everybody on all the computers.
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:54.340]   And so daily they'll run a backup.
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:55.780]   Chronosink just backs up changes.
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:59.180]   So once they do the big backup, they'll all be back on the NAS.
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.740]   So that's my that's now my local backup is the NAS.
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:02.980]   And now I'm going to try this.
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:03.980]   It hasn't.
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:04.980]   There's apps you can put on it.
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:08.020]   There's a iTunes media server app.
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.540]   So I think I'm going to move all the music to that.
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:14.540]   I wish I'd done this, but when my kids were buying it and they buy all this music and
[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:16.540]   sometimes about the same things.
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:17.540]   I've done a couple of things.
[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:19.900]   And it would be nice if it has central database.
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:20.900]   Yeah.
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:26.180]   Anyway, moving along now, Andy, have you received an invitation from Apple yet?
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:27.180]   I have not.
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:29.140]   Alex, have you received an invitation from Apple?
[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:30.380]   I never received any.
[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:31.380]   Ever.
[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:32.380]   Me neither.
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:33.380]   So has anybody used to?
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.380]   I used to.
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:35.380]   That incident.
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.980]   The little thing with the laptop.
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:38.980]   Okay.
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:39.980]   You know, Steve gave me the.
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.220]   It wasn't like you were necessarily being very covert about it.
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:46.380]   I didn't say they never said to me, you can't do that.
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:48.980]   Like a stanza defense always works.
[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:53.980]   Well, no, I mean, if it had said anywhere, I looked if it said anywhere.
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:57.980]   I held up my laptop with my camera and pointed it at the CEO.
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:59.580]   I got a plea ignorance.
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:01.180]   Well, I got good video.
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.820]   We got a lot of hits.
[00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:03.820]   Yeah.
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:07.700]   You came home with the story and that's the first job of any good job.
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:08.700]   Exactly.
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:13.460]   I am not, you know, I'm not really, it's not, you know, of course, I'll never get invited
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:14.460]   back.
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:23.260]   So it was it was a calculus about whether, you know, whether it was better to do this
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:27.420]   and never again be invited to an Apple event.
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:29.100]   That's Scott Shepard in front of me.
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:34.380]   I wonder if Scott, you know, maybe they said Scott, you should have blocked him with your
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.380]   body.
[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:37.380]   I wonder if he gets invites anymore.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:40.460]   Who's that kind of my left or I'm right?
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:41.540]   He looks familiar.
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:43.420]   He should have jumped me.
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:44.580]   He probably doesn't get invited.
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:47.780]   I bet everybody in this picture is no longer invited to Apple events.
[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:48.780]   What do you say?
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:49.780]   No, I think it's Sam.
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.420]   No, because you got the stink eye.
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:52.420]   I did.
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:53.420]   I got the stink eye.
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:54.420]   You got the Steve's think.
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:55.420]   Not many people get the Steve's think.
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:59.020]   I he has to know who you are and he has to disagree with who what you're doing.
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:02.980]   Well, I also got in Apple's own in house video of the event.
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:05.140]   This is that's what this screenshot is from.
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:08.140]   So that might have something to do with it.
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:12.180]   Anyway, the reason I asked, there's a big rumor afloat that I think September 8th,
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.460]   Apple's going to have an event.
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:14.460]   This would be normal.
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:17.020]   They always in September have an iPod event.
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:21.180]   This is when you announce new iPods in time for the holiday buying season in time for back
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:22.660]   to late for back to school.
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:28.420]   But that's what I was talking about earlier though, is we're starting to see this unusual
[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:33.420]   object out there on the internet surfing and stuff.
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:34.980]   No one can quite figure out what it is.
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:38.900]   Of course, the speculation is it's this ITV.
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:42.900]   Do you think, let's see, it would be two weeks, you know, if Apple were going to mail an
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:48.140]   invitation, it would be a week early, not two weeks early.
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:49.140]   So we'd just be next week.
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:50.140]   It'd be next week.
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:51.140]   It'd be next week.
[00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:52.140]   I think so.
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:53.140]   There's still time for us to get an invite.
[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:56.220]   And Andy's the only one unsullied at this point.
[00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:57.220]   The question for Andy.
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:58.220]   Will you come about it?
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:50:59.220]   If they invite you, will you come?
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.140]   I'll fly you out, Andy, because I am of the opinion.
[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:05.180]   It is not an everyday iPod announcement that we're going to see this with this time.
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:06.340]   If they do it.
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:11.540]   I think that, and you know, Kevin Rose wrote a really good piece on his blog.
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:17.660]   And I think others are speculating this as well, that this fall, Google TV versus Apple
[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:22.420]   TV, perhaps renamed ITV is going to be the battle royale this fall.
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:24.940]   Forget iPhone Android.
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:33.140]   Imagine an iOS based device, no storage, thin little device attached to your HDMI cable to
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:38.140]   your TV controlled by the magic trackpad.
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:42.660]   So you've got all the features of a, of an iPad or an iPad, there could be an iPad app.
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:43.660]   That would be really cool too.
[00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:46.460]   You'd have the ultimate remote control, wouldn't you?
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:48.740]   And you can add apps to it.
[00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:49.660]   You could add Hulu to it.
[00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:50.660]   You could add Netflix to it.
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:52.740]   Comcast could maybe add an app for it.
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:55.980]   What if it was just an iPhone?
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:59.980]   What if it wasn't just basically maybe it's not additional hardware?
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:00.980]   It's just an iPhone four.
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:04.340]   It's I'll tell you why, because you can disconnect it every day as you go out of the house.
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:09.380]   No, I'm saying, but I for what I'm saying is iOS four, that's all it is connected to
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:10.380]   your TV.
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:11.380]   Yes.
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:12.380]   Permanently.
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:13.380]   Right.
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:15.380]   In a little box that would be that's what it is.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:18.300]   With just flash storage built in and that could work really well.
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:22.300]   And giving you your choice of controllers to connect to as long as it has a Wi-Fi signal.
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:24.100]   So you can control button in theory.
[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:27.220]   You can control by iTunes, control from your iPhone.
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:28.220]   60 bucks.
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:29.220]   You can control by your Android app.
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:30.460]   For the Magic trackpad.
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:33.940]   And you can type because the trackpad could be a keyboard is big enough.
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:34.940]   You could type.
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:35.940]   You could mouse.
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:36.940]   You could zoom.
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:37.940]   You could pinch.
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:41.300]   But I think the key to this and it's the key to the Google TV announcement too is apps.
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:42.300]   It's putting apps.
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:43.540]   Right now you can buy a TV.
[00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:46.500]   I'm even seeing ads for TVs with apps, but you don't.
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:47.700]   Nobody upgrades their TV.
[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:52.980]   There's not a robust app architecture or app store or ecosystem.
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:54.500]   You've got Google with Android.
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:56.980]   You've got Apple with iPhone.
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:57.980]   You got the infrastructure.
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:52:59.180]   I think that I think I want it.
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.180]   Go ahead Andy.
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:05.980]   I was just going to say that if it turns if it turned into a holiday holiday season 2010
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:10.100]   battle royale between Google TV and ITV Google TV loses.
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:15.180]   It just it does no conceivable way that it can be they can win in that kind of consumer
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:17.100]   space because remember the Google.
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:22.180]   Because Google TV is going out the way that Google usually releases things right now.
[00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:23.340]   They have a deal with Samsung.
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:26.900]   They have a deal with Sony to incorporate the technology to TVs.
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:32.540]   I was going to say they also have so this is a technology that will come in certain models
[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:34.180]   with Sony and Samsung TV.
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:35.780]   So it's not putting it every single TV.
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.420]   That's not I think they're going to make it as that's.
[00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:38.420]   Excuse me.
[00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:39.420]   And that's not ideal.
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:40.420]   I agree with you.
[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:42.420]   It should be an add on and you can buy a logic tech bot.
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:45.980]   Logic tech is also announced that they're going to have an add on box to make that work.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:49.620]   And so again we're talking about two different we're talking about parts of a very long and
[00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:51.420]   complicated lineup.
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:57.020]   So once you have but even if logic tech let's say is really really invested in this they
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:00.660]   they're absolute believers and even beyond the idea that they think that they're going
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:03.340]   to be making a hundred million dollars off of this in the next year.
[00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:07.180]   They just spiritually believe that this is a great product and they're willing to assert
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.660]   themselves to make this work.
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:12.140]   They still have to talk to Best Buy and they still have to talk to Amazon.
[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:15.580]   They still have to talk to every single retailer to give it that kind of a prominence.
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:20.380]   Whereas when Apple decides that that ITV or Apple TV is going to be the big thing that
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:23.580]   everybody should have it's going to be in every single mall.
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:25.740]   It's going to be highlighted in every single Apple store.
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:28.140]   There are going to be commercials everywhere for it.
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:32.260]   Well and if you're a content creator like let's use Hulu that's why I think Hulu Plus
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:33.620]   has started to emerge.
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:38.220]   You write one app that will run on the Apple TV but I can also put it on 85 million iPod
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:42.780]   touches, iPhones and iPads so there's already this huge.
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:49.460]   Well and you're rolling out I think that we can agree that when it comes to creating
[00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:55.740]   an interface for the average consumer Apple is going to provide a better experience.
[00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:58.860]   It may not be as wide but I still think- I'm not one of those cool-
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:03.420]   I just think I like Android but I just think that the people will feel more comfortable
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:05.900]   with an iPhone interface than they will.
[00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:10.140]   I think the issue is that if you're a geek and you want a total like I want to rip it open
[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:14.620]   and do all kinds of fun stuff and I may do that want that too then I want the Google
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:15.620]   you know a Google Opera.
[00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:19.180]   I think you guys are right and I think actually what Andy is saying is also super telling
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:21.900]   because Apple is already in position in a way Google is not.
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:25.940]   But I don't think the Apple Google battle is the interesting battle here.
[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:32.060]   The real battle that is laid down by either one of these platforms is the battle of content
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:35.540]   providers versus content.
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:36.540]   Yeah.
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:41.500]   Transporters because it disintermediates the cable company it disintermediates everybody
[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:46.260]   because Blockbuster makes an app Netflix makes an app Warner Brothers makes an app you buy
[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:51.540]   the app you could pay and you know Hulu is a really good example because you pay ten
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:56.500]   bucks a month to Hulu not to Apple not to Comcast but to Hulu.
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:00.700]   Yeah but let's also not forget that Verizon has an iPad app in the works that will let
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:06.780]   you if you're a Verizon file subscriber basically stream any of their content any Verizon files
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:10.740]   content to any device within Wi-Fi range of your house.
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:17.740]   So that's another potential target for every single channel you're subscribing to via Verizon
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:22.860]   files can possibly be watched on your iPad or on your iPhone through these devices and
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:26.540]   every if you don't think that the networks themselves are also looking at this as a way
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:29.260]   to solve so many of their problems.
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:33.900]   And this is also and Netflix I think is the best is the best opportunity at all of all
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:38.940]   they are consistently they they they invested I think that I'm trying to remember with almost
[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:41.460]   a billion dollars on Epic.
[00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:45.620]   They decided to spend five hundred million dollars on a very very exclusive catalog of
[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:50.420]   cable TV movies and content and they said that they're they're they're explicitly saying
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:53.740]   that we're taking the money that we think that we're going to be saving on not sending
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:58.660]   people DVDs by mail because we feel that right now that that's a tapering down dead
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:03.180]   end to our business and essentially building ourselves up into the first IP based cable
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.180]   rider.
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:07.860]   And I think here's the key here's what it solves it solves the tower of Babel problem
[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:11.660]   because right now the problem is you're getting content from 18 different places and there's
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:13.620]   no unified interface to it.
[00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:18.460]   So I turn on my TV and it drives my wife crazy what do I do what box do I start and how to
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:23.420]   now you turn on the TV all you turn on the ITV and everything that every content provider
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:25.380]   has an app that's pretty easy to manage.
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:28.940]   And I think that I think it's like a channel on your TV you go to the Warner Brothers app
[00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:32.820]   you go to the Disney app you go to the Hulu app so it's not a problem.
[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:37.060]   Now Google has a global search tool I'm sure Apple will have to come up with some way of
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:39.380]   you know I don't know you know this is the problem.
[00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:45.380]   Okay well tell me where Blossom is and it says oh search for Blossom oh that's on these
[00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:48.980]   these apps we need to solve that but not that's easy.
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:52.860]   I also think that that there's two other things that I think really point towards this is
[00:57:52.860 --> 00:58:01.220]   I think that the number one is the ability to I mean the need to offset Netflix specifically
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:06.180]   even though Netflix will be an application on this new app this new hardware if it happens
[00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:09.260]   the thing is is they're starting to get they're starting to pull away from a lot of people
[00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:13.300]   when it comes to content and we know that a lot of the content providers don't want
[00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:16.980]   anyone to become the biggest game in town anymore they want to even things out and this
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:18.380]   evens it out for them.
[00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:19.380]   It's huge.
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:21.540]   The other thing is is that the I add thing makes a huge difference here.
[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:25.100]   Because there's revenue because now you have you could be running all the stuff without
[00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:30.100]   subscription services because the I add now runs on everything that goes into all of
[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:36.260]   these TVs suddenly I add which is you know which is doing okay now becomes a big big
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:39.260]   big deal because this is the kind of ads that the consumers want to get because it's
[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:45.060]   not intrusive it is you know and suddenly it's getting wide distribution onto the TV it
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:48.500]   totally and the thing is that what I'd be worried about is even the networks if the
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:53.060]   network you know because now I think all distributors are gone it's it's content providers direct
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:56.900]   to content creators creators and I think even Hulu's in a little bit of trouble because
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:00.900]   they're aggregating content creators but why should NBC even go through Hulu I think
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:03.380]   that it's disintermediating that's what the internet does.
[00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:08.540]   The other question is is why should a production company who's selling their stuff to NBC go
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:09.540]   through NBC.
[00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:12.820]   So that's why we have a Twitter app I don't have to go through anybody have a Twitter app
[00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:15.900]   if in and we could put ads in it we could figure out sorts of ways to monetize using
[00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:16.900]   the Twitter.
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:20.820]   For example like I don't like most of the food network but I one of the main reasons
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:25.420]   I stuck an app it one of the main reasons that I still have a cable connection at all
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:29.500]   is for good eats you know and so the thing is is that if good eats became an application
[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:34.980]   that I could watch HD shows on I would probably start pushing my wife to cancel now here's
[00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:40.620]   the here's okay so this is all the utopia but here's where the fight gets bitter because
[00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:45.720]   Verizon and Comcast and all these people who are providing your data pipe also count on
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:52.900]   selling you premium services like HBO if HBO says buy by Verizon buy by Comcast we have
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:58.560]   an HBO app that we're going to make money directly we're going to disintermediate you
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:03.560]   what happens to Verizon and Comcast isn't this maybe where the battle maybe this is why Google
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:08.580]   gave up net neutrality on mobile they want to preserve it on landline because they see
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:14.180]   this is a huge revenue opportunity with Google TV is that what what happens Andy I think
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:17.880]   I think that's when you start seeing all these companies go to tiered levels of service for
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:21.800]   Internet because number one that's where they're going to be making their money from now on
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:27.120]   if they can't get the 40 bucks a month yeah and they can get charged that for data and
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:31.960]   also not just because that they're being mean little little Johnson's about it but also
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:37.600]   because if everybody starts getting all of their entertainment via the Internet pipe that
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:41.800]   becomes a much more expensive service to provide especially if you're trying to get as especially
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.380]   when you have the season finale of lost and every house in the neighborhood is trying
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:50.300]   to pull down the exact same stream in HD at the same time well you can see why they would
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:56.020]   want to charge the providers more for that access to those consumers that's why net neutrality
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:00.220]   becomes important because they will they'll say oh hey if you if you want lost you're
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:04.020]   going to have to pay us more because you're going to kill our network or if you want to
[01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:07.300]   but the thing is if you want to if you want to be the person who's streaming lost to them
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:10.460]   whether it's Apple or Google or someone else that's what I'm saying they want to charge
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:16.100]   you for the the building to stream you know onto their pipe now you know I I've decided
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:20.880]   that I think that I think we should just go ahead and let them have their net in non-neutrality
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:25.000]   except little catch I think that we ought to the government ought to be able to tax it
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.600]   and invest that money back into building backbones we ought to remove all of the all of the restrictions
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:35.000]   against municipalities building their own pipeline you say go back to the public Internet once
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.600]   again allow well yeah well here's the deal is if you're going to take away net neutrality
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.740]   allow municipalities to do whatever they're going to do and if you want to and so the
[01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:45.840]   thing is is that you know take if you take away the net neutrality let them have that
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:49.640]   let them start charging as long as there's competition we don't have to enforce net neutrality especially
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:53.080]   if there's a public pipe you know because I think you know that because I think public
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:57.540]   option is back the bill of public option where and that public option is being paid by the
[01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:03.060]   non-neutrality you know so basically is that you know that tax it and build it well isn't
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:06.460]   that kind of what Google's talking about with its gigabit they're saying well you know we're
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:10.800]   going to bypass these these guys because they're eventually they're going to be a toll road
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:16.880]   we don't want a toll road is what we're saying now all of this negates the big rumor that's
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:24.360]   going on right now Bloomberg says that Apple is in advanced talks with News Corp and this
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:29.120]   may be why they're building that big facility in North Carolina the network operation center
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:35.000]   there to let users rent TV shows from News Corp for 99 cents apparently discussing this
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.060]   with other media companies viewers would be able to rent programs from Fox for 48 hours
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:46.940]   see I think this is an old model that's going to go away why wouldn't Fox just sell direct
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:53.660]   and forget and eventually Fox goes away and the company that makes lost right has a lost
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:57.660]   application and you know you could do a much more interesting look at people how many shows
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:00.780]   do people watch they don't watch everything they maybe they watch a dozen shows a week
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:04.380]   maybe you're an ass car fan you watch the lost you watch madman you get the madman app
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:08.800]   you get the lost app and it's rich media there's a lot of other content customized for that
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:13.200]   viewer that experience and then I think Fox and CBS and all these guys are in trouble so
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:16.440]   maybe jobs is just going to them trying to get squeeze a little money at them before they
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:20.520]   go up belly out there there'll always be networks they're just going to be a little bit harder
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:25.240]   to spot because the producers of two and a half men and big bang theory they don't want
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:28.520]   to be in the business of selling advertisers they don't want to be in the business of dealing
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:32.120]   with bandwidth issues they want to produce their shows and collect their checks and they're
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:36.180]   going to hire out a company that will provide those services to lots and lots of different
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:41.680]   people and you know who wants to be that company I do I do apple apple apple computer well and
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:47.860]   again with the eye with the eye at opportunities there's a huge this is why apple I just understand
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:54.860]   this now is making the ads yeah they ultimately want to get rid of that agencies they could
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:58.620]   they want to be the whole I think they can't no I don't think I don't I actually don't
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:01.000]   think that I don't think apple wants to do that okay they want to sell them they want
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.480]   to provide a production service yeah so if I'm well I don't think they want to become
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:08.240]   the right now I think what they want to do is control the quality I think that that
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:12.960]   over time what they want to do is allow it for don't underestimate Steve Jabs desire
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:16.480]   to control the universe but I think they want trusted developers that they're going to outsource
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:19.920]   that work too I don't think that and by the way if anyone from apples watching I would
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:24.680]   like to play anyway so anyway this is really good for people like you this is a huge opportunity
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.800]   for you we've been one I mean this is exactly that we've been talking about for 10 years
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:33.880]   but you I think the thing that we can overlook is the fact that what's always paid for television
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:39.040]   is advertisers and average what what advertisers when they pay money for is not necessarily
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:43.080]   viewership of the right kind of viewership if I'm trying to I'm trying to sell this beautiful
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:47.840]   lady not go model thermal mug I want if I want to target ads exactly the sort of people
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:52.720]   who are in the market for exactly the sort of thing and no other platform but computer
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:58.440]   with the web browser has given advertisers the ability to find specifically right exactly
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.480]   the sort of consumer they want because there's a really great article in the Wall Street
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:06.600]   Journal I think was last week she wonderfully long and detailed article about exactly the
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:11.880]   level of precision by which marketing agencies can essentially profile everybody he uses
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:17.360]   a browser by via tracking a very very fine level of control and so when you have a computer
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:21.080]   that is not only the TV device but also the portal to everything that you all you've
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:26.440]   your entertainment all your all of your purchasing history all of your the news sources and
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:31.240]   things like that you essentially have a big data farm in God knows where that can essentially
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:38.920]   say deliver to order I need 5000 people who are very very likely to be in the market for
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:43.880]   a sporty but practical family sedan sometime in the next three months and they will give
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:47.960]   you a thousand people that will give you the highest level of return you'll ever dream
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:51.240]   of that's not the sort of things that that's not the sort of thing that producer two and
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:55.120]   a half men can really do so that's why it's always it's still going to be these big companies
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:59.800]   that collect all this data observe what you do and sell that information in the form of
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:04.080]   here are a thousand people that you want to target this ad to give me give me money thank
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:08.720]   you very much but let's not forget that apples also or Google is providing a way for you
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:13.600]   to sell to do pay better much better subscription television ad free subscription television
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.680]   because you can buy the I mean hulu is ten bucks a month you can buy you can buy or you
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:21.600]   could buy the app or you could but do a subscription all of that is handled kind of automatically
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:25.560]   and it's all and money and here's the thing that apple is ask you as as a producer of
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:29.880]   content would you prefer the ad model or would you prefer the subscription model I would
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:35.960]   prefer both there's no reason to choose there's no reason to rather screw the viewer twice
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:41.400]   no no no no but there's no here's the thing is that is that for some of the shows that
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:45.880]   we do for instance there are reasons to have a subscription because that market is so vertical
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:50.160]   that it wouldn't be necessarily supportable from sponsorship whereas some of the stuff
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:54.320]   that we do is wide enough so the idea is that I would want to be able to I want to do both
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.560]   two some shows you know like the pixacore for instance is we are a subscription service
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:03.200]   people subscribe to the pixacore for content that is exclusive to them because that's a
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:07.480]   vertical market that advertising wouldn't be enough to support it whereas a lot of our
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:10.680]   shows are wide enough that we have advertising that comes in because they're wide enough
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:15.680]   to do that and so there's I think that that having this nuanced view of and then we we
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:20.560]   also sell applications you know you know so so these are the we use all of these business
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:26.800]   models and all of them are effective for different you know different communities where
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:39.520]   that makes sense that makes sense Wow I'm just saying that it as I'm not a producer
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:45.000]   but I'm just a viewer and I tend to rebel when you ask me to sit through ads and pay
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.280]   you money I'll agree I agree but I think that the great thing about that you don't do
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:52.920]   both on one person content he's saying it depends on the content who those doing that
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:57.360]   with or not who Lou Lou Lou Lou Lou Lou is doing that X bucks a month and I get to see commercials
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:00.760]   which pisses the hell out of me XM's a good example of something that where you're hearing
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.640]   ads and you're paying for the service now I have to admit I love XM I would never go back
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:10.000]   to radio but maybe if you do ask like we do a little less fewer ads not as intrusive well
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.160]   the thing is I ads right now the way they're structured is they're just sitting at the bottom
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:17.640]   right they're not even they're not interrupt if I can watch my shows and when I go down
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:22.600]   to get controls to fast forward or whatever I see a little I add and and I decide whether
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:26.480]   I want to do it but it's not something that's intrusively attacking me all the time I would
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:30.720]   I would always watch shows on that if I if that's all I got this is definitely an area
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:34.640]   in which Apple can win and beat Google or at least steal a lot more their business than
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:40.360]   people are thinking I was every time I watch a video on YouTube and I see Google's idea
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:45.280]   of ads which is I'm going to put this big stripe over the bottom fifth of this entire
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:49.480]   video that does not go away until you click a very tiny closed box and we don't care this
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:53.040]   going to be covering up important information that the video is going to be embedding at
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.600]   the bottom of that video because it's important for us to show you this ad that gets me really
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:03.080]   frustrated if Apple's idea is to make a much more controlled ad system where it's almost
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:07.880]   seems like a feature of the application that you're using ideally as opposed to yeah we're
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:11.160]   just going to plaster we're going to give you a pop up ad over the video that you just
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:15.240]   cannot in any way for shape or form a nori you just have to deal with it before you get
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:20.920]   past it and I think a great example is is Macworld magazine and and Wired magazine and
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:25.680]   that is I read the ads almost as much as I read the magazine because it's targeted because
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:29.640]   their ads are appropriate I want to see oh like I go through the back of Macworld and
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:34.520]   the back of Wired looking at like the little marketplace area because there's cool things
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:38.080]   that I want to check out computer shop or survive for so long it's known it was all ads
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:43.760]   but it was ads that were relevant targeted ads all right I take you back now to I think
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:49.680]   it was May of last year Steve Jobs Eric Schmidt spotted at a coffee bar remember there was
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:56.760]   a quote that was kind of impenetrable now think if this quote now starts to make sense
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:00.320]   if you've got the head of Google the head of Apple together and Steve Jobs says they're
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:06.880]   going to see it all eventually so who cares how they get it maybe they were talking about
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:12.920]   the world of TV and a IP TV maybe not that was right before he said I will kill you for
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:19.400]   fun but don't you think I mean at that point both Apple and Google knew what their plans
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:24.040]   were with the TV world a year would there would be a year later and I would make sense
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:27.600]   that that's what the two of them might might well be talking about and you know what I
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:32.240]   think it's not going to be iPhone Android hmm well it is I think it's I think it's but
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:36.240]   those two platforms though it's those two platforms but the battlefield is going to
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:39.560]   be over television well I think the battlefield is going to be this what I think is interesting
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:43.600]   is looking at some of these very exciting new new touch tablets that are coming out based
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:46.560]   on the Android that were announced last week I can't quite a few of these gonna be but
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:51.960]   they're like 200 $300 and I think that you're looking at two companies that are engaging
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:57.600]   at so many levels our phone our computer our TV eventually our car amazing you know it is
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.120]   you know and and they are you know you can definitely see how there's going to be just
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.800]   a lot of friction between the two of them because they are competing in every level but
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:10.000]   you saw that tweet that I retweeted last week let me see if I can it's I have to go
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:16.960]   back in time a little bit it was from a guy named I think Phil Nash he was talking about
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:24.080]   how the world had how the world had changed go back here I want to quote it exactly because
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:29.600]   he wrote it quite quite nicely when I think the other thing is interesting for both you
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:33.680]   know Google has been looking at these these massive pipes you know of being able to deliver
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:37.880]   all this stuff at the same time I think that we can all agree that if Apple for instance
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:40.640]   put out an internet service let's just say Apple bought you know decided they're going
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:44.960]   to provide an internet connection how many Apple users would buy that internet connection
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:48.760]   from Apple I don't know I would I don't know I think it comes a time when you want to stick
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:52.920]   to your knitting at some point you don't want to so this is Phil Nash's tweet from August
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:57.840]   14th he says welcome to the new decade Java is a restricted platform this is right after
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:02.160]   Oracle sues Google Google is evil right after Google makes a deal with Verizon Apple is
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:08.680]   a monopoly and Microsoft are the underdogs who's left out of this nexus Microsoft it's like
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:14.360]   where are they all that last decades technology they tried yeah they're still trying yeah
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:19.040]   but I don't see them as being part of this game it's it you know you see this all the
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:22.720]   time and technology people often assume the first mover has an advantage the first mover
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:27.320]   almost always loses and Microsoft was very early with the home theater PC Apple even
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:31.720]   their Apple TV was early too early to the game this is now this is it this is this is
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:35.080]   when we're really starting to see it and I think that one of the things that both Apple
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:40.120]   and Google have that give them a key advantage over Microsoft is the willingness to jettison
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:45.000]   their history for the future yeah Microsoft spends a lot of time making sure that the
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.840]   current base that they have of people who are installed can continue to use applications
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:53.080]   can continue to use stuff that's moving forward that they're moving that forward because that's
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:56.000]   a big piece of their puzzle I mean it doesn't you know they have just a lot of upgrades and
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.480]   they make a lot more money than both those companies because of that but at the same
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:05.240]   time that holds them back because that backwards compatibility I think is they're they're passed
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:10.840]   oftentimes glues their feet to the ground alright yeah go ahead any last last thoughts final
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:15.200]   thoughts before we go to our last last thought is that Microsoft is up Microsoft is up at
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:19.760]   Microsoft was like a mall where they just feel as though they have 40 50 60 stores and they
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.600]   perform so any one of them you really just matter to them we're asked Google and Apple
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:27.240]   Apple particulars they do not put out something unless they're willing to state that this
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:31.200]   is the most important thing that they're they've done the past 10 years and the twice the most
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:34.340]   important anything they're gonna be doing in the next 20 years and that's why we're
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:37.920]   essentially try it because it's great and we love you you're gonna love us for having
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:42.720]   tried it Microsoft is like oh yeah it's right I got next box last week you can play with
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:46.640]   it if you want I don't know if you want it but unless of a computer over here if we'll
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:49.980]   use the computer you know you say they don't have the fire in the belly that Apple and
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:56.280]   Google have right now what a Mountain Dew you know it's like they're not the ones that
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:01.200]   say oh my god I gotta show you this great thing I got last week it's called the iPad is for
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:05.820]   my books is for everything you gotta try you gotta try it I think that I think that in
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:09.860]   a lot of ways Apple has that singular focus that Steve brings to it if this is where we're
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:14.060]   going this is how we're gonna do it X Y and Z and I think Google has the advantage of
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:18.300]   being willing to try lots of things and letting lots of very creative and independent thinkers
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:23.300]   run out there and throw things out and and make mistakes you know and you know have their
[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:26.580]   buzz not work completely right all the time and have all those things and and I think that
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:29.500]   Microsoft is somewhere in the middle where they have a lot of creative people but sometimes
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:33.400]   there's a lot of infrastructure around that that makes it very difficult for some of that
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:39.600]   to really percolate out yeah you know I think maybe yeah I'm sorry I'm sorry you said Leo
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.800]   said why this up a minute ago I'm still talking I'll keep talking I just I just want him to
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:50.120]   create an exception for a major Nelson on Twitter who who at Microsoft he is like the Xbox evangelist
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:55.520]   and he is everywhere always spreading the gospel of Xbox and so I think that within
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:58.400]   the entertainment division and maybe within the mobile division there might be a difference
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:04.380]   there but it's been a long time since I've seen a Microsoft product demo or Microsoft briefing
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:08.600]   where there was any sense of urgency that you know you should definitely write about this
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:12.340]   tomorrow because it's so great like I don't know where this is the first version we'll
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:20.820]   do the next version next year or maybe not I don't know when I go to RVs this is this
[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:25.560]   has been a great discussion I just hope that Apple does release this ITV in a couple of
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:32.280]   weeks because I think we're it's just what we've just laid out this vision is just it's
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:37.440]   too good it's too obvious it's it's I can't it's too perfect to not happen I'm really
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:42.920]   glad that none of my family watches the show because that is my Christmas present for everybody
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:47.480]   ITV for all just like you know that's the best of it just to make sure that there'll
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:51.080]   always be an ITV every time you visit them so that you'll have something to watch something
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:55.360]   to do this stuff that I haven't counted out is that the ability for me to post photos really
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:59.160]   really easily not to think about it and they can just turn it on and make it a screensaver
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:02.560]   on their TV that's now all the kids are up there in the videos and everything else the
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:06.680]   roku box will do this we're starting to see a little like the roku is like kind of like
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:11.400]   the backdoor apple TV because you've got apps now and stuff but it's it's that without
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:15.200]   the huge apple infrastructure and the installed base now you throw that on stall based and
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:20.480]   infrastructure at it so we already see this I put my photos on smug mug and as I do I
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:24.960]   can on my roku box I have a slideshow on my big screen TV and it's great right it's
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:30.000]   great and I but but that's just kind of like a little as taste right I think as it would
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.720]   be if it because they we all have iPhones and we're all having this other you know this
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:37.400]   stuff I think these all bases really yeah gonna be huge right but also I think roku really
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:43.440]   pointed the way they did they did they did for IT for inner IP TV what apple did for
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.760]   touchscreen phones they simply said no it's not going to be a four hundred dollar computer
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:52.240]   that has great great TV features it's not going to be a home theater thing it's going
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:57.640]   to be we gotta build it for 99 bucks not hundred bucks and not hundred one bucks no
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:01.920]   storage at all no storage at all we're just we're not going to be selling somebody a lifestyle
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:05.720]   we're gonna hook them up to a service that they already use and love and already evangelized
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:09.680]   to all their friends Netflix and then we're gonna make sure that everybody who wants one
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:13.880]   of these boxes can have one of these boxes and show it off to all of their friends and
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:18.200]   thanks to MediaFly we are on the roku box as an application you can watch us live you
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:23.440]   can watch us on demand it's it's we have parody with everything else on the roku box
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:26.840]   and that's the whole that's the thing that excites me as a content creator about this
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:32.040]   app based I just have to tell you my my wife suddenly heard you on in the house she heard
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:37.120]   you in the house she just left she had left the she left the rumor of it and my son had
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:40.000]   figured out how to go to the roku my two and a half year old man had figured out how to
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.080]   go to roku how to find twit and play and he had twit playing and he was sitting there
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:49.440]   happily on the other kid your kids are genius he's crazy with country he's a towel two and
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:53.960]   a half yeah he figured that out figure out a fine uncle Leo he's a frightening little
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:58.560]   boy he's a genius I like that kid we need more like that you know you like it except
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:02.520]   when he picked pockets your your iPhone 4 and then rearranges all your apps and deletes
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:07.840]   some of them and then and then you find him you know it's a yeah my genius son has already
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:13.080]   dropped his iPhone and cracked the screen that there you go brand new iPhone 4 smashed
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:16.240]   tenor bucks well that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna iPhone repair and that gets replaced
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:20.840]   a screen I'm so relieved to know about that that's it was it the screen or the back it's
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:24.680]   a front it's more expensive because you have to replace the whole LCD right cuz they're
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:31.600]   glued it's glued yep I know I don't know how much it is yet I'll have to call them those
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:34.680]   are the guys we had in iPhone repair they're just up the street I'm so are they really
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:38.800]   up right up the street yeah I know I think it's funny that bias is right up the street
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:42.720]   I always feel like we should walk up and say hi just ask them out for a no yeah they're
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:47.800]   just like our neighbors yeah Petaloma man it's happening it's a new tech new tech center

[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:57.600]   can we can look at the entire town shows up for that for the for the parade not only
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:00.520]   is the entire town show up for the butter and eggs they parade their tire towns in it so
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:04.960]   basically what happens is they go by and then they sit down and watch the next stage go
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:09.120]   by and then the next stage sits down it's like a loop yeah it's everybody's sitting down
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:13.120]   and in the parade it's great yeah that's what happens when you have a big parade in a small
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:18.880]   town this portion of Mac break weekly brought to you by our friends at audible.com the great

[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:32.960]   now operation mince meat because you just raved it that Andy what do you got it now this
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:38.360]   is one that's on deck I'm almost finished with the book that I recommended three weeks
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:46.680]   ago which was the one that came over the name of it but it was the title about the five
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:51.440]   different Oscar nominees from 1970 and the behind the scenes I'm nearly done with that
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:56.480]   as just not not not not on the level of operation mince me except to be I have to be careful
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:00.320]   if I like these books oftentimes like if you talk to me while I'm nearly at the end of
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:03.920]   it oh my god there's the greatest one ever you got to get this great one operation mince
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:08.480]   me still like even like a few weeks after if I have to recommend somebody one book oh
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.960]   yeah that's going to be one of the three that will come to mind to say okay if you if you
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:16.000]   don't like this one then you don't like the concept of audio books which is fine but this
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.880]   will if you don't like this then there's definitely something wrong with the way you process books
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:27.840]   the next one up is something that I've read about 30% of in that at Barnes and Noble unfortunately
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:33.560]   I was a mean spirited thing that I did I didn't mean to I was I was selected and when
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:38.840]   I get nearly to the end of one audio book I start like processing auditioning the next
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:46.520]   one and this one is McSweeney's math math McSweeney's mammoth treasury of thrilling tales which
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:52.800]   is an anthology of adventure stories written by every author you would ever want to hear
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:58.360]   an adventure story from Glenn David Gold Elmore Leonard Neil Gaiman Nick Hornbeast Stephen
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:03.840]   King Michael Crichton Laurie King Dave Eggers Mike Moorcock Harlan Allison as a story in
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:11.200]   here there's Stephen King Stephen King this not all read by the author fortunately or
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:16.440]   unfortunately but there this looks great exactly and so I'm like there must be and these
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:21.000]   were all written I believe especially for this treasury so it's not like it's reprinted
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:26.680]   from stuff that got rejected by you know amazing amazing fantasy in 1968 this is all
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:32.000]   great new stuff and so I was really worried about because I've bought anthologies before
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.560]   and as often as not I might have reading about 40% of these stories and skipping over the
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:40.880]   rest of them because they just don't grab me so I did go to the Barnes and Noble I did
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:45.080]   like pick it up off the shelf just to do just to do my three flipped test we just sort of
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:49.080]   flipped to three random spots and see where it goes and I wound up like sitting there for
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:53.280]   like an hour and a half like just reading story after story at the point where I'm like
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:57.880]   yeah you're kind of stealing this book from the Barnes and Noble they're not they're
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:02.200]   a print publisher they're not doing the print book store they're not doing very well so
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:05.880]   I haven't I haven't read the entire thing but I've already bought this one and that's
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:11.320]   on deck all the stories that I've already read were just absolutely wonderful and some
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:15.200]   of them are actually if you if you're kind of on the fence about this definitely do do
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:19.120]   a Google search on some of the story titles because some of these are actually available
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:24.960]   on the McSweeney's website for instance the Elmore Leonard story how Carlos Webster changed
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:30.320]   his name to Carl and became a famous Oklahoma law man is available in its entirety sorry
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:36.320]   I'm sorry a pretty media excerpt from it is available on the McSweeney's site so you can
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:39.560]   get a really good taste for all these stories and I don't think that you'll be deep into
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:43.680]   any of these before you decide you have this to be this to be a good one to listen to I
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:50.800]   McSweeney's quarterly concern is a literary magazine created by a couple of really great
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:54.680]   writers in San Francisco so it's kind of a it's a neat thing to see this I can't wait
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:58.880]   boy the people in this Harlan Ellison narrates his own story which makes it all the more interesting
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:05.920]   for sci-fi fans McSweeney's mammoth treasury of thrilling tales I like to say is audible

[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:21.080]   that's a setting at the very beginning I just can't figure out how to get back to the settings
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:24.520]   it's one of the things that really bothers me about the iPad there's no there's no kind
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:29.320]   of menu system or standard thing you can easily have controls that are just obscure
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:35.000]   maybe if I do it like this I don't know I just can't figure out where that you know extra setting
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:40.200]   is hidden you can see in in portrait mode it's really great it's just like reading a Kindle or
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:46.200]   something there's your river of news and you can look at the feeds in in this way really a nice
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:50.840]   little program it's not very expensive it's a few bucks do you have it up there because I can't
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:57.400]   I don't see the price here river of news I don't I don't have it all look anyway my recommendation
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:03.320]   great news reader now it's your turn Alex Lindsay for your recommendation of the week I have a few
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:08.600]   small recommendations okay um there they I didn't feel like they would they really eat any one of
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:11.960]   them because one of them is a little bit of a repeat but I just want to come back to it and
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:17.640]   then circle round baby here we go actually we'll just do two of them number one is I got the new
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:23.160]   magic trackpad you got it I bought one I got a big get one because I really do like it was
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:28.920]   literally in really first 20 minutes I was like oh I'm not going back and and I generally you know
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:32.280]   and I have to admit I spent a lot of time on a laptop so I'm very comfortable with my with my
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:38.360]   trackpad really but I hooked it up to my my Mac Pro and and I was just like I started using it and
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:44.520]   I was like oh I am not not going back to my mouse so I've done I mean and and I've been using it for
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:50.440]   the last week and I'm just completely happy with it and so anyways that was my one pick I think
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:54.200]   people have been kind of asking me whether I've gotten one and what I think of it and everything
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:59.480]   else well that's my opinion I kind of have to buy it it's you know you know I don't know and he's
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:04.280]   got his already so yeah he's using it it's a good size that's a nice size yeah I mean it's just so
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:09.640]   handy because especially like if you're not in a traditional usage sort of situation like right
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:13.960]   right here this is a situation where I've got believe I've got like an external screen like
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:18.760]   about a little perch about three feet in front of me the laptop is behind the screen and this is
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:23.720]   just on a little low table like to my to my right here like to simply reach over and just be
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:29.240]   mousing and controlling things as I go I mean I use it when I'm on the sofa I'm use it I use it
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:33.720]   like when I'm in bed it's just it's always always give you a flat stable surface uh
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:37.160]   wish to mouse on the only the only thing I don't like about it though is that I really
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:41.960]   wish that you didn't need to have these two feet on some sort of a stable surface in order to get
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:46.360]   the click you need to have this I really wish that uh you could have this on like sort of an
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:51.400]   unstable surface you could you can also set it to tap and you can set it up right you said you
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:56.040]   could set it to tap on it which is the other uh option um that's what I've been doing because I
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:59.720]   I had the same problem with I gotta order it sitting on the couch or sitting on my leg you know and
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:04.760]   what's great is the mouse you had to try to find a good location for it to scroll around and and
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:08.440]   in a busy location like you know and used to be able to use a track ball but this is way better so
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:12.760]   so you'd suggest if for instance I uh I was gonna get the 27 inch when it comes out next month
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:16.760]   for my laptop so that I can use my laptop close with the screen I have already the bluetooth
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:21.000]   keyboard I should get that yeah that is the mouse that's the way to go okay I'm actually thinking
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:26.600]   about like building myself a little table specifically for this so that I'm serious like something
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:31.960]   where it's like an integrated it's like an integrated armrest that you can put on the floor that ends
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:36.680]   with like right here so I could have sort of like a captain's chair yeah sort of effect with just
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:40.200]   putting you know what you need you need a little harness that you put over your shoulders that
[01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:44.040]   attaches it like a little tray that sticks out from your left no you do you do need kind of a
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:48.840]   Star Trek thing and then you just for all five fingers is war bait there you go you know so the
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:53.560]   yeah so my here's my my other uh so my other one which is a little bit I don't think I think
[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:58.520]   you might have recommended this Leo age yeah and I have been using this product for six months now
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:04.360]   I use it every day and it's do you still use the why things um scale yeah I was talking to someone
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:07.720]   about it I just wanted to bring it up again I don't weigh myself every day anymore I weigh myself
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:11.960]   like once a week see I weigh myself every day see here's it there's stuff yeah I see it that's my
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:16.920]   here's his here's his why things graft see this is kind of cool so it you know you do you tweet
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:22.600]   I don't tweet it see that's that's kind of so so I tweet but but the graph is great and here's the
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:26.600]   thing is it's cool because I don't want to write that down the reason that I'm doing it is because
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:30.280]   I don't want to write it down and this is the iPad app the iPhone there's an iPhone this is the
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:34.280]   iPad app which looks fantastic there's also a website that gives you the same information right
[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:38.440]   and and but I love the fact that on my iPhone or my iPad I can you know it's keeping track of all
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:41.560]   those things this is great and it and the thing is is that when you do it every day you can see
[01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:47.560]   that long straight one that was when I was in Africa right and but the the thing about it is is that
[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:51.560]   it is you just get on and you don't have to think about it and you and it keeps track of it and
[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:54.840]   it gives you this long view of where your weight's going and that's the thing if you're doing it
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:59.240]   every day at least with this graph shows you're trying to seeing the trend so it's okay to do it
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:02.280]   every day because you see a volatile it is if you do it every day but that doesn't matter that's
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:07.080]   water weight that's all kinds of other stuff that's a big meal at a at a Brazilian steak house actually
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:13.240]   was was was fat let's look at weight and weight's looking good oh yeah there's the Brazilian that's
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:17.880]   the Brazilian yeah and then I went and then and then there's the African trip and there's the trip
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:21.160]   and I got back from Africa and I started losing weight again here's when you had the diarrhea for
[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:26.120]   three weeks that's good that's good there's the intestinal flu you know and I find that I find that
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:30.280]   if you think about what you eat and then you're weighing yourself every day you actually make really
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:35.560]   interesting observations you know about about what is is going on there and this just makes all the
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:39.880]   difference and it and it so if you're interested in if you're getting into weight loss program and
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:44.920]   you use a mac or an iPhone or whatever it's expensive it's yeah but the thing is is it I don't
[01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:49.080]   know and I don't even know if it's a great scale but it's all right it's as accurate I had another
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:52.680]   I had another scale that I kind of tested it against and they were identical I don't know they
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:56.520]   were either I mean they literally I'd weigh myself right next to each other when I first got at the
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:33:00.520]   sea and so it's just as accurate as any other scale I think it's about 10 15 pounds heavy for me I
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:08.200]   don't know why so um it's anyway I love this scale it's 159 bucks I actually think that's gone down
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:11.720]   it does tweet for you if you want but that's not you don't have to have a tweet you can just have
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:16.600]   it log it yeah I don't I just have it log it I don't I don't need to tweet it I tweet yeah so the
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:21.400]   uh but but I think that um it is if you're really interested in I mean it is the best
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:26.920]   tech scale out there and you're still doing great you've lost you haven't gained your way back or
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:31.880]   now I've been about the same I've been I've lost about over the last year now I've lost about another
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:39.160]   six or ten pounds but I lost 50 the first year right so it was uh so about 60 pounds total so
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:44.120]   just to circle around Sparky tells me he's absolutely right as is often the case with an
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:51.000]   iPad app you should always check the settings in the iPad global settings because there's
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:55.800]   additional settings there for this program I can reset my delicious login so thank you Sparky
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:59.560]   for suggesting that still not kind of ideal I have to start over again with the login but at least
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:05.320]   I'll get back to my settings and it is $2.99 for River of News and now all ladies and gentlemen
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:10.760]   Mr. Andy Inato I have just bought River of News because it looked interesting enough to try thank you
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:16.040]   good demo you'll get your 18 cents or whatever you know I don't have anything for that
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:22.440]   I'm not no no I have a policy Leo of giving you a little bit but if you save me 18 cents of the
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:27.560]   course my next month you're getting that 18 cents back thank you sir I think I'll think all listeners
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:32.840]   should do that right so so that 18 cents you got like three months ago in the PayPal account
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:41.560]   that explains it it's the love uh okay my my pick is a really cool little app a little utility
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:45.480]   called witch that a lot of people are probably familiar with but if you're not boy do you want
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:53.080]   to be familiar with this you can download it from many tricks.com/witch uh it's a enhanced
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:59.480]   window switcher utility uh obviously you already have you know expose and you got all these other
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:05.720]   little built-in OS features but this is a much more finer tuned version of this uh for one thing
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:09.960]   it does one thing I really like which is that it will just give you a nice little aquified
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:14.760]   list of all the windows that are open instead of waiting for previews to be built up 40 different
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:18.840]   windows on your screen and then sort of having to kind of like peer really closely saying that
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:24.360]   looks kind of like the document window that has my interview notes on it I don't know I'm gonna
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:28.520]   have to click inside of fine see what see what that is instead you'll get a very nice little pop-up
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:34.520]   list the other cool thing that uh I've been using it for is the fact that it allows you to control
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:39.720]   exactly what apps will contribute windows to this list because I'm not necessarily need I don't
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:44.520]   necessarily need a list of the 14 finder windows I have opened I really just want to see the list
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:48.920]   of give me a list of all the Safari windows I've got open and all of the word processor windows
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:53.000]   I've opened because those are the two apps that tend to switch between when I need to find one
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.440]   specific window above all others uh so it's it's easy to tune it to the way that you need an app
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:03.000]   switcher and also you can switch you can define what the hots with with the uh hot switches are
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000]   going to be the hot keys to activate and switch between apps are going to be so if you want to use
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:12.600]   this instead of the standard command tab app switcher for instance or the standard expose trigger
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:17.080]   you can do it that way the only feature that I really wish it did have is I don't I don't know
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:22.600]   of any app that really does this I'm hoping this will appear maybe as a Safari plugin because I so
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:28.520]   often open new windows in new tabs instead of new web pages and new tabs instead of new windows
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:32.360]   so oftentimes getting a list of open windows really won't help me find that one window that
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:37.160]   I've got twitter or google reader in and so I went up just after not wanting to search through
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:41.480]   18 windows for the one tab that has google reader I'll just open a new instance of google reader I
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:46.840]   really wish that there were a utility or plugin or a new version of which that simply added
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:52.360]   added the feature uh peek inside windows for tabs and add that to the list as a feature but other
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:57.000]   than that it does streamline uh application switching and window switching it makes it a lot faster
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.880]   for me uh there's a free trial if you buy it it's something I believe it's 19 bucks uh it will
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:07.560]   let you switch 250 times in demo mode uh before you have to cough up uh but that's a good it's a
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:13.320]   really handy utility very good which I've been using this for quite some time and I agree with you
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:18.520]   it's a really it's once you get used to it I think 19 bucks a little expensive for a switcher but boy
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:22.840]   once you get used to it you have to have it if if it's a business thing and I actually I should
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:27.000]   also say they've got an app they've got an iPad app coming up called paddock that that's what brought
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:32.040]   me to the site to begin with a couple weeks ago because I talked I talked it's uh it's they say
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:35.880]   it's not a secret anymore uh remember the last week I talked about how what I would love to see is
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:41.480]   an ability to do have an application that has a tiled interface so it can have a text editor
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:46.200]   in one section of the window and be peeping in Twitter one pane and it looks like many tricks
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:51.240]   is actually developing that exact same app with this thing called paddock uh they're yeah they've
[01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:57.800]   got a video of it in operation with a couple of features that they have been redacted I think we
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:03.800]   can guess exactly what they do uh I'm uh they haven't I haven't seen a working uh it's not like I have
[01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:08.520]   a working beta of this on my iPad or anything although I would love to test it mr many tricks
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:15.720]   dot com or mrs many tricks dot com or miss or unattached mr many tricks dot com uh I'm really
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:19.800]   curious to see if apple will approve this because remember that they got uh they got a little bit
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:24.040]   of press so a few months ago for uh pulling an application because they thought it was too
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:29.480]   widget-y uh an app that they don't want you to change the desktop right so I'm wondering if
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:34.040]   I'm wondering if they will decide that this is too widget-y at app and that it has the functions of
[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:39.160]   multiple different sort of the they're not you're not running different applications but it has the
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:43.720]   functions of different applications like it's ever having a separate twitter client a separate
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:47.880]   web browser and a separate text editor you have one app that has twitter features and
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:51.080]   text editor features and this other feature I'm wondering if they're gonna
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:56.680]   if that's gonna swing with uh with the apple approval process if it's if it swings I'll be
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:00.040]   there with my 299 or my 499 because it looks like a really interesting app. I had the same
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:03.560]   misgivings when I saw it but on the other hand it is all within its own app so it's not like
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:07.960]   you're changing the desktop you're just changing it within that app so maybe there's some hope
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:11.400]   this is the thing I don't like about the apple at universe you can spend a lot of energy on

[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:14.040]   doing lots of uh of live streaming now for the members yeah I love that idea we've gone a little
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:20.040]   crazy we now have a for the for the live streaming we have a three we've an ex three and two ex ones
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:23.720]   and one of them's on a jib and we're putting one up soon we're putting one on a steady cam and then
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:29.640]   one on sticks it's mostly to train guys in house as well so it's it's a dual research thing and
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:35.720]   we got three JVC cam corners those things those are on uh on my uh and your recommendation because I
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:39.880]   think that they're those are they're 2,500 bucks so they're not the cheapies but they're not the
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:45.000]   ex one they they go straight into final cut which I love the workflow on standard SD cards yeah dual
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.240]   SD cards so the the only bummer about them is is quarter inch chips but if you shoot in a
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:52.920]   relatively well lit place they're gonna be they're great little production cameras yeah well
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:57.000]   good because we just bought 7500 bucks worth of them they're worth it it's for our green tech
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:03.000]   show they're great in the field actually we shooting in the in the yard back Alex is also
