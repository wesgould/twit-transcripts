[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Andy Alex and Mr. Jason Stenler here with lots to talk about.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.160]   We've got our new iPhones, we'll talk about the buying experience, the picking up experience,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.280]   the installation experience and some new features plus some new bugs that need to be
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:30.480]   squashed. It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:39.120]   This is Mac Break Weekly, Episode 836, recorded Tuesday, September 20, 2022. Travis, I'll take
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:59.920]   one of each.

[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.360]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the ladies and Apple News with Alex Lindsey
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.360]   from office hours dot global. Hey, Alex. It's good to be here. Good to see you.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.960]   Also, Andy and I go W.W.G.P.H. in Boston. Hey, they're either over there. Hey, hey, hey, hey,
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:05.200]   hey, hey, hey. And Jason Snell from 6colors.com. Hello. You have been, we have been all of us
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:13.760]   posting photos of the good old days. Here, here, here's me and Randall Schwartz in 2005 on a geek
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.840]   cruise, which you snapped, Jason. Yeah, that's, that's one of my, you're giving tips. You're
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.760]   going to do a Mac tip there. Sit tricks. Yep. How fun. We got way back. Yeah. I was on, you know,
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.360]   we met, we had a bunch of back world owners on some of those very first episodes of Mac Break
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.280]   Weekly. That's where we met. Back break back in the day when it was video, right? Before it was
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.080]   after we met a call for help. Yeah, it was after tech TV. And, and yeah, that was, that was all.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.520]   Yeah. So we do go back along along with it. Here we are again to 1999 and I and most likely
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.880]   here we are in 2010. Yeah. At the iPad announcement, the last Apple event I ever went to.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:01.840]   And then Alex put in some really fun images, which I won't show because we do have to do a show,
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.760]   but of old tweets, if you want to see those, they'll be on the Twit Plus feed for club members,
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.480]   because I'm sure they'll take that pre-show and edit it all up. I have in my little hands.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.560]   Okay. Now tell me if this is an Easter egg or not. So here's the, this is the iPhone 14 Pro.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:28.640]   Is that an iPod? Is that an iPod box? Isn't that interesting?
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.920]   Deltz but recycling. That's adorable. Do you think that's an Easter egg?
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.280]   That is an Easter egg. I think it has to be. The square thing is where the, you know, the, the
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.360]   manual they designed backwards from the little tiny manual, the little tiny manual. And then
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.760]   I've already removed it. Yeah. What? Yeah. What? Everyone goes through it looks for the sticker.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.000]   Like you just got to find the sticker. And then this is the, the, uh, yeah, you got one too.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.560]   And you've already, you left your cable in there because you probably don't need it.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.200]   I got cables. You got cables. But yeah, I don't know.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.840]   Does that look a little bit like? I mean, it could, it could not. It could just be a
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.400]   coinky. Hey, those are nice cables though. Like we all have them, but yeah, they're braided.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.240]   They're like really. Oh, no. These are plastic. I hate these.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.200]   These are not the braided cables. These are not the braided cables you're looking.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.760]   I'm not even on the Pro Max. I wish I wish. No, the most impressive thing about, um,
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.120]   the new iPhones is that the camera bump is so huge that they have to go into the top of the case.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.040]   Now and put it face first down is down massive. It's not the camera, but it's the camera zinger
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.280]   at now. It's the, it's the Mayan temple. I, my other son, you got a dynamic.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.840]   I think I'm gonna work it. The camera Mesa.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:45.360]   You got a dynamic on the camera Mesa. Uh, yeah. Wow. That's pretty. That's hefty.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.240]   In fact, so much so that when I put it on an easel, the charging easel, it's kind of like
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.800]   tilts up. It's pretty bad. I mean, this is why like on the Pixel six,
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.600]   you know, that, that, that horizontal camera bar, it looked really weird, but then you
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.720]   appreciate that. Well, now I can, it, it basically spreads the entire bump across the entire back.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.480]   So it doesn't jiggle when you have it like face down or face up on the table.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.200]   But remember that, remember the time when like all kinds of Apple people like all the,
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.840]   all the style wonks and design wonks like, Oh, look at that camera bump on that Nokia.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.520]   Apple would never do something quite so vulgar as that. Yeah.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.240]   Yeah. It's a good solution. I'm glad they got over that.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.240]   If they made it 50% stick out more and then just made the whole thing of battery to even it out.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.640]   So it was flat. I'd be a hundred percent. A telescope. Yeah. Exactly.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.920]   I mean, I would stick out like a little James Bond thing. You know, I think I
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.880]   there it is kind of an acknowledgement that these are really not phones anymore.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.240]   They're cameras. Yeah. With some, I mean, that's really big upgrade.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.280]   Right. The biggest upgrade on the, on the phone every year is the camera.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.640]   It is made of camera. Yeah. The other stuff we're doing the best we can.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.240]   Yeah. Yeah. We're trying. So easy feature explain. Yeah.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:07.120]   Hey, like to just updated for the camera. Have you been taking any
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.160]   Alex, any raw, pro raw images? Yeah. They're big.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.400]   Because you're wondering. Yeah. More than 48 megapits.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:21.600]   75 megabytes. Yeah. They're massive. A lot of resolution. I mean, you really want to do it in a
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.600]   well lit area. So well lit, you're getting in a lot of data. When you get into a darker area,
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.840]   of course, you start to see the you if it gets too dark, of course, it just switches at night mode,
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.560]   and you're going to get 12 megabits, right? So it drops down automatically if it's going to start
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.960]   needing more light. But I took some out of the back of my house and there's a lot of data there
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.880]   to work with. I mean, it's it's pretty impressive. I am seeing on Reddit mostly.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:55.440]   Photographers say that in fact, because of the dynamic range of these DNGs,
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.480]   in fact, I've seen some images where they look dark. If you expose for the highlights and they
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:07.120]   look dark, but you can pull it up because there's so much data in there. And I saw somebody say,
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.160]   you know, he's nobody has yet done the effect. It's almost impossible to do to do the dynamic
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:19.120]   range of these DNGs that they're shooting, but the pro Ross. But they are a pre he says,
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.360]   when he goes in a directly in the light room, appreciably more dynamic range than in his full
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:29.600]   frame, Sony's like they're 11 there. They're test out at about 11 stops. He's saying we're
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.920]   getting closer to 15 stops on this. I think the only thing I would say is that it's just a lot
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.480]   more grainy. Like it's you definitely I definitely see the grain, you know, in it. It's, you know,
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:44.080]   taking that many pixels and putting into that small of a space, you know, the photosites are
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.920]   going to have more ratta. And that that seems to be indicative of the pictures I've seen that I've
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.680]   taken so far. Here's from halide, the exposed for highlights. So this is done the left. This is
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.160]   what you would have would see as a JPEG. And then if you take the raw out and you bring up,
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.800]   bring up the background. That's pretty nice. Details pretty amazing.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:08.240]   Yeah. It doesn't look too that grainy. I will say that the when you zoom all the way in, I mean,
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.480]   we're not zoomed in on there. So but when you zoom all the way in, I felt when I zoomed up,
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.800]   I could see more grain in it just because of and that's something that I would expect.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.120]   But the dynamic range, it still means you could take a raw at 48 megapixels,
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.000]   bring it up to wherever you want, and then take it down to the resolution that you're
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.440]   going to use it at. And all that grain will go away. It'll just be, you know,
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.800]   I see in the sky, I see, yeah, I see some grain, but you're right. If you
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:36.320]   collapsed, I'd say the night mode to a pretty impressive.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.080]   Yeah. Look how the start you see some stars there. And you know, that's kind of interesting.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.720]   Yeah. Well, even when it goes into the night mode, I took a picture of our cat like when it was
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.200]   dark and it was, you could tell because the cat's eyes, you know, their irises are all the way open.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.760]   It was really dark and it looked totally fine. It was quite a thing. It's a good, it's a good
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.840]   camera. Good enough to say, Oh, I'm going to train in my 13 or 12 and get this 48 megapixel.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.760]   For a raw. Let's care about the camera. Yeah. I mean, if you care about the camera,
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.120]   that makes sense. I mean, it's just it depends on how important the pictures are that you're
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.000]   taking with those cameras. You know, we're, I think that I was excited to get the 14,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.440]   have my wife switch up. I think she's got either an eight or 10 and get her up to 13 because,
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.600]   you know, every time she took pictures of the kids, it was a bummer.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.200]   It was like, well, that's you know, like, so, so the,
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:29.040]   Is it the case only if you're willing to edit this pro Ross or even without even
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.000]   no, I think the 12 makes are 12 or significantly more detailed as well. I mean,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.520]   they're definitely benefiting from a larger sensor that's been because it's basically
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:44.400]   oversampling that that 12 megapixel. So it's, it is when it comes back down to that and using the
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:49.280]   binning, it definitely feels like there's a lot more detail there. By the way, it's a,
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.720]   it sounds very much like if you're a, if you fancy yourself an iPhone photographer,
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.120]   you should probably upgrade to this model because it is that much more. If you're a casual
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.920]   photographer, I mean, you know, I don't think it necessarily motivates an update. When you get
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.680]   there, you will be very happy about it. I actually think for casual photographers, that 2x setting
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.800]   where it's cropping the 12 megapixels in the center of the frame is a more important feature
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.880]   than shooting raw because those people aren't going to be shooting raw. But if you are somebody who
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.280]   actually thinks about shooting raw, you use halide that update, you know, one of the clever
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.280]   things that halide does that Apple won't do is it'll let you shoot raw and also put out a modified
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.000]   JPEG that's actually like usable right away, which is also kind of nice.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.360]   Yeah, I actually put halide on my front screen right above the camera icon.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.120]   Maybe I don't, I'm not quite ready to replace the Apple camera with halide. It's good to have both,
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.680]   right? It's, yeah. It's, yeah. It's, yeah. I find with all of those, most of what I shoot is with the
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:53.920]   Apple, with the Apple camera. And then I have, I use Filmic for some things. I play with halide.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.920]   I don't use it on a day-to-day basis. And so, you know, day-to-day, I just take pictures with the
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.680]   camera because I want it to just work and I get frustrated when it doesn't, but it, but that's the
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.200]   one thing that happens there. Yeah, it's nice just to have a camera right away. Yeah.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.000]   Oh, I got to shoot it. Yeah, exactly. What is, I don't understand. So there's three lenses on here,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.960]   but they have four settings. They have the .5, the 1X, 2X, and 3X. Huh?
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:24.080]   Yeah. Beautiful. But it's not, they don't map to the lenses. So the, the, the 1X is the main camera.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:31.120]   2X is the main camera with the quad pixel binning turned off and instead it's going to crop to the
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.760]   12. So it's not a digital zoom, but you're cropping to the 12 megapixel. So you're not going to get
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.080]   that advantage in low light conditions of the binning, but you are going to get every pixel
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.240]   of a 12 megapixel image. It's going to be cropped at the center of the sensor. And then 3X is the
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.400]   telephone. Would you be better off shooting 1X and cropping in, in the editing?
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:56.160]   Uh, not what you, well, if you shoot 2X or shoot 1X, then it, then it's pixel binning.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.480]   Right. And so you're going to lose that. So what you're doing is you're trading the extra detail
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:07.200]   and light capture of, which especially matters in low light of the pixel binning for the actual
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.360]   individual pixels of that 12 megapixel. Mostly stay in 1X.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:18.880]   If everything was brightly lit, I think you could shoot a 2X if it was a better frame and it would
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.280]   be just fine keeping in mind that, you know, your alternative is going into 48 megapixel raw mode
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.600]   at that point. If you really want to get those extra pixels, that this is the only, it's actually
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.640]   the only situation outside of raw mode where Apple is going to be individual pixels on the sensor
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.520]   is in 2X mode. Otherwise, it's going to bin all of those down and you're going to get a 12 megapixel
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.680]   output. So it sort of depends on what you want to do. But if I was in a situation where I wanted to
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.360]   frame it and the 2X was a better frame, I would just shoot it in the 2X.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:52.240]   Yeah. It's weird, but the, the, the plain 1X camera and no matter what phone you have with the
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:58.960]   iPhone 13, 12, 14, that's almost always going to give you the cleanest image. Like the telephoto
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.040]   is great. All the computational stuff is great, but they almost, but almost every maker,
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.280]   Apple included, make sure that that's the sensor that gets the widest aperture. That's the one
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:12.160]   that has the greatest light sensitivity. And sometimes if things are a little bit sketchy in the lighting
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:17.520]   situation or the, or people moving too fast or anything like that, you find that going to the
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.520]   plane, trying to force it to the 1X camera will give you the cleanest, sharpest image. And then you,
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:27.120]   then you go into like a, your, your, your on camera apps to, excuse me, your on phone apps to adjust
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.920]   the brightness and stuff like that. But you find that the, you avoided like the high ISO, you avoided
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.400]   like the motion blur, you have, you got real depth of field instead of like sort of a hinky version of
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:41.360]   it. It's a weird thing to try to remember, but sometimes it pays off. It's very confusing because
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:47.920]   you really don't get the ProRough 48 megapixels unless you use the main camera, the 1X. Is that right?
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.400]   Right. Right. Yeah. That's the only 48 megapixel sensor.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:56.160]   So just keep that in mind. I don't know. Here's,
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.160]   it does come up. I've seen a lot of people saying, wow, I can't believe this 48 megapixel sensor.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.320]   It's amazing. Here's something from macro mode. Yeah. Yeah. It's like macro mode is not on that one.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.960]   Macro mode is using the wide, the wide, the wide camera to shoot macro mode's great,
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.440]   but it's not really any or much greater than it was on the last model.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:19.280]   And just to reiterate ProRough, the reason it's 75 megapixels is, yeah, it has all of the data from
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:25.280]   the 48 megapixel sensor, but then it also includes all the computational information that the
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:34.240]   iPhone has, right? So it's more than just a raw, raw. It's not just the bits from the sensor.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:41.520]   It's a lot of extra information from the iPhone. So if you, the people who are saying on Reddit
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:48.400]   that they prefer to use Lightroom said you won't really get a very good edit in iPhoto because
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.200]   it's, it's going to still kind of give you the J-Pig. It's going to work on the J-Pig and the J-Pig
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:15:01.280]   dynamic range. It's very complicated, I guess. I don't know. I'll just say that the number of times
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.480]   where I think that, oh, well, gee, I'm a fancy photographer. I've got a really expensive, really
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.280]   nice camera. I have really great class. I'm going to apply these skills and this knowledge to using
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.760]   my phone camera. I'm going to get pictures that are 10 times better than anybody else. And then
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:20.720]   every time I try to outthink the computational photography model, I regret it so badly. It's like
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:26.000]   that one button has so much thinking and so much development behind it that usually I just trust
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.920]   that one button. So confusing. Yeah, just take the, just use the Apple camera. Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:39.200]   Yeah, it's one of those. If you have to ask, then don't ask kind of thing.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.360]   Let's just like you know if you need it and if you don't need it, don't turn it on.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.800]   Yeah, if you're super expert. I mean, they have, if you go in the
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.680]   Haline settings, by the way, Haline is now a subscription, unfortunately, but I think worth it.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.880]   Yeah, if it keeps them in business, it keeps them updating. Absolutely.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.880]   And if you go into the settings, now you suddenly have all of these
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:07.200]   capture formats, including something they call ProRaw Plus, which is the DNG plus the HEIC.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.680]   Yeah, that's the thing I was saying that Apple doesn't give you, but Halide will,
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:18.960]   where they will, they will write out a JPEG basically or a HEAF file that is their best guess on what
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:24.240]   it should look like. And that means you get a more traditional file format that you could share or
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:29.760]   use without having to go in and open the raw and convert it. And that's something that Apple
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:35.040]   doesn't want to really give you. Should I? Okay, so I'm going to go with ProRaw Plus.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:42.400]   12 megapixels of 48. That's what it will choose on the main sensor.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:48.000]   Right. You can switch back if you want. I'm going to, I guess, stay in 12. I don't know.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.960]   Well, I mean, come on, little, little, little, little, little, little, go for it.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.360]   This is back break weekly. I think you got to use some new stuff.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:01.920]   Save ProRaw files a 10 bit. No, screw that, right? Alex, save them in all the bits.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.280]   All the bits. All the bits.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:10.640]   Coverage. What's coverage can get the best possible shots, but takes longer to take two
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.880]   shots. This makes capturing images slower, but JPEG images significantly higher.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.960]   The setting has no effect. I'll thank God when shooting ProRaw. So I'm not going to worry about
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.760]   that. Well, I think, yeah, I think that's one of those things where it's taking multiple
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:29.600]   images on multiple cameras in case you miss. Holy come, holy. Save lossless TIFF in max format.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:34.000]   I don't even know. If you know what it is, you know, if you need it.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.280]   You know, if you need it and I don't. I just want to get a picture of my kitty.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:42.880]   Well, okay. That's the whole thing is that it's no longer. I just want a picture of my
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.120]   kids or my kitty. It's like we're turning this into, especially in the ProN, we're turning this
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.760]   into a machine that you can really generate content with. An amazing capture device,
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:56.880]   just for photos, but for all the data on the photos. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty cool.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.720]   All right. So that's the camera. Anything else to say about the camera?
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:07.760]   I just wanted to mention I did a few shots using action mode this weekend. And it's amazing,
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:12.640]   right? Like you would not want to leave it on because it is going to degrade the quality of the
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:20.400]   image. It's it's using a lot of the edges of the sensor in order to do stabilization. But
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:26.160]   it really is like you turn it on and it's like you're using a gimbal. It's really quite remarkable.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:31.520]   So I think it's going to be great for, you know, that's where a regular person can turn that
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.000]   feature on when they're shooting their kids football game or soccer game or whatever,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.960]   or anything that's got action or people doing like anything where you're moving the camera a lot.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:46.480]   And you're going to get something that just feels way better than a, you know, simple
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:52.160]   image stabilization, which is which we have that's mostly to eliminate shake and keep everything
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:57.760]   clear. But the action mode really is like steady cam mode. It's it's it's pretty good. It's not
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:03.840]   perfect, but it's it's very impressive that it's all just my shaky hand. And it comes out looking
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:09.200]   like it's got, you know, it's a camera on a track with a floating head and, you know, it's it's
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:14.720]   pretty amazing. You can't do that in anything but the 1x, right? Because you need the off. I don't
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:18.640]   know. Yeah, I think so. I think I think you know the pixels. I think that's I think that's right.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.280]   Yeah, it's a specific mode too, right? You got it. You got to go in that you have to turn on that
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:28.560]   video. And then I think this is it up at the top. Is there a little running man running guy?
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:34.240]   Yeah, action mode more light required. Oh, it switched to the ultra wide. So maybe it's.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.560]   Okay. So maybe that's what it needs. Oh, no, it'll work there too. I can do it in all of them.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:43.120]   It looks like action little running man in all the modes, but you do need a lot of light.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:47.840]   It's interesting. It actually tells you more light required. That's kind of cool. So in daylight,
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:53.120]   though, you know, this would be it. Yeah, it is. It is literally a feature you only want to use
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:59.520]   outside in bright light because it is doing a lot of weird stuff in order to get that output.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.600]   But the output spectacular. You know, a really well-lit room. If you were doing like a basketball
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.680]   game or something, I'm sure we'd probably be okay. But it's like it's that it's for it's for that.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:15.120]   It's for sports. How about a rod your waters concert. Hey, one surprise tip.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:21.920]   Not recommended. I didn't haven't yet got my case because, you know, they're making it or something.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.880]   But I have my old iPhone 12 case. Wow. Look at that. It fits right in there. No problem.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.280]   No problem. So I'm using the old case except.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:35.040]   There's a camera a little problem. It's just a little bit, not too bad. I don't know what lens
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.840]   that one is. It's got a little edge. You only see the old. Get some scissors. Yeah, you know,
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.600]   I may just cut that out there. Just got a little exacto knife.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:48.160]   Exactly. But the main bob, the body fits in. So it's exactly the same
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:54.000]   dimensions. And even the, I mean, it's not a perfect fit for the on off buttons, but it's close
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:02.160]   enough. I can do it. So just a little tip for you. You know, the the silencer switch is just a little
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:08.240]   apple did not really redesign us now. It's very interesting because I fix it says there was a
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:17.120]   big redesign in the iPhone 14, not the pro, but the they have upgraded now. I fix it.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.600]   The repairability of the iPhone 14 to seven out of 10, which is the highest and iPhones been
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:27.040]   in years and years and years. Yeah. They were really excited about like replacing the back glass.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:33.920]   Now it's rather required a much, much stronger adhesive before. So a lot more finicky to get rid
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:39.840]   of it. Now they say that much, much weaker adhesive. So it's easier to get at plus just fewer clips,
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.800]   essentially this is a common repairs now. They just doesn't it as much, much, much easier to
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.520]   perform when they were on or previous phones, including the iPhone 14 pro, you have to get at
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:54.080]   stuff from the front. You open up the front and you dig down. That makes it easier to replace the
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:59.360]   screen easier to replace screen harder to replace everything else. Now it's a I fix it says this
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:05.280]   is the iPhone 14 reborn is a beautiful butterfly. The mid frame is in the middle. Don't say
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.960]   butterfly. Don't say butterfly. Please use your PTSD from the accessible screen on the left
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.920]   removable rear glass on the right. So that's kind of cool. So you can get in from both sides,
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:23.520]   which makes it much easier to repair. They gave Apple big props for this. They said this was not
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:29.360]   easy to do. They worked really hard on this. I feel like Apple has been there's this general
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:34.480]   trend and includes their new repair program. But I feel like that behind the scenes, Apple has
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.680]   been making their stuff slowly, but surely more repairable. Part of that is that it's a more
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:45.360]   mature category. And I think that they feel like they've got the room now to do some of this one
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.560]   before they were trying to cram everything in and glue everything together in order to fit. But I
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.360]   think also it's a financial calculation because you know, if an iPhone in certain circumstances,
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:00.000]   if an iPhone breaks under warranty, right, like Apple has to make those repairs and it's hard.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.680]   Nobody repairs more Apple devices than Apple itself, right? And so on one level, I do think that
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.320]   somebody maybe came in and said, we're spending a lot of money on repairs. Can you make it more
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:17.760]   repairable? And I know it's only in the in the 14 right now, but this is a I suspect we're going
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:22.320]   to see more of this in future iPhone models as well, like that they want to make the individual
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:27.840]   pieces a lot more accessible because not just to make I fix it happy, right? But bottom line stuff
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:34.800]   that it saves Apple time and or money to do their own repairs of their products under warranty.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:42.640]   Highest repairability score since the iPhone 7 according to I fix it. Now they did point out
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:48.800]   it looks like you will have to do software activation of some parts, which is kind of like the John
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:55.600]   Deere thing. Yeah, that's too bad. It's not so nice. That's kind of unclear and it may even be
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:01.600]   possible to do that as a third party. So good. Well, I don't know that you're going to be able to
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.200]   order your own back as part of the iPhone repair program. Sure. At some point here in the next few
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:10.880]   months, your own glass back and not only will it be a lot cheaper because you'll only be replacing a
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.920]   much cheaper part, but it'll be a lot easier because you unscrew some screws and you can pull it off
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.080]   and replace it. So in the end, even if you don't, if you want to repair it yourself, you're going to
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.080]   be able to do it and it'll be much cheaper and less harrowing. Rest taking the expensive to replace
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:30.880]   the back on a iPhone 14 Pro Max or a 13. It's like what? Because they have to take the whole,
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:35.360]   they get to go from the top down. Essentially disassemble the entire phone
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:43.840]   in order to fix the back. That's not going to be true on the 14 nothing. And I presume at some point
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:50.640]   on all iPhones. One thing though, they also learned losing the SIM tray doesn't save any space. They
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:57.600]   still have a place for it. It can't because it's not lost on any other model worldwide. This is more
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:04.560]   of a, I don't know, a test in the US in order to do this. But they talk about, you could put an SD
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:09.760]   slot in there. And I guess you could. But what's really going to happen is the next version is not
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:14.080]   going to have it anywhere in the world. And they're going to have, they're going to use that space.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:19.600]   Right? That's the long term effect here. But they're not going to design a whole other feature
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.320]   that takes up a whole other set of space inside this thing. But only on the US models. They just
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:30.000]   omit it from the US models. Yeah. And I think that it's probably safe to say that the iPhone 14 is
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.320]   also a test. Like, well, let's see how this works. They're not using as much glue. Let's see if it,
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.960]   if there's reliability issues or if anything, doesn't work. And then it would make sense. Yeah,
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:44.480]   this is part of Apple's always doing that long game thing. But they're gradually
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:52.240]   and realize and realize the first, first, the first wave of people who get these phones,
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:58.640]   they are going to be watched very, very closely by, by Apple engineers. There's, there's usually
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:05.120]   sort of a hunting license that they're given out from a Cupertino to Apple Genius Bar saying,
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:10.640]   we would like to give you here are some, here are some shipping containers. We want to see five
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.360]   examples of iPhone 14s that failed because of water ingress. We want to see three examples of
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:19.440]   a crack back screen. We want to see eight examples of a back, whatever, whatever. And those are the
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:24.800]   times where you can come in saying, Hi, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe that if slipped out of
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:29.040]   my pocket, it bounced out of my car. I managed to get on the third bounce. But the screen is
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:34.320]   all correct. It's my responsibility. I did it. And then you find out that, Oh, no problem. We will
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.320]   replace it for you for free because we're awesome. And because we try to take care of your phone.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.960]   And also because again, because this is a brand new product, they want to see they want to get
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.800]   some of the stuff back and see how did it break? Why did it break? And how can they prevent things
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.400]   from breaking in the future? Do not drop your iPhone 14. However,
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:27:00.080]   do it. Don't do it. Phone buff YouTube channel dropped a bunch of iPhones and some Samsung S22s
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:08.240]   to see how they fared. TLDR. It was a tie. Don't don't don't just don't.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:17.120]   Even though that you know, iPhone apples are touting this new gorilla glass Apple ceramic shield
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:24.320]   that you know, maybe, I mean, maybe Samsung also has a ceramic shield of some kind. But yeah,
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:29.120]   they still break. They still break phone boxes. I hate, I hate these tests. I hate them too.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:34.000]   Not only do I hate them because they these guys are, I mean, it's their money to buy a new phone
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.080]   and then and then break it. I remember when the original iPhone came out and we got we waited
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:42.960]   in line to get ours and the as a PC world waited in line to get theirs and immediately started
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.920]   throwing it on the ground to see if it would break. What are you doing? But the big problem is
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:53.040]   you can't test it like this. I think fundamentally you can't test it like what do they just dropping
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:58.160]   it? They just dropping it. Yeah, and it's one phone and it's certain angles. It's like to really
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:02.560]   test this and that's why nobody but the manufacturers can really test it. You really would want to do
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.840]   it like with a hundred different phones with a bunch of exact angles and see what the different
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:12.640]   points are. And here it's like it's like a random throw of the dice about what the landing was
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.840]   and what the force was and I don't know. I was waiting for my case. I was waiting for my case
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:23.120]   and I saw I've been carrying it around a little bit on its own. I've dropped it twice and I can't
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:27.760]   even find a mark on it. Like I and every time I both times I dropped it, I dropped it last night
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:32.000]   at dinner and I was like really good ramen place we were talking about in San Rafael and
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   fell off the thing. I looked down and I was like it was like face down. I was like well there you go.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:45.040]   And the truth is I've been broving the screen in years. The reality is like it's not like the
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:50.160]   new glass coating or the new sapphire coating will make it impervious. It's a little like they're
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:55.360]   waterproofing too. It's like well we took the water ingress from dropping it in a toilet from
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:05.360]   90% to 30% or we took the drops. Like people like Alex would drop this phone and it would break
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:12.400]   700 times out of a thousand. Now it's 200 times. It's the odds.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:18.400]   Usually I have it in a case. I have a screen protector. I haven't had a nick on one for four or five
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.360]   years because I just immediately move into a case and this one just happened to be different.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.640]   And I was like I can't believe that I did that. And that's why I stuck mine on the old case because
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.200]   even if I don't leave it again until it gets fixed. I will say that the one thing I did learn is
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.520]   that if you are updating your new iPhone when you're on your old iPhone, I was on a phone call with
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.920]   my old iPhone and I'm sitting there typing away like yes, yes, yes, yes, yes on the new phone because
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.680]   I was excited to turn it on. And it just took the sim. Like it just took it took my phone call.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:49.280]   And then I had like there was like three minutes I couldn't call them back because the phone is
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:54.320]   in the middle of its update. And I'm like now I'm just like how fast can I get? No, no, I'll do
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.760]   that later later later later later because I'm trying to call someone back because it but it
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:03.360]   literally just grabbed onto the sim and moved the move my phone number over. I would have been
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:10.400]   really cool. We decided to be really cool. If it grabbed onto the sim and kept the phone call.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:16.080]   From one phone to the I'm going to hand off the phone call that you were on on the other
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.880]   on the other phone. But you hear that the other I just did that was the turn off sound you could
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:25.840]   turn the boot chime on. Now it has a boot chime. I'm gonna turn it back on. Let's see if it makes
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:31.840]   a sound as it boots. Oh, it should go bong though like a Mac. Don't you think?
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.960]   And then the swish thing sounded about three and a half in Sony disc right.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:51.280]   Somebody somebody should offer that as alternative boots sounds. I don't think they can do it because
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:56.000]   it's I think it's in the firmware. I think because it's before any OS even loads it's
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:04.480]   making it sound. The other factor both of the drop tests is that oftentimes like you think
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:10.400]   you drop it you do exactly what Alex did you like. I'm gonna give myself eight seconds before I
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:14.000]   turn the pick this up and turn this over because for the next eight seconds I don't know for a
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.040]   fact that I just destroyed my phone. But then you pick it up and say okay wow okay I can't believe
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.800]   I dodged that bullet. But what you don't know is that you might have caused a micro fracture that
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:28.160]   will make it more prone to break the next time or over time if you drop it you now start to forget
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:33.200]   the number of times you drop it and now you think that oh well gee this is it says it's waterproof
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:37.760]   till like two meters. I'm gonna take pictures of my kid having his swim class and then most of
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:42.000]   you like one of those drops like kind of like broke the seal the adhesive that's causing that
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.240]   stuff and so now that it's gonna actually kill the thing. So I'm never actually taking it in the water.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.640]   I still put it in a water case.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:57.200]   Yeah exactly it's like it's so it's so easy to get like even just you're sort of like you know
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:03.520]   halfway for 50 bucks you can get sort of a halfway case where no it's not like gasketed with steel
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.360]   bolts holding it together pressurized to the marion is trench or something like that. But at
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:12.800]   least like it's the first thing that will fail before the big fail and like every time someone's
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:17.680]   someone's throwing me oh look my kid is learning how to take underwater photography but there's
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:22.320]   another phone I'm like oh don't use it as an underwater camera go just I'll give you a
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:27.520]   $300 camera so get an action cam because it costs like no name one will cost you 150 bucks and you
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:31.520]   can take great pictures underwater. Just for all the claims that Apple continues to make about
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:38.400]   water ingress on the iPhone I just want to be clear here if it fails you pay. Yes that's it.
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:43.760]   They do not cover water ingress it's not covered under the warranty if the water they're saying
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:48.240]   yeah it probably they're really talking about like if you drop it in the toilet like I said before
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:53.280]   if you drop in the toilet it probably won't die and whereas in the old days it certainly would die
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:58.080]   but they're not saying drop take it swimming like they're don't do that. I could tell you from
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:02.880]   first-person experience the first thing they do is they shine a little light in the lightning port
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:08.240]   and they look at they there's the paper in there that turns blue when it's been immersed and they
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:13.120]   go oh you got an water doing it. But still we haven't talked about this in a while but they do there
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:18.320]   is sort of an informal like we're awesome policy where if you if you are completely honest and you
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:22.480]   said oh I can't I was just stupid I would jump to the pool I forgot that I had this in my pocket
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:28.560]   can you fix it and can you do anything for me there's a possibility without a promise that they
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.960]   will say you know what you did it was an accident you tried to take good care of it we're awesome we
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.720]   want you to be happy so we're replacing your phone but realize that this was out of warranty we didn't
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.320]   have to do this and we were just doing this because we're awesome it's worth it's worth asking and
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:45.360]   it's worth always worth being completely honest because if you come in there with I know I was
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:49.520]   just using it like a normal phone and now just stop working and I want to know what you are going
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:53.760]   to do about it. Well you especially want to be honest if you actually immersed it on camera
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:34:01.840]   yeah in a podcast when I brought it in. Dead giveaway. The guy said yeah I saw I saw what you did.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:10.000]   I was telling remember that remember they had these guys at CES they said oh you know you sent us
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.360]   the phone we'll coat the whole thing with this polymer so it's water and CES they had these
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:20.880]   phones in in aquariums you know just sitting there with working so I said well let's test it and
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:26.400]   so I sent it into them and I got it back and I put in a glass of water in me and immediately failed.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:31.840]   I can't remember if they gave me a new phone I don't I don't think they did I think I had to buy
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:36.320]   it but I think I was at a discount rate or something like that it wasn't I don't think I paid full
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:43.120]   freight anyway that's a long time ago when I was young and naive let's take a break
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:49.520]   uh and come back in just a little bit there's still lots to talk about Alex Lindsay
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:56.000]   Jason Snell Andy Inaco Mac Break Weekly is on the air I showed today brought to you by
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:05.040]   New Relic I know a lot of devs some of the most curious people in the world they always you know
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:10.160]   want to explore the newest technology they dig into the documentation they they you know I
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.400]   and I put myself in this category we not only want to know how things work we want to know why
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:20.160]   they work that way and if you're a developer you or an engineer that's kind of part of your job
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:26.240]   isn't it that's why so many engineers turn to New Relic New Relic gives you all the data you need
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:30.800]   about what you build shows you what's really happening in your software life cycle a single
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:37.760]   place to see the data from your entire stack I mean the cloud I mean the edge I mean everywhere
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.680]   you don't have to look into a bunch of different tools make those connections manually New Relic
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:47.200]   has all the tools you need in one single app and New Relic will pinpoint issues down in the line
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:52.880]   of code so you know exactly why the problems are happening where they're happening and how to fix
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:58.880]   it quick that's why Dev and Ops teams at DoorDash and GitHub and Epic Games and more than 14,000
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:05.600]   other companies use New Relic to debug and improve their software when teams come together around data
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:10.480]   it lets you triage problems or lets you be confident decisions reduce the time needed to
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:16.880]   implement resolutions and you're doing it using data not opinions not some guy's idea but the facts
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:22.720]   use the data platform made for the curious right now you get access to the whole New Relic platform
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.880]   and 100 gigabytes of data per month free forever no credit card nothing
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:32.560]   that's right the entire platform and 100 gigabytes of data a month free forever so there's no reason
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:43.840]   not to do this sign up at new relic.com/macbreak and E.W.R.E.L.I.C.com/macbreak we thank New Relic so much for
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:47.760]   supporting Macbreak weekly I encourage you to use that address so they know you saw it here
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:54.640]   that helps us new relic.com/macbreak thank you New Relic
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:37:04.400]   let's see here well if you haven't yet bought your iPhone you might be waiting although not so
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:11.280]   much I noticed I could pick up a iPhone 14 the one that's easily repairable tomorrow the iPhone
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:18.880]   14 pro not so much we're talking now October maybe even November I guess I should go to the store
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:25.760]   and find out let's just let's just go shopping don't let me push the button okay I can't I already
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:35.840]   I already have one I don't need one oh you want a gold one don't you you want five 12 don't you
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:40.400]   one terabyte one terabyte well I think that's gonna let's see you know you have to go through all of
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:46.480]   this stuff before you can even see when you're gonna get it and I've clicked all the buttons and it says
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:53.200]   October 26th through November 2nd maybe what if I maybe if I just suck did you just say sucka
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:38:00.000]   if I cut it down to 128 gigs no no luck maybe if I get like oh the one no one's gonna get the
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:08.880]   terabyte no luck it's all the same uh rats how about if I don't get gold I found that gold was
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:14.640]   the easiest to get that's why I have a gold one I think black is the most popular I mean it seems
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:19.520]   like almost everybody that waited more than about four or five hours is somewhere yeah yeah
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:26.240]   yeah I ordered it I think I mentioned this last week right away 506 508 yeah 508 whenever I was
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:30.240]   able to get it I was at 508 I think you might have been 506 I thought well we're not you know that
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:36.320]   was Lisa's and she's not gonna till sometime next week so that's why I went back at 830 and I
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:39.520]   searched around for what's the crappiest phone no one wants
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:47.600]   so is it pro easier to get let's just let's just see if a pro pro is easier to get is it all
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:53.920]   October 26th oh I have to go through the whole order process again if I shift that
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:58.880]   that that that that no apple remember you can always haunt your local apple store
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.880]   a little sooner shipments in the morning yeah yeah if you go in the morning and see
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:09.520]   if I do in store pick up you may get it so I so that's what I did uh it was 830 in the morning
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:13.920]   because I had you know I couldn't get through I had you know I did that whole thing where you
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:18.240]   set it all up ahead of time and it still didn't work but it worked out for me because when I the
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:23.200]   one I did for Lisa was was how I did that and she's not getting a hers for another week so I got up
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:29.600]   have my coffee said let well let's go see searched around I found a gold one at the at the uh
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:37.920]   uh quarter Madeira apple store at 3 30 to 345 they said and then you get a QR code in your phone
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:44.000]   I go down there and you know I sit on a bench with a bunch of other people waiting for my exact time
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.880]   show them the QR code they say great get in that line I said oh no it's like eight people ahead of me
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:57.600]   but I timed it eight minutes from that point to getting the phone fast the rep was very nice Suzanne
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:02.720]   she said uh it's you know it's no it's e-sim you want to help me with help you with activation I said I
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:08.160]   think I could figure it out what do I do call them go on the web she said yeah I said okay fine
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:14.880]   so I got it a meat and I had my old phone next to it turn it on it says you want to upgrade from
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:20.080]   your old phone I said yes as of course as one does and then says oh you want to move the activation
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:27.440]   from T mobile on the old phone the new one I said yeah yeah okay it's done done getting phone calls
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:33.360]   while you do it that's what I did yeah you made a call while you were doing it I was on the call
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:37.760]   while I was setting up the other phone and I was like doo doo doo doo doo just setting it up while I was talking to
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:42.160]   like going to one of my producers and suddenly just like disappeared because it just we have deactivated
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:47.360]   your phone sir yeah just switch to the other phone Alex just it's over there now we put it on
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.880]   line but the only thing that would have been cool is if it had just kept the call going but
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:55.840]   I'll say that it was great yeah it it's I like how it also phrases it is like I found your phone
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.680]   number and would you like me to move this number to the other phone I thought that that was like
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:04.640]   you know not talking about e-sims or sims or anything like that like I'm going to move your phone
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:09.680]   number from this phone to this other phone is that okay and you say yes and it's like all right
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:16.720]   done there you go awesome love it that was yeah I think even the even Suzanne the wonderful apple
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:21.360]   employee didn't hadn't done it yet because she was like well we could take you the front of the
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:26.320]   store and well I said is the web is it a phone call she says yeah I'm not sure I said yeah that's
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:30.720]   why we used to do it remember in the old days with CDMA you'd have to call Verizon and say I'm
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:36.560]   activating a new phone I got hated those days so the experience was very good eight minutes got it
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.760]   they were very nice did not now I'd seen some people say they there's a lot of upsell what you
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:46.080]   know you're sure you want you want apple care don't you or you need it case no upsell she want
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.840]   anything else with that I said no maybe it was because I'm seeing a long line to get through that
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:54.160]   yeah they were moving fast move move move move anything to talk to you about well it's funny because
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:58.720]   so you showed they get they a person comes to you you stand with her at the kind of the front of the
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:04.560]   store she says they'll be bringing it up and so somebody kind of just comes brings the phone to her
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.600]   and then she gives it to me I spent that said you want it at that time go ahead what'd you do I
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:15.040]   spent that time trying to persuade her to give me one of those masks about how great did it work
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:20.800]   who made them and did it work no that I can't give you one we get one per day dude I'm not giving
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:25.200]   you a lot of it we're not like you're not like you're not like I worked around it right up until
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:29.680]   the very end and I was like do you have any of those they'd rather no I can't give you one so
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:34.640]   I was it was a it was a positive experience because you know I I remember waiting in line for many
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:39.680]   an iPhone especially the first one I was in one at least eight hours compared to eight minutes
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.640]   this is a much better experience this is quarter of a dare yeah
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:48.000]   then we went to a meringues for dinner and I took pictures of ravioli it was great it was
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.960]   perfect perfect meringues is a good place to test it's a perfect day I said honey can we go to
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:43:01.760]   meringues she said I hate meringues come on okay fine it's it's old school you get a great martini
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:06.480]   but because of covid they no longer make the Caesar salad at your table which I was disappointed
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:13.200]   that was fun our waitress Pamela very nice she'd been there I think a long time
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.480]   looked like it she said yeah I hated make those seizures
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:21.440]   I'm glad I have to do it anymore all right fine
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:28.400]   yeah so that everybody else similar experience well Jason you probably are using a loner now
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:34.240]   yeah although I did get I got my son's college phone first his first non-hammy down and it came
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:40.400]   you know that morning first thing knock knock on the door nine you know nine fifteen a.m. or something
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:45.440]   and there it was so he wasn't even awake yet because you know teenagers and yeah and then the rest of
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:52.640]   the my dad did you slip it under his pillow I well I knocked softly on the door there was no
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:58.720]   response he was dead to the world and I just left it like the monolith from 2001 standing up on his
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:06.400]   desk and when I came back later it was like the box was open and empty and the case box was open
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:12.240]   and empty and the phone was already and then he then he emerged at one point he was like how do I
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:17.120]   and I had to walk him through the transfer of the how do I yeah yeah yeah but that that was he
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:21.120]   just never done it before but you got to learn these kids they got to learn they got to he's going
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:25.200]   to college you got to learn to do it for himself what you should have judged done Jason is that
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:30.160]   like what since he was dead asleep you should have looked for like a pile of like dirty laundry
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:35.120]   and like put the phone underneath it and then say hey son are you gonna like wash your clothes
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:41.840]   all get to all get to okay let's find us get to it sometime you know yeah you know you know he's
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:47.440]   leaving in a few days he there's no way he would get to it in time say that's the problem oh darn
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:51.760]   it would be it would stay there for weeks and weeks or you don't have an excuse to go out and visit
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:57.040]   him I'm sorry son I missed you didn't bring your iPhone I desperately said that you grew up and
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:07.200]   you left me anybody Alex did you get yours delivered or did you you went to the store right I had to
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:11.680]   go to Coromadera yeah otherwise I had to wait another week yeah yeah we're probably there I think
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.640]   you were there in the after I think we figured out that you were like three hours three thirty or
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.960]   something yeah yeah I was like 12 30 yeah yeah yeah because I wanted to go to uh we're in
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:23.680]   chose for dinner so I was already down yeah the early bird special though at least Instagram
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:32.160]   and people said why he did four because I got a new iPhone I do by the way Jason thank you for
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:36.640]   showing me on the old iPhone because it made by the way completely copies everything over this is
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:43.600]   definitely the way to install an iPhone nowadays is say yes upgrade do it from the iCloud backup
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:48.480]   make sure you do the backup before you know ahead of time do it from the iCloud backup I hadn't
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:52.880]   finished the backup and then so it said well what you know do you want to use yesterday's backup I
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:57.760]   said yeah that'll be fine I'll take yesterday okay that's gonna be fine and it copied everything
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:02.240]   over it downloads all the apps fresh from the app store which is probably a good thing that's the
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:06.880]   thing that takes the longest yeah but it does that in the background to make you wait for that part
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:12.800]   you so you get a kind of a partially usable phone in the meantime it even copied over all of my all
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:20.640]   my um uh lock screens nice which is great thank you for showing me that I've been going crazy it
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:26.400]   isn't you know it's it's really interesting it it is part of I think why the upgrades happen so
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:31.520]   quickly with for Apple users or for iPhone users because it's so easy to go from one to the other
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:35.760]   like I know with my Mac like I want to upgrade a Mac and I'll think about it for a long time because
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:42.640]   I'm like oh the serial numbers and the thing and the thing and this was pain I know with the iPhone
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:47.920]   it's always like okay we're done all this all this is better than it used to be though all this is
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:53.120]   better than it used to be like I I do as a you know reviewing these products I'll tell you moving to
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:57.360]   a new like the laptops because every time there's a new laptop I get it and I move my laptop over to
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:02.160]   it and then I have to move it back and then I and I'll tell you five years ago maybe six seven years
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:07.840]   ago Apple was really not very good at this they have come a long way the iPhone experience five
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:12.320]   years ago when you bought look look buying an iPhone should be the best day of the year right
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:16.640]   you'd be like yay it's new phone day and then for people only buy a new iPhone every two or three
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:21.200]   years even better right it should be like a day of celebration you got your new phone and five years
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:27.040]   ago when when you would upgrade it was miserable right like they it would be you know where is my
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:31.200]   stuff and I got to back up and did I do it right and they it's not perfect and there were still
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:37.120]   some issues because so many people get it on that one day that sometimes the back end servers are
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:42.400]   slow or don't work quite right but I'll tell you it is an area that does not get appreciated enough
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:48.320]   where Apple has made a big difference it is so much easier than it used to be and it's so many fewer
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:53.280]   bumps in the road and you can get to your destination which is an unlocked phone that you can use
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:58.800]   a lot faster yeah we were talking we've been talking about like uh why uh apple doesn't make
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:04.160]   more things cross-platform between iPhone and android and partly because of the great difficulty
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:07.920]   in creating an android app that supports all android apps but you notice that they have a
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:13.120]   really beautiful switch to iphone app for android and if that one was worth all the investment in
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:16.800]   let's make sure we don't we're not bothered that we had to make sure it works on all Samsung phones
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.480]   and all Google phones and all the one pluses and all that sort of stuff like that they really do
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:26.080]   make it a they it's itself serving yes but it also serves the customer to make sure that whether
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:30.320]   you're going from iphone to iphone or android to iphone it's as painful and friction-free as
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:35.760]   possible they even put a really good video up that is not full of fun not full of like banging the
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:39.600]   drum about apple it's just quietly just saying here are the questions you're probably going to have
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:44.800]   if you're considering moving from android iphone here is very briefly how you would solve each one
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:50.720]   of those problems and it works really really great evil irc is asking our chat and i think he's
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:56.960]   correct if you do the iphone backup from the iCloud it will log you into the apps right or the apps
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:03.920]   setup it depends on how the storage is set per app some apps are great at it even with the iCloud
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:08.800]   backup device to device is the other option right where they actually talk to each other directly
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:13.120]   yeah they still have to redownload all the apps but it will copy your data over instead of using
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:20.240]   the iCloud backup some apps will say only only to that backup others won't do it at all so i i
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:27.440]   know that some people swear by by device to device i found it slower and i'm not so easily better
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:33.760]   yeah and these days i had to log into very few things when i made the switch and the ones that i
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:39.520]   did most of them were like the usual suspects like slack always wants you to log in again no
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:45.200]   matter what you do i mean one password maybe but i it didn't feel to me like i was being asked to
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:51.120]   log in everywhere i turned yeah so i had to log into authy my uh... indicator and bitwarden my
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:57.440]   password manager but i did not have to relog into instagram so it is it's it's and that's via the
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:02.160]   iCloud backup so i think you're right i think it's uh... app specific it's not it's neither one of the
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:07.200]   other i think i had a relog into twitter maybe the maybe the apps that are more security conscious
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:11.520]   uh... yeah because some apps are basically don't don't uh you know don't
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:16.720]   back this up to iCloud don't put this these credentials in iCloud right and those aren't going
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:20.640]   to be there on your iCloud backup them that right to the bottom line and they will be
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:24.960]   in your device to device transfer because they're actually on the device but that's the only
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:30.880]   difference did have to relog into my reddit app apollo uh yeah but it was worth it because now i
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:35.040]   have a little teeny weenie kitty cat on my dynamic island
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:41.440]   which running back and forth i'm so i am so happy that apple
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:46.560]   i would like to i would like to believe you can't see you have to zoom way in there i don't know if
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:51.680]   you can zoom in yeah but there's like a little there's like a little tamagochi like like kitty just
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:57.280]   like walks walks from left to right on top of the the island and sleep sometimes and just
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:03.120]   yeah cute adorable things so cute and it's like i for it's i'm i would like to think that
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:09.360]   some app reviewer at apple had his their finger over the reject button and said
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:13.840]   you know what i don't see a specific i know it violates something but i'm gonna wait for i'm
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:18.560]   gonna let let this at least people have their fun for a few weeks before we formally say you can't
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:23.840]   you can't do the dynamic island injustice this way you can't handle dynamic island
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:31.200]   oh god so cool just one just i just i just missed the i i i i tweeted about this uh like uh
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:36.080]   after uh after the update and like so many people were like coming back with oh it's sort of like
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:40.080]   remember when we used to have like eyeballs and the menu bar that would follow your mouth's
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:45.280]   cursor remember the talking moves remember all this stuff oh yeah and i and i mean Elvis was my
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:52.240]   favorite exactly and i and i i started thinking gee remember when like max were a lot more fun
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:58.240]   than they used to be because because all of these uh system extensions that violated a lot of rules
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:03.760]   and made the system more insecure blah blah blah blah but it's it's such a delight to see hey look
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:08.320]   if you i would love apple to say look if you want to have a little kitty traipsing back and
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:12.480]   forth and gambling and romping and playing on top that that's not our business it doesn't interfere
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:17.200]   with anything we will let you have a kitty thank you it also it doesn't appreciably increase the
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:23.280]   size of the dynamic island it's such a little teeny kitty so cute touch a little teeny weeny kitty
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:30.320]   um so as we were we're talking about wait times i didn't finish this up which is
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:38.400]   according to rumor mongers who may or may or may not be reliable um apple is already shifting some
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:47.440]   of its iphone 14 production to the pro there is a lot more demand for the pro line uh analyst
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:56.160]   daniel ives and john uh katsingris from wed bush say the iphone 14 pro mix is up to 85 to 90 percent
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:02.960]   of phones versus back a year ago when it was just 60 to 65 percent of this time of the
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:08.560]   second we know it's tired early on but right mink mink she quo who is a very reliable supply chain
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:12.800]   analyst just did a medium post he's really getting into this he used to be i think he got tired of
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:18.560]   being translated and quoted by nine to five mac and so he now has his own blog on medium where he
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:25.120]   writes about this in his own twitter account but he said um iphone pro models will account for 60
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:32.560]   to 65 percent of total iphone 14 shipments versus the previous estimate of estimate of 55 to 60
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:39.760]   and that pro max accounts for 30 to 35 percent and is the most popular model which is i think a
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:46.560]   surprise that it's so tilted toward the pro and toward the pro max and this is with the 14 plus
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:51.600]   not yet on sale but i think they're anticipating that that the 14 and plus are just not going to do
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:56.880]   it like the pro and pro max what is it's the camera that's doing that camera
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:02.000]   maybe a little bit dynamic island you don't get a dynamic island on the 14
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:07.040]   i really think that i mean i buy i at this point i buy my phone based on the camera if they had an
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:10.800]   upgrade of the camera i wouldn't buy anyone like yeah yeah i'll be like um i think that's probably
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:16.000]   increasingly like the case i was waiting for a bigger upgrade uh any upgrade last year i don't
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.440]   know what else i i it's kind of like one of those things like i don't know what else i need i just
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:24.000]   need that camera to be better right i think they would better it lider in or if they need you know
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.680]   but i always just want to have i'm just trying to close the gap between this on a full frame sensor
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:34.800]   you know and so i said there's a lot less um uh i don't know impetus to upgrade if you're uh
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:39.520]   uh by upgrading to a 14 right those are more casual buyers they i would bet you that the lower
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:43.920]   price phones sell better in the second or the first half of the calendar year than the second half
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:49.200]   only because it's more casual buyers buying them and even if you were somebody who was who was a
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:55.280]   year or two out from your iphone purchase you look at the 14 and it's not that dramatically better
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:55:00.640]   than the ones that were there before and so you know i think i think all of the heat is on those
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:04.880]   pro models and so maybe that's the reason the pro max doing so well is really interesting right
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:09.360]   i i guess that as somebody who doesn't like huge phones i mean look the proof is right there right
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:15.280]   like people like big phones nobody has ever gone bankrupt making a bigger phone did you strain your
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:20.640]   hand going from the mini to the pro max it's you know i well i didn't go to the pro max i'm using
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:25.120]   i've been using the pro okay but every time i pick up the pro i think it's the pro max because the
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:30.560]   mini is so much smaller than i i'd like this surely this is the very large phone right it's not
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:35.840]   it's just a normal yeah it's just the normal i need i need yes some flexibility yeah uh it's it's
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:40.640]   takes i'm getting used to and in my pocket too it's like you know it's this big phone is in my pocket
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:45.520]   now it's uh it's a it's a real adjustment for me as an iphone weirdo who who likes a small
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:51.600]   iphone because i am i am clearly not the i the smartphone audience if the pro max is the number
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:58.480]   one iphone right um hanha has been ordered according to uh in she quoted shift some of its iphone 14
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:04.320]   production of the pro models uh sales are strong and china wed bush says 30% of chinese iphone owners
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:09.840]   may upgrade to the iphone 14 line out of the gate retail servers in china crashed this consumer is
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:15.680]   placed over two million orders in order in total for the pro line in the first 24 hours and as we
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:20.720]   said the pro lines go faster in the beginning i i still think apple could flex i always say this
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:24.080]   every year somebody that you're they're gonna do it they're gonna flex and say we've got four new
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:30.000]   items coming out um next week like that we're gonna do announcement for and you can order them
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.400]   right now like you know just just pick one and there's a i'd love to see what the numbers are like
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:38.960]   random like i don't know what i'm gonna get you yeah like they say we got four new things they're
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:44.160]   gonna be this price this price this price for you you did that you used to do that you call the apple
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:50.560]   store and say i'll take one of each but uh sight unseen i might have done that we were sitting in
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:55.840]   erboboyne's center in the auditorium and you had you said Travis i'll take one of each before they
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:02.400]   even announced it you know you're that guy i think there is an argument to be made that people buy
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:07.360]   based on price price tiers right like we we talk about all these features and we make make a real
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:11.760]   effort to go into them but if somebody said we're coming out with four new iPhones they're
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:18.480]   799 899 999 and 1099 i bet you most iPhone buyers would just be able to say oh yeah i'll probably
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:23.760]   want the 999 one and they'd probably be right well and the thing and the ones that would do this
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:27.920]   kind of random whatever we could we they could even just say we're only gonna sell the top end of
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:33.760]   whatever we're doing next week is gonna be this much money and then just like we can buy it now
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:39.760]   if you want it just well well there's an event coming up in october Alex i can't tell you what
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:43.280]   you're ordering i think it only works with the phone i think it only works with the phone like i
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:48.720]   think it's like it's it's it's not like i don't think you can maybe i've got a laptop for you for
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:56.320]   19 99 i don't i've got an iPad for you for 1499 i'm doing my best david
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:05.440]   i don't like it's going on so the um the but yeah i mean if they told me that they had a new mac
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:10.720]   mini i'd be pretty excited about yeah that's that's all they just tell you the price and i'll
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:14.000]   tell you what you're getting just the price i think it only works with the phone i think they
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.040]   couldn't do it with anything else because it's too complicated there's so many other things to
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:23.120]   to just to me a little you know you're gonna get a phone you just know it right i i don't know i
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:29.280]   waited i wanted to well i kind of know i knew i was gonna get it because i we had i skipped 13 so i
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:33.440]   thought it's our job like it's our job we come here and talk about it so least and i were talking
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:39.600]   because i come my wife when we retire we'll be on a fixed income living on social security and oatmeal
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:47.440]   and uh and i said honey if we weren't in the biz uh would you buy a new phone every year
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:54.080]   he said oh yeah i said i wouldn't i'd go four years he said no i'm going four years it's a long time
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:59.280]   but remember i'm living on social security and oatmeal i did have my trio for three years like
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:05.520]   andy right your trio you kept yeah but the other thing was a tank you couldn't break your trio
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:10.720]   thing is the the trio was like the thing i actually still i found it like it's in my somewhere in my
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:17.680]   garage but the um uh so technically i still have it but the big thing before the iphone it was like
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:21.600]   every phone was just the one you hated less than all the other ones right you know like it wasn't
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:26.240]   it's so true it wasn't a phone you got a window CE phone remember those they were awful
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:30.880]   blackberries i had to do a thing i had to do a tour with a night what was it the um
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:36.400]   oh the blackberry with the touch screen oh it was horrible oh yeah yeah the
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:43.440]   the storm storm so that was the one i did a trip with that was it was yeah lisa had that
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:48.800]   before she she didn't buy an iphone right away oh my gosh it was so horrible and i i can't i think
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:53.680]   she dropped she dropped she was walking from the cottage to the brick house she had dropped it
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:58.720]   many many times you couldn't break that thing as bad as it was the the whole click the whole surface
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:04.480]   had to go down for a click the whole front of the phone uh and uh she finally dropped it and broke
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:08.480]   it and i that's i think how i finally got her into the iphone it's probably a 3g i had to tear
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:15.520]   i think i i think i i think i i think i had to break my wife's uh yeah yeah yeah you gotta get you
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:23.760]   a new phone um apple is number one on the american customary satisfaction index
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:31.360]   but it's pretty close i think it's within the margin of error uh they put this out every year
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:40.640]   in personal computers uh apple is 82 82 no percent change samson though coming up personal computers
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:49.680]   79 and 81 maybe that includes phones uh then asir amazon amazon must be what amazon
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:56.720]   what this is silly who they don't make a purse is there an amazon pc no yes they're talking
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:02.320]   about the tablet tablets oh the fire oh so this probably includes everything uh then asus
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.800]   amazon people that aren't happy is when you buy it and realize you can't
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:11.200]   very useful unless you're not using amazon products well uh over all amazon had the best
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.480]   improvement seven percent increase a year over year hp dropped three percent year over
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:24.080]   you know these are dumb forget it forget i even mentioned it the uh it's a survey of 9271
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:28.800]   customers chosen at random contacted over the course of the year they were asked to evaluate
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:36.640]   their experiences with recently purchased products this is for the uh from the acsi household
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:46.880]   appliance and electronics study june july 2021 to june 2022 apple always is the best come on just
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:55.200]   live with it get over it man apple has improved according to frederick over tichy the battery
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:02.160]   percentage icon in 16.1 beta 2 there has been some i don't buy i put on the battery percentage i like
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:08.000]   it the problem is the icon you know it doesn't it doesn't reflect the percentage it just it's uh
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.360]   it goes from a hundred to nothing i know now it does now it does it shows that now the number
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:22.960]   is less readable but it's more accurate if you want it yeah yeah i don't care like i i'm like oh
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:28.000]   i'm low i'm i'm low medium or high is how i want to do it i think it's like three places
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.600]   rapple didn't doesn't want didn't want you to look at it and i think they're right it's an anxiety
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.760]   producer for no good reasons when it's full i'm like i'm not gonna think about it on when it's
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:40.480]   middle i i like i might want to look for something in when it's low i i go well i better plug it in
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:45.760]   but there's not i don't like the exact percentage is silly yes in my opinion i agree it is it is silly
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:50.800]   but if you're going to do it the the number or the like uh thing behind it should be more precise
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:57.200]   than it's all there until it's gone right like that was a that was a design mistake right i get
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:01.280]   the legibility issue but if you're going to say that it's 50 percent you should show that it's 50
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:05.680]   percent i think the problem is it declares it declares an accuracy that's beyond the precision
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:10.320]   yeah it's right because that's the problem yeah yeah all battery percentages seem digital and
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.080]   they're not they're analog they're frightfully analog and not accurate because they're just
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:19.200]   measuring the voltage and it's it should really say 33 to 60 percent and then it should say or
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:23.520]   that zero to 30 percent like that's about the accuracy and these days it's it's like our model
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:27.760]   based on the history of your battery and the way you're using it now in the current you know power
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:32.560]   we're getting out of it suggests that you probably have 40 percent of your battery life left but
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:39.040]   it's all like it's exactly what you said they just yeah just tap on it our our traffic's all
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:43.360]   things tap tap to explain how much battery life is left in this theory appears and
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:49.120]   might be a couple you might hear what i found on the web about that well right because we all
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:54.240]   wanted to be precise and so they're going to give it to us in a way that makes us feel comfortable but
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:02.240]   the truth is that battery yeah batteries are like weird and chemical and they're trying they're
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:06.160]   trying their best this is that same thing about why they got in trouble because they were like
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:10.880]   recalibrating what what full was and then people said they were trying to hide battery degradation
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:16.000]   which they kind of were but then again that's all part of the game i understand why people felt
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.240]   that way but it's also part of the game of being a battery person trying to explain battery to
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:28.400]   regular people because they're not how they don't work like we think they work so it's it's tricky
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:33.040]   all right you convinced me i'm turning off the percentage turn it off turn it off right now
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:38.080]   just making you feel pressure that you don't need it is it's an anxiety-inducing uh thing yeah
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:43.280]   it's no point no point just like oh you need a blob then you just got to turn off the other
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.840]   exact anxiety inflicting what's that?
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:52.640]   notifications turn off all the badges on all your app icon yeah i don't like badges literally i
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:58.160]   turn off the the overall notification i go through every app and i'm like nothing nothing nothing
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:04.080]   nothing yeah i don't want to talk to you don't talk to me you could turn off badges uh on the on
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:08.720]   the desktop can you i don't want to yeah you can turn off you can turn off that you can go through
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:13.360]   that list i go i little you have to do it per app per app i do it through i do it i do it through
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:17.360]   every one of those apps and i just turn it off i don't want all both of them like i don't want
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:22.960]   you to do anything see all these badges that's just that's just annoying i not oh so i got badges
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:30.800]   and folders are the worst i got 1,728 something's where i don't know where oh under net newswire
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.400]   sure those are news stories that's always going to be a huge number don't want to see it
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:39.440]   but it's yeah it doesn't say it's just on a full notice settings notifications net newswire turn
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:45.600]   off and then here's another thing to turn on in the baddies and i this isn't quite as convenient as
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:50.880]   google's way of doing it it's an accessibility this is the live transcriptions live captions
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:56.400]   and you can if if you want and as you turn that on so that's under excessive it's a little
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:02.160]   hard to find i had to take a round yeah let me let me get let me so and it's not as great as i
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:09.280]   it's first of all it's serie so it's spoken content
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:15.440]   is that right no that's wrong that's wrong it's not see this is a problem it's hard to find
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:22.000]   uh i don't know i had to i had to search around subtitles and captioning maybe that's it
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.280]   nope you'd think nope that's not it either live captions right underneath the beta
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.520]   okay you turn that on you could say what the appearance is going to be of the captions
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:41.920]   uh do you want live captions and facetime sure sure why not live captions and rtt
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:48.800]   is that uh is that that see notice though this icon is a floating icon it's always in the way
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:53.040]   i don't know what rtt is that's that radiate that's that uh transcription that's this is an

[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:27.840]   left it on because it's that's a nice thing to have especially if it's late at night you know you know
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:33.120]   you don't want to make noise but you want to look at tiktok uh i believe there was a story in the
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:37.360]   new york times we talked about on twitter on sunday more millennials are turning on live
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:42.240]   captioning then then old folks i thought i was turning it on because i'm deep but apparently the
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:50.320]   kids do it even more my kids turn on all the time they live on it my daughter who is who is 20 yeah
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:57.360]   is is turns captioning on on all of her netflix shows and all that stuff and it's turn off turn
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:01.360]   on captions for life we're gonna have to turn live captioning for you Jason you started turning
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:10.960]   into a robot would you unplug and re-plug your name uh uh uh this is uh this is i'm sorry it's a
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:17.920]   wall street journal uh it says why do all these 20-somethings have closed captions turned on i think
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.440]   they i think it's because they got used to it in facebook like in facebook you get used to you
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.560]   get used to like seeing it's really funny captions it used to be really easy for me to find a captioner
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:33.840]   for events i we just had a french captioner for an event on sunday and and uh it is um it's really
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:39.200]   it's much harder now to find captions because they're so in demand because they're used for
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:43.600]   you know all the social media because people got used to what they're scrolling and they just
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.120]   want to see the text they don't want to turn the audio on because they're probably doing it at
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:52.960]   school right their parents whatever and it started on facebook because companies like taste made and
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.560]   and others kitchen realized that if if people are scrolling their newsfeed the sounds off
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.480]   they're gonna get stickier and they're gonna get more attention if they caption
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.480]   what they're the right it was cooking and stuff like that the recipes are the news stories
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.600]   make a decision about whether they're gonna turn on the audio based on the captions so that's
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:13.680]   how it started now tiktok almost everything's captioned well then it was also combined with the
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:18.800]   fact that christian fernolan makes movies that we can understand understand like it doesn't
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.640]   in a may survey of 1200 americans according to the wall street journal 70 percent of gen z
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:30.640]   respondents and 53 percent of millennial respondents said they watch content with text most of the
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:37.840]   time so it's going up mm-hmm only a third of older respondents according to language teaching app
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:44.000]   preply tiktok is also being used just as a search tool like feeling for information a lot of
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.080]   that i saw that story what is that man how do you search what are you what are you talking about
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:52.160]   there what are they saying just just like you might go to youtube if you're trying to figure out hey
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:56.720]   how do i fix this washing machine or whatever a lot of people did they just communicate by creating
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:01.280]   a quick video and if you're looking for information about what just happened if you're looking for a
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:04.800]   recent video about what just happened if you're looking for information about how to do something
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:10.240]   you can go to tiktok for it although according if we both read the same article one of the problems
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:16.880]   is that it's not necessarily validated information information so you might you might find and also
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:24.400]   tiktok is not terribly like mature and by that by that i mean that as a technology gets years after
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:28.560]   years after year they figure out where the holes are and how to patch them i mean just even just now
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:33.120]   youtube is figuring out that perhaps we should need we should have like in-line
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:40.720]   in-line education on how to spot fakes and how to spot uh people who videos are trying to coerce
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:46.160]   you towards a point of view with fact with fake information so tiktok is is now like the best
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:50.720]   vector for that kind of stuff right now this is the story from insider jenzi is increasingly
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:56.800]   using tiktok videos instead of google search but one in five contain misinformation
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:05.120]   it's a a new study that just came out by news guard it's a site that monitors misinformation
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:10.480]   jason do we have his uh soundback or are we still working on it beep boop boop boop
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:16.800]   no i just was gonna say my daughter is 20 and and uh she turns captions on everywhere yeah it's
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:21.760]   absolutely a thing and if she can caption the entire world and her entire life someday i'm sure
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:25.600]   that'll happen and i find it funny because we always talk about these kids today they can't read
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.840]   it turns out they do read they read the captions that's what they're reading they read captions
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.760]   on the captions as they watch i guess they can't read cursive anymore i was like i read some
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.640]   monocles it can't read cursive i was like i don't know if i can recurse of anymore i don't
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:41.920]   and they only want to read one line at a time right like one line of dialogue at a time but it is
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:45.520]   it's a it's a totally real thing and i think it's uh i think it's amazing and every time my
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:49.200]   daughter comes to visit i sit down and watch tv and the captions are turned on it's like
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:53.200]   i'm like they're on all the time i'm like who did this oh that's like i turn them off and that
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:58.960]   flicks turns them back on they think they know i know it's like that's right i actually you seem old
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:03.360]   like four young yeah exactly i we just want to watch it we've decided to do on what you're
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:08.480]   concerned i house of the dragon the captions were annoying me because i wanted to look at the
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:13.280]   beautiful pictures and so i turn them off it depends on what you're watching on the other hand
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:18.720]   if you're watching industry which is that show on hbo that's in britain you have to have captions
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:22.960]   it's talking that's all i'm talking like this and i don't understand what they're saying
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:30.160]   by the way do not roast your chicken and night will okay that is apparently a tiktok challenge
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:33.200]   and the fda is warning that's a lot of night
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:40.960]   i'd be impressed if they even figured that out night will detain to see the manifest
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:47.680]   dextromethor fan and doxolamine uh and according to the fda and oppressorly social media trends
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:52.400]   and peer pressure can be a dangerous combination of your children and their friends especially
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:58.960]   when involving misusing medicine uh boiling night will or similar cough cold medicine can make the
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:03.680]   solution much more concentrated and changes properties in other ways
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.560]   inhale simply inhaling the vapors
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:15.600]   so don't okay i'm just saying if you're doing that thing don't do it don't do it no more
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:23.760]   um i gotta i gotta take a break we're gonna do more uh stuff but we're not gonna roast chicken

[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:40.000]   favor go just go to the website first zocdoc.com/macbreak that's how they know you saw it here
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:46.480]   zach doc.com/macbreak what a good idea
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:50.400]   just get this just obvious zach doc.com/macbreak
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:58.560]   uh oh here was the thing that bugged the hell out of me and i thought oh this is i guess a security
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:08.000]   thing messages would like to paste from safari do you want to allow this yes every single freaking
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   time fixed in beta to release today by the way yeah in fact an apple executives uh yeah that's a
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:25.840]   bug told mac rumors oops ray hwang senior manager dapple uh joining an email thread he had sent him
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:31.120]   email to craig federigi and tim crook uh he said uh yeah that's not supposed to appear every time
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:36.480]   you paste that's quote this is absolutely not expected behavior we will get to the bottom of it
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:40.480]   and there's a mmm i'm sure there was a bunch of meetings a bunch of angry meetings about that
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:45.760]   but i you know this was this came in response to the fact that people were seeing that tiktok
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:51.520]   for instance was cop was always copying the clipboard and uh tiktok said well we do that so
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:56.720]   you can paste uh you know it in automatically so it's just i think it's a good it's a i understand
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:01.840]   the motivation anyway yeah i think this is this was in the betas too uh for a while and then it
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:05.280]   went away and then it's weird that it came back and i think that's what they're reacting to it's
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:10.160]   like i thought we had crushed that bug and they apparently brought it back yeah the idea is to
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:17.520]   warn you if a paste is gonna happen without your interaction but it was you were saying i want to
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:21.920]   paste this and there's nothing that makes me angrier as a user of apple products then when
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:27.200]   there's clear user intent to do something and then it wants to stop you or warn you and not let you
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:32.960]   do it and that's that's in my mind that is when their security goes over the line is like i am
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:39.280]   pasting just pasted you're my device i told you to do it just do it and and fortunately this is a
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:44.480]   bug because yeah you should never have to you know double paste anything to get it in there it's
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:49.520]   ridiculous yeah yeah and aren't you aren't you relieved that like this was they quickly identify
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:55.280]   this as a bug as opposed to that did we want that to happen well well it's really good in case because
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:59.520]   i think didn't say something about how we want to make sure that every time someone pays something
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:05.440]   uh one actually is on the patent for this feature so yes something he has a dog in his
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:11.280]   hunt yeah i mean you want to you want it to be protective but not invasive a lot of this is the
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:16.640]   the the line that all these companies have to walk especially the platform vendors is like a lot
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:21.280]   of apple stuff is kind of invasive where you like say i would like to launch this app and it says
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:27.200]   i don't know if i want to let you launch this app or and there there comes a time where you need
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:33.040]   to be able as a user to say yes uh stop asking me i want to do this thing and i know that the
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:38.560]   argument is oh but then somebody's grandma's gonna get talked by a scammer into doing all those things
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:45.440]   to turn off all the protection and install spyware and it's like yeah i know but at some point you
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:53.440]   have to let me use my computer the way i want and fortunately they they let you get there but
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:21:01.520]   sometimes it should be easier are you on 16 1 now beta 2 Jason my my i found an ipad are just now
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:08.480]   freshly on beta 2 you're a brave man but my mac is not on the ventura beta because i have a podcast
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:14.800]   to do it with this i work if work can't really do that during the show yeah wait you're not
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:19.680]   you're about to let you do something that's your job sorry Andy go ahead i'm sorry no i was just
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:24.160]   gonna say you heard about the really really funny bug that they're gonna be fixing next week where
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.800]   the camera start the phones are
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:32.480]   mildly non uncontrollably yeah i think that's got to be related to the stabilization the action
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:37.840]   camera yeah so it's only in certain apps like tiktok and snepchef that's kind of bad when you
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:44.080]   you open snepchet it goes boohh it's just instagram it's not a big camera app
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:50.320]   no i wouldn't worry about it uh apple it says i will say mine's crap i mean not crashing it's
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:57.680]   hanging a lot like the new one the new phone with 16.0 like i get into uh like messages and it just
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:03.840]   suddenly becomes unresponsive and the only way to get out of it is to force quit the app and then
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:08.640]   and i've had that like i mean since i got it probably five or six times so it's it's definitely still
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:13.200]   working progress it's it's weird because not everybody's getting this camera thing happening
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:17.520]   so it's not it's not a consistent bug and which is why apple missed it in testing
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:22.320]   uh they also who had heard this is a little more scary allowed grinding sound
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:31.920]   i don't know if i'd want to hear a picture of that what that would be uh don't do it don't yeah i
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:35.680]   don't like it yeah keep in mind that when they ship these things out they're shipping with uh
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:40.720]   an older build right because they start making these phones and loading them up with software and so
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:45.920]   we get in this weird case remember how people always used to say don't ever download point
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:50.800]   the point zero of anything well if you're really concerned about this don't get the iPhone on day
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:55.760]   one get it on day 30 because they'll probably be like three or four software updates between
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:01.600]   Alex day one and day third i go by well i don't but i would if i were a normal person go by Alex's
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:10.320]   rule which is not the not the first update but the fix on the first update so 16.1.1 right yeah
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:13.520]   i mean yeah yeah that's usually when i try to wait unless there's some feature that i just
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:19.840]   absolutely have to have 16 is really i was upgrading to though i have to say you will when you get your
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:27.600]   new iPhone immediately have to go to 16.1 you get an update right away did 16 did 16 um add the the
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:32.880]   magical feature which is called take off my remove from home screen is that new or did i just not do
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:37.360]   it every time that's been there for one now that that came in with the app library once once the app
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:41.440]   library existed you don't have to have a one-to-one i never noticed it before and i was like
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:45.360]   isn't that nice i could just delete them and search for them if i want to i was just you know
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:50.000]   i don't have to i was i have to admit okay i'm a little behind on there's also a weird thing that
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:56.160]   i comes and goes on my phone i noticed i can turn it off that the three dots at the bottom sometimes
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:03.440]   says search that's that's something new right yeah i mean it's literally nothing new right it used to be
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:08.400]   like it's it's doing literally the same thing as if you swipe down right but what they realized is
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:12.800]   people didn't know you could swipe down so they just replace the three dots when they're not in use
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:18.800]   with a thing that says search that when you tap does the same thing because which is clever right
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:22.960]   because it's discoverability they they realize people weren't discovering how to search on their
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:29.440]   phone so they just put a label on there that does it's like literally not a new feature it's just
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:35.360]   a shortcut so people know they can search has anybody unscent and uh message yet
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:42.160]   that's new right here's Joanna Stern demonstrating it she sent this message said i thought better of
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:49.920]   it undo send and it stops it's gone so uh i haven't done that not compatible with older os's so if
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:54.720]   you unsend a message if you send something and unsend it what you'll get on somebody running an
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:25:01.520]   older os is this person tried to unsend this message and it's days there it's not only
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:09.200]   only on the current oh so don't use this don't use this feature again after 90 percent of people
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:16.800]   update in the next three minutes i admit my guilt message feature like i it whoops i think i
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.240]   think i think i think i think i think i think i think i think i think i think i think i think i think i
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:22.400]   it says that you edited it to say something else but it doesn't actually end oh that's awful that
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:27.120]   just calls attention to your mistake i would just tell you you can't do it like if oh that person
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:33.120]   can't do the thing wow so yeah think about that before you edit i would unsend probably i think
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:41.600]   it's gonna be a great feature in 2024 any other undiscovered uh cool features that you uh really
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:49.280]   excited about i'm still loving the lock screen widgets and what apps are coming out that support
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:53.680]   lock screen widgets my favorite uh one is the slideshow for some reason at first it said
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:58.560]   we haven't yet processed your photo album i guess it has to go through your whole photo album
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:05.360]   but now you can say uh oh a pet or in my case a spouse and every time i get a lock screen it's
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:10.720]   a new picture of Lisa gonna have thousands in my photo album so it's a i really like that feature
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:15.680]   really live yeah there's one for like nature where you can say like show me nature or cities
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:23.040]   and and you know you've taken 20 30 000 pictures and there's probably some nice nature photos so it
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:29.200]   analyzes your library it seems same library analysis and it's your nature photos and it does a pretty
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:35.680]   good job i think it needs to be better at saying this is like you can say this is a loser don't
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:39.840]   use this picture but you can't like do it in the moment you have to go in and edit it and make a
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:43.360]   bunch of things and that's the one thing that i would really like is because there was a picture of like
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:50.880]   like a wood chuck or something that i saw when i was in Colorado and like it was like hey isn't
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:55.840]   this a great nature photo of the zoomed in of this brain game i was trying to identify and it's like
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:02.640]   please i never want to see that again and that that part is hard so you go again discover
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:06.560]   ability on this one's tough i didn't even know about it until you showed me last week Jason but
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:12.160]   you go to your lock screen you press and hold that'll let you configure it and then uh when you say
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:16.960]   add new wallpaper you have a choice of photos people but this is the photo shuffle which i
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:22.720]   really like and then you can do people pets nature i want oh so you can have all of them oh i even
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:27.120]   know that yeah or or separate ones for each one or whatever you want to do and then you can do it
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:32.880]   on tap on lock hourly or daily i like doing it on tap and you can use featured photos or select
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:38.320]   photos i'm gonna say is apple pretty good about the used featured photos oh there's our kid oh there's
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:45.440]   our cat oh there's a swan oh there's something yeah it's the same stuff that we just show up in your
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:50.800]   in your widget if you had a photo is this is kind of fun there's my daughter there's my cat again
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:59.280]   wow okay that's really cool that's really cool that's a nice that's a nice feature
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:06.000]   um what else do we like i agree the lock screens are great i love changing the font on my time i
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.920]   know it's silly but i do i like that the discord mentioned the haptic keyboard which is a feature
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:17.920]   that's been on android for a bazillion years i love this iphone users have not had it and they put
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:23.040]   it in and it's really i turn mine on i really like it i love having just that additional feedback that
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:29.280]   i have pressed a key and i don't ever have the sound on so i never hear the sound effect but
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:34.000]   getting that little haptic feedback it's really nice i really really really like that uh yeah
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.680]   because i i don't like it when it clicks at night and i'm typing or something
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:42.320]   system haptics where is it it's a play haptics been re-keyboard settings
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:47.120]   keyboard feedback you don't want sound but you do want haptic it's just it's not even a yeah
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:54.320]   it's just a little thing but you then know that you've typed it uh that's a really nice feature i
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:29:01.760]   agree anything else people are uh crazy about i like i like that at least we're starting to see
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:06.080]   past keys i don't think you can use them with very much have you seen a site with past keys best
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:16.160]   by i think has past keys now i want to do it let me try it let's do a past key uh let's see uh
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:26.240]   hi there let's create an account yes uh oh yeah you know you go into um i just did yeah i just did
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:31.600]   sign in and it actually comes up and says sign in with web often which is past keys oh see you
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:35.920]   you'd have to know that though but i think you've got a i think you've got to log in with your account
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:41.360]   first in order to do that oh yeah there it is sign in with web often so okay close your eyes
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:48.640]   everybody close your eyes i don't want anybody to know that i have a best bike out
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:58.480]   i only had it because for a long time i was trying to get an xbox okay uh uh let's log in the
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:05.200]   best by okay i'm signed in now and then sign in with web often no it says hi Leo
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:08.160]   sign out do i sign out now to do that
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:16.400]   signing me out maybe let's oh i really i'm dying to get this let's do it again let's do it let's do
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:25.440]   it again uh account sign in and now sign i get it sign in with web often so it needs to know my
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:31.920]   email address okay you haven't set up web often on this device please choose another way to sign in
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:38.480]   then you can go to account settings i get it why are they calling it web often
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:43.840]   well that's the standard right and the standard is across because google has
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:48.080]   microsoft are all gonna support it it is a better title i mean everybody calls it past
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:51.840]   fun at the dynamic island but past keys is a pretty good name for it right yep
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:31:01.520]   me and all right so i'm going now to my account settings set up to factor email face or fingerprint
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:09.280]   is it under change your password no face or fingerprint you think face or fingerprint
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:13.440]   browser or operating system you're choosing doesn't support that well i know that
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.040]   continue with touch id i just got it yeah and it said that's it so all i did on my mac was go to
[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:24.880]   face or fingerprint and it said continue with touch id put your finger here and then it said
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:29.040]   that's it face recognition or fingerprint sign in is set up on this device and now that will
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:36.480]   sync with i cloud and so now on all my devices when i want to oh yeah the best buy i can do it without
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:41.680]   a password and there's and it's cryptographically guaranteed and there's no password to leak from
[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:49.840]   their system and it's all just kind of magic so there as far as i know who is using past keys
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:53.920]   they're the first one i've heard of in the wild i think that's the first one i've seen yeah
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:32:00.800]   that's great i mean it's too bad it's passed by but it's i have no use for but
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:04.800]   though that's still great so i should do it on my iPhone or my mac something with fingerprint
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:12.960]   or face id yeah yeah neat i'm just so glad that it really is a a common standard that's not going to
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:16.400]   just simply say hey this is going to be great for apple people but what happens for everybody
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:21.440]   else who's using any other kind of device i mean this is this is it's it's a common enemy that needs
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:27.200]   to be slain and it is passwords that people get used by so true so true so true so true
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:38.320]   so i'm just quickly doing this on my phone sign in okay yeah okay now if i go into my account you're
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:47.200]   saying i should be able to sign in yeah by fingerprint or face i guess is what they call it which is
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:52.160]   funny because that's best by trying to explain what web often is yeah in fact i didn't really
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:58.000]   understand what they were talking about yeah that it probably is better to say something like sign
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.960]   in with face or fingerprint everywhere yeah because that's the idea here is your fingerprint
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:09.040]   sign in set up on this device do you want to say oh see now apple says do you want to say
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:15.520]   have a pasky paskys are saving your iCloud keychain yes i do face it i love the face id dynamic island
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:22.000]   by the way and i have to say it seems like it's a little faster okay i just did set it up that's
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:28.640]   it wants me to do it again okay best by set up failed well never mind never mind i think maybe
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:34.480]   you actually did set it up and it just didn't do it oh so should i log out and try i really want i
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:46.160]   want everybody to see how this works let me sign out sign out okay signing you out good
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:54.880]   yeah now sign in again sign in
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:34:03.920]   no didn't do it oh wait a minute sign in with web often no yeah
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:10.000]   wants my email address still yeah you got to put in your email address it's pretty good isn't it
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.520]   yeah yeah it wants your email address and it'll auto fill it and then and then
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:20.480]   it didn't i didn't have to do a password and that's it then you got it nice i mean there's no password
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:25.520]   it's a little funky um through your email address but you don't have to have a password and they don't
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:30.720]   have to have a password and it's just a key exchange that happens graphically right and and as Andy
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:36.240]   said it will it's coming to every platform it will be it will be even that even it'll be on your
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:42.480]   linux platform eventually Leo eventually so i don't want to use a password i want to sign in
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:47.520]   with web often it still wants my email address i guess that's that's still part of it that's part
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:53.120]   of it then it's a face ID and now yeah now i'm in and apple is asking me again to make sure i want
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:59.440]   to do that and then it says yes and then i'm good okay yeah i mean it's not us it's actually not
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:04.960]   easier or faster than if you have a password store in keychain it's like that but okay fine
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:13.120]   it's good it should it feels like the work the workflow should be a little bit far straightforward
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:24.640]   i don't know um early days early days early days austin man in scotland we always like to see
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:29.760]   austin's reviews of the iphone he seems to be somebody who can really you know put it through its
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:37.040]   paces he's in the don catoran estate in the scotish islands look at that places to take pictures
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:45.760]   ultra wide pro raw file stitched in photoshop nice massive megapixels there's a chicken a scolish
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:55.360]   chicken there's a close up of a scolish chicken it's a very foul test yeah look at that look at that
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:02.160]   100 zoom on the 48 megapixel pro raw that is a lot of detail that is not as normal as smury as
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:09.280]   those big zooms usually are boy that's pretty yeah i mean we see we see there where you see so many
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:14.240]   like uh ai algorithms for image processing that might be able to take something that looks rough
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:20.400]   off of a raw and then reprocess it and add sharpness and detail there's a lot to love about having
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:23.760]   that many megapixels on a sensor and i can't wait to see third parties coming through
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:30.240]   he says after a few days using it i probably leave my settings to 12 megapixel pro raw
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:36.400]   only push it up to 40 megapixels when i need it 12 is still where the camera really shines plus
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:43.760]   capturing and 48 is a bit slow uh and storage is also becomes a premium he says also he seems
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:50.640]   as battery life seems to get zapped when shooting all day at 48 megapixels so you the 12 megapixel
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:37:00.960]   pro raw what do i get with 12 megapixel pro raw it's uh is it we are getting a smaller file that is
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:11.200]   using the the quad pixel binning right okay so after where do i set that oh it's so complicated life is
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:17.840]   so so complicated so you just turn on raw will it and i said it by the way this is a new feature
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:24.480]   you can set the camera to sit remember the settings so once you do that turn and turn off live to as
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:28.800]   much as i like live that does not give you the best image quality is that right i believe not
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:35.200]   no it'll it'll capture it's just capturing a movie around the oh okay so i can continue to do live
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:41.840]   oh up to you no live in raw though it's one or the other do it get your hopes up Leo all right so
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:48.320]   now i think it'll remember that from now on let's close it out yeah it stays in raw oh no it doesn't
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:55.600]   no it did so if you set it to remember your settings which i think you know that way if i if i
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:01.600]   put it in a video and i leave it stays in video i think that's a nice feature i don't know if that's
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:08.080]   new or not i didn't notice it before but it stays in whatever because in the past the camera would
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:17.760]   jump back to the default yeah let's see what else um i am not going to talk about rumors about the
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:25.280]   dynamic i thought 15 i am not i will not i actually i put a a link to a story in there and and i did
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:31.520]   my own editorializing yes we have officially gotten our first story telling us details of the plans
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:37.840]   for the iPhone 15 make it stop stop make it stop not well moratorium just your band we're gonna
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:45.200]   stop it right here right now 2023 check back in gentlemen and ladies if you're here prepare your
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:54.720]   picks of the week while i talk about my lovely night sleep on my eight sleep pod is the ultimate
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:39:03.680]   sleep machine i just love it eight sleep you know it takes the idea of some you know a bed warm or
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:09.760]   electric blanket to the next level it's a bed warmer and cooler it does both it does both and it
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:14.880]   turns out that's the best way to sleep you don't want to sleep hot at night on those hot summer
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:20.960]   nights when we were getting up at 113 degrees and it was just burning hot i set my eight sleep to cool
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:28.000]   me off it goes as low believe it or not as 55 degrees which is pretty chilly or as high as 110
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:35.360]   degrees which is pretty warm or anywhere in between good sleep i don't think i have to sell you on the
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:40.080]   value of a good night's sleep it's good for your health it's good for your state of mind it's good
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:46.640]   for you and still more than 30 percent of americans suffer with poor sleep feeling hot at night is the
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:52.480]   number one cause of poor sleep uh i i've solved it i have just totally solved it and i encourage
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:40:01.440]   you to do the same with my eight sleep pod i wanted to say cover they sell they sell both uh eight sleep
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:09.760]   uh mattresses but since we had a really nice mattress we just got the cover which goes over
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:14.800]   any mattress and gives you the same benefit clinical data shows eight sleep users experience
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:24.160]   up to a 19 increase in recovery up to a 32 improvement in sleep quality and up to 34
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:30.560]   more deep sleep deep sleep is the key deep sleep is the garbage cleaning
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:38.160]   of your brain and the way the eight sleep works is so clever so i i mean you might have different
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:45.920]   ways i have it set here i'll show you my eight sleep i have it set uh that's my sleep report
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:56.160]   i have it set to um be cool it's off right now because i'm not in bed be it starts a little warm i
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:41:02.240]   have it set to like plus two something was plus three at night and then as the evening is the night
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:07.920]   goes on in deep sleep you might want to cool it off in fact i do in fact i even go down a little
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:13.280]   bit to zero or maybe even minus one then you get a deep sleep and then for rem you might want to
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:17.360]   bring it back up a little bit warm yourself up and then i love this because you can have a wake up
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:22.640]   schedule that warms up your bed to get you out of bed but then the best thing about the eight
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:29.040]   sleep i have the autopilot turned on autopilot then watches how you sleep and they notice is that
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:36.000]   too cold are you tossing and turning is that too warm and they adjust your sleep based on the
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:42.720]   rooms temperature so if it's a really hot night it'll fix it best based on your feedback based on
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:48.240]   manual temperature adjustments and based on how you're sleeping it's unbelievable
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:53.120]   eight sleep we're gonna have to get this because we have the original pod cover they just launched
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:58.000]   the next generation the pod three which enables more accurate sleep and health tracking because
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.600]   they've doubled the sensors and which means of course more accurate temperatures as well i mean
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:09.280]   i'm very happy with our pod it's not magic but it sure feels like it it's so nice to get in a nice
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:14.880]   toasty warm bed and then sleep so deeply because it's cooled off at night and i mean my deep sleep
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:21.600]   now is so deep go to eight sleep dot com slash mac break eighta sleep dot com slash mac break

[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:54.640]   and i could tell you it works it's so great eight sleep currently ships within the u.s. Canada the

[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:36.080]   the uh that's a lucky word i know i know it's not pokéman's but that's what tim cookall the
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:41.520]   man i love it um it's it's not words by zach age who is for my money the best uh
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:46.320]   ios and probably best game developer on the planet for for these kinds of games for casual games
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:53.200]   uh has made so many great games it is using a crossword puzzle mechanic uh and the the premise is
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:44:00.480]   you're given the uh the crossword puzzle shape and inside it there are little blocks that have
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:05.360]   particular letters that are in those blocks but you don't know where the letters go and so you
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:11.200]   have to puzzle out based on the letters that are there and based on what maybe you've got clues from
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:19.360]   the crosses what the actual um words are in the puzzle and they and if there are many puzzles
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:24.160]   that are that you can finish in about a minute or two every day there's the classic puzzle which
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:30.080]   works kind of like uh many other crossword puzzles where monday is easy and it progresses through
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:34.720]   sunday and gets progressively farther and changes over the course and then if you if you're really
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:39.520]   into it they have this twisty puzzle where you have to get everything exactly right and it's uh
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:44.240]   it's extra tricky but the classic i think is good it's free within that purchase so you can kind of
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:51.040]   amp it up uh if you want to but i love it i play it every day my wife plays it every day it is a
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:56.320]   huge amount of fun it is it is going to use the crossword puzzle part of your brain but with no clues
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:05.600]   i am so leo i'm gonna do it goodbye goodbye what did you have something to show us what what it's
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:11.680]   two it's too late leo's uh it's really how much if i want to buy it how much five dollars a year
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:16.320]   or bought it buy it outright for well i'm definitely gonna buy it outright i already paid much more
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:20.640]   than that for the new york times crossword puzzles and this sounds better yeah it's it's really good i
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:25.360]   mean it's not a crossword puzzle you know clues you know get clues part of it yeah but the the trying
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:29.040]   to form words and figure out what the crosses are and knowing what words are valid or invalid it's
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:35.840]   just it's so good it's so well done and all of zax games are like that but this is uh you know
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:41.280]   one of the latest and greatest and i love it just bought it 12 bucks my god yeah then you can try it
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:46.800]   out for free but it's uh it's a really good just a nice spin this mechanic i can't believe nobody
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:51.120]   seems to have thought of this before of using the crossword it's almost like you're building the
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:56.000]   crossword puzzle and then you would at the end you would come up with the clues yeah that how that
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:00.960]   feels it's it's uh it's a lot of so it gives you hints so you don't have to you know completely
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:05.120]   it's all that's yeah that's the game mechanic is it'll say there are two blocks and one of these is
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:11.440]   is an a and one of these is a j and then you have to start to figure out like okay uh well a j is
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:16.640]   unlikely to be the combination so i'll do j a and then you know and you go from there oh this is hard
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:23.760]   i want my money back it's too hard i want something that reflects myself image as a smart person yeah
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:28.480]   exactly hey at least you don't need to know what words mean so there's that that's true
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:33.440]   and they're all english language words i presume they are they are english real english language
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:37.840]   every now and then you get one where you're like really but uh that's that's normal that's how games
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:47.200]   work yeah it's called cannot words knot w o r d s uh and it's and because of zach it's it's also
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:54.080]   got a great uh ui and everything it's very and and this is ios mac and it's in steam i think it's
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:47:00.480]   a single play so it's it's everywhere so what's a puzzle book those are extra puzzles so you get a
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:04.080]   puzzle a day and then you can get the puzzle books or you bought maybe that's what you pay for and
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:10.240]   and then you so if you one puzzle is not enough you can you know you get a like 25 puzzles or three
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:16.400]   puzzles for the month they must be uh they must have some auto generation yeah so the it's actually
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:24.080]   it's it's zach age and zach schlesinger are the authors and zach is the kind of game uh app designer
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:31.120]   guy but my understanding is jack schlesinger is the one who created the uh puzzle generator right
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:35.280]   and so they have a a really interesting back end where they are creating puzzles and rating them
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:39.920]   based on difficulty and and then those get dropped in for your daily puzzles so they had to create
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:44.080]   kind of like it right it's not just the puzzles the puzzles have to come from somewhere so they
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:50.080]   have a puzzle generator working somewhere that is uh cranking out the right puzzles for every day nice
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:59.280]   it's good and the anachopica the wake uh mine is a really cool open source uh image scaler upper
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:04.720]   pays based on ai uh called upscale i just got it like last night i've been playing with it like
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:10.320]   pretty much nonstop since then it uses uh ai learning models to take a lower lower resolution
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:15.120]   picture and scale it up to a higher resolution picture and a lot of times the results are really
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:21.680]   really impressive uh they the the catch is that despite my wishes and despite how many times i've
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:26.960]   tried to give it a low resolution blurry image and turn it into a higher resolution perfectly good
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:32.960]   looking image it doesn't really work that way but it tends to have some pretty good results if you
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:38.720]   start off with a lower resolution sharp image like a good one uh and then but it will scale up i
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:45.360]   i put in a link in the show notes to uh uh i gave it like a really old old old like 1990s picture from
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:51.280]   mac hack 800 by 600 pixels that uh i downloaded from my own flicker account and it upscaled it
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:49:01.200]   really nicely to uh like 3,400 by uh 2800 so wow that's a big improvement yeah and that yeah and that
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:07.680]   was so it's not like it's not a tool that will work great for everything but when it works boy
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:12.480]   it works nicely and sometimes when it doesn't work well it actually gives you kind of a cool like
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:18.480]   painterly effect uh like you can actually if you're not necessarily looking to create a nicer quality
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:23.200]   image you just want to see what it'll do to a to a certain image you can run it through the the
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:28.240]   the combobulator like twice three times and sometimes you'll get a really nice interesting like ai
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:34.800]   effect to it so it's not just doing like the basic like uh image sharpening algorithms it really is
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:40.080]   using an ai model that was developed by Tencent uh to try to figure out what's in this image and try
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:46.240]   to create what's not in there to begin with uh and it's it's the the other caveat is that it is
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:51.840]   open source so it is very very open sourcey when it comes to interface it is basically like a
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:57.040]   hypercard stack almost it's it's so simplistic also uh it's not going to work on every single
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:04.320]   Mac out there it is multi-platform uh it works fine on my uh m1 macbook did not work on my
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:10.160]   surprise surprise by 10 year old uh my 10 year old uh mac mini uh so your mileage may vary it does
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:14.560]   have to have a GPU somewhere in the system in order for it to work but again it's free uh this is the
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:20.560]   second major release they've done and uh he's trying to we want to keep updating it with new image
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:24.960]   with new learning models uh new techniques and i'm definitely going to be in there for the ride
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:30.080]   because it is a fun app and sometimes a very useful app it's one thing people are doing now also with
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:36.560]   those ai image generators they're giving them a sketch sometimes like stick figures and then
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:43.440]   having stable diffusion or mid-journey or dolly finish the sketch and it's actually kind of
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:49.280]   remarkable i've seen some really good this is stable diffusion on this one but i've seen some
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:54.480]   really good examples of people taking stick figures and turning them into let me see if i can find
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:58.720]   another one turning them into something who some of these are kind of sexy now um
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:04.160]   turning them into something very artistic yeah so i guess you have to know what you're doing
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:09.280]   your prompts and everything but still it's it's not it's these these initial demos of hey look uh
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:16.080]   how about a doggy spaceman uh eating cake on uh on the planet fisbane on from the muppet show and
[01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:20.640]   that's a fun like tricky little fun little trick to play fun little demo it's going to be great like
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:25.280]   a year from now when they are taking these models and building specific tools out of them like
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:30.960]   when we get to the point where i can spend a month or two training this model for here is what i
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:35.440]   like what i want people to look like here is what i want environments to look like here is how the
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:39.680]   the sort of painting that i like i don't want you to simply take a pakaso style i want you to
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:44.400]   start with this i'm going to teach you what i think drawing should look like and then the ability
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:48.880]   to like do an entire comic book by simply doing these stick figures and then when when a stick
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:53.040]   figure is not emoting correctly taking that's the picture that was generated and putting a bigger
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:58.480]   smile or or basically something that will indicate turn the head to the left and make turn art into
[01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:02.800]   an iterative sort of process that anybody can access i don't think they'll be at the same level
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:09.120]   of like an atom hues or john bern or anything like that but uh just like i movie opened up uh
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:13.600]   visual storytelling and non-linear linear editing to people who just have an interest and want to
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:18.480]   screw around with it uh this is this is from this is the acorns from which mighty oaks can grow
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:22.800]   so this is why i'm super excited by what happens when more these models become more sophisticated
[01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:27.840]   it really exploded when stable diffusion uh came out because you could install that on your own if
[01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:32.320]   you have a good gaming machine and now there's a i'll make this my pick of the week there is a
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:38.800]   version of stable diffusion for the m1 mac uh divan goopta has actually bundled it into something
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:46.160]   he calls diffusion b which it makes it you know you you don't have to have a super high end but it's
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:51.360]   it would help to have a higher end m1 or m2 of a this will run locally on your machine i have not
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:55.760]   yet uh tried it but i hear very good uh things about it it makes it very easy to install
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:00.880]   uh instead of a docker image or something like that so diffusion b.com if you want to
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:06.320]   play with stable diffusion on your Mac quick one quick last but do you write to me that upscaled
[01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:10.640]   does run locally on the on your computer it doesn't contact another server so it's all
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:17.040]   that's nice and some some of these things take like i have for the first time in years was nostalgic
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:21.520]   i was able to like look how slowly it was processing something a big a big challenge i gave it's like
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:27.120]   wow i actually have time for the first time in years to use oh no my computers all tied up maybe i
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:31.440]   should just go down the street get some waffles then come back i hope it's done by it's by the time
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:35.600]   it by the time i come back so thank you i had breakfast today thank you because i was gave it
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:41.360]   something a stupid task that it was not really designed to do well it is uh open source it's on
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:47.760]   github and they have versions for linux mac and windows plus you get the source code and build
[01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:56.000]   it yourself so uh command line of that s ca y l op scale kind of cool neat
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:05.520]   Alex Lindsey pig Oui so in my journey to build this the new uh skyposaurus essentially i figured
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:09.840]   out this is a kind of an expensive one if you put them all together but but in my world it's much
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:14.800]   less expensive than what i was doing before so um so there's three pieces to this and i'm gonna
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:18.640]   show you two of them one of them didn't show up yet i have a we use them at the office already so
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:23.120]   i don't i know that it works and that's the sonnet that's the link i gave you there the sonnet box so
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:29.520]   that whole i know it's expensive because it's just a black box that's the ultimate black box that's
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:35.040]   that is the least expensive thing that's about three hundred bucks um so this is what i'm putting
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:40.160]   in it so this is a black magic um what's called a quad card so this will do four and four hours
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:45.520]   so the sonnet is just a uh content the pcie container that plugs into your computer with
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:50.560]   thunderbolt three or four okay so then you put this in and what the big exciting thing about this
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:55.200]   is that it's high density out so i can get up to eight outputs out of this out of this card
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:55:00.800]   so i can have eight video outputs from in my case zoom you know for for this so eight different
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:06.480]   people you've taken notes on this john all right so this is for sis so right yeah and the problem is
[01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:09.760]   you need a little switcher for this you know so you need to be able to switch this and so what i got
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:15.600]   here is the black magic now this is the same iso that was done i have this is what i run my show on
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:20.320]   like when i'm switching between things except this one's a little different because it uses STI
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:26.240]   so instead of HDMI for the old iso this is my new one that i that i just they also support
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:31.440]   india and uh it supports india well the switcher doesn't support india black magic doesn't use
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:36.320]   ndi now if you want to do ndi what what you should do i'm going to be building a bunch of different
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:41.840]   versions of this because i i want to see you know different ways of using iso and so with my mac
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:48.560]   mini i'm using this uh with my studio i'm going to use memo live from boinks you know to um pass that
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:55.920]   all via um uh i don't know i'm not going to lose my lost my head but anyway so i'm going to uh
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:02.480]   siphon so siphon is how i'm going to pass from zoom iso to memo live is using siphon for that
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:08.400]   and then i'm passing but to do hardware a hardware version of it i'm using this with a mac mini it's
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:13.360]   a little less it's actually less expensive to use this with a mac mini so then a studio um anyway so
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:19.280]   anyway these are the pieces of the puzzle i'll probably show them in the future as they get closer
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:23.600]   together and we're going to be doing lots of labs and office hours to talk about how to get this all
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:28.320]   working but what it means is that you could run a a pretty i think i'm going to be running a pretty
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:34.800]   darn good show with just a little bit of hardware i love it yeah and but you you know we've been
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:39.040]   struggling with this for 15 years you know since kolene built the yeah let's Skype the store it's
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:44.000]   amazing now it's it's literally getting down to this little switcher um this little card and a
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.960]   mac mini and it's not gonna make me kick myself that we have four more years in our lease of this
[01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:56.560]   studio i could just go home well the big thing is is that is that you know what we've had trouble
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:01.680]   with is that we have a half million dollars of hardware that does like yeah um that does bigger
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:07.040]   shows for oh and i know and then um office hours has its own little set of hardware that it just
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:13.040]   uses that's not a half million dollars like a uh 75 000 with a part better right and and it's well
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:17.680]   it does a lot of things on it but what what's happening here is that this is for like if i want
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:22.080]   to do like i'm gonna be starting to do the michael krasney show with this you know so this is going
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:27.120]   to be like the the rnd where we can do super sources and we can do lower thirds and all the
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:32.080]   things we want to do but it's it's just one person running this relatively you know be a 3500
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:38.000]   dollar kit that one person's using and it and it really if it works uh we're kind of on the front
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:46.560]   edge of it but if it works it's a um it really democratizes um really democrat i want to buy this
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:53.040]   son it's 350 bucks just to put other things in yeah yeah you could put any pcie card in here right so
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:58.400]   storage depends on how long they are if they're full size or whatever it fits the the black magic
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:04.400]   boxes the the cards the um there's bigger ones that'll fit larger cards there's ones that'll hold
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:09.440]   three cards at a time um i'm choosing to just use the one there's part of me that thought i should
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:15.840]   have gotten the three slot just for say this be an e gpu on intel max uh yeah that's what we use
[01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:20.960]   them for originally oh okay yeah each each p u but we um but mostly now we use them for video
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:25.920]   video in and out from the from the mac minis nice pick of the week and of course you'll find out more
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:31.680]   at office hours dot global in the days and weeks to come has me a lot of talk about building remote
[01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:36.960]   shows it's it's definitely a kind of obsession of a bars right now take notes john take notes
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:42.720]   i want to just quickly show we have a chat room pick of the week from evil irc the first game i've
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:50.400]   ever seen that uses the dynamic island it's a pawn game called hit the island and the idea i'm
[01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:56.400]   gonna replay it now the idea is here's the ball it bounces off the dynamic island which does a
[01:58:56.400 --> 01:59:04.400]   really nice little uh fact is you hit it isn't that hysterical it's free this ad supported hit the island
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:10.560]   i don't know if i guess you get a point every time you hit the island i don't know what else
[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:14.640]   happens maybe something else it seems to be changing yeah actually like you get into like
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:19.520]   multi ball and it gets complicated so you know about all this and you didn't tell us
[01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:26.880]   hit the island very cool we're you know it's so early it's all it's all novelty uh yeah it is right
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:32.160]   now right material right now it's like those beer pouring apps in the iphone days right yeah
[01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:38.160]   you know it'll settle down also let's let's let's see how long apple lets everybody have their
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:42.640]   fun before they say okay you know what it was funny at first but now well they specifically said
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:48.880]   you know we're gonna give you an api so apps can do it right i don't i don't think they had pong
[01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:55.200]   in mind i thought well this is a good use of the dynamic i'm glad i'm glad i feel like the island
[01:59:55.200 --> 02:00:00.800]   should be more expressive though like have a face on it that goes ow oh that would be more fun
[02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:07.440]   i'm not i'm not mario uh yeah i want to i want to hurt it hurt the island would be more interesting
[02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:13.680]   i'd pay an extra dollar it just goes boom it's pretty cool you think apple and no apple's not gonna
[02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:17.120]   let me say about this you never know though do you
[02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:28.320]   it's pong who would have thought oh no oh no people are enjoying something you had to kill that
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:33.840]   immediately i hear a child not a problem i was having fun in here uh who would have thought that
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:42.880]   when i was sitting in new haven't kennedyket at a bar playing this would have been 1974 75 let's say
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:50.240]   50 years ago playing pong my first computer game that someday i would have a phone in my pocket that
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:56.080]   i could play the same stupid game on minus the white russians andy and aqua when are you gonna be
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:01:03.280]   on gbh in boston next i'm off this week but you can check me out next thursday at 1245 in the
[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:11.680]   afternoon uh you can watch me and listen to me at wgbhnews.org live or later thank you andy so nice to see
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:19.600]   you always lovely mr. jason snell six colors dot com that's right anything you want to plug
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:26.000]   oh yeah check out six colors that's the best place to go i'm working on my phone reviews you know
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:30.240]   when you're in the second wave you got to try to like think deep thoughts because everybody's
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:35.200]   already rather reviews so it's not really what it's about anymore so i'm working on that and and
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:40.480]   taking my kid to college so you know when you when you're making that road trip it's a couple days
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:46.240]   yeah in a couple days now so in the cuts in the creels in the suits yeah i know right
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:56.640]   leece is going to do a new iPhone hey at least he's not a blue bubble that's all like that's all
[02:01:56.640 --> 02:02:03.200]   it matters and of course office hours dot global is where you'll find mr. Alex lindsey every hour of
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:13.680]   the day minus this one office hours is an amazing free club a clubhouse for everything from multimedia
[02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:21.440]   to cooking and and on and on yeah we had a great session this morning about euro racks and and
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:28.240]   modular synths and so there was a lot of a lot of really in-depth coverage there and then um
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:32.800]   tomorrow tomorrow is going to be really worth checking out we you know we covered iBC you know
[02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:38.240]   it's the end it's the european nab and we had two live views we were doing virtual production
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:43.120]   there was 10 people on the ground i think 20 or 30 people in the cloud kind of working on things
[02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:47.200]   um to put that put it together and tomorrow the team is coming together and they're just going
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:51.520]   to break down like how did we actually pull that off and what what was all the hardware because
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:55.280]   what we what we do in office hours of course is when we do the production it's kind of transparent
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:03:01.040]   so we go this we do something and then we open it up and explain how it all worked and what we all
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:04.880]   did so anyway that's going to be tomorrow morning so it should be should be a lot of fun and it'll
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:12.080]   be recorded on youtube otherwise i have to watch thursday's holding viewers attention episode clearly
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:19.120]   something to learn about but you have office hours at global you want to hire alex zero non zero
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:25.520]   dot zero nine zero dot media thank you alex thank you and you thank you alex thanks also to our club
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:30.480]   twit members who subsidize all of our programming if you're not yet a member seven dollars a month
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:35.680]   gets you ad free versions of all of our shows you wouldn't even be hearing this ad if you were a
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:42.160]   member you also get asked access to the club twit discord which is a barrel of laughs a lot of fun
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:51.200]   i was playing um uh what was it satisfactory in the let's play section streaming that on twitch
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:58.160]   for our club members uh yeah i guess that was uh saturday and uh yesterday did a little more of that
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:04.640]   now i want to do uh something a cool game that alex will help taught me about called farther
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:10.720]   something farther farming i don't know anyway that's part of the fun uh we have the book club we have
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:15.680]   shows that don't make it uh to the public uh i because they're subsidized by the club things
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:21.920]   like hands on mac with uh micro sergeant hands on windows with ball tharat the untitled linux
[02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:26.800]   show with jonathan bennett stacy's book club stacy's book clubs coming up october 27th we're
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:32.480]   gonna do the book will be the long way to a small angry planet i joined in with ant proitt and stacy
[02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:38.480]   that's a lot of fun we're doing a fireside chat this thursday with ant and club twit members
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:42.880]   it's just a great place to hang and then there's also the twit plus feed and that's for instance
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:46.880]   where we'll show some more of those photos from the good old days that we did before the show that
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:51.440]   doesn't make it into the podcast but it makes it to the twit plus feed all of that for a mere seven
