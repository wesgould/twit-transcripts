[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.960]   Lori Gilles here from imore.com, managing editor.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.240]   Hi, Lori.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.960]   Hi, how are you?
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.800]   You're a blonde this week.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.880]   I am. Well, I got a little pink this time.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.560]   Oh, nice. I like it.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.520]   Yeah. I like it.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.720]   It's pretty fun. I'm enjoying it.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.520]   Yeah. Do blondes have more fun, I wonder?
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.160]   Based on my personal experience of having multiple hair colors,
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160]   I'm going to say no. It doesn't matter what your hair color is.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.880]   You can have fun.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.080]   You can have fun no matter what.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.600]   Andy Inako.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.440]   It's the debut.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.120]   I'm going to sit it again. Chicago Sun-time.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.760]   Former Scrull sometimes now WGBHNPR.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.800]   Former Scribe.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.520]   He, like me, has learned it's a lot easier to talk than write.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.160]   Well, not necessarily because now I have to like actually,
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.160]   when I do radio, I have to like be in a place with other people.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.800]   So I can't just like do radio from my bed without having shaved, without having changed up.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.400]   Oh, you don't know. That's how I did it for years.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.920]   In fact, I stopped doing that because it was kind of grim.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.480]   I used to have my radio studio on my house and you're just hard to get your energy up when it's
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.040]   just you and your jammies and your buddy slippers. This is not the same.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.640]   Well, again, in my old age, I'm finding that to be true.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.000]   This is again one of the reasons why I'm doing podcasts from the library
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.400]   because it does force me to say, "Guess what? You're going to be ready like an hour in advance.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.240]   You're just like, you're not just going to keep doing gay mail until five minutes before.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.080]   You're going to shave in the morning." Yeah. So you're going to actually see people.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.640]   Speaking of people, look who's here. Renee Ritchie, coffee achiever.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.720]   And I am doing this in my pajamas from my home.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.560]   It can go full circle. Are you wearing your bunny slippers though?
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.120]   No, but I have dyed my hair, Greg, because I heard the silver foxes have more fun.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.760]   Silver foxes, silverbacks have more fun. And I'll,
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.440]   silverbacks. I'll vouch for that.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.480]   My crumping is not advanced. So a week from
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:37.000]   two weeks from today, one week from today, no two weeks from today, we expect an apple event. Yes.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.040]   Yes. You would be foolish. You would be foolish to buy an iPhone today.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.040]   Unless it's within the return window. Wait a few more days.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.800]   Oh, yeah. What is the return window? Actually.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.760]   In the return. I think it's like 14 days in most places, isn't it?
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.600]   14 days from the day you can buy it. So it would be 14 days, not from September 10th,
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:04.120]   but probably something like September 20. Hold. Hold. Hold. Hold until after Labor Day.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.040]   Then you could do whatever you want. I had quite a few friends just in this past week.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.120]   Say to me, what's the best iPhone that I should get right now? And I keep saying,
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.760]   just wait just a couple more weeks. And they're telling me my phone is about to die. I don't know
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.760]   if I can. Oh, man. Just try. Just try. We have a little bit longer.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.840]   It's the strangest thing. You know, I had even the radio show people are calling.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.880]   And Lisa's iPhone 10S Max has been really flaky. It died as I mentioned in Orlando on our trip.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.760]   I let her mind. She says, wow, yours works so much better than mine. I have the same model.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.920]   And so we really concluded it was it was a lemon, which I've been saying for months because she
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.360]   said, I dropped a call or I can't get online. I said, you got a bad device. The problem is proving
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.360]   it to Apple. She brought it on Sunday. She brought it to the Apple store. The genius said, well,
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.400]   I can't in our tests, I can't see anything. So we're just going to wipe the phone and wish you the
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.240]   best. And it's like it was a little annoying, Lisa, because it's like, well, I know it's not good
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.560]   because it's crashing it every day. It'll have to be reset and things like that. But this is how
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.880]   I kind of understand any tech support person is going to be faced with this because it's if you
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.600]   can't demonstrate to them and to their face, it's hard for them to understand what's going on.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.280]   And if it doesn't happen in a very specific set pattern, you can't reproduce it.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.120]   It's like it's like taking your car in when you know there's like a weird noise that happens,
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.320]   but I don't know when it happens. And the mechanic is just like, well, I didn't hear it. So we're
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.400]   going to change the oil. Yeah, they take a test drive and they say, well, it's not doing it. And
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.640]   yeah, so you got to have a reproducible flaw. Unfortunately, these days, you know, is it
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:49.000]   is a completely possible of a device that is kind of just not right, but not so bad that you're
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.880]   going to new one. Anyway, I told her, don't wait. Don't worry. You two weeks, you can, you can
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.640]   gazelle it. Maybe it's testing it's impending deaths. That's what it's doing. Like it just knows
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.560]   to get the new one. That's what I wonder. It's kicking and screaming. Everybody is the same thing.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.360]   I'm having the same experiences. Laurie, everybody's saying, oh, my phone. Is it just no somehow?
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.080]   Yeah, it does. It knows that we're going to use it to watch its own replacement.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:21.160]   So we got the latest german. The new german, yeah, Apple ready's camera focused pro iPhones,
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.200]   new iPads, larger MacBook Pro. This is very much what we've been talking about all along.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.320]   There's nothing new here. Is there or is there? There's a couple new things. I mean, he's talking
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.920]   about the increased shatter resistance and the glass, which is nice. The increased water resistance,
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:42.200]   it'll go beyond 30 minutes, which is also really nice. The best way I've come across to explain
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.240]   what the iPhone 11 is going to be to people is the iPhone 7. You've had the iPhone 6 and the
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.400]   6S, you had the iPhone 10 and the 10S. And now you're going to get one that has, you know,
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:56.040]   is better waterproofing, better features, nicer design, nicer finish it. What, nicer to have it.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.720]   The same design with nicer finishes and a big honkin camera upgrade just slapped onto the back of it.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:08.200]   We still believe the way he writes his headline sounds like it's all going to come at once,
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.840]   but I don't think that's the case, right? No, in the article, he actually says, you know,
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.600]   he's listing everything but saying that some of the things will be coming later, which I think
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:24.040]   is true. But all in 2019. Maybe the things like the AirPods could go to that. If anything is not
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:29.800]   ready now or not ready in October, they could very easily be ready in March, or they could just say,
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.560]   we don't, these are too close together. We're going to move them. And I apologize kind of for
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.840]   rehashing everything because, you know, we talked about this every week, the last few weeks, but
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.960]   this is the time of year. And there's nothing much to talk about except the impending Apple event.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:50.120]   The thing that's so exciting about the camera. Go ahead, Rudei, then then, then,
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.480]   Larry. I was going to say the thing that's so exciting about the camera case for me is like,
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.680]   I have this problem. And I know other people have had it too. Like even on this video,
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.280]   when I'm shooting my videos, if I'm too far to one side, I can't really fix it,
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.120]   because I either have to move it over and there's no image data on one side of it,
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.840]   or I have to zoom in and nobody needs this head to be any bigger than it already is. And then I
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.080]   lose data. And that happens when you take photos, it's just not centered and there's no way to
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.320]   without zooming in too much to cut it off to get it back in the center, or the people aren't equal
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.400]   or one kid moved and suddenly his face is missing. And what I like about this is they're going to
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:26.920]   fire all three cameras and just buffer that ultra wide angle and then do computational
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.080]   photography to normalize it. So it looks instead of being treated as a different lens model,
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:37.320]   it'll be functionally just more data. And then you can reposition, reframe the shot the way we
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.720]   were changing depth before. And now we're changing literally the framing of the shot.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:47.080]   And it's going to do that not just in photo, but in video, it sounds like the video is getting
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:52.360]   full on. They said pro camera quality update with much bigger sensors. They're going to be taking
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:57.160]   much higher resolution pictures, much better low light. And as someone whose iPhone is their
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.720]   primary camera now, that is super exciting to me.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:05.640]   Yeah, absolutely. Andy's audio is way down.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.800]   How about you, Laurie? And then we'll fix Andy.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.440]   So I was just going to talk about how I love this time of year. And I know there's a little
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.600]   bit of the rehashing going on that we're kind of talking about the same thing over and over again.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:24.440]   iPhone 11, for example. But to me, this is the way I feel like I'm a kid and Christmas is coming.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:30.840]   It's what am I going to get? What is it going to look like? Is it going to be what I asked Santa
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:35.960]   for? So this kind of stuff to me, this is why I got into the business about writing about Apple
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:41.960]   is I love just getting excited about what the possibilities are. And I personally am never
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:47.400]   disappointed with the outcome. The biggest disappointment is that we lately hear so many
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:52.600]   leaks that when they do announce it, it's like, "Oh, yeah, well, that's basically what we thought
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.320]   it was going to be." And it's not quite as big of a surprise as it used to be. But I love all this
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:03.160]   kind of talking about the minutiae of what might be on the next iPhone. We're still trying to figure
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:08.760]   out whether or not USB-C is coming, but apparently it's going to be a lightning to USB-C cable,
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.080]   which is sort of like getting USB-C on an iPhone, but not quite.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:19.640]   It's pretty clear photography is going to be. By the way, I can hear you now, Andy. Go ahead.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:25.800]   Sorry about that. It's an exciting time for mobile photography because now we have
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.440]   sensors that can capture way, way more data than you actually need to get a good picture.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:36.680]   So like Renee says, whereas before just two or three years ago, a camera had to take one picture
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:41.160]   and either had guessed right on how to do it or guessed wrong yet to take what you get.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:47.480]   Now it's taking like 50 photos. It's like, let's just shoot pictures with every setting imaginable.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.600]   And then in the two-tenths of a second after we take the picture, we'll figure out what the best
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:59.720]   parts are of each. And when you have a company like Apple, that's hanging its hat on the quality
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:04.280]   of the pictures and the quality of the video that it takes, that's when you really, really get
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:10.280]   super alive. This is why I'm really, I'm looking forward to the new features of the new Pixel phone.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.280]   For me personally, because I'm an Android user, but it's not really about...
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:22.120]   Andy's having a little trouble with his connectivity, I'm afraid. The library's on to him.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:28.200]   It's caught on. You know, there's somebody in room 32 that seems to be sucking bandwidth like crazy.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.920]   We think they're streaming the boys, but we're not sure.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.680]   I agree with Andy. I mean, in computational photography, clearly the next big thing. And
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.920]   I will also be waiting like Andy to see what the Pixel 4 does because that's going to come out
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.400]   almost certainly a month or so after the iPhone 11.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:49.000]   Oh, and the cool rumor that Gremlin had too is that Google's going to be using the radar effect.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.560]   Yes.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:55.640]   To project Solis to increase the usable range of their Face ID system, which is remarkably similar
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:00.600]   to Apple's Face ID. And Gremlin reports that Apple's Face ID is also going to be way expanded.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:06.280]   It'll unlock sooner and over a greater variety of angles, including flat-out tables.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.720]   So all that tech is getting better now.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.800]   You know, the laggard here is Samsung, the number one phone manufacturer in the world.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.360]   Their fingerprint idea, this is the Note 10 plus the new Samsung.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.320]   It's pretty bad.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.840]   It's very pretty bad. Shimmering it back.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.160]   But that's a gimmick.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.800]   But it's such a good one.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.920]   It's a pretty gimmick.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.480]   But they're...
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.520]   Looks like Lori's Apple card.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:31.320]   And in many ways, they have three lenses. They even have a time of flight sensor,
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.320]   kind of a radar sensor on the back here.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.760]   And it feels like they've got all the pieces in place to do what Apple's doing.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.520]   And Google hopes to do, I guess, which is use like take a picture with all.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.560]   But they don't.
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.880]   Like you use one or the three lenses.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.520]   And it doesn't...
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.040]   The depth sensing doesn't seem to be helping live focus at all.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.800]   They can now do live focus in video.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.720]   I'd be curious...
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.160]   And of course, Google's never really needed three lenses, but they're going to have three lenses.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.200]   So it sounds like though, I feel like Apple's on the right track.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.640]   And the fingerprint sensor on the Samsung is terrible.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.200]   And their face-
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.640]   That's way worse than the optical ones.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.200]   Even they say it's not to be used for secure,
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.680]   because it's just not as good as what Apple's doing.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.480]   And they ditched the iris scanner right on the latest notes.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.440]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.000]   I don't know.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:15.960]   Yeah, I don't say it.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.640]   Which some people found actually usable.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.160]   Well, it's certainly more secure.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.800]   It's interesting.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.960]   Samsung has always been a company that ships feature sets.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.920]   And it's partially because I think they're a vendor.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.120]   They're a supplier.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.240]   They're the ones who produce all these parts for other companies.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.120]   And they just always want to have like,
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.440]   we'll just put it in an FC radio and they will just put it in the lights.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.120]   But their ink trick creation isn't as good, is it?
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:38.680]   Yes.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.240]   Yes.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.920]   Because they're not as much a pressure sets.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.560]   Right.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.800]   Where they don't ship NFC, they ship Apple Pay.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.480]   They don't ship a second lens.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.160]   They ship portrait mode and digital zoom.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.280]   They don't ship a third lens.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.320]   They ship smart framing.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:54.200]   They're very cognizant of what the user experience will be for the technology they add.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.120]   The other thing I think is safe to say,
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.120]   you tell me if I'm wrong, Laurie and Renee,
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.280]   but that the video on the iPhone has always been better than anybody else's.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.080]   We talk all the time about stills.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:12.120]   And I would say that Pixel 3 XLO and Pixel 3A maybe are giving Apple run for its money.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.160]   Huawei, too.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:13.880]   And Huawei.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:18.120]   But in video, is Apple still the king?
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:26.040]   I think Samsung, they've been doing really well with the Galaxy 10 and now the Galaxy 10
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.360]   note where I think they've sort of caught up.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.280]   They've got stabilization.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:30.840]   They've got stabilization.
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.840]   Excellent stabilization built in now.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.200]   But this sounds really interesting.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.120]   It sounds like next level stuff.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:38.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.680]   So Apple's developed a feature.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.880]   This is german that allows users, this is in video, to retouch,
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:50.840]   apply effects, alter colors, refame, and crop video as it's being recorded live on the device.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:57.080]   So here's why I ask.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:02.680]   We're planning to go to CES this year, kind of a return to CES.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.200]   We've said people before, but I think I'm going to go and I know we're going to have
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.880]   probably Ant and maybe even Micah and Father Robert down there as well.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.920]   And to save my, it's a very expensive proposition for us to go down there with
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.560]   with a boost, which we have done in the past.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.240]   That's a hundred some thousand dollars.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:23.880]   But even to go down there with a crew, even if we use a crew in Vegas, I want to do it.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.160]   Alex Lindsay's always said we could just do it with an iPhone.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.000]   I want to do it.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:29.800]   Or maybe with it.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.440]   I don't know.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.480]   I guess I'll have to see what the new iPhone could do with a new Pixel 4 could do
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.320]   because we have till January to decide.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.920]   But I think I'm going to use a camera phone and it may well be the iPhone.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.440]   Samsung has built video editing into its phones now.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.760]   So they come with a video editor that's designed, especially in the Note 10, to use
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:47.720]   with the stylus.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:52.040]   So you really have small touch targets because they know you're going to use a stylus
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.920]   and a very fine ability to cut and move and stuff.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.200]   I'd be very interested to see which one can do the best job.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.040]   So we don't bring an editor.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.640]   We don't bring a camera guy or a sound guy.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.080]   One of the other things that Samsung does, and I haven't really tried it out,
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:11.240]   is supposedly they have three mics that aim at the subject of your video.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.680]   So the audio is targeted.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.600]   I haven't really tried that out.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.280]   I suppose I ought to.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.080]   It sounds like it changes the loudness.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.520]   Instead of you being loud, it makes whatever you're resuming in on louder.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.240]   I want to get CES is a real challenge sonically because of all the noise.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.520]   And if you could hear the guy who's three or four feet away that you're
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.920]   videoing clearly against the background noise,
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.800]   that would, you know, we're going to have to bring them all.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.960]   That will be one of the things we'll review at CES,
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.400]   which phone would be the best running gun video shooting.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:46.280]   And we're on the pot with the phone on the pocket and then a directional mic on top of the other side.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.280]   I mean, there's a lot of stuff you can do.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.120]   I've always been one of those people who says you should be able to do it all by yourself.
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.760]   We should be able to do Gorilla Gorilla video.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.640]   Right?
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.880]   You'll find out in January if that works.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.880]   Maybe the new iPad, we go with the giant cameras on the iPad.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.440]   Do that big viewfinder. You can just go around and just.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:06.920]   Well, I pass.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.520]   Now the rumor is there will be better cameras on the iPad too.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.560]   Will they be as good as the iPhone or they've always lagged behind, right?
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:18.520]   Yeah, it'll be tough to say if it gets the 11 camera or the 11 pro camera,
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.440]   but either one would be a big upgrade from what they have now.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.560]   Well, that'd be fascinating.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.880]   Then I would consider the iPad as a, especially if you got a rig to hold it and.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.200]   Yeah, they make some nice rigs.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.680]   Shotgun mic that comes down so you can get good sound.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:36.440]   The ability to shoot a 4K video and edit and post it from the same device that in itself
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.000]   would sell it.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:37.480]   Exactly.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.920]   Exactly.
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.280]   I wouldn't need to bring an editor down.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.440]   We just, we could do it all and run and gun and had fire and file those stories.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.960]   Instantly, you know, and be constantly firing through filing throughout the day.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:52.280]   I think that'd be a great way to cover CES because that's really what you
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.680]   by always thinking on CES was always.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.880]   And this is true of any conference.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.920]   I want to give you the experience you'd have if you were in a 10 D.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.080]   So you're looking, you'd say, well, I want to see that booth.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.920]   I want to see that booth and we just go and we do that.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.160]   All right.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:05.640]   So far.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.240]   Welcome back, Andy.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:07.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.200]   We lost you.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.160]   Sounds like we got a good trip.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:09.480]   Sorry about that.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.200]   I don't know.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.040]   Maybe I just had a bad initial connection.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.240]   It's much better now.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.320]   I just, I just said to Carson, this is strike two because this is the second time that like
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:23.160]   I had a disruption and I'm, I'm so desperate to keep this wonderful spot as my podcasting home
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.200]   that like, okay, we'll try.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.240]   If there's a strike three, then we'll stop or loop.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.920]   I'm going to have to see how big a donation I'll have to make to the library to say.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.200]   Can you possibly give me a static IP address on the app?
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.880]   I don't think they'll do it.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.720]   I don't think they'll do it.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.400]   So I am living dangerously.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.480]   I have a leather wallet.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:49.400]   Oh, Apple, you know where I'm going with this inside this leather wallet.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.720]   I have stored a pristine, dumb, dumb, beautiful white.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.600]   Oh, no, you did it.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.640]   Titanium metal.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.520]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.120]   It sounds better than any other card.
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.440]   Sounds like I got a lot of implement in my wallet.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.960]   But it's no stain so far.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.960]   Did, did Apple actually warn people?
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:12.840]   Because I can't find it.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.400]   They, they, they actually released us.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.880]   They released a support document that said, here is how to care for your Apple card.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.360]   And it really is like caring for an iPhone.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.120]   It says only don't use any detergents clean for the damp, damp cloth.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.640]   And also contains like the rather miraculous statements.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.640]   Don't, don't, don't store it in anything made out of leather.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.120]   And also don't store it in anything that might, where it might be placed next to other credit cards.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.360]   That sounds like a definition of a wallet to me.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.360]   I don't know if that's where they're getting at,
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:48.200]   but they're saying that the leather, leather and denim can stain permanently your Apple card.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:48.680]   So.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.720]   And that's like, okay, you know, there's a certain irony to this.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:56.200]   Because when you use your Apple card, it gets stained, not the physical card,
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.480]   the digital card.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.720]   Now mine's pristine white again.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.720]   But when I used it at the grocery store, it turned brown as if I'd kept it in leather.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:11.160]   But I, but I have to say, look, I've got some Apple cash already got $7.63 back from one trip
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.120]   to the grocery store.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.600]   That's pretty nice because I used Apple pay.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.520]   And then when you pay it off, it's kind of fun.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:22.120]   Because so the car gets different colors as you buy stuff blue for entertainment,
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.840]   brown for a lot of stuff.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:29.000]   Then there's one other color like a magenta, I guess for electronics and electronics.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.680]   But when you pay it off, it gets white again.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.040]   It's like you cleaned it off.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.280]   I hope, I hope that the, I hope I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.240]   Just saying it was pretty fun.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.120]   Mine is currently solid purple.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:42.760]   Is it?
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.520]   A lot of entertainment going through there.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:50.760]   Well, I, I weirdly my, it's purple because I took my cat to the vet to get a surgery.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.160]   Okay.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.280]   So that's good.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.600]   Well, no, no, we need to, we need to accumulate the different colors you get.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.880]   Pet surgery is purple.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.600]   That's good to know.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:58.680]   That's good to know.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.120]   Huh?
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.240]   I thought she was going to say three years at Disney Plus made it purple.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.120]   That will do it too.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.840]   So do you, so you, so you, Renee, I'm sorry.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.440]   I apologize because he can't get one of these.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.920]   No, but what I thought was hysterical was that immediately,
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.360]   or a couple of days afterwards, all the other credit card people started putting up articles
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:20.200]   about how to take care of your credit card because suddenly that was the SEO battle you had to win.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.160]   Oh, that's crazy.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.680]   Well, I, well, I have other metal cards.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:30.040]   I have an, a metal American Express card, but it doesn't clank as, I think titanium is a bit of
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:30.360]   radium.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.320]   We need a vibranium.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.880]   Titanium has such a nice clank to it.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:39.880]   Not as, not as, not as the clank of coins, the Russell of paper.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.840]   Oh, all right.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:47.000]   I was talking about this issue with some friends and, and I went into this just thinking that Apple
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.480]   has to be trolling us, right? Because they're talking about, you know, don't use compressed air.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:57.880]   That's like very specific wording for cleaning your iPhone and really ridiculous when you think
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:02.680]   about using to clean a credit card, right? So I thought, oh, well, they're just being really funny.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:07.480]   But then Renee was pointing out that they're kind of, make it, they're, they're covering themselves.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.720]   You know, if you remember when the HomePod first came out and you got rings on your wood,
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:18.200]   because the HomePod would leave a ring to it. And so then Apple sort of after the fact came out and
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.280]   said, here's, you know, put down, put down coasters so that you don't mess up your furniture.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.920]   So in this case, in this case, Apple is kind of ahead of the curve and saying,
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.880]   okay, there's going to be a bunch of people who are going to complain about how their credit card
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:34.680]   is going to get all messed up. So let's just jump the gun on this and give them this support document
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:40.760]   to explain how to clean it. But here's my argument. If they had just sent this Apple card in an
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:47.240]   envelope and put somewhere on the cardboard thing that it comes in, you know, we recommend leaving
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:51.720]   it in the envelope to keep it clean. Nobody would be talking about how to clean your Apple card
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:56.040]   right now at all that because then they've, they've covered their backs, right? Because then when
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:05.400]   people start complaining about how they're, they can cover their back by saying, well, we told you
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.640]   whether you did it or not. And they do. And Lori backed me up on this. The onboarding experience
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:16.120]   the card is awesome. They comes in a very nice extra stiff, is it cardboard or plastic with an
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:21.480]   NFC chip in the envelope? She has a sheath and has an NFC chip and says, this is the best experience
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:26.520]   I've ever had to activate your card. Put your phone here. And just like with the AirPods or
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:31.960]   whatever that little card slides up says, Oh, you got an Apple card. It's just great.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.840]   My only thing about this is that I wish that it feels like a missed opportunity to me because
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:41.080]   when I heard titanium, I thought of metal. I thought it would be this wonderful metal card.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:45.720]   And in my imagination and my technology wonder heart, I imagine it would be like vibranium that
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:50.520]   Apple will have solved because it's true. Every card does to you know, I just my American Express
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:54.840]   is getting the plastic off the edges. My Visa card is all grimy, you know, they, they, but
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.160]   this was an opportunity to end all that. It doesn't have to be just like every other credit card.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:03.400]   I would have loved them to come up with some wonder finish that just it's not oleophobic,
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.400]   but it's like human phobic. It just gets rid of all the crap that we filthy creatures
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.240]   walk around with every day and always looks like the way it looks in that video.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.640]   That's to be honest, for all we know, it does because so far have you have you been able to
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:20.200]   besmirch your Apple card, Lori? I haven't. I keep it. I keep it on leather wallet.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:26.840]   Yeah, me too. Yeah. Yeah. So I think this is overblown. I, well, it's it's like,
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:32.760]   no, please no Cheetos. I just think we're kind of obligated to make fun of Apple for this. Just
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:38.520]   like we were so happy to make fun of Apple for for not not not for again, they put so much thought
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:43.000]   into, well, what if we put an NFC chip in every envelope? So the onboarding chip,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.280]   not thinking about, well, why don't we just make sure that this thing will not look like crap after
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:53.960]   like three weeks in the without the people to read a special document? It's the same thing with
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:58.120]   the with the with the with the HomePod. It's like, did they not understand that people are going to
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:04.360]   put this on top of furniture? And that this maybe very important for it not to not to ruin the
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.920]   finish on your piece of furniture. These are like the first things that you do. And then you
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:14.040]   figure out how to make the cool NFC chip stuff work. I'm sure the YouTube videos that involve
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:19.400]   scraping the pain off of this thing will emerge soon if you apply nail polish remover. But I have
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:25.720]   to say there's something the the the name your name, the Apple logo, actually your name is not,
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:31.160]   but the Apple logos embossed as is the master card and Goldman Sachs. And they've de-bossed
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:37.720]   the mag strip. So it's so the so I mean they've really actually know this is they're all debossed.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.800]   You're right. They're not embossed. Maybe your name. No, no, it's all deboss, which means it's sunk
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:48.440]   into it. And I presume that the shiny metal we're seeing color seeing is actually the color of the
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:54.200]   card, which is very pretty. I wonder how many layers you have to scrape off the shiny metal part.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.720]   Stay tuned. I'm sure there'll be a YouTuber that'll do that soon. It seems pretty.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.160]   When it's the same thing, how soon before we have videos or services where you can refinish
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.720]   your card? I'll give you a tip. Like the raw red YouTubers. Oh yeah, like the like you do now with
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.440]   the AirPods and other Apple stuff you can you can who is that the color colorize? What is the name
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:15.880]   of that? Yeah, yeah. Colorware. Colorware. Here's a tip from Father Robert Ballisair,
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:22.360]   the digital Jesuit, the mad priest. I didn't know this. Fluoride dissolves titanium.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:27.400]   So if you have fluoridated water, don't leave your apple card in a glass of water.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:33.800]   Whoa. Apple should. That's amazing. Yeah, I want to see that video. No, I want to know why
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:41.720]   Padra needs to get rid of an apple card body this badly. Fluoride titanium. The financial news
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:46.600]   network. So probably the fluoride is too the blue water, but that's that's something I've been
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:51.720]   wondering about since I got my physical apple card is, you know, when you when you're not going
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:56.920]   to use a card anymore and you know, cut it up or you shred it, you can't cut up or shred the
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:02.520]   apple card. What do you do with it to destroy it? Like you can't you can't destroy it microwave it.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:08.600]   No, but it didn't fluoride apparently. If you weren't putting it in fluoride. Yeah,
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:12.600]   brush your teeth with it. I had a titanium watch for the longest time and it was natural finish,
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:17.880]   beautiful gray. It was my favorite watch and it broke unfortunately, but and they stopped making
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.720]   but I washed my hands all the time and I didn't you know, I don't I think you'd have to have a
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:26.760]   stronger fluoride concentration to dissolve it. No, no, don't ask any questions. Padra will tell
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:34.200]   you no lies. Yeah, now there's one negative I should report for the apple card. The obviously
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:39.000]   thanks to apple the onboarding experience, the getting the card signing up for it and the and
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.320]   getting it and activating it always is a really nice experience. Best anywhere. However, you need
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:50.200]   to have an iPhone to pay off your card. And that's something you should be aware of. And
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:54.200]   apparently the way you pay it off, at least the way I paid it off, you hook it up to a bank account.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:28:00.840]   So you can't write them a check. You can hook it up to multiple bank accounts though,
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.720]   which I thought was interesting. If you're you know, if you and your partner pay through separate
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.160]   accounts, you can actually use separate separate things. So you're gonna have it with apple cash?
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:17.960]   Yes. No. Oh, sorry. I apologize. I spoke. I misspoke. Yes, you can. Yes. Yeah. But at the
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:23.320]   rate of apple cash in any dodgy way you want and then you can use it. Yeah. At the rate of
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:28.680]   rate of 2% of transactions could take you a while to pay off your card. You're gonna be going on
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:35.560]   on your own Bitcoin. Yeah. And that's the other thing is your cash back is in is in apple cash.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:40.840]   So I you know, I don't know what I'm gonna use apple cash for. I guess if I buy or oh, I know
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:45.800]   arcade plus I'll use that. Yeah. That's probably what that's what they're thinking.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:53.880]   Oh, yeah. Exactly. It's like when the casino lets you pay for casino services using chips.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:58.120]   It's like, no, no, no. Don't exchange our house script for actual money. Spend it here.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:02.920]   It's all here. But yeah, I bet most people are just gonna park it and then use it for like when
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.680]   they're sharing when they're splitting a bill with other people and they need to like pay people back.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:11.880]   I'm new to all this. Is there a way to take apple cash? I think and with not and make it something.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:16.040]   I can send it. Yeah. You just have it deposited into your bank account. You can.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:21.720]   Okay. Yeah. You just have to set it up. It's very easy. We have a guide or any dodgy Bitcoin scheme.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:29.960]   So I have to say the cashback is kind of nice. I bought something like $383 or the groceries
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:36.360]   and I got $7.63 back. That's pretty nice. That's a burrito. That's a burrito.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:41.320]   As soon as you can translate that into something tangible, then you start to really appreciate it.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.320]   Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no, I want a burrito.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:50.200]   Well, there are some people who are worried and saying like, you know, it's a lock in,
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:55.160]   which fair enough. But I always point out now that iPhone amongst non nerds, like the mainstream,
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:00.280]   the vast majority of people still has an over 90% retention rate. So it's mostly us nerds who
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.880]   move around phones. Then we tend to keep a lot of phones, including an iPhone. But if you're
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.840]   all worried about it being tied to the iPhone, you don't plan on having an iPhone for years and
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.280]   years and years like Lori Gill and myself, but then pay attention to that part.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:16.120]   Yeah. What's so there's no alternative way to pay this off.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.000]   There will be. It's like apple pay where they rolled it out to iPhones first,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.400]   then it went to iPads and then Max and then the web. It's on iPhones and iPads now,
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:27.080]   and it will go to the Mac and it'll. It's not quite they need a web interface so that if I lose my
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:31.640]   phone, I could still pay my bill. Yeah. See, this is what seems kind of
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:37.000]   churlish to me that I really think that you have to make give people as many options as possible.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.600]   And when you deny people those options, you leave yourself open to the,
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:46.280]   to people speculating that, no, you made this decision, Apple made this decision specifically,
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:52.040]   so that to make make it harder for people to switch away from from an iPhone, because I
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:57.320]   remains right that people tend not to hop from phone to phone to phone, but you never know.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:01.480]   There's always going to be like that, that deal at your local phone store that says,
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:06.520]   Oh, you mean that I can get everybody in the house, the latest Samsung Galaxy phone for and
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.760]   that if I buy one, they'll get like two free everybody's time I plan. Well, definitely switch
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:15.160]   from the iPhone because I'd love everybody to have like the same really, really modern phone.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:20.440]   But then you've, but then they bump their heads into well, but gosh, I'll have to stop using the
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:26.200]   Apple card. I'll have to, and this is already canceled in another card. And it becomes unnecessarily
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:32.040]   difficult when all you have to do is add a web interface, or at least let me use desktop machines
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.840]   to use it, that this is not this is the sort of thing that that consistently annoys me about Apple
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:43.560]   that this isn't like messages where there is a credible argument to be made that Apple can't,
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:47.800]   it's not an Apple's best financial interest to support a billion people worldwide using
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:52.600]   Android phones using the messages service. But what's their excuse for not having,
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:56.920]   not having a couple of interns for a month working on a web interface for this,
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:01.640]   just to make sure that if you lose your phone or for whatever reason that life happens,
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:06.520]   you can pay your bill and take a look at your finances from the web. I just don't see that Apple
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:10.280]   has a little excuse for that. Yeah, I agree. It's a little bit of a cause.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:16.200]   But remember the American Express slogan for some years ago, membership has its privileges.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:22.120]   That's kind of what this is. The long standing issue they have is there's one team, and Apple
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.040]   teams aren't big, there's one team working on this interface, and they got the iPhone version
[00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:31.000]   done and crammed it into settings on the iPad. And that team now has to go build the Mac version
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   and then has to build the web version. And they also try to, they don't assume that the iPhone
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.760]   version is correct. So they'll get a bunch of feedback and then make a better iPhone version
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:42.920]   that will be the version they bring to the Mac. I'm guessing that Goldman Sachs will also weigh
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.240]   in on this. This is their first credit card. They're the ones that are going to get the heat
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.520]   if there's no other way to pay it off. I'm guessing there will be
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:55.800]   and the support costs and the support costs, right? As more and more people have this and then call
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.760]   up and say, Hey, I lost my iPhone. What do I do? This bill is going to go up to the phone, which is
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:05.480]   big support cost. Yeah. And that's another thing that's worth talking about. Goldman Sachs really
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.720]   has to demonstrate their good faith to customers because the last time that they were really
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:16.280]   largely in the news in terms of personal finance, they were getting slammed because they were selling
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:21.800]   financial products to individuals while also internally using their own money to bet against
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:27.480]   those same financial products. So they really have to demonstrate that they're not out to screw
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:31.320]   consumers like they were out to screw their own investors. You know what? It's a new Goldman
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:35.240]   Sachs. The secretary of the treasury is formerly Goldman Sachs. There's a lot of Goldman Sachs.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:39.160]   There you go. Well, you know, it's an all new administration. We know it's as good as gold.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.960]   It's good as gold. Here, by the way, it's like the Accenture is not as decent.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:47.560]   Is your first YouTube video. What's inside an Apple credit card?
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.760]   Tear it out. Three. Two.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:56.120]   How did you go, Laurie? One. Yes, I'm so happy. Oh my God. What if it has an antimatter core?
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:01.800]   It's hard to cut. Oh, yeah. This is the first. This is from what's inside. They do that.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:05.560]   There you go. It's the tire store. Just try to cut my credit card now.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:10.760]   So that's what you do, Laurie, if you don't want to use it anymore, you get some snippers.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.520]   I watched a video. I watched a video with that.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:21.160]   Some people shot it with a bullet and it was bulletproof. No, come on. No, I'm serious. You can
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:27.240]   find it. I think search is Apple card bulletproof and it'll pop up and steal jacked it though.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:31.320]   It's much better than a Bible. So if you want to keep that in your heart pocket.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.920]   I have to say, I do want to see the one where they take nail polish remover to it because
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.400]   it is really pretty metal and it would be nice to see what it looks like without the white.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:44.280]   Would that avoid it? I doubt it. Do you think just just finger-flushing to remove that?
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.160]   Because I would do that right now. Put a little well.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:52.600]   What my Apple card looks like? As always, test your finish before using a product.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.680]   Just a little corner. Just a little clear coat.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:57.000]   It later, Laurie. Clear coat.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.960]   Yes. It's awful. I'll hook it up.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.880]   I'll hook it up. I can guarantee you that there are people doing that right now, maybe to their
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:04.360]   good.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.680]   That's great. Apple card socks.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.120]   That's okay. That's going to be the next big thing.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:13.000]   I think that Apple honestly thinks that every time you use the physical card,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   they've lost. The whole point is to get the entire world to think that it's a lot easier,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.080]   a lot more fun, a lot more interesting to use your watch, to use your phone,
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:27.400]   rather than to use your charge plate, as our forefathers would have said.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.280]   Yes.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:33.160]   I'll tell you, I ask more businesses now if they take Apple card than I ever have before,
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:38.200]   because I want 2% instead of 1% when I make those purchases. I'm always a little disappointed
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.640]   when they don't, or I'll say, "You should probably..." Yeah, this is the one.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.560]   Just wait until he picks it up, check it out.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:49.000]   They're going to shoot an Apple card? Poor innocent Apple card?
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.920]   They can't about this.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:51.400]   They can't about this.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.120]   That makes this...
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.560]   Look at that.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.360]   Well, what are they shooting it with? A 22?
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.960]   It's just a pistol. I don't think it's a very strong F2.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:00.360]   That's 5.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:04.840]   You know, if I got shot with a 22 and survived because my Apple card,
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:08.120]   I wouldn't complain that it wasn't a 44. I would say...
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.120]   Watch, you're so too windy-gun.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.080]   That's awesome.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.760]   That's got it bounced off, so it could... Apple card could save your life.
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.800]   That's why you don't keep it in your wallet. You keep it in your breast pocket right here,
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.680]   right over your heart.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.200]   Yes.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:25.000]   All right, I'm going to calm you down now, because it's time to talk about our sponsor, Calm.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.240]   Ah, don't you feel better just even saying it?
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:32.360]   Calm.com.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.080]   [sighs]
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.600]   I'm a Calm Premium subscriber. I have been for some time now.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:43.160]   And the reason is, it's the best place to go for directed meditations,
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:47.160]   for sleep stories, for beautiful soothing music.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:54.520]   In fact, it's so popular now with ambient musicians that Moebi and others have posted their
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:37:01.240]   albums on Calm first. Calm's amazing. Your daily meditations.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:05.160]   Today's daily meditation is really a good one for me. It's patience.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.760]   I need that. I need that one.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:15.880]   Tamara Levitt and their other narrators will walk you through a 10-minute or so
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:21.480]   meditation that will relax you, will calm you, will make you feel better, make you feel good.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:27.960]   I love calm.com. And you know, sleep deficiency is a huge problem these days.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:31.880]   And it's damaging. It's bad for your brain and your body.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.880]   People who don't sleep or sleep poorly are more prone to accidents.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:41.480]   Weight gain, depression. Don't let your sleepless nights become a lifestyle.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:45.560]   Get some help. Calm has a complete library of programs designed to help you get to sleep.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:50.680]   Your brain and body needs like soundscapes, which are just, you know, things like water,
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:58.440]   a bubbling, babbling brook or thunderstorms, but also sleep stories.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:04.040]   There's over a hundred now and they're more all the time narrated by some beautiful voices.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.120]   My favorite, they have a bunch of ASMR. We discovered this earlier today,
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:13.080]   including one by the French Whisperer. It's really, it's so nice. I can't. That's what I'm
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:19.720]   listening to tonight. But also Stephen Fry, Matthew McConaughey, Jerome Flynn from Game of Thrones,
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:24.040]   does a really nice one, a tour of New Zealand. The great thing about the sleep stories,
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.880]   you listen as long as you can. There's one in relativity. Actually, that's the French Whisperer.
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:33.000]   And as long as you listen, you're learning, but don't feel bad if you fall asleep either.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.440]   They have children's stories too, your kids, 11. Right now you're going to get 25% off a
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:47.800]   calm premium subscription just because you listen to Mac Break Weekly. Go to calmcalem.com/macbreakapples
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:53.880]   app of the year in 2017. It's beautiful. Put it on your phone, your iPad, and your computer too.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:39:02.280]   C-A-L-M.com/macbreak. 50 million people. 50 million people have downloaded Calm. I'm one of them
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:11.480]   and I use it all the time. I love it. Calm.com/macbreak. 25% off right now.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:17.400]   There's no reason to be stressed. Lisa and I have both been using that lately.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.800]   That's just really nice. Suddenly I'm not so bummed out about the stains on the apple
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:27.160]   coat. It just happens. It happened. It happened. Stains. Whatever. They were doing their best.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:32.040]   Now you're something against your heart. You're hurt rate and blood pressure up again.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:40.200]   Apple contractors allegedly listening to 1000 Siri recordings a day each. Now they've let them
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:45.320]   all go, right? They're done. They fired them. They've paused it, which means that they are now
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:52.760]   unemployed because they were contract workers. The Irish examiner, I guess many of them were in
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:40:00.440]   Ireland, say that they were doing on average two a minute. That means they're not really paying
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.960]   close attention to who you are or what you're saying. They're really trying to figure out if
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:10.040]   Siri understood the command and if Siri did the right thing. I've been misfired. Why it misfired?
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:17.080]   Of course we remember. I think that article talks about how much of the things that they're
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:22.200]   listening to are actual queries and only a small percentage of them were accidental.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:26.920]   Yeah, the Guardian was the one that first reported this and it's a few percentage points, but still
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:33.720]   it's much less shocking when you're reading it from that perspective. It doesn't seem quite as
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:39.880]   they're listening to people getting murdered or whatever. Well, Apple said 1%. So if we give Apple
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:45.480]   1%, that means that every contractor every day is hearing 10 misfires, right? If they're listening
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:51.480]   to 1000 a day. So if that's five people making love, three people fighting and two people going,
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:56.760]   hey, Shlomo. I mean, I misfire that much just by saying seriously, or just one of my days
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:01.400]   watching. So it could just be immediately. I mentioned this last week that our cat's name is Sam
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:07.080]   Samantha. I call her Sammy and every time I say Sammy, you get a dollhouse. You get a dollhouse.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:12.280]   Anyway, Apple stopped it. I think we mentioned John Gruber's really good
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:16.600]   piece in during fireball, which he said, look, Apple, if you're going to say privacy matters,
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:22.520]   you got to step up. We talked about that last week. So I think it's important that Apple
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:27.320]   do this just as Amazon and Google do it because it's going to make Siri better.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:33.160]   And Siri needs to get better. Apple might just stop. I know Google has basically said
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.680]   there's no way in hell we're stopping this will disclose it better, but this is vital to the
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:43.000]   progression of technology. But Apple, I worry that Apple will stop it and it will regress
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.600]   instead of just doing a better disclosure system. I'm hopefully doing a better disclosure.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:52.840]   My big pet peeve with Siri is when I say, hey, Siri, make a appointment for a haircut Saturday at
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:42:00.920]   two. And it goes, I found some answers on the web that will help you. I found this on the web.
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:05.000]   And that is the pet peeve is that there's like nine servers that are fine. And one
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.320]   server, I'm assuming an ed EQ's closet that has just never been updated. And I get that server
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:17.240]   three times a day. So apparently, this was spotted on Reddit. Apple now will get a little bit better
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:23.400]   at answering direct questions with direct answers rather than a list of web results. This isn't
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:28.200]   fixing its understanding of what you said. But it will it will help a little bit more. They're
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:31.960]   doing kind of what Google does with its knowledge graph. They're synthesizing information from
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:37.400]   Wikipedia and other sources to help it give you the answer you want.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:43.480]   Yeah. And I think that part of what Apple should be putting into Siri right now is to make sure
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:48.760]   that they are communicating to everybody how much work they put into it and all the technology
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:53.160]   that goes behind it. Because I think one of the most dangerous things that can happen to
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:57.960]   technology or a product that's still kind of developing is when it becomes sort of like the
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:03.320]   late night talk show a host host model joke where there's everybody. Siri does have that
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:09.400]   reputation right now as the one that will always not misinterpret you or always send you to a web
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:14.760]   result. That went for every time the theories of a head to head competition between the three major
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:21.560]   services. Siri comes in last, which means that even though it's improving all the time and how
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:26.120]   it works this year is much better than it was last year and nothing like how well it'll work next
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:31.480]   year. People will kind of like not even trusted or not even try it because they're going to be
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:35.240]   anticipating that they're not going to have a pleasant experience with it. So I think that this
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:42.440]   is an area where if Apple were to publish lots of papers about how they make Siri do what it does
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:49.240]   even like a online interview, make their engineers available for interviews about how they how much
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:55.800]   work they put into Siri and also incidentally push the button that there's a reason whether they can
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:01.720]   100% defend the state the statement or not being able to say that well there's a reason why
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:06.920]   Google's assistant is so good because they don't make security and privacy a priority whereas
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:11.000]   there are either things we could do to make things easier for ourselves but we don't want to compromise
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.760]   security because they really have to make sure that they confront the idea that this is this is a
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:21.640]   good viable voice assistant. It's not as good as the others right now, but that doesn't mean that it's
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:27.240]   no good. So I actually want to correct myself because as I've as I'm rereading this article,
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:34.360]   the headline in 9 to 5 Mac says Apple testing smarter Siri web answers. So for spotlight search
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:41.160]   queries. So when I went, this is the Reddit post, if you do this, type this into spotlight,
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:46.520]   you'll get in fact I just how tall is the Empire State Building typed it into
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:51.960]   spotlight as opposed to saying it, you'll get a web answer show my, show my phone if you would.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:59.160]   You get a web answer the total height of the Empire State Building 1454 feet tall and then
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:05.320]   this is the new thing the Siri knowledge card which gives you the answer and then even if you go to
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:11.160]   the website, it'll highlight supposedly we'll see it'll highlight the answer maybe not that gives
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:17.880]   that that they got this information from. So presumably this let me just try it. Let me let me just see.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:27.560]   Let me start Siri. How do you start Siri again? Press and hold.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.440]   Right for a second. Yeah, wait a minute. Never mind. I got to start over.
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:37.320]   It's. Yeah, I'm sorry too. How tall is the Empire State Building?
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:46.040]   The Empire State Building is 1250 tall. So it is answering in voice and it's giving me this new
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:51.800]   knowledge card which is great with that information in it. So that's, I think that's nice. So maybe
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:57.400]   it is coming to Siri. I just want to be clear this is a spotlight feature. Because it's really
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:01.880]   doing kind of the same thing it was doing before. It's just it's actually answering the question
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:08.040]   and then instead of saying here's some results I found on the internet. So it's not, you know,
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:12.040]   it's not smarter than it was before. It's just using it's what it's,
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:16.120]   and the knowledge it has to get that answer more specifically in your face.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:21.000]   So in this case I said who was the first man on the moon and Siri didn't speak it but did say
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.880]   here's what I found and put up this knowledge card instead of that awful answer. Here's a few
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:30.360]   things I found on the web. That was really the answer we're forgetting rid of. This is this is
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:35.240]   a lot better. So that's good. That's good. So maybe you know Siri is getting better but I do
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:41.160]   think that if Apple throws away this whole process of grading Siri responses with humans it does
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:46.920]   take a human to do that. Unless Apple, you know, at the next WWDC they may announce we've come up
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:50.760]   with an amazing machine learning way to improve Siri's answers without human intervention.
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:55.320]   Maybe that's what they're working on. Well they have reorganized that entire like everything is
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:47:00.680]   now under Jen Andrea. Right. You know, they've all he came from home left Craig and has gone to Eddie
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:06.600]   but yeah he came from Google AI. He believes firmly in ethical AI and he thinks Apple is a really good
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:13.160]   place to do it's not all he has to do is do it. Yeah, that's the problem. I think this thing that
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:17.880]   struck me the most about that specific story was the human element to it. We're all talking about,
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:21.480]   you know, oh no, there's a bunch of people listening to our stuff but really a bunch of people just
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:26.520]   lost their jobs. Yeah. And I know it's I know it's contract work but it does kind of make you go.
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:31.640]   Oh yeah, they probably kind of expected to have this contracting job for a really long time and
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:37.240]   it just got just pulled out from under them and then you know things happen but it's that's a bummer
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:43.560]   though. Yeah. I hope they can find a replacement job or maybe even this comes back in a different
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:48.040]   format so that you know they they keep working they keep having that job they want it or something.
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:52.920]   Sounds like kind of a grueling job. Yeah. Yeah. Just listening to people.
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:58.040]   To a minute. The contract jobs are none of the contract jobs are good. Even Apple Maps, Amazon,
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.920]   I wish Tech Silicon Valley would just stop doing that and bring people in house.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:05.880]   Yeah. I mean to say nothing of all the content moderators that have to watch
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:10.280]   horrifying videos. Yeah, that's the worst day in and day out and they're not getting without any
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:17.480]   job security without the right kind of pay and suffering injuries that kind of require PTSD
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:21.960]   treatment afterwards. So I really I really think that this there's there's going I hope that there's
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:25.960]   going to be a time twenty or thirty years from now when we look back on how tech companies,
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:31.640]   big companies including Apple used to hire people to be disposable and kind of automated
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:36.040]   machines and it was kind of okay. That's just terrible. Yeah.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:46.680]   Apple is going to let users view their health care data if it comes from all scripts. This is a
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:53.000]   new way of connecting. So and this is you know, remember that Google and Microsoft had
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:59.640]   big initiatives to collect your health records into what was Microsoft Health or Google Health.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:03.400]   Both abandoned I think for privacy concerns as much as anything else.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.840]   Apple's not foolish enough to do something like that, but they do have the Apple Health app.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:12.280]   And so I guess all scripts it does a electronic health record product.
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:20.840]   Several sunrise touch works and professional EHR and if your health care provider uses that,
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:27.400]   you will be able to import that stuff into Apple's health records. So that would be nice.
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:34.200]   You know, right now I'm a Kaiser and I can go into the Kaiser app and look at all of those records
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:39.800]   through the Kaiser app. It would be wonderful if it would be unified into something like Apple
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:44.520]   Health. Hospital systems that are using it right now sharp health care in California,
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:49.320]   blessing health in Illinois, Sarasota Memorial Health Care in Florida, and then apparently several
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:58.120]   large physician groups. So this is a tricky one, right? And Apple launched this in January of last
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:06.520]   year, a beta for personal health care records. There is a standard the fast health care interoperability
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:15.160]   resources or F H R standard. Yeah. So that's it's complicated. Legal compliance is as difficult
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:21.800]   as the technology, because this is health records, the one area of personal data in America where
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:27.000]   there's actual actual obligations, legal obligations on the part of people who are storing,
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:33.560]   retrieving and moving around that data. So if there's no way to get around HIPAA.
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:38.840]   Yeah, there's a huge value when you go if you're in, you know, you have an emergency and you're
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:43.320]   brought to the hospital for physicians to be able to access your health records to know what drugs
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:47.400]   you're allergic to, what treatments you've had in the past, what conditions you have. All of that
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:52.120]   is hugely valuable. So there's this mixed, there's this mixed priorities, one to keep it
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:55.960]   absolutely private. And but one of the things Apple Health does is fully encrypted,
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:51:02.440]   on device encrypted. But it's really valuable to be able for you to access it, but also for other
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:06.680]   healthcare providers to have access to that. Right. I mean, the optimal thing is for
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:14.680]   that data to be securely stored on your phone. And if I'm hit by a car on my bike and first
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:19.960]   responders pick up my phone, tap it to a device and immediately get my whole health history,
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:25.320]   that's absolutely to my benefit and to the first responders benefit. The only the only
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:29.720]   hitches that we just have to make little modifications to stuff like HIPAA to say that the fact that
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:37.160]   I've put this data on my device in a format that can be accessed by health professionals
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:42.280]   implies that I'm giving consent for that data to be accessed by that person on scene. So it's
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:45.720]   just little things like that that have to be worked out. It's caught it is. I had a really,
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:50.520]   I had a really fascinating talk with some of Apple's privacy people and they were talking about how
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:56.440]   initially their view on privacy was absolute, your data was your data and nothing could come
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:00.120]   between that. And then when they were dealing with health, they realized you couldn't be that black
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:04.600]   and white because there were all sorts of cases where maybe you were not able to use some of the
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:09.880]   health data that you would benefit from or by combining things together, you get much more value
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:13.880]   out of it. So there have been re-architecting where it's still I think double opt in to get
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:17.640]   into some of it. Like you have to say, I really want to use this, no, I really want to use this.
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:22.120]   And then you can start connecting with caregivers and medical institutions and all these things
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:25.480]   to really give you that wealth. And I thought that was a good moment for Apple because if you
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:29.400]   take anything too far, it becomes as bad as what you were trying to defend against.
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.440]   Yeah, this is being able to be a little bit flexible with it is so much better.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:35.640]   These two stories align because you have this issue, which is you can,
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:40.920]   this stuff could be very valuable, but you also want to protect privacy. And I have to think if
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:45.960]   anybody's going to be able to navigate that, it's going to be Apple. Ben Thompson had a great
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:53.720]   piece this morning in his trajectory column on privacy fundamentalism. And he's talking about the
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:53:02.360]   issue of if you get too dogmatic about privacy, you do lose some benefits. And so what we have to
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:08.520]   really do, I think is be balanced and say, okay, we certainly are owed and want privacy, but
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:14.280]   there are definite values to sharing data. And
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:16.920]   Who needs to be informed? Yeah. That's part of the problem.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:25.160]   Yeah. He's talked a little bit about WebKit because last week WebKit announced that they were going
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:32.840]   to really up their tracking prevention on Apple's Safari and browser. And Mozilla.
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:38.680]   At Mozilla Firefox does this as well. And Ben points out that this, you know,
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:45.720]   is a little tricky because he uses things like Google Analytics without sending data back to
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:51.080]   Google. He's able to do that to find it. He sells subscriptions, right? And he has a number of
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:57.880]   plugins on his site that are not for invading privacy, but enable him to make a living doing his,
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:02.520]   you know, site, he doesn't put ads on his site. So it's not a question of ad tracking. And he says,
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:08.680]   WebKit, these changes to WebKit will hurt him. You know, so in case you were wondering,
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:12.520]   yes, this will affect sites like Stratecary and the WebKit team knows it.
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:20.440]   He says this will hurt things like WebKit says this will hurt federated login using a third-party
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:27.000]   login provider. That's something Stratecary does. Fraud prevention, bot detection, improving the
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.320]   security of client authentication. All these things are good, but it is a tradeoff. Apple says when
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:37.160]   faced with this tradeoff will typically prioritize user benefits over preserving current website
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:43.240]   practices. We believe that is the role of a web browser, also known as the user agent.
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:48.520]   He said, Ben says it's disappointing that the maker of one of the world's most important and
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:53.560]   most unavoidable browser technologies, WebKit's the only option on iOS,
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:58.120]   has decided that an absolutist approach that will ultimately improve the competitive position of
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:03.400]   massive first-party advertisers like Google and Facebook, his point being, if you, you know,
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:07.720]   ads on Facebook are first-party, not third-party ads because Facebook is providing them,
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:13.960]   but he's too small to have an ad technology built into his system. So it'll actually,
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:19.960]   first-party providers like Google and Facebook will benefit from this even as it harms smaller
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:25.080]   sites that rely on third-party providers, not just for ads. Yeah, okay, maybe for ads, but not in
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:31.480]   his case, all aspects of their business. So I think this is a good point. He titled this piece
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:36.200]   privacy fundamentalism. And I think that's what we're talking about here is balancing. And we
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:40.280]   talk about this a lot on Twig too, because Jeff Jarvis will always say, well, yeah, but
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:47.400]   think about all the benefits we get from aggregating some of this data. And so the trick is to balance
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:55.240]   it. I think anybody can do it. It's Apple. This is right up there, Ali. And a lot of it is
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:56:01.080]   consent-based. Like for me, it's the consent thing is where this is. Like if you want to do this,
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:06.440]   and I don't want to get into the Steve Jobs thing, because I think he asks quite many times. But
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:10.760]   just do you want to allow tracking on this website? Yes. And then let me be a big boy in big-point
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:14.440]   pants and do it. But don't let them just start tracking me without me knowing about it. Because
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:19.400]   I trust Ben, but I don't know the other thousand people who are using this technology. But if I
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:23.320]   go to their website and Ben says, I use tracking for blah, blah, blah, like the same way they have
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:26.760]   a cookie disclosure policy now, which I know is annoying. They do it too often, but there's a
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:30.840]   balance there too. Just say, we use analytics to better serve our sub-able blah. And for
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:35.240]   Ben, I will hit that every single time. But I would rather have to hit that once than just have to
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.280]   assume that everybody out there is using this stuff for my benefit when they aren't.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:43.160]   So long as it's a transaction and the people understand what the nature of the transaction is,
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:47.080]   consent is all you need to do. I think I think some people would point out, though, yeah,
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:51.160]   except that most people aren't going to take the time to understand the pros and cons of the
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:54.920]   transaction are just going to say, no, no, no, no, no. We can't tantalize them though.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:57:00.040]   No, they should be a choice. But the WebKit is doing that. That's what Apple infanellizes its
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:04.120]   users in that sense by saying, well, we know what the best defaults are and we're going to choose.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:07.080]   Well, who's one wants to use us? Apple wants to protect us and none of them are talking to us.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:12.520]   They're all talking to us. But I think Apple's realistic because most users don't want to be
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:17.800]   bothered. They just do the right thing for me. And so that's what Apple's doing.
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:24.600]   Yeah. People like us often forget that for most people, a phone, a computer,
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:29.000]   Internet service, it's just a box with a button that they push to get the thing that they want out of
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:34.280]   it. And it really isn't, they don't feel any sort of an obligation to understand how it works or
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:40.360]   why it works. And we really need to understand, excuse me, as people who are interested in the
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:45.240]   sort of stuff and also try to communicate how these things work, it's important for us to not
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:50.760]   raise the alarm when it turns out that, oh my God, your voice assistant is people, actual human
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:55.560]   beings are listening, might be listening into your conversations and make sure that that's not
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:58:00.280]   the headline story. But to also make it sure, make sure that people understand when there's
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:09.160]   an important thing, such as that when you tick the box saying that you agree to, you agree to
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:14.840]   release of certain private data for customization and personalization, that maybe they're going to
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:18.920]   make it very, very difficult for you to rescind that later on or to be aware of when that is
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:24.120]   on and when it is off. So it's hard. It's just like we're talking earlier on about
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:29.640]   people who are trying to talk people out of buying a phone a week before an Apple event.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:34.840]   To us, it is like, Oh my God, go into the basement. That's where the killer is. Don't go into the
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:40.360]   basement. But these other people, it's like, well, my phone is crap. I mean, it's fine. My
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:44.680]   fingers bleed every time I try to swipe anything so I don't swipe anything. And I'd much rather
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:50.760]   have a phone for the next two weeks than have a better better phone. Anyway, here's this is
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:56.760]   Firefox I use and obviously you can't use this on a iOS device. You could use it on the Mac.
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:59:02.760]   And by default, when you first install it, you get this kind of ballot, they call it standard
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:07.400]   content blocking balanced for protection and performance allows some trackers to function.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:14.600]   So websites work, block known trackers only in private windows block third party tracking cookies.
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:21.080]   That's the default, but I often, and I suppose if you and this is why this is challenging,
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:25.960]   I will go into custom and I will check block fingerprinters because that's those things
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:32.120]   from the like buttons and the tweet buttons. And every time, of course, you go to a site with a
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:37.320]   like button, Facebook gets a signal that you're there. They can concatenate that information.
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:43.640]   So I always block that. Do you want to block trackers only in private windows or in all windows?
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:50.040]   This gives the user the choice, but goodness gracious. How many users know what they're getting here
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:57.000]   and configure it out? And you know, I don't know if you if you pay attention to do not track,
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.760]   but when you turn on do not track in Firefox and other browsers, it'll pop up a big thing and
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:07.320]   says, well, you could turn it on, but nobody's going to pay any attention. And this just goes on
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.600]   and on and on. And can we just do a little shout out to show that no matter what happens with
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:15.480]   Apple, Google and Amazon, Facebook has always always got to one up them. Like now we're finding
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:20.920]   out they're using humans to read our messages, not just our devices. And they're launching a new app
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:24.600]   where they want us to persistently share our location and message is just like whatever,
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:28.120]   whatever controversy we have, they're like, no, no, no, we can't be out of the spot like that long.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:33.960]   And I have to say I that's the reason I don't put any Facebook apps, Instagram, what's app or
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:41.160]   Facebook on anything I use. I don't have a Facebook account. And I block Facebook trackers, Facebook,
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:46.840]   you know, like buttons and all that stuff. And I bet even though I don't even have a Facebook
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:53.960]   account, they have a shadow dossier on me, they know they know a lot about what I do anyway,
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:59.720]   even though I'm doing all of these things. But I think it's prudent. I don't mind. I don't miss
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:07.240]   anything. My friend, my trainer actually is also the coach of a crew club with high schoolers.
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:11.800]   And they're trying to figure out what they should do so that they can have a kind of a group
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:16.680]   messaging platform. So he can say, practice is off today or, you know, whatever. And he said,
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.800]   well, what somebody said, what about Facebook? And he said, all right, well, how many of you have
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:28.600]   Facebook? This is a group of 40 high schoolers zero. Wow, zero. And this is what what keeps Mark
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:32.680]   Zuckerberg up at night. That's why Mark should buy calm.com. Now this is what keeps Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:40.200]   Is that young people are not interested now. They all had Instagram. So Mark was smart enough to say,
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:44.760]   well, let's see what what are they going to use next. But, and a lot of countries, what's up?
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:50.840]   Yeah. Yeah. And TikTok. And, you know, I mean, every every kid that age has TikTok. So, and that's
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:57.960]   a Chinese company, which is not bound by any US laws. So this is an important conversation.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.400]   We have it a lot here. I've actually suggested at least that maybe we should do a show, a privacy
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:07.640]   show or something. I don't know if it's worth a show, but I feel like we should be talking about
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:11.880]   this because this is something people care about. And look at even I, when I look at this
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:17.160]   Firefox, I don't know. I don't know. Should I, should I block trackers in all windows or only,
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:22.760]   well, clearly only in, well, but, but, right. And then I have a block list. Oh, good luck
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:30.440]   maintaining the block list. Should I use level one or level two? I do. You know, I mean,
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.120]   I guess what you do is turn it all the way up and see what happens.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:41.160]   Yeah. See that, that is a problem that Firefox is, has an important role in the internet as being
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:45.800]   the one that is, we're totally open source, but we're not nerds about it. We try to be a very,
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:51.320]   very consumer focused service and also be working for your interests and not other people's interests.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:55.880]   But even they fall into the trap of here's all the little, little, little, tiddly,
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:01.240]   little settings to, to manipulate things with when really the front page should be just a
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:06.120]   fourth position slider bar saying that if you slide this all the way to the right,
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:11.160]   you will have absolute utmost privacy, but a lot of your experience will be disrupted. If you
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:15.880]   slide this all the way to the left, and you will be able to have a complete freedom to do anything
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:19.560]   you want on the internet, but you'll be giving up as much stuff as possible. And then there are
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:25.160]   two or three settings in the middle that we suggest you start here. And if you have problems,
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:29.640]   then slide it a little bit more to the left until your experience is no longer ruined.
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:33.240]   That then I'm amazed that there are companies that should be awaited.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:38.360]   Do that. Yeah, exactly. That is exactly the sort of people that you want to get in,
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:42.520]   not the people who understand how proxies work and people who understand how VPNs work,
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:47.320]   but the people who just understand that they don't want exactly, they don't want their location to
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:53.640]   be captured by, they don't want to do a Google search for a car that you saw a TV show about
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.240]   in a movie, but just because you thought it was a cool car and you wanted to know, you know,
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:02.360]   when it was made, and then suddenly start seeing a million ads everywhere for buying new cars and
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:09.480]   car financing. Yeah, I mean, I, I take some pride in the fact that we don't allow trackers,
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:15.480]   our advertisers, the ones who buy billboards are often saying, I'm sure you can kind of this as
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:19.160]   well, Renee. Oh, please, we want to put some trackers in there and stuff like that. And we,
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:25.560]   we really limit what they can do. And podcasting by its very nature, at least so far,
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:31.400]   doesn't, doesn't track you. We, that's why we do our regular surveys to kind of, and that's all
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:35.800]   opt in to find out more about you, because advertisers do want to know this. But I think there is
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:41.720]   increasing pressure even on podcasters. Adtech is coming to podcasting. Oh, can you imagine a
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:45.880]   tracking tone and every headphone has it built into listen to the tracking tone in the book?
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:52.200]   Yes, they're going to do something because advertisers want it. And they've been spoiled by banner ads
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:57.160]   and, and, and digital advertising and ad tech and digital. And that they, they say, well,
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:02.120]   why can't we do that with podcasts? And so I, you know, I do have a little dog in this
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:06.760]   hunt because, because I don't want to have to ever do this. We have a good model, which is we,
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:11.400]   we do shows for a specific kind of person. If you want to hit that kind of person
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:15.560]   by an ad on the show, that's the original magazine model. I'm wondering you how many people who read
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:21.560]   a magazine or how far into it they read or what happened to magazines. Yeah. What happened to
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:26.040]   what happened to the advertising business? Yeah. It's not like they're thriving. Well, yeah, well,
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:31.000]   but that's the thing I think digital advertising is there's billions of dollars in it. I don't know.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.440]   It's a really Google and face for me. This is something I've been dealing with. We just came back
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:38.760]   from the podcast convention. And this is a big, was a big topic of conversation for us, because I
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:43.160]   really don't, don't want you to have to use a particular app. That's why Spotify spent $230
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:48.920]   million on Gimlet is because what they'd like to do is make you use the Spotify app for all your
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:53.400]   podcast needs, because then they know exactly how much you listen to when you listen to all
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:59.320]   the stuff, who you are. And I'm so far, we've managed to avoid that. I don't care what podcasting
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:04.840]   app you use, please use the one of your choice. You know, even Apple offers those analytics, right?
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:10.280]   But and so I guess some podcasts are tempted to say, please only listen to us with Apple.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:16.680]   But I don't know what to say about that. Let me just see. I use UBlock Origin, which
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:26.280]   is another kind of high-end geek tool to not merely block ads, but block trackers, block scripts
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:31.320]   are a big problem too. It's pretty easy though, but I recommend I recommend it to people because
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:34.200]   I know that they can install it and use all the defaults and it'll just play with it.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:40.120]   The defaults work. That's right. Yeah. Although I'm looking at Stratecary, who they have no ads,
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:48.600]   and UBlock Origin is blocking 13 requests. So, you know, that's an example. I don't want to block
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:52.760]   anything from Ben. Ben deserves, I actually pay for his absorption to Stratecary because
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:58.120]   Ben deserves the money, it's great insight. And he doesn't have ads on there. He's got a model
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:03.160]   that is exactly a consensual model. You can read a bunch of stuff for free, and if you want to buy
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:09.160]   a subscription, you can. And that's a perfect model. And yet, a lot of his stuff is being blocked.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.560]   So I'm going to press the Unblock button right now. It's to Tech Repen.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:16.040]   And you'll know what basketball team you support.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:21.560]   That's fine with me. Let's take a break. We're going to come back with more, actually,
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:27.640]   some big news in the jailbreak arena. A mistake Apple made and has now fixed, but first a word,
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:33.560]   from Rocket Mortgage by Quick and Loans. We love Rocket Mortgage. Longtime sponsor here,

[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:38.040]   Apple made a little po-po! Oopsie. Oopsies. iOS 12.4 enabled a jailbreak.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:46.760]   Right? Wasn't that nice of them? Yeah. Well, it actually re-enabled a former jailbreak,
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:52.040]   or it disabled the fix of the jailbreak, if you want to put it that way. That's the oopsy.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:10:01.400]   They broke the fix. But now they fix the broken fix in 12.4.1. The thing about jailbreaks that's
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:07.160]   important to understand is that a jailbreak takes advantage of a security flaw. In every case,
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:14.600]   from day one, it was something that's not right. It's a bug that is almost always a security flaw,
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:19.080]   because if you can jailbreak your phone, so can a bad guy, and they can use it to get onto your
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:25.320]   phone, any time you've got a jailbreak, Apple's going to fix it. I don't think it's because they
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:30.440]   don't want you to jailbreak. Obviously, they don't. But it's just as important because it's a security
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:36.200]   flaw, right, right? Yeah. Yeah. So the same tools that a benevolent actor or just a hobbyist would
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:41.240]   use to jailbreak a malicious actor, a bad actor who will use to break into your phone and install
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:46.840]   monitoring, wear spy, or wear, any sorts of other stuff. Right. Do we still jailbreak?
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:52.840]   I have a jailbreak. I have to confess. I jail broke the first iPhone. I think it was the first
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:59.880]   one. Maybe the 3G iPhone, because Amber MacArthur was in Canada. And as you know, Renee, you couldn't
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:05.400]   get an iPhone in Canada in the early years. So I wanted to get her one. So I jail broke it
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:08.280]   and brought it to her. She was smart enough never to use this. I was the same. Yeah.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:13.720]   Yeah. That was using with Rogers, right? She put her Rogers, Simmin, and would be able to do that.
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:19.320]   Yeah. I did the same thing. And to get really incredible cutting edge features like, you know,
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:25.160]   cut and paste. Tenderification centers. Is there a reason to do it these days? Because really,
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:30.120]   all it does today is let you use a third party store. And that seems like just a really bad idea.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:33.560]   Well, people do it for customization still. Like if they want to change the kind of icons
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:38.440]   away, the icons, the density of the icons. Like it's mostly for tweezers who want more customization
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:44.920]   control over their phone or for security researchers who don't yet have apples or search fused phones,
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:48.680]   who want to be able to get into the phone to start poking around to sort of do more research.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:55.240]   It's not a bad reason to do it. It's still risky. I stopped with iOS 8, I think, just because I
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:00.120]   finally had everything that I was using jailbreak for like the notification center, the control center.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:03.320]   That was all the big stuff for me. I just wanted to things that were easier to do and how it could
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:07.880]   do all that stuff anyway. So I remember we would jailbreak it or Alex Lindsey would jailbreak it
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:12.760]   because it was the only way to get a video out of the phone so that he could shoot the phone
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:16.840]   direct instead of taking pictures. Or screen recording. I mean, they've just... But they've put all the
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:24.600]   features in now. So yeah. I love the jailbreak culture, which actually isn't very robust anymore.
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:29.800]   But I've always been too scared to jailbreak my phone. I always love reading articles about,
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:34.280]   you know, things that you can do with your phone when you've jailbroken it and the creative things
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:38.440]   that people would come up with once they've jailbroken a phone and that if I wanted to,
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:43.640]   I could go download this cool thing, this cool hack, if you will, that you could use on your phone.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:50.520]   So it's always been a fascinating culture to me even though I've been... I don't know. I've
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:55.000]   jailbroken an Android device, but I've never done it with an iPhone. For some reason, I'm just too
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:01.720]   scared to do it on an iPhone. Yeah. Unfortunately, the reason... The larger reason for most people to
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:06.760]   jailbreak an iPhone or to be able to side load apps is because all of the pirated apps, all the
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:14.280]   broken apps that are available online require that. And once you start to say, "I'm going to trust an
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:20.280]   app that was provided to me by someone who stole it from a developer," that's never a good idea.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:28.200]   Yeah. I also found it made... It maybe was my just kind of a sense of it, but it felt like it
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:32.520]   made the phone much less reliable. Absolutely. Well, you're exploiting more resources. So
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:36.040]   Apple is very conservative because they believe in things like, you know,
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:39.400]   they have disabilities paramount, but other people want to push it more. They want to overclock it.
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:42.040]   They want to assign more memory. They want more control over the memory manager.
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:49.640]   So I'm going to do the update right now, which is 12.4.1. Is there anything else that 12.4.1
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:53.720]   does? Or was it just a quick release to... This is a security update. The much more interesting
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:59.320]   thing that happened today, I don't know if it's on your list or not, but iOS beta 13.1 came out.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:08.840]   Well, I got iOS 13 public beta 7. Is that the same? Yeah. No. No. Most years, iOS...
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:14.200]   Like you get the iOS, whatever. Like this year would be iOS 13, and that beta would go until
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:19.960]   launch. And then sometime after that, they would start the iOS 13.1 beta. But this year,
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:26.280]   before the iOS 13 beta track has even finished, the iOS 13.1 beta track has started.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:30.680]   So who's getting that developers? Yeah. So that's the sort of bummer thing here is that
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:35.240]   developers who want to target specifically iOS 13, because they want to make sure their apps are
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:39.400]   rock solid on 13, because that's presumably what's still going to ship. As far as I understand,
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:44.920]   that's still what is shipping with the new iPhones. They're going to have to specifically try to
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:50.520]   stop it from updating to 13.1. And then when they're super happy with their apps, then go to 13.1.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:54.680]   So I wish Apple had different profiles for the different beta tracks that would make life easier.
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:59.480]   But it's... I think it's unprecedented. I don't think they've ever done this before.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:03.960]   That's what Microsoft did when they started beta testing to the Windows Insiders,
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:12.600]   both the fall update and next year's update. It got a little confusing. What am I getting here?
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:16.520]   So if you're a developer, this would be a good time to move to the public beta,
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:20.760]   because that's not happening on the public beta, right? But you know, when...
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:26.120]   Well, you want to test 13, right? That's the key.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:29.160]   So if you just stay on the previous beta, right?
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.360]   Just don't let 13.1 come.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:33.640]   Okay. Turn off on the head of the top.
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.560]   Turn off that auto update thing.
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.240]   What happens if you delete that profile?
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:39.640]   Does it... It stops as well.
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.960]   Yeah, so that would be the way to stop. Just freeze it in place.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:46.600]   At some point, 13 will come out probably in the next two weeks, two and a half weeks.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:52.040]   But the question I have then, does that mean that there's no update?
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:56.440]   There's no more developer update to iOS 13.0.
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:57.800]   Is it done?
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.160]   Should we be a GM still?
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:15:59.720]   Because if it's...
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.160]   There should be a GM still at the event.
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:09.480]   But if the same profile is updating to iOS 13.1, how is there going to be a GM launch?
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:10.520]   Excellent.
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:13.400]   That's that window that I'm confused about right now is,
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:19.880]   how can they have a GM if the beta, the same profile beta, has moved on to 13.1?
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.880]   I don't know. We'll see, I guess.
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:24.440]   They had a website where all of this was explained.
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:29.240]   Is this new in iOS 13? I was closing tabs on Safari.
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.000]   I said automatically closed tabs.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.680]   Safari can automatically close tabs that have not been viewed recently after one day,
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.280]   one week, one month. Don't close.
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:36.840]   Is that new?
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:43.000]   I think they at least announced it way back at WWDC.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.080]   I like that because especially with iOS, I don't get it...
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.600]   Nope, you're looking at the wrong thing.
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:50.280]   I don't get it. There you go.
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:55.160]   I don't get it in my desktop. I close tabs all the time.
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:57.240]   I don't like having running tabs.
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:59.880]   But on iOS, you don't really even see them sometimes.
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:02.200]   Actually, though you do on 13 because it's a desktop.
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:06.280]   Yeah, this made some nervous because they have their carefully curated 73 articles.
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:07.320]   They're eventually going to go through.
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:08.840]   This is a bad idea.
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.600]   Don't do it.
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:13.560]   I'm going to say one month, which is the conservative setting.
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.360]   But then see, I like to close tabs.
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.480]   It just feels good to me.
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:20.600]   You have to triage them.
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:23.320]   And it makes you think about every single thing that's worth keeping.
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:24.760]   If you want for one tab.
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:28.760]   Well, I use one tab because I don't necessarily...
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:31.480]   It's hard for me to bookmark things and then find them later.
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.240]   I don't need that level of organization.
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:37.080]   I just need to know that here are a group of tabs because...
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.200]   Here's something I was researching.
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:39.720]   Here's something I was trying to understand.
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:45.880]   And at least if I do a search of that page for a certain amount of content,
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:51.400]   I'll find it because this was the only solution to tab management and bookmarking
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.080]   that's really worked out for me in the long run.
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:56.280]   You should see my bookmarks.
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.040]   I got folders and thread folders.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.880]   I push my tabs daily.
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:06.120]   At the end of every day, I just go into Safari on my iOS device.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:08.440]   And I just close tab, close tab, close tab.
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:11.080]   I hate having all those extra things lying around.
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:15.240]   Everyone's idea of organization is different though.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.840]   Andy, I get what you're saying because that's how you organize it.
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:23.720]   I imagine that you have a desktop that's organized chaos.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:26.360]   Where if I looked at it, I wouldn't be able to find anything.
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.120]   But you know where everything is.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:32.280]   I don't have any icons on my desktop at all.
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:36.920]   Just to give you an idea that...
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:41.800]   Did you know that on the phone version of Chrome,
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:45.720]   the Chrome browser, eventually, if you have enough tabs open, it stops telling you
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:49.000]   how many tabs you have open and just gives you a smiley face.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.440]   Reverse smiley face.
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:53.800]   I know that because a few days ago, I said, "Oh, wow.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:57.480]   Maybe 93 tabs open on our mobile browser is not a good idea."
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:02.600]   No, I would imagine Safari on all platforms is smart enough not to have all those tabs
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.280]   be occupying resources.
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:07.880]   Is it like the recent apps where it's just like a placeholder or...
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:13.240]   Because I feel like Chrome and maybe Firefox use a lot of resources for those tabs.
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:17.640]   Or that each one is currently an instance of the entire app,
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.080]   where I think Apple is also doing...
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:24.840]   They're also separating each tab out, but they're not running an entire version of smart.
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:26.520]   They sandbox them, but yeah.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:29.320]   Browsers are pigs.
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:33.240]   But they're so necessary.
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:38.040]   A few things annoy me as much as when to free up memory
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:38.760]   it closed out.
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:42.760]   Or rather it purged the contents of a tab.
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:47.720]   And now I just need to find my ticket information.
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:51.880]   And that's okay because I bought the ticket the last thing I did before I closed the lid of my machine.
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:55.800]   Like open it up again and they need an internet connection now to get that back.
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:01.160]   And I really would love to see a browser that is more of...
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:06.680]   It's 80% of browser and 20% a content capture and archiving device.
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:09.960]   Because that's so much of what I wanted to want it to be.
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.720]   Yeah, like you can just...
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:16.680]   It would just sort of capture that moment even after you go offline and it's just still there.
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:21.320]   And you can actually scroll on and off it, even though there's no internet.
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.040]   I like that idea.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:27.640]   Just kind of giving you that information even though you're not actually actively using that page anymore.
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:31.320]   Time to talk about Apple TV plus.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:38.440]   I'm so excited Apple is going to do a show about Angie Dickinson who was always the hottest woman
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:40.920]   on television. I'm really excited to see.
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:43.720]   It doesn't look like Angie Dickinson.
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:44.760]   Wrong Dickinson.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:45.960]   That's not the least woman.
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:46.680]   Wait a minute.
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:47.800]   Why is...
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:52.760]   So the new show Dickinson, which is yes about poet Emily Dickinson, is a comedy.
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:53.080]   Oh, it's not...
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:55.560]   How is McInson?
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:58.840]   Dickinson, the sign words are completely different.
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:02.040]   Wait a minute. Let's watch the trailer just real quickly.
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.120]   Can we...
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.160]   Oh, now there's wonder...
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.600]   Would everybody say if we watch the trailer, Apple will take you down.
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:09.320]   You're going to get a shuttle to the whole take you down.
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:10.760]   I watch the trailer.
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:12.280]   It's about Emily Dickinson.
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:13.080]   Does Apple...
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:13.400]   Wait a minute.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:14.040]   Does Apple...
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:17.240]   Honestly, if I play this trailer, Apple will take this show...
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:18.840]   Block it on YouTube.
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:19.720]   I think they will.
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:20.280]   They might.
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:20.840]   I don't know.
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:22.680]   Well, that's incredible.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.040]   What if I turn this sound off?
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.400]   Well, the trailer's the only YouTube...
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:29.480]   Half of my YouTube recommended list is people re-uploading trailers.
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:29.960]   How do you know?
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:34.360]   Let's leave the sound off and leave it like not full screen and see what happens.
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.360]   Oh, an experiment.
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:37.480]   The reason we don't...
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:42.360]   We're worried about this is because if they take us down, it takes like what?
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:45.960]   10 weeks to get it back up and significant loss of revenue.
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:48.840]   It costs us thousands of dollars for me to play this trailer.
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:50.200]   Screw you Apple.
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:50.920]   I'm not going to play it.
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:51.800]   I'm sure you want to do it.
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:53.560]   Here's the show about Angie Dickinson.
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:54.600]   Nobody wants to watch.
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:56.440]   Thank you very much.
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:56.840]   We'll show some those...
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:57.400]   Plus trailers.
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:57.880]   Take that.
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:03.480]   So it's labeled like a comedy, but it's a comedy.
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:07.800]   Yeah, but I watched the trailer and obviously trailers are going to be edited to be a certain way.
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:15.080]   So you can make a horror film look like a comedy and you can make a drama look like a horror film.
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:19.480]   But the way I read into it is that it's a light-hearted drama.
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:21.080]   It's what it seems more like.
[01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:26.440]   The character Emily Dickinson character, she's young and she's rebellious.
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:26.440]   Oh yeah.
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:33.160]   And so the story, it's about her sort of bucking the system and how the people around her are
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:39.480]   like struggling to accept her or she's sort of struggling to accept her role in society at this
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:39.640]   time.
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:43.960]   So it does not look like just a flat out sitcom.
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:50.760]   It looks like a sort of a more light-hearted telling of her early, early adult years or her
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:57.480]   late teen years of just kind of being crazy in an environment where she absolutely shouldn't
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:57.960]   be crazy.
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:00.280]   It's a comedy in the Shakespearean sense.
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.400]   Shakespearean comedy, people survived at the end.
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.400]   A tragedy, they all died at the end.
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:06.760]   Literally, that's the definition.
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:11.080]   So it's light-hearted, it's not heavy.
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.200]   But is it...
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.400]   Were there jokes?
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:14.120]   Did you laugh?
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:18.040]   No, it looks more like a typical drama.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:22.120]   You know, a very like, expensively made drama.
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.200]   It looks really high production value.
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:25.640]   So now the trailers...
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:26.120]   And then there'll be...
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:26.440]   Go ahead.
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:32.200]   There would be a scene here and there where she might make a funny face or she might say
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:37.000]   something or do something at a party that's like funny but oh, I can't believe she did that.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.360]   It's more like that kind of...
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:39.240]   Oh, that Emily.
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.440]   She's such a card, such a cut up.
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:46.920]   Did you see she bid eight no trumps while playing Wist?
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:49.720]   Oh, that kind of joke.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:50.040]   Okay.
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:52.600]   Now that we're seeing trailers...
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:53.320]   If it's not the match trailer, what?
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.800]   Now that we're seeing trailers for Apple TV Plus, are we excited?
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.800]   Eh.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.560]   Not excited.
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:00.040]   I am like...
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:03.640]   Not excited enough to pay that much a month just for a couple of shows.
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:05.480]   So that's my thing is that I would...
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:10.200]   I don't know the pricing because again, we've now seen more information on Disney Plus.
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:13.800]   Netflix is already perturbing me because their prices keep going up and they
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:17.800]   make you pay this for this many views and that or this mode and it's...
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.960]   And I understand they have no other sources of income.
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:24.920]   It's much easier for a company like Apple or Google or Disney or anybody else to make content.
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:29.560]   We know it's easier for Apple music than Spotify because Spotify has to be profitable on the music.
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:33.160]   But Netflix, it just seems like it's becoming less and less friendly to me.
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:38.360]   It's not integrating with anybody and Disney Plus, it's going to be in a lot of countries.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:42.040]   It's going to integrate into all the Amazon for some reason, not right away.
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.840]   But Apple stuff, all the other stuff, it's going to work just great.
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:45.880]   It's going to be in the TV app.
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:50.040]   It looks like you're not going to have to pay extra for 4K or for Dolby Atmos.
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:52.360]   They're going to bundle it.
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:53.960]   They're going to have a low price for it.
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:56.360]   If you pay for three years, you get even a lower price for it.
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:59.720]   It feels like they're doing everything right and they're going to have
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:07.400]   not just amazing Marvel and Star Wars and all these other muppets, all this great content.
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.880]   That's basically 80% of my childhood at this point,
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:15.880]   but they're also going to have the catalog content from Disney, from ABC, from Fox,
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:20.520]   which means once I've watched the new Vision Wanda show or the Mandalorian,
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:22.600]   I can go watch Simpsons and I'll be fine.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:27.560]   And Apple's going to have a few shows and the pricing model is going to be,
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:32.120]   if they gave it to me because I subscribed to iCloud or Apple Music, it'd be great.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:34.120]   I would just love to see the Jennifer Aniston show.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:36.600]   I'd love to see the space show, the JJ Abrams show.
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:37.720]   That'd be a great value.
[01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:39.320]   Jason Momoa, bring him on.
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:43.480]   I just don't know how you price that against companies that have catalog content.
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:47.800]   Yeah, particularly when it didn't Apple say that they're going to be releasing stuff on a
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:49.800]   weekly, but they're not going to be doing the entire series.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:50.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:50.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:51.320]   Oh.
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:51.720]   Yeah.
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:52.520]   Which we...
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:53.000]   Oh, Disney too.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.560]   Yeah, I mean, because that would at least have given Apple the ability to...
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:03.800]   I would have least maybe decided that, well, I've heard good things about the morning show.
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:05.000]   A lot of my friends like it.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.200]   I'll sign up for one month just so I could watch the entire series.
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.480]   And then I'll intend to cancel.
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:13.560]   And then maybe while I forget to cancel it, and then after a couple of months, I like it too much.
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.240]   That's why they're not doing it though, right?
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:17.320]   They don't want you to cancel, yeah.
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:18.360]   That's a problem with Netflix.
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:19.640]   People sign up, they binge.
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:23.240]   So what I've heard is that some people are planning to watch Netflix for a month,
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:26.680]   catch up on everything and then cancel it, and sign up to Disney for a month,
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:29.000]   watch all this stuff from that year, cancel it, move on to...
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:29.960]   It's a real deal.
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:35.560]   Yeah, that's what a lot of people do because it's easier to just pay $10 and...
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:41.640]   $10 30-day rental fee, so to speak, for all the seasons of Game of Thrones
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:45.720]   than to either buy them online or even just to pirate them online
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.040]   and risk getting in trouble with your ISP or with your mom.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:50.200]   Yeah, I bought all eight seasons of Game of Thrones.
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:51.800]   It was hundreds of... it was expensive.
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:52.680]   It was hundreds of dollars.
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:53.720]   In your return season eight?
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:57.400]   No, I have them all.
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:58.760]   I probably shouldn't have bought it.
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.520]   I don't know if I'll ever sit down and watch them all.
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:01.320]   But there's just...
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:01.960]   I like to...
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:04.520]   You know what Apple's doing, and I have to say this is good,
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:06.760]   is the extras that you get when you buy these things.
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:09.400]   I bought Breaking Bad.
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:10.600]   Apple had a new package.
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:11.240]   Was it Apple?
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:11.720]   I think it was.
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:15.720]   Had a new package of Breaking Bad with all of the additional material,
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:17.400]   the behind-the-scenes interviews,
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:22.040]   they have the uncensored version because it was on AMC,
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:23.320]   so they had a sensor out stuff.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.240]   They have uncensored versions of shows.
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.800]   That's smart because that's who buys that, is the collectors.
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:31.000]   People want all the little bits and pieces of that.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.160]   So what we don't know...
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:34.200]   So it's Apple TV.
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:35.000]   Go ahead.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.360]   With Apple TV Plus, I think.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:40.200]   Just from watching the trailers of these shows,
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:45.960]   they're really in a bad position because none of this is content that exists already.
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:48.040]   So it's brand new.
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:52.520]   How do I know I'm going to be on board with this TV show about space?
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:55.320]   Whereas Renee was talking about Disney Plus.
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:59.400]   These are all franchises that we are familiar with and we grew up with.
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:01.800]   And Apple's not giving us anything that we grew up with.
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:04.200]   So it's a lot harder for us to say,
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:07.800]   "I can't wait for the new XYZ show to come out
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:11.000]   because it's based on something that I loved as a child."
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:16.280]   And I think the shows, all of them, the trailers look absolutely amazing.
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:18.520]   The production value looks incredible.
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:21.000]   But it's all new content.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.040]   It's new stories.
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.280]   It's franchises that don't exist yet.
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:29.000]   And that's going to be really difficult to convince people to get on board with.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.360]   Even if there were no other streaming services around,
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:37.080]   there's just nothing familiar to pull me in other than some actors
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:39.320]   that we recognize and some directors that we recognize.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:44.120]   So they're just in an awkward position of trying to convince us that it's worth our money.
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:49.640]   Yeah, particularly when you hear about how good the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is.
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:55.480]   Well, the thing is you probably have already our member of Amazon Prime
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:57.960]   and you didn't get it for the movie stuff or the TV stuff.
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:01.080]   But then you find out that, "Oh, well, actually, I can watch this for free."
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:03.640]   So yes, I'll invest the time and watch it for free.
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:05.080]   But yeah, I'm with you.
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:08.760]   You can even have a fantastic, the Morning Show could be fantastic.
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:09.560]   It could be wonderful.
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:11.400]   It could be one of the most brilliant things ever.
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:14.360]   But if you're not particularly interested in that genre,
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.440]   you're just not going to be interested in it.
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:22.520]   So Apple, again, Apple has a cushion of several hundred billion dollars in cash
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:24.200]   to see them through this.
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:29.080]   But I'm sure they have a plan that goes on for many, many, many years.
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:31.720]   But I wonder at what year they've got earmarked for.
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:35.000]   Okay, at this point, we really have to start making serious money off of this.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.080]   We really have to have a serious share of the streaming market
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:43.080]   in order for us to continue with this because they are really at a disadvantage.
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:52.280]   So according to a German 5 shows at launch, which isn't enough to pay $10 a month for
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:56.040]   unless, and I'm sure this is Apple's strategy, one of them is a breakout hit.
[01:29:56.040 --> 01:30:01.480]   Like if you get a sopranos, something that people just say, "Oh, I have to have it."
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:04.840]   Or if there's a bundle, like if you, if you love it, there might be someone who says,
[01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:09.000]   "I absolutely hate Apple music. I hate all this stuff, but I'm the world's biggest Jennifer Aniston
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:15.000]   fan or JJ Abrams fan or Moon aficionado." And no matter what price is, I just have to see that
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.160]   new thing. There will be three people like that.
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:20.840]   But I think for the vast majority of people, if it's a bundle and it's like, you get Apple
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:25.800]   music and then for two bucks extra, where you get Apple music plus news plus this plus that
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:30.200]   for the tidy sum of 20 bucks a month instead of 10 bucks a month, I think that's how you start
[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:33.480]   massively cloning out those numbers. Yeah.
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:39.320]   Wouldn't we all be floored if Apple just said, "It's free." You know, you have to have iCloud.
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:41.240]   That 400 bucks a month.
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:44.680]   Because they haven't announced a price. The rumor is, of course, 10 bucks a month,
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:46.120]   but they haven't announced a price.
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:52.600]   And I think that rumor is just solely based on the fact that other streaming services average
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:53.640]   out to about $10.
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:54.920]   I think it's just a nonsense.
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:55.880]   Yeah.
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:55.880]   Yeah.
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:31:02.120]   Well, let's also remember that they also have the iTunes store. So what they could do is make
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:07.400]   it subscription only, but then after three or four or five months, now episode after three
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:12.680]   months, episode one becomes a free download on Apple or maybe becomes a 99 cent download on Apple.
[01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:18.520]   Make it a loss leader just to get people interested in this content and aware that if they give
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:23.240]   if you if you horse over 10 bucks a month, you will be seeing stuff that you will be surprised
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:28.440]   to learn that you actually enjoy. So they have an ability to distribute this stuff beyond simply
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:33.320]   making it streaming only. So that's one area in which they might have an advantage over
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:39.800]   over at least Disney over at least CBS.com where you don't you can if you want to own it without
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:45.000]   having to subscribe, it will give you that option and they don't have to go to outside parties in
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.520]   order. They have to negotiate with themselves for those rights, not with outside parties.
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:54.120]   Well, we'll find out probably not until later this year though.
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:59.960]   We might find out pricing soon. We might find that out at the at the Apple iPhone event.
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:01.400]   They might just drop that on us.
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:04.920]   Boom. Are you guys.
[01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:09.240]   So, Laurie, you're in the you're on the West Coast. You could come down to the Apple event.
[01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:12.360]   Are you and Renee, are you expecting invitations?
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:16.680]   I never expect them. I mean, they're always you always get them though.
[01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:19.880]   Like being you always do until you don't though. That's the thing.
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:23.960]   I never I never expect them and I never get them. So it's perfect for me.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:29.640]   Yeah, I'm always happy to have one, but you know, I never want to get to the point where I expect
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:37.960]   them. Now Labor Day is September 2nd. So I'm going to predict that on the next Mac break weekly,
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:42.040]   you guys will be holding up your golden tickets. And I'll be.
[01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:45.480]   I'm going to predict that if we're getting invited, it'll be Thursday.
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:50.680]   That's my prediction. Yeah, as in the day after tomorrow, that's my prediction.
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:54.360]   Okay. We're reduced to predicting when we'll get the.
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:56.040]   It was August 30th last year.
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:33:01.160]   Or not. Invitations. They said that all invitations August 30th last year for the event.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:02.840]   Oh, okay. Well, that's about right.
[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:03.880]   Today is the 27th.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:06.440]   Yeah. So Thursday or Friday is August 30th.
[01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:11.160]   Yeah. But the event was slightly later in the year as September 12th. So two days earlier than
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:15.960]   that would make it the 28th. Lori is so good at this. She's so good.
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:21.400]   I've only been invited to that. I've only just recently been invited to a couple of events.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:25.800]   So I'm not holding my breath that I'll be invited by. I would certainly love to be able to attend.
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:32.120]   This I have not yet attended an actual iPhone event. So I think what Apple should do is say,
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:38.840]   if you have an Apple card that you get a ticket and it's pristine way.
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:48.200]   If I charge my ticket, it will determine right orange. So if you sold enough or if you spent
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:53.880]   enough money since Apple Card came out, which I would win because like I said, I put my cats.
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:58.840]   Surgery on my credit card. So I've already put a bunch of money on it.
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:04.200]   So now you're suggesting that the Apple Card is like making a donation to the
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:09.480]   police and police union fund to get that sticker in the back of the car. They don't tell you that
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:14.200]   you'll avoid getting a ticket if a cop spots you on the on the window. But maybe they'll help you
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:20.760]   to think that you will. You just you just flash your Apple card when you get up to the wherever
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:24.040]   it's going to be home. Oh, I've got my Apple. Oh, please come right in.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:33.080]   That would be nice. Let's check the name on it. Oh, Mr. Sax, come on in. I'm wondering if
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:40.040]   anybody checks their MacBook Pro and their checked luggage. That seems like a I don't put
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:46.360]   anything valuable in my checked luggage, including laptops, cameras. Why? But why would you but why?
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:52.280]   I almost did. I was visited. I went to visit my mom and I knew that I wasn't going to need it on
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:57.320]   the plane, but I knew that I was going to need it there with her. And I almost checked it. And
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:02.040]   the reason I didn't was my fear of it getting stolen out of my bag. I ended up taking it on
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:07.880]   taking it with me into the on to the plane. So yeah, I don't think that very many people would
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:13.560]   check their MacBook Pro or MacBook or whatever. But you might. I thought about it. Most people
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:20.200]   will not be affected. But a couple of three airlines have reacted to Apple's recall of the
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:29.320]   20, what was it? 2015 through 2017 MacBook Pros, the batteries posing a safety risk by banning all
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:34.040]   MacBook Pros and checked luggage, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, and the latest Virgin
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:39.480]   Australia have said you must carry it on. And the reason they're worried is if there is a fire in
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:47.240]   the hold, that's pretty hard to respond to when the airplanes in the in the air. So I don't just
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:55.720]   just a word of warning. Check with the airline before you pack a MacBook Pro into the checked luggage.
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:36:02.200]   Check luggage. Yeah. And honestly, I'm not mistaken. It's only the 15 inch MacBook that was affected
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:07.240]   by the batteries, but they're banning all Mac because they say we can't tell where to how you
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:12.040]   expect us to look at it and tell you. Honestly, don't put your cameras, your laptops, anything,
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:17.880]   your iPads, anything, you check luggage. Just just by a giant carry on bag. Yeah.
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:22.600]   I have to really the hardest thing for me is the camera gear because that could take up a lot of
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:26.840]   space and I have to figure out how to but I'm no way I'm letting my camera go and check luggage.
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:31.880]   No way. Yeah, that's that's that's why when those Scottie vest things are good. It's good for
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:37.720]   shoplifting and it's also for technically it's not a bag because I'm wearing it. Yeah.
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:42.680]   Tim Cook just donated five million shares of Apple stock to charity.
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:50.520]   So if you're the charity, hold it, right? Hold it. He's giving away his fortune. Good for you, Tim Cook.
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:59.480]   23,700 shares. That's um, I wish that I remembered the wording on this, but I think it was Bill Gates
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:04.680]   that kind of came up with this, you know, the the billionaires club or whatever. Yeah, Warren Buffett
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:09.400]   Bill Gates. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Where they they're going to be just giving away their
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:16.760]   fortune, which it's such a job's never signed on to that. I should point out. But he might have,
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:21.560]   he might have eventually later in life, he might have. But Cook has always been very good. We only
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:28.600]   know this because of an SEC filing, which doesn't tell us who the shares went to. But previously,
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:33.400]   he's donated to the Robert F Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights and the Human Rights Campaign.
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:39.480]   Uh, and he says he's going to take a systematic approach to giving away his entire fortune in the
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:45.800]   future. He has no children, but he has nephews, but he's said he'll, you know, he's going to keep
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:49.400]   some for the nephews, but he wants to give away almost all the rest, which is awesome. He wants
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:54.120]   to pay for the education of his nephew. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And didn't he, didn't he get, uh,
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:38:01.080]   I would just to search to remind myself, he got him one million shares of, uh, of stock in 2011,
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:08.120]   from Apple to like lock him into, uh, CEO positions through 2021. So if he stays, if he stays until
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:15.400]   2021, he gets the full like million shares. So you'll not have to. Wow. That's the thing is, you know,
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:20.600]   only the founders have founder money. Yeah. But, but, but that doesn't change anything that that's
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:25.160]   still like real money that he's given away. Yeah. It's like $200 million at the current stock price.
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:30.440]   That's a good, exactly. Good chunk of change. But I think, you know what, Tim is right. You could
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:35.960]   only spend so much in a lifetime and, uh, my kids aren't getting a penny because, uh, I don't want
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:41.640]   to spoil them. So there you go. So the Apple years, you got them over the years, Leo. That'll,
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:45.400]   that'll support him for life. Yes. They're getting all my Apple stock.
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:51.320]   What's it? What's the same? You gave us, you gave us these MacBook Pros. We've kept them every
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:55.320]   year. They're in mint condition. We're selling that book collector. Thanks for the future. Clever.
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:00.760]   I asked Henry what he wanted his birthdays tomorrow. I asked Henry what he wanted for his birthday.
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:05.240]   And he said, just give me cash. He said, I'll put it in my savings account. I said,
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:08.360]   the problem with giving you cash is you spent it here and there and pretty soon it wasn't a gift.
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:12.760]   It was just, you know, you bought some Fritos. I, uh, it's, but he says, no, I'll put it in my
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:17.640]   savings. So then I said, I'm going to give you a savings bond. And he said, what's that?
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:23.400]   I said, in the old days, we were bond. Yeah.
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:27.480]   War. Did he reject that because he wanted to actually be able to spend the money?
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:32.920]   Well, yeah. Do people still get savings bonds when kids are born? Yeah. Yeah.
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:36.360]   Yeah. My nephew, who's only 10 got a couple, I think.
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:40.200]   It's not. They're not the best investment vehicle. Not a beach. I mean, 20%.
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:44.600]   I think giving somebody 10 shares of Apple stock would probably be pretty good.
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:49.400]   Yeah. They're pretty good. It's worse because it's presumptive to pick a gift for somebody.
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:51.960]   You're supposed to give them money because they'll pick the gift that they want.
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:55.080]   I want to be in that culture. Okay. Henry, you get a cash.
[01:39:55.080 --> 01:40:02.760]   That's why they haven't bought it. They didn't, but he didn't specify what currency.
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:07.240]   So give them something that he'll have to go to the airport or to a Pacific Island in order to spend.
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:11.720]   I'm giving him $7.83 from Apple Pay. That's what I'm giving him right now.
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:14.840]   It's a knock-out point. It's the imperfect instrument. Oh, I can't.
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:18.280]   I'm an actual trans-all. He's always wanted my Bitcoin wallet. I can give him that.
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:23.480]   Yeah. That's a lot of money if you can figure out the password. Oh, come all these, all these
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:27.960]   dollars have Chairman Mouse picture on it. Well, son, it's called the Yuan.
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:33.400]   Yuan. I do have quite a bit of international currency. I remember when Alex Lindsey came back
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:36.600]   from Zimbabwe and gave me what was it? Like 10 million Zimbabwe bucks.
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:41.240]   I remember when the Rand was worth more than the dollar and how times have changed.
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:45.080]   Oh, yes. The Canadian dollar was worth more than the US dollar when I first came here too.
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:51.160]   Yeah. Yeah, that was a problem for me because I started getting paid in Canadian dollars
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:54.200]   by Rogers and it got to be less and less and less and less.
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:41:02.120]   Nope, that was super fun writing for British magazines where it's like the worst that our
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:09.320]   economy was doing. The higher my page rate got. You know, as a joke, I am going to print out my
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:16.280]   Bitcoin wallet ID and I'm going to give it to Henry as a joke, put it on a card. Maybe.
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:19.560]   Oh, I still have the old Apple card holder. I'll put it in there.
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:25.160]   Well, then he's going to be disappointed because he's going to think he's getting an Apple card.
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:29.560]   Oh, no, I don't think he wants to know. Actually, he does. I told him to apply for the Apple card.
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:33.240]   He doesn't have a credit card and, you know, he's a young guy. He's starting out. He'll be,
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:38.360]   he's his 25th birthday tomorrow. And so, you know, that's the first thing you do as you get,
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:41.800]   once you get out of college, you get a, you start to build credit, right? You get a credit card.
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:48.040]   But for some reason, his credit is tied to my American Express. And I guess at one point,
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:52.680]   I gave him when he was in college a card within his name so that he, if for emergencies. And
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:56.440]   all the credit unions are saying, well, you're carrying a huge balance.
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:00.840]   Oh, no. That's not his, that's not his balance, baby.
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:07.480]   Because we use, we use it for, for business, we, the American Express card is used for business
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:12.520]   purchases. So there's, but we pay it off every month, but there's often fairly significant
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:18.760]   balances on there. So poor Henry will never get a credit card. He said, I don't want to apply
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:22.280]   for an Apple credit card, get turned down, but people don't get to people are people getting turned
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:27.000]   down. I think they're pretty liberal. There are people that are getting turned down.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.440]   It's, it's maybe just based on like conversations that I see on Reddit or on Twitter on something
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:39.400]   like that. It's maybe, maybe two to 3% of the people who talk about it have said they've been
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:44.040]   turned down. It's pretty low. In fact, one of the headlines was Goldman Sachs gets into the
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:48.760]   subprime lender business. Yeah. So maybe, maybe I should just, just to get the Apple
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:51.000]   card. It's just for building credit. He doesn't, you know how it is.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.160]   Right. Let's take a break.
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:55.320]   You're his name off that Amex though.
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:59.400]   Well, yes, that's the first thing I'm going to do is call Amex and say stop reporting
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:05.320]   that my son is carrying a $30,000 path once he's not. Of course, you know,
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:09.560]   some of his friends, if you're listening, send an alert to him. He has a limited
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:12.280]   amount of time to charter a jet for your for all. Yeah. Right.

[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:54.520]   show it real quickly because Andy, you picked this last week. I ordered it from Hong Kong. My
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:46:02.680]   light picks labs, flash IQ or flash queue, I guess, came today. This is going to be so cool. It's a
[01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:12.360]   strobe, tiny little pocket strobe that can be removed from the flash shoe. So you could put it on a
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:18.680]   tripod or even hand hold it. This is a transmitter. This is for 60 bucks. Andy, thank you for the
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:22.840]   suggestion. I'm so excited about this. This is awesome. You're going to have a lot of fun with it.
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:29.080]   And if I put nickel, metal, hydrone in here, it's rechargeable. What a great idea. Thank you.
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:36.120]   Now, Andy, give me a new thing to buy. This is free, free, free. So the law set,
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:41.720]   some of the things everybody knows Scott Kannaster. He is one of the nicest people in
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:49.000]   Mac and technology. He's been writing and working in the industry for decades. And he decided to
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:55.800]   create all the stories he used to tell about working in the valley for his entire career since
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:47:02.680]   working for Apple in 1983. He decided to turn it into a stage show, an hour of storytelling.
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:09.720]   And it's called the show is called adjacent to greatness stories from tech. And he did a live
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:15.560]   show in a theater recently that was recorded. And it was in San Jose. And it's available on
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:19.880]   YouTube that you can actually watch and stream it. And he has the most amazing stories. He's
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:25.080]   almost like the forest gump of like startups in the 80s and 90s. Because he's like, he's
[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:31.400]   he's worked at he's working at Google now. He used to work at Microsoft, Apple, he general magic.
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:38.040]   When he left Apple to join general magic, he got hired, got a job offer from next when they were
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:43.640]   first starting up. And he was actually got job offers from both Apple and next. He of course did
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:47.160]   the whole days worth of interviews culminating with an interview with Steve Jobs himself.
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:52.760]   They wouldn't tell him at next exactly what they were developing or what they were working on.
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:57.720]   And so at that point in his life, he decided to go for something a little bit more stable,
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:02.840]   like at Apple. And of course, he got a phone call from Steve Jobs, like as soon as like he turned
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:08.280]   down the offer saying, so they tell me that you've turned down a job working for the best people,
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:14.360]   working on one of the greatest pieces of technology ever happened. Huh. So tell me about it. And to
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:20.120]   try to get him to sign up again. But no, no, no, no, no going. He's a great storyteller. This is
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:25.160]   not just him just like sitting down and writing his memoirs, like in an alcohol binge or something.
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:29.800]   These are well, well, well rehearsed, well performed. He was start he basically
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:35.640]   road tripped it as 20 minutes at stories. And so by the time he developed it into a full like one
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:40.440]   hour long show, it's really, really well told, really, really well owned. And it's free. It's on
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:44.600]   YouTube. I can't recommend it. Highl enough is such an entertaining hour. Oh, he's such a great
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:49.560]   guy. I've known Scott since the eighties. He was he's a great technical writer written so much
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:54.440]   great stuff. I'm thrilled. I'm thrilled. I thought I was gonna have to go to Broadway to see this.
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:59.400]   It's on YouTube. That's awesome. Yeah. And I mean, I'm amazed that if you ever if he ever decided to
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:04.920]   retire from from from from Google, he could basically tour for the next two or three years
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:09.160]   going from whipping hired from like, trade show to trade show to trade show, like every single
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:14.440]   hacker con every single developer con to tell these stories because that's it really is quite
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:21.640]   quite wonderful. The the the the poster picture on the on the YouTube is actually him like on the day
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:28.680]   that he went into to to interview at Apple. So the picture of his hotel room with the free
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:33.400]   like Apple tote bag. I'm sorry, his first day of work, the free Apple tote bag that Apple gave
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:38.280]   him like on his first day of orientation. So this goes and it's a pretty cool tote bag. It's like,
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:43.720]   I told him that if he ever decides to throw it out, I will be waiting outside by his trash bins.
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:51.800]   Such a cool bag. He still has it. Lori Gill, your pick of the week. Oh, so 12th South.
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:50:00.920]   No, they they have a line of products that all match each other. And they just recently updated the
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:08.840]   the one for iPad Pro. It's the journal line. And so now I have the whole line of of journal products
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:15.480]   from from my iPhone and my Mac and my iPad Pro and I even have the catty sack. So they just they
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:21.080]   just released this one updated for the iPad Pro, which actually is the same design as the one for
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:27.880]   the MacBook, which has this extra pocket in it, which to me is the best update for this particular
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:33.400]   one because you can slide. I actually have the keys to go. So you can slide the keys to go in there.
[01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:38.840]   So if you need a physical type of physical keyboard with your, when you're on the go,
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:42.760]   you can actually shove that in there and still use this kind of fancy pants looking
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:45.640]   journal and just pull out the keyboard when you want to use it.
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:53.080]   Is the keys to go their products? No, no, it's they just happen to make a little sleeve and one of the,
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:58.120]   if you have any ultra thin keyboard, would fit in there. It fits, if I were to describe it,
[01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:03.720]   like maybe, you know, like one of the spiral notebooks that it wouldn't fit the Apple keyboard
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:11.880]   probably. That's the wedge is kind of big. No, I'm going to say no, it wouldn't fit it. Yeah,
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:17.080]   it's it's a needs to be a little thinner that than that more something more like a 30 or like
[01:51:17.080 --> 01:51:23.400]   maybe a 90 page spiral notebook that you just get from the grocery store, you know, it's it's thin,
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:28.760]   but does not super thin. So you can it's leather. Yeah. And it's it's gorgeous. And when you have
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:33.400]   the whole lineup, all sitting next to each other, I think I described it as having
[01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:39.960]   matched luggage, you know, it's very she she she and fancy. It looks really good when they're all
[01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:44.520]   just together stacked up like that. They need to make you want a game show in the 70s.
[01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:49.000]   They need to make an Apple Apple card holder to go with all of this. Yes. Yes.
[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:57.880]   12 South is great. That's nice. Beautiful journal for iPad pro. Very nice. Thank you,
[01:51:57.880 --> 01:52:03.160]   Lori. How much is it? Just out of curiosity. It's probably expensive. I'm going to quote this
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:10.360]   wrong, but I think it's $99 starting at 99. Oh, that's not bad for leather. Yeah, it's not bad at all.
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:16.040]   Not bad. It's real nice. They're really good quality. That's for the 11. So 12.
[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:21.000]   Yeah, it's I think it's one 29. Yeah, it's not one 20. It's not bad. Thank you, Lori.
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:26.920]   Renee Richie, you've got something for the Apple card. Yeah. So I mean, I'm this is just
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:31.080]   I hate to use a cliche, but game recognizing game, you know, my backgrounds and marketing. I love it.
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:36.920]   When you see really clever, really snarky marketing. So well played D brand because as
[01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:42.360]   soon as that article went up and people started talking about the possible discoloration and the
[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:47.880]   elaborate care procedures for the Apple card, D brand tweeted out, we got you, Tim. And in that
[01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:54.120]   we have a link to D brand slash Apple card where they are offering you their trademark skins,
[01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:58.520]   which are basically three M skins for your Apple card. You can get them in color.
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:04.440]   Yeah. So if you're worried, I mean, you can six, you can six, you can Jason Snell those things up.
[01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:09.400]   It's kind of, I got to say a little cheesy. They're charging separately for the front and the back.
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:17.320]   That's I mean, come on guys, I guess. I don't know how much you think this is a joke.
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:21.480]   How much of it is. Yeah. And how much of it is just well, there's going to be some people.
[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:30.040]   Oh, I want the wood, the wood backed Apple card. Oh, yeah. And the reason they separate is because
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:36.920]   you can mix and match. Oh, that looks like the paneling in my, my bedroom. That's a piece of
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:42.600]   lag. I want the, I want the frog design one with like the horizontal slats and like the off white
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:51.240]   sort of pebble, treble plastic dragon skin, carbon fiber stone stone marble. Oh, I'm definitely
[01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:57.080]   wondering. Well played well played. And that's, and by the way, the card name is Tim Apple.
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:54:02.840]   Oh, yeah. If you've always wanted a black card, now you can make your Apple card black, black,
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:06.600]   black, and you can get it with or without the Apple cut out. So if you don't want anybody to know,
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:13.000]   you can hide the Apple. What would I do? What would, what would Renee do? Would you hide the Apple?
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.720]   No, I mean, but I, you know, see, I'm not allowed to hide any Apple, but if I was you,
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:21.880]   I'd go full still. I'd go total. Oh, yeah. I don't want anybody to know. It doesn't have your name.
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:25.160]   This just looks like a piece of weirdly colored.
[01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:32.360]   Okay. Good. But, okay. I got, I got the product though. Someone should make like a six color
[01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:36.920]   classic Apple logo exactly the right size to replace. Oh, on the car.
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:40.520]   D brand you got that's an easy, that's an easy five buck purchase.
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:46.840]   So I'm going to get a bamboo front and back hiding the Apple logo hiding my name. Look at that.
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:51.960]   You can't even tell. It's just like, oh, you got a piece of bamboo with a mag stripe and a chip.
[01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:56.840]   Yeah. Free order ship September. I need it now.
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:04.600]   Now D brand now. My pick of the week, I showed this on iOS today. I thought I'd show you two.
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:09.000]   It's from other world computing. I love what they do. They've made a travel doc in the past. Now,
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:15.320]   I bought because of you, Lori, I bought the Hyperdrive that goes on my, my iPad Pro. It's got the
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:23.160]   little USB connector and it has a bunch of other ports on it. But it doesn't work very well with
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:29.400]   a MacBook. So this is actually a really cool idea. They call it their travel doc. It has one of the
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:33.800]   things I like about it. The Type C cable is part of it. It's built in and it has a little holder in
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:40.280]   the back that you can put the Type C cable in. It's just long enough to connect to your iPad
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:46.280]   and sit on the desk or to your MacBook. They have two versions. The newest that just came out
[01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:51.480]   has a hundred watt pass through. So I could fully charge it's enough power to go through that Type
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:57.080]   C adapter. So I could plug this into the wall, have this sitting on my desk when I get back
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:03.880]   from work, plug in my iPad. Now I have a standard Type A, USB 3.1 port, a full size HDMI port,
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:10.280]   an SD card reader, and another USB port. Unfortunately, no headphone jack, which is odd.
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:15.880]   That is something that the Hyperdrive has that this lacks. But if you have a MacBook,
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:19.080]   I guess you don't need the headphone jack. Maybe that was their thinking. I wouldn't mind seeing
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:25.960]   an ethernet port on here too, but times have changed. It is very affordable. $55.
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:32.040]   That's their Labor Day savings, I guess. If you want to get the one that doesn't have all that
[01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:39.080]   power only, I think it's 60 watts. That's 43.88. But then you can't charge really, you would
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:44.440]   take a while to charge your MacBook with that. But you can. It's just a little bit slower. How
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:51.480]   many watts is this one? I think it was, I want to say it was 2730, something like that.
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:58.680]   Well worth it. I really like this. A 4K display is supported. USB 3.1,
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:02.440]   generation 1, and the SD card reader. And that's the main reason I'm going to use this for my
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:09.720]   laptop is to plug the SD cards in when I get back from my photo shoots. Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:18.920]   let concludes this edition of Macbreak Weekly. Thank you, Andy Inaco. Thank you to the
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:24.360]   library for supporting Andy Inaco. And we will catch you at the Boston Public Library sometime
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:30.200]   later this week. Nope, we have this week off because no one wants to screw up a long weekend
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:34.680]   with a Friday broadcast. But I'm going to be back the following Friday, also at the Boston
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:43.880]   Public Library. 1pm, I believe. Nice. On WGBH Boston, our favorite. Boston's NPR, your local NPR
[01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:49.960]   station. My favorite grew up listening to WGBH. Thanks to Lori Gill, she's managing it at her
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:58.520]   iMore. She'll be getting her invitation on Thursday. Maybe. Don't curse me. Maybe anything else you
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:05.960]   want to plug. Not this week. Okay. We love having you on though. Thank you for joining us and Renee
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:12.280]   Richie, the Pokemon master. Still playing the game. You know what I kind of gave up on Wizard's
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:16.040]   United? It's just not that interesting. A lot of people are saying that it's not doing as well
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:19.800]   as anybody expected. Yeah. Oh, man, I thought there'd be more crowds. I thought it'd be like
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:24.520]   Pokemon go three years ago, except worse. And it nothing. I think Warner's made the wrong choices
[01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:28.200]   about which elements of the game to include. And if they'd done it more like Pokemon go where it
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:32.760]   was more adventure and less management, it would have had a similar effect. Way too much. I got
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:36.840]   tired of the management. So yeah, a lot of people have been doing that. Yeah. So I'm doing
[01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:43.800]   crossword puzzles instead. Well, you could be out doing your Jirachi quest. Jirachi is now available
[01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:48.680]   by Quest. You could be out there. I'm sure that's what Lisa's doing. She's sad because she'd never
[01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:53.400]   reads any of the releases or press releases or any of the background information that iMore.com.
[01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:57.000]   She always counted on me to do that. So I would say she said, what is this? And I'd say, well, let me
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:03.160]   tell you. But now I don't know. So she's kind of without her Pokemaster. However, if you wish to be
[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:09.080]   a Pokemaster, go to iMore.com. And if you wish to be a master of all trades, go to iMore.com/vector.
[01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:15.080]   Renee's wonderful podcast. Renee Richie, always a pleasure. Thank you for being here every week.
[01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:21.480]   I guess except for two weeks from now where you'll be in somewhere.
[01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:27.960]   Just come back with enough of the Apple T-shirts for the old-fashioned original logo for everybody
[01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:33.000]   from the Apple store. And it will be square. There you go. We do Mac break for large. We do Mac
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:38.920]   break weekly on Tuesdays right after iOS today. Make it a Apple morning if you want, starting at
[01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:45.160]   9 a.m. for iOS today and around 11 a.m. Pacific for Mac break weekly. That'd be 1 p.m. Eastern time
[01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:52.760]   and be 1700 UTC. You can watch or listen live at twit.tv/live. You can even ask your voice assistant to
[01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:59.960]   stream the live stream. In most cases, it's something like, "Hey, you play Twit Live." And it will start
[01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:06.520]   playing it. So that's a great way to listen along. If you're in the live stream, do join the chat
[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:12.440]   room because they're talking all the time about the stuff we talk about. It's at irc.twit.tv/family/friendly.
[02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:17.880]   A great place to hang out. In fact, many people stay there all day, even all night. It's a strange
[02:00:17.880 --> 02:00:26.200]   bunch. You can also listen to the show on demand because it is after all a podcast. Go to twit.tv/mbw
[02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:31.720]   for Mac break weekly or better yet subscribe in your favorite podcast application or on YouTube.
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:37.160]   And you'll get the minutes available on Tuesday afternoons just in time for your Wednesday morning
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:41.960]   commute. Thanks everybody. We appreciate your being here. But now I have to say it's time to get
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:58.280]   back to work because break time is over.
