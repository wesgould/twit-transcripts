[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.280]   For news. Of which there is a dearth today, but that's okay because
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.560]   we're gonna have a good time because Jim Dowrympel is here from the Loop.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.480]   Loopinsight.com. Hello, Jimmy.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.840]   Hey. Good to see you. How you doing?
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.600]   I'm well. How's life in Loopland? Life is good. Good.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.240]   We always like having Jim on also joining us as always from Boston Public Radio.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.440]   WGBH at Boston, Mr. Andrew and not Co. Hello, Andy.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.960]   I don't think I've ever heard like Jim refer to as Jimmy.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.880]   That's it. That's like almost a mind blower.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.480]   I almost ducked when I said it.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.680]   No, no, no. I honestly came out of my mouth and I went like don't hit me.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.440]   Sounds like my mother calling me. Jimmy. Time for dinner.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.400]   If I'm in trouble, it's just James. James. Then I knew I was in trouble.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.600]   Yeah. James come here. We have to talk.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.280]   But on your way, pick a switch from the bush.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.080]   Also with us Renee Richie, who is celebrating 18 weeks of nonstop snow.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.880]   No, it's the floods now, Leo. The snow has all gone away, but the floods remain.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.560]   We're still on state of emergency.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.680]   Don't, don't, don't, don't.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.440]   Up in Montreal.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.600]   You can call me Jim. You can call me Jimbo. You can call me Jimmy.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.280]   I mean, any of those things are fine.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.520]   It doesn't has to call me Renee.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.440]   No.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.640]   So Apple loses in the Supreme Court, but as everybody was quick to point out, it doesn't really mean a thing.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.080]   Well, it was interesting because go ahead, Andy. Sorry.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.840]   I'll just say, well, it's it just it just means that instead of
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.160]   if it means that a lawsuit that could possibly change how they do business gets to go forward,
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.600]   we're off. If it's 10 steps to Apple having to totally change all of their app store policies,
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.480]   we are now on step two, maybe three, but that is arguably two numbers greater than one.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.520]   It was kind of a firewall. Apple was hoping they could get rid of the whole threat of the class
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.600]   action lawsuit over the Apple store's monopoly by just saying, well, customers of the Apple store
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.400]   don't have standing. They can't sue us according to Illinois brick.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.480]   Yeah, well, it's the interesting. I think, sorry, Ben Thompson had a really good analysis on this,
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.640]   which he has want to do. But the this to me is sort of like maybe the one of the best things
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.960]   that could have happened to Apple. And I say that only because that law was supposed to prevent
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.800]   dual plaintiffs from getting damages based on the same lawsuit. So in this case, it was meant to
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.160]   prevent developers from suing Apple and customers from suing Apple both for the same thing.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.640]   And the US has traditionally looked at lowest price as the key for regulation, where the EU looks at
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.000]   things like competition, regardless of price. And in this case, the thesis is that because of
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.960]   Apple's control of the app store, app prices are artificially high, which whenever you say that,
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.120]   I just imagine every developer in the world screaming and crying, because if anything,
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.200]   Apple has been accused of absolutely destroying the value of applications.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.200]   But what this means is that it doesn't do have anything to do with the merits of the case.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:02.080]   It just means that the people involved, the customers involved, can sue Apple, but they still have a
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.280]   terrible case. There's a case maybe that developers can sue Apple. And there's a case that can be
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.360]   made about antitrust that has nothing to do with this. This looks like the worst possible antitrust
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:20.480]   case from Apple is now allowed to go forward based on a bad reading of an existing law that's
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.480]   designed to prevent just that. So it's sort of the ultimate irony at the same time.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.480]   So just to be clear, the Supreme Court did not rule whether app the app store is a monopoly.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:37.600]   Yes. There are no consequences, no damages to Apple. It just means that a lawsuit about that
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.400]   can go forward. And Apple has ample time a to defend that lawsuit, which probably will take
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.240]   years and b, to if it wants to. And I think this is what Ben Behren said, there are lots of little
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.600]   changes they could make to the app store that would make the whole thing moot.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.040]   But are they pricing based? Like the whole thing for me that makes this one silly is that it's
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.480]   based on the price of apps being too high when the price of apps is still trending towards zero.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.680]   You can make a lot of anti-competitive arguments, but pricing is a weird one.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:16.240]   Pricey is the silliest argument of all in this whole thing because the majority, well, no,
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:23.280]   not the majority. Let's say that a good portion of the apps are either free, which Apple takes
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:30.160]   no cut of. Obviously, there's no money to take a cut of or they're 99 cents.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:42.160]   So how is it that pricing is an issue here when apps cost 99 cents? I mean, I wrote yesterday that
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:51.280]   I don't think as consumers, we value the work that developers put into creating these apps.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:07:01.280]   The customers these days value free and complain that 99 cents is too much even if they find the
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:08.960]   app useful. And that to me is just craziness. I mean, from what I've seen over the years,
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:17.440]   and I've been doing this for 25, 26 years now, the price of apps is ridiculously low. So for
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:24.720]   somebody to say that Apple has a monopoly based on that is just ridiculous.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.960]   Yeah, but it still leaves them open to the idea that there is no way to sell an app on,
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.400]   there's no way to sell an app to iPhone users without giving Apple 30%. There is also in
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.880]   particularly the EU where it's not the users who are filing a class action suit, but the EU
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.560]   that is actually applying anti-trust laws against Apple saying that it's not correct for Apple to
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:52.160]   be selling a music service through their app store, but giving themselves better terms than
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:59.120]   their giving Spotify or any other services that are sold through the app store. So there's still
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:07.840]   although everybody's very correct in saying that it's odd for users to file this suit as opposed to
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:14.800]   the actual aggrieved parties, i.e. the developers and the makers of competing services to compete
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.680]   with Apple to bring the suit, it still reveals a big vulnerability for Apple. This is something
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.120]   that they probably in the next three to five years, they're going to have to either, they probably
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.320]   have to proactively make an adjustment to how they deal with parts of their business just to
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.760]   make these lawsuits much, much harder to prosecute if nothing else.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:41.920]   Yeah, and if people want to download apps from other sources, so from anywhere on the internet,
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:49.120]   what's going to happen is that there's going to be malicious apps and malicious code installed on
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:56.480]   phones that allows them to be hacked because what Apple does with the app store is not just
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:02.560]   have a platform, but it's a safe and secure platform. So if you can go download apps from
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:08.880]   anywhere, which people will do, they're going to come back and the headline is going to read,
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.880]   not the headline won't read some stupid person downloaded an app from an insecure website,
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:22.640]   which put a virus on their phone and they get hacked, the headline will read iPhone hacked.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:29.760]   That's it. Well, and then the EU will be screaming at Apple to protect its users
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:38.720]   and people will be screaming to put software in place so that I don't get
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:45.360]   my phone hacked. Well, what if Apple does what Android does, which is allow users to check a box that
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:52.000]   says, I'm going to get stuff, sideload stuff from third parties. I know I'm taking a risk. Google
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.960]   puts a big warning of the risk involved. In fact, lately, they've made it so that the switch is a
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.520]   one time only. You switch it downloaded and it switches, it reverts back to the play store. What
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.000]   if they did something like that? I don't think that the Google environment, despite all the press,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.600]   is significantly more risky than the Apple environment. Wouldn't that be a suitable way to get out of this?
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:19.760]   I don't think so. I think that what will end up happening is that people just scream at Apple.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:26.640]   That's what's going to come out of it. People, I think, expect in Android and some of the other
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:34.080]   operating systems for different devices that viruses and malware are a thing. With Apple,
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:39.840]   they don't. They figure that they're secure. They're secure because of the way that Apple
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:47.680]   distributes things. They hold the developers to a certain standard of what the apps have to be.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:53.360]   Now, it still leaks through. I honestly don't think that I feel any less secure using Android
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:11:00.000]   than I do Apple. Apple released through both cases. Both companies take great steps to protect you.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.960]   I don't think that Google takes great steps to protect privacy and security.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.560]   Privacy may be the best explanation. Absolutely.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:20.880]   They absolutely do. The biggest... I would reply by saying, "Come on, come on." They do app
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:30.080]   screening. They do proactively screen apps that go in. The number of apps that have malware that
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:36.880]   come through the Play Store is minuscule compared to the perceived advantage of being able to
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:46.400]   sideload apps as your own priority. One thing we haven't spoken about is that if Apple were to allow
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.760]   third-party... Excuse me, non-apps or apps to be installed, the other problem is going to be
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:58.960]   piracy of commercial apps, which is another very, very big problem. My position is that I do think
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:05.360]   that this is my phone. I've spent $1,000 for this phone. If I perceive a benefit to be able to
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:13.920]   sideload an app that is not on the app store that violates iTunes Store app policies,
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.440]   that should be my prerogative. I think that they have a responsibility to warn me that this
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.400]   might be a bad idea, particularly if I'm going to be getting this app from someone I don't know
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:28.800]   and can't really trust. But that really is my priority. And the other thing is that this
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:36.640]   really is an issue, that if Apple has the ability to sell services through iOS apps,
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:42.480]   if Apple has the ability to break its own rules for developers, again, there are many,
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:49.840]   many benefits to users, but that also arguably and legally arguably creates a burden on the people
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:56.080]   that Apple is competing with through the app store. So this is something that needs to be discussed
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:01.360]   and really needs to be settled out in the open rather than Apple being able to claim this by fiat.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.400]   I think there should be fair to Apple. And then Renee, you'll be next, but I should give
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:16.320]   you what Apple said in response to CNBC. I just had it in front of me and I've lost it again.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.440]   Essentially, I want to read it exactly. Today's decision means
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.520]   today's decisions. I found it. Today's decision means plaintiffs can proceed with their case
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.160]   in District Court. We are confident we will prevail when the facts are presented.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.360]   The app store is not a monopoly by any metrics. So we've already said that this just merely means
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:41.680]   that the lawsuit can go ahead. It does not end the lawsuit prematurely, which is what Apple hoped.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:49.040]   Apple says we're not a monopoly. So what is the... Is it that you can't buy stuff from anywhere
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.800]   besides the app store? Because that's one remedy we're talking about. But are there other remedies?
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.960]   What if Apple didn't charge Netflix? One of the complaints is Netflix and Amazon and others don't
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:04.240]   like that Netflix says we're not going to allow people to renew their Netflix subscription.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.080]   Companies that are intermediaries. There's a couple of things here. One is that
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:14.560]   in this specific... There are a lot of antitrust arguments or regulation arguments you can make
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.440]   against the app store. This case just happens to not be a good one. I think just on the law,
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:25.040]   it was a bad case. The biggest problem with things like Netflix and Spotify is that
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.840]   they and Apple are both trying to do the same thing. Netflix and Spotify are trying to aggregate
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.960]   other people's content and sell it to you for a process. Whereas Apple is trying to aggregate...
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:40.320]   They're aggregating music or TV. Apple is aggregating apps and trying to sell it at a margin.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.600]   You're right. And there's no room for two margins there. You can't have two middlemen.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.000]   And that creates inevitable tension because Apple can't take 30% and Netflix takes 30%.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.920]   And Spotify takes 30%. There's just not enough percent. It's just a math thing.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.840]   I think Apple has to be incredibly careful because there are so many potential landmines
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:00.880]   that they could step on, especially in the EU. They are vulnerable in the US like we saw with
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:08.400]   Amazon and books where really lowest... You can completely price drop everything and sell it for
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.480]   no money as a loss leader. And the regulars will tend to love you rather than thinking that
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.680]   you're destroying any and all viable market for that material. So there are landmines on both sides
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:23.200]   there. This case just happens to be a very bad one. And I think anything can happen at trial.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.040]   It's one of those situations where you can never go and predicting it. But on the law,
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.760]   this seems to be one of the more solid arguments for Apple. So I don't think there'll be any
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.680]   immediate damage from this. There's just the potential for problems outside of it.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.720]   And it reminds me when you go back... Because I always do this, whenever something happens,
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.480]   I go back to previous years and I read and I read and I read. And you look at the announcement
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:47.600]   of the App Store and how many developers were absolutely thrilled that it was only 30% because
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.400]   everyone else had always taken 55% from them or charged them so much for everything that it
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:59.760]   ended up being an exorbitant amount. And 30% was just so low for them and free apps they charged
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:04.400]   you nothing for, no hosting, no transaction, no nothing. And there is going to be a problem for
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.720]   Apple if they lose that 30% because so much of that service is revenue, which they're claiming
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.600]   they're going to double in a short amount of time is based on App Store. But also they subsidize
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.360]   everything that's free in the App Store based on the amount of revenue they're pulling in.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.200]   Not that it's not obscenely profitable it is, but there would have to be a profound change to the
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.880]   way the App Store works if any of these elements starts moving around.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:31.840]   Is there an economic pressure on Apple as well? Besides this lawsuit, an economic pressure on
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:37.440]   Apple, we know that smartphone sales are plummeting the worst quarter in a long time, last quarter,
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.960]   not just for Apple, but for all smartphone sales. Keep services driving you up.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:47.120]   But at the same time, you also want to keep developers writing for your platform. You want to
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:53.520]   incentivize, I mean, as you point out, really what Apple's selling with an iPhone besides the
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.920]   hardware is the content. It's still the most profitable user base and developers want to sell
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.160]   into. They mean they convert better than any other platform still. And that's where a lot of
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.600]   money is for developers. Those are certain developers to do well. But that service revenue
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:12.960]   comes from selling content subscriptions in app purchases created by third parties. So you've
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.040]   got to incentivize third parties. If third parties are selling ripped off.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.200]   Okay, that's a good point. I mean, honestly, they don't have a problem.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.280]   Lawsuit notwithstanding, they don't have a problem as long as developers keep
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.160]   putting stuff on Apple store. Especially those games, Leo, those games with the
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.640]   Smurf Berries and the Poca coins. Yeah, but don't you think one of the reasons Apple created
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:39.360]   its new gaming platform is in response to that? Yeah. Yeah.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.680]   I mean, it's hard to use the key money off of them. When you make money out of something,
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.720]   you don't like it's a weird position to be. Yeah.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:53.280]   Well, also there's legal exposure. Just last week, there was a legislation that's moving through
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:59.360]   the house to basically call these loot boxes and call these other sort of in game purchasing things,
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:05.520]   kind of regulate them like they're gambling and to take publishers to task for making gambling
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.800]   software available to kids. So there's a lot of good reasons to do it, part of which to make
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.200]   sure that they can the parents were the ones who actually make the money that goes into the app store
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:21.360]   through the form of allowances. If they stop letting their kids buy things through the app store,
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.360]   then they start losing that money. So you may as well make sure the parents are happy.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:33.200]   Eric Benjamin, super writing on the mobile dev memo blog about the problem with the 30%
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:40.320]   platform fee in three charts, his final paragraph, Netflix decision to stop allowing users to register
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:45.040]   for the service on their iOS devices highlights Apple's difficult rock and hard place position
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.080]   with respect to payments. Smart phone penetration and decreasing hardware sales growth means
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.920]   in app subscriptions are more important than ever. But in a cross device world,
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:59.440]   developers have the option of accepting payments elsewhere. So he's saying, give developers tools
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:04.640]   like lapse subscriber discounts. Apple makes the case that access to its payments and products
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.440]   fully justifies his platform fee. That's what this that's the real risk here for Apple, not this
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:15.600]   lawsuit, which is going to go away, settle whatever. It's the long term risk that developers would
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.400]   turn their back on a store if they don't see it as in their interest. Well, also there's no value
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.000]   left. I mean, the problem with the app store is that it created the era of pop apps. We went
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.960]   from having Photoshop that was a thousand dollars in a box on a store shelf. And you bought one or two
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:33.920]   apps a year or every couple of years, because that's all you could afford to the expectation that
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:39.200]   you can have every app anytime you want it. They went from scarcity to ubiquity. And there's very
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.840]   little value in ubiquity. We see that in news. We see that in almost every form of content.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:50.320]   We've seen music go from very expensive CDs to $99.99 a month for everything you could ever want to
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:56.320]   stream. And there's there's no real walking that back. And the pressure on apps to go down in price
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:01.360]   or low in price, big companies can afford to give everything away for free. So not only are you,
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.840]   people don't want to pay for your apps, but Google or Facebook or Apple is likely making a version of
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:10.080]   your app for free. And I think one of the greatest problems is that we're just going to lose our
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.600]   capacity for any of the developers that we hear on this panel of to make a living making these apps.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.520]   And then we'll be stuck in a sort of an era of, you know, not anything wrong with Netflix or
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.720]   Office or any of those things, but that's sort of all the apps. There's different constituents.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:28.640]   It's not money in the platform. So our friend Rich Segal, he's happy to be back in the app store.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:33.520]   He's happy to give that 30% cut to Apple. But the marketing, the distribution, there's benefits to
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:41.200]   him. Netflix though, by pulling out cost Apple, it's a sensor tower estimates cost Apple $450
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:47.120]   million or more. That's how much money they had made so far from Netflix. That's a big chunk to
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.800]   Apple. Isn't that a big risk for Apple? I'm sorry. You might be cutting you off.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.200]   I'm so, you have a Disney Plus is going to solve their woes. But they could hurt Netflix and make
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.000]   Netflix go running back to Apple. I mean, we don't know how this is going to play out.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.480]   Yeah, we're in interesting times. Go ahead, Jim. I'm sorry, Jim. I didn't mean to cut you off for
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:10.160]   you. Oh, no. No, I forget what I was going to say. I'm sorry. I apologize.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:16.240]   Who? Well, so and who is being hurt by this? Are consumers hurt by Apple's monopoly? I don't
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:22.240]   think I think that's your point, Jim. It doesn't hurt consumers. I think it helps consumers.
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:34.800]   We have a safe, easy central place to buy apps to have our credit card there. I have my Netflix
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:45.360]   subscription through Apple. I just, I don't see the harm that I see is more that we expect so much
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:56.560]   for free from our developers. And everybody here and people watching, no developers,
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:05.760]   no apps that they love, they can't work for free. And they're trying to find ways to monetize what
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:10.960]   they do without pricing themselves out of the market. And right now, pricing themselves out of
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:20.160]   the market could be $1.99. That seems ridiculous to me that that is where we are. That's the point
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:31.840]   that we've come to. And we're also worried about Apple taking a 30% cut or Apple inflating the prices
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:40.880]   of the app store. Meanwhile, Amazon and Facebook are still collecting all of our data and selling
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:51.920]   it. And we kind of let that go. And now we're focused on, well, Apple and the app store. I think
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:57.840]   our priorities in a bunch of different areas are completely wrong right now.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.520]   So, well, we can we can be focused on several things at once.
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.080]   Well, we don't seem to be able to do that.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:11.120]   Well, okay. But other points that I think need to be made are that I do think that if
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:16.720]   I think the ideal situation is not that Apple is forced to shut down the app store,
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:21.520]   it is a huge benefit to consumers. I do believe that there should be a switch buried somewhere
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:26.400]   in settings that if you really, really, really want to do that, if you really want to sideload
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.640]   this app, we will let you do that. But here are some warnings. And also we will turn off
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:39.040]   things like we feel as though we can no longer trust this feature if we are allowing a sideloaded
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:44.240]   app to access it. So we will turn off this make this ID feature unavailable. We will make Apple
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.080]   pay unavailable to this outside app. But if you really want to do it, go ahead and do it because
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:54.000]   again, 1000 bucks, this is my this is my phone, I can do that. The other things that we should
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.760]   include in this conversation is that remember that the app store means that apps developers can
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:04.480]   only do things that Apple is going to allow them to do, which means that a lot of really, really
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:09.600]   cool ideas that have nothing to do with stealing your credit card number will never be permitted
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:16.000]   to happen within an iOS app. So I feel as though if Apple were to allow people developers to sideload
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.240]   apps, in addition to yes, not having to give 30% Apple and probably giving 55% to someone else to
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:28.560]   process the charge, they could really move development of the entire platform forward in little increments
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:35.200]   to those people who feel as though gosh, this is this alternative app launcher is really,
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:41.440]   really cool. Or this alternative, this enhancement to Siri is really, really cooler. Just this ability
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:48.480]   to stick a USB device into this plug and just mounted onto the file system is really, really cool.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:54.080]   That's worth my that's worth my going to the trouble of turning on this feature. So it's there
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.000]   there are a lot of things about this that go above and beyond not wanting to pay 30%.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:05.440]   And there are a lot of issues that go beyond the security of the device. And I just think that I see
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:15.280]   most I see I see the upsides of sideloading apps as being more in quantity and in quality than the
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:22.160]   downsides of keeping the iPhone as a completely locked down device. One test case we have of this
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:29.280]   is Epic Games, which and Fortnite. So Fortnite came out first on iOS, which tells you something,
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:35.680]   by the way, that Epic Games thought that was a more valuable audience. And Apple took 30% of all
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:41.600]   those, you know, in game goods that Epic was selling quite a lot of money, I'm sure.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:48.960]   When Epic had the chance to go on Android, they decided not to go on the Android store. They did,
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:56.400]   in fact, tell users you'll have to click that switch and sideload it. Initially, there was malware
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:04.000]   floated in via the loader. They fixed that. I don't know. I haven't seen any measures of the
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.800]   success or failure of that strategy. But my sense is that it's probably a lot easier to play Fortnite
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:16.240]   on iOS than it is to play it on Android. I mean, I continue to maintain that the like if you want
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.160]   to affect change on the app store, the best way to do that is to do something on Google Play
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.960]   that you just can't do on the app store and make it so successful that people start switching to
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:29.760]   Android just to do that. And so far, a lot of the most popular apps and popular services of all
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:34.320]   either debuted or been launched at the same time, things like Instagram and Uber. Isn't that a real
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.960]   assertive thing changing app? Somebody's going to do that? They could. Absolutely. Like if
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:44.160]   sideloading is immensely so popular on Android that people are leaving iOS and grow to go to
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.440]   Android just to sideload. That is the fastest way you will ever get out.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.360]   Well, that's one of the reasons why Daily Driver is a Samsung Galaxy S10 plus because I
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:56.320]   it's a very simple thing. But I don't want to use Apple's springboard. I want to use
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.720]   I don't know. I want to use Google's launcher. I use a third party launcher, which gives me
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.640]   features I can't get on either of those platforms. That's why I kind of like having both because
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:10.800]   for people who who like the model, like the Nintendo model, like game consoles are like this,
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.400]   you can buy cartridges from different places. Like you can get links to the app store from
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.480]   different websites. But all that stuff is going through Nintendo. And that just it,
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:22.160]   if you don't want to worry about anything, like I understand Andy completely was a thousand
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.280]   dollar thing. It's mine. But there are people like me was like, I just don't want to bother
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:29.920]   with any of this anymore. And I don't want it like to risk like I play with this launcher and now
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:34.320]   I can't get my font off of Comic Sans. And I'm just I've had it with this phone. There's an option
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:38.400]   on the market for you. And if you hate that, there's a different option and enough people hate
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.000]   it. They'll change it. But until then, it's nice. It's nice to sort of have the different options.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.880]   Ben Thompson says, it isn't consumers he's worried about. He says, I do believe developers
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:54.880]   are being harmed by an Apple's policies. And I do believe those policies are illegal. The
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.120]   implication of that though, is that developers who should have the right to sue Apple,
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.320]   that's developers who should have the right not consumers. And as you pointed out,
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:08.080]   Renee, this is all about double jeopardy that the court says only one of the two parties can sue,
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.760]   only one of them has standing. The court has now said consumers have standing.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:17.360]   The majority's argument Ben goes on and say that there would not be a sort of double jeopardy
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.920]   with regard to damages. One of the motivating factors behind Illinois, brick, is not all at all
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:28.080]   compelling. Apple claims that allowing consumers to sue a resulting conflicting claims to a
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:33.120]   common fund, the amount of the alleged overcharge. Apple is incorrect and incidentally,
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.280]   the Supreme Court agreed. This is not a case where multiple parties at different levels at a
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.560]   distribution change are trying to all recover the same pass through overcharge.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:47.600]   Yeah, I think developers have a different axe to grind than consumers. And I will, I think I
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:53.040]   will grant you Jim that consumers benefit by the app store. And because they do have a choice,
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:58.880]   they can go to Android. I don't think the harm to consumers is the case for that is very strong.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:03.680]   I think there is a case though that there's a harm to developers. And clearly, examples like
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:09.440]   Fortnite and Netflix show that some developers are choosing not to give Apple their 30% vig.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:16.800]   No, that's very true. But there's also a lot of benefit to developers and
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.960]   yes, they're giving access to this huge platform.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:28.640]   Devolution get the choice, I guess is the point. Well, if you want to pay Apple's 30%, you should
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:33.840]   you know that that and be in the app store and get the marketing benefits and the security benefits.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.760]   But wouldn't it be nice if a developer had the choice? Maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe the
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.080]   developers should just do what Renee said and write for Android.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:44.640]   Konami code, put in the Konami code every time. If you can't remember the Konami code,
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.320]   you're not responsible enough to unlock your device. Is there some other remedy Apple could
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:53.680]   pursue having to do with maybe zero? Their old one was web apps. Their old one was like,
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.120]   if you don't want to, we have an equally viable alternative for you. It's called HTML apps.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.440]   You can put an icon on the home screen and we see progressive web apps on platforms like
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:05.840]   Microsoft where they have not had success making modern app platforms and they will argue that
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:10.240]   their first class citizens. I will argue that there is still a disparity between the types of apps
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.920]   and performance you can get out of native code versus the web. But Apple's whole thing is like,
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:16.720]   you want to make Playboy? That's fine. Make it a web app. You can't put it on the app.
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:22.240]   Actually, and that maybe that is one Apple remedy, which is to put in better support for
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:28.240]   progressive web apps, better service workers, etc. And Safari so that there can be almost
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:33.280]   parity between an app store app and a progressive web app. I run Ellipurn with open GL.
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:38.880]   I don't know. For instance, we just got an app rejected from Apple TV because we're making
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:44.320]   little apps for our shows and they wouldn't accept an app for iOS today. We just got one
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.600]   accepted finally for hands on tech because we had to take out all the imagery that had
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.840]   anything not Apple, including Windows machines because it's a review show. No Windows machines,
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:56.640]   no Android devices can be shown. Okay, fine. We did that. But now I don't know how we're going to get
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:01.440]   iOS today in there because they said, well, you can't have an app that's called iOS today.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:05.280]   I think we're going to have to call asterisk today or something like that.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:10.000]   I understand that's Apple's trademark. I understand, although they've allowed us to call that show
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.320]   that for years. We've been Mac break weekly for 15 years. I'm not, I don't want to cause any trouble.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.720]   We had the same problem with the iPhone blog. That's one of the reasons we ended up changing
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:27.520]   the name so often. Yeah, so it's bad for you. It's hard for you as a developer. It's also hard
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:33.600]   for our listeners who want that app on the Apple TV. It is after all and app singing the praises
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:39.920]   of iOS. So I would say there's benefit all around, but that's the rules. So that's what you do.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:47.360]   That's how it is. What was my point? Well, I guess that that's a case where the developer
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:55.280]   us is hurt by Apple's rules. And if we had a progressive web app, we could call it iOS today.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:00.400]   And I was Apple. The app making could be a progressive web app. It's not a very impressive
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:06.000]   progressive web app. So I guess the solution I would love Apple to do is make progressive web apps
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.360]   first class citizens as Microsoft and Google are both doing, put better service workers on iOS,
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:16.880]   make them first class citizens, give us the ability, for instance, to store settings in between
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:22.960]   sessions, which right now you can't do. And that to me would eliminate the harm to developers of
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:28.480]   a closed app store. Netflix could have a progressive web app or Amazon, like comics,
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:34.960]   comics,ology, comics, yeah, yeah. And then they could sell, you know, because it's just a website,
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:40.960]   they could sell it just as they do now. If you are using Android or audible on the Apple store,
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:45.120]   you have to buy your audible books through the website and then download them into the store.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.360]   If you're doing on an Android, you can buy it within the app.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:54.080]   Yep. And you don't have to worry about arbitrary code execution because JavaScript is a supported
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:58.640]   element. Yeah, PWA, I think could be made completely secure. I don't, I don't, I think there's a way to
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:04.800]   do that. So I mean, it won't have any vulnerability that a website would have. Yeah, that's true.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:10.400]   But Apple secures Safari pretty well. Yeah. That's sure, by the way, way, Apple does not let you
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:16.720]   have persistent storage for PWA's, by the way. But they feel like they could sandbox that per
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.760]   instance. Like if you started the instance, it gets its own little secure box, it doesn't get
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:24.880]   to yeah, there'd be ways to get to other instances. Yeah. So there are, so in other words, even off
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.160]   the top of our heads here, we've come up with a few solutions that Apple could pursue. I'm sure
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:33.760]   that some of those will be pursued in the light of this Supreme Court decision.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:39.680]   It's rare that a company, the size of apples or half the size of apples, let's it get so far that
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:44.960]   they are required by the court to do something that they don't want to do. Usually this thing
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:51.280]   ends with some sort of an agreement where Apple is allowed to make some changes that the court
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:56.800]   thinks are appropriate and are certainly well within Apple's ability to negotiate for, and then
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:01.360]   it goes away. So this, I don't think we'll see a huge, huge change in this. I'm just glad that the
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.440]   conversations like this one are happening. Yeah.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.360]   Any other thoughts before we move on? I think we've exactly this one.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.600]   To talk about lavender phones with Andy at some point. I'm sorry. That's all.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:24.000]   All I'll say is that like the day that I can, I can activate that switch on iOS and suddenly have
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.480]   like a one word processor that allows me to use a Bluetooth mouse for cursor control and for
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:38.400]   user interface, I will sideload that app like like that. Anyway, yeah, you might with iOS 13,
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:43.520]   right? In fact, I just got the bridge keyboard here, which I really like. It makes that makes
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:47.600]   an iPad look just like a MacBook, doesn't it? You didn't kill Jason Snell and take his, did you?
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:53.440]   No, no, I had Kickstarter it. And it finally came, which they're still taking pre-orders on the
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.680]   bridge website, but I think that means they're very close to shipping it. Let me log into my
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:03.280]   iPad so you can see that it is in fact an iPad, not a MacBook. But notice they've got this nice
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:09.120]   wrist rest where a trackpad would just be so nice. But of course, there's no support.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:13.760]   Accessibility feature. Yeah, there's no support for that on iOS, but if this is going to be a big
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:18.240]   problem for bridge, if in iOS 13 has rumored, there is mouse and trackpad support suddenly.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:22.080]   In the iPad Pro, I'm going to have to buy a new bridge keyboard.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:27.360]   I just plug in a mouse. Yeah, I guess that doesn't it doesn't it sicken you that you spent all that
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:33.760]   money on like a portable, a portable keyboard solution. And the case like there's almost a full
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:39.120]   millimeter of travel. It's disgusting. I know. And you know, it's a wobble in their seat. They're
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:44.480]   not they're not stiff like a butterfly keyboard. It's actually pretty usable. You might get that
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.400]   fixed later this year too. It's pretty it's pretty. That's spoiler. You think that's the rumor? Is that
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:53.360]   true? I might have put a video up about it a few days ago. Yeah, there's. All right. All right.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:59.600]   Okay. No, stop the presses. We're going to hold on hold that thought. I want to take a break and
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:06.240]   then I want to hear more because well, and there's an interesting Michael Sai, who is a long time
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:13.760]   Apple developer in his blog. He's the guy who did the anti spam solution that I used for years
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.720]   on iOS. Spam sive. Spam sive, isn't it great?
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:25.600]   That was one of my favorite apps of all time. Absolutely. God, what a lifesaver. So Michael,
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:29.600]   many non-hinek and email stop. Michael's talking in his blog about people
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:40.400]   shocking, leaving Apple for Windows now that there's a Linux kernel in Windows. I think I
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:45.200]   this must be a bad dream. I must be I must have dreamt all this because there's no way.
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:54.080]   Bill Gates is spinning Linux and Windows and developers abandoning Apple to use. Oh, it can't
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:59.520]   be anyway. We'll talk about that in just a second. There is, I think, a little rebellion among
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:05.760]   some of us who just can't bear that butterfly keyboard. But first a word from Zipper Cruder,
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:12.240]   if you are hiring, you know that this is the hardest job in a business, but it's probably the
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.800]   most important job of a business because honestly a business is that's what a business is. It's
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:22.640]   people. It's the people you hire. That's what makes the business. There's there's nothing else.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:29.280]   A business is a bunch of people with this with this common goal, a common aim. The right person
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:34.080]   can take you to the moon. The wrong person can crash the rocket ship. So you got to do a good
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:39.680]   job and yet it's challenging. You know, perhaps there's a perfect person somewhere out there in
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:46.720]   the mist for that job opening. But where? Which job site do they use? Which of the million resumes
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:51.760]   you're looking through has that right person? How do you review them? How do you? Zipper Cruder

[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:09.600]   job boards and also social media like Twitter and Facebook. So right there, you're cutting through
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:13.680]   the fog, getting your posting out to the maximum number of people, giving you the best chance of

[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.560]   Cruder. And they look for people with the right experience and then they send them a note saying,
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:35.200]   "Hey, you should apply to this job." They invite them to apply to your job. It's one of the reasons
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.280]   four out of five employers who post on Zipper Cruder get a quality candidate through the site
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:48.560]   within 24 hours. Our experience has been even better. Lisa was breakfast. Our bookkeeper had
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:52.240]   given us two weeks notice and Lisa said, "I'm going to have to do her work in two weeks if I
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:58.080]   can't find somebody." I said, "Lisa, this is a chance to use Zipper Cruder. This is breakfast."
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:03.440]   She says, "Oh, yeah, post it." Before lunch, in about an actually about an hour or two,
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:09.600]   her first she got her first applicant. She said, "Oh, this person's good. This is really good."
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:15.120]   Then another one. Then before lunch, we had three qualified applicants. That's the magic of Zipper
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:20.080]   Cruder. And oh, it's better than just people calling you or filling your inbox. It all goes in the

[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.720]   Cruder is the smartest way to hire. Thank you, Zipper Cruder. So...
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:22.400]   Alio, before we go on, I was just reading the Ticketmaster is now nervous. The same Supreme Court
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:28.800]   decision could apply to them. Oh, artists and Ticketmaster. If there was ever a company that
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:36.880]   deserves to be sued. Yeah, really. You buy tickets at Ticketmaster and they say, "Oh, and by the way,
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:44.640]   here's your $48 service trip." What? They're going to have to find a judge in a jury that has never
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:55.760]   ever bought a ticket for anything. Unpossible. Don't get me started. So we went to a Broadway
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:01.520]   show, the Harry Potter show, that does not use paper tickets. They require you buy it on Ticketmaster
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:06.640]   online and then have the barcode on your phone. That's the only way you can get in. I guess maybe
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:12.720]   to save, I don't know, maybe there's piracy issues. I don't know. But of course, Lisa wants her
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:18.080]   ticket, so I send it to her. It doesn't work. I can't get my barcode up. We get to the front door.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:22.320]   I said, "I bought it on Ticketmaster. I can't... The show's about to start."
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:27.120]   I don't want to miss the beginning. They said, "You have to go to the box office. They'll print one for
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:32.560]   you." So we have to go around the corner. What did I pay the service fee for? Nada.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:42.800]   I know this is all about the human psychology. But just last week, I wanted to go see something
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:49.520]   where the ticket price was $50 and then go to check out and it's $72. And I suddenly thought,
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:57.600]   "I don't want to..." If the ticket price had been $75 or $72 for the $3 fee, I would have paid it.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:02.880]   I know it's the same amount of money. But there comes... It's just something about your ego says that,
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:11.920]   "If you tell me that you need me to eat dirt, maybe I'll eat dirt, but now you're making me
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:17.280]   eat dirt and call it ice cream." I feel as though that's abusive and that's an abusive relationship.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:28.960]   I agree with the Andy. It's crazy that that's what happens to us on Cheka. Mentally, you plan
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:34.880]   on a certain amount. And then when you get there and it's nowhere near the amount, imagine if you had
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:40.800]   a boss or tickets. Then you're looking at a hundred bucks or more.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:49.280]   This is going to now start a whole spate of people thinking, "Hey, who's rent seeking?
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:53.440]   Everybody's rent seeking. Who can we sue? Customers and developers.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.240]   Customers and artists." I didn't like that TV show. I'm suing that for...
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:00.400]   Because everybody's rent seeking, right? That's the new thing.
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:08.000]   I will settle for... If I could just key the car of one executive at Ticketmaster.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:16.960]   I just want them to know that they've been inconvenienced and it was because of the business
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.920]   that they're in that people hated them. That's all. I know it's me that I know it's right.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:30.480]   I heard the other day that somebody sued the lottery because over 20 years of buying tickets
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:37.760]   for the lottery, they were never told that they wouldn't win. What? And they were never told
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:47.120]   that the odds were so high against them winning. So they sued for three years profits from the
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:53.440]   lottery plus half a billion dollars. What? The coffee might be hot.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:44:00.480]   Learning this coffee might be hot. Now they lost because in fact the odds were printed on the back
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:04.800]   of each ticket. They are on every ticket. Yeah. It's just that people don't understand probability.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:16.240]   What does that mean? Reminds me of a sketch on Mr. Show where the government was sued
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:20.960]   by someone who doesn't like... By someone who made a lot of money and then lost it all.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:24.320]   And the government was forced to put a disclaimer on every piece of paper
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:28.800]   currency saying that this dollar will no longer be yours after you spend it.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:35.440]   By the way, I just want to finish up on this bridge keyboard. I really like it. It's a very
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:41.600]   nice keyboard. It really is all going to depend on what Apple does with iOS 13 because I do want
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:45.840]   more. This could be a great lap. iPad could be a great laptop. At least now I have a good keyboard.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:52.400]   Backlit. It's got all the function keys. It's really a joy to type on. There is one negative.
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:57.360]   It's got a giant battery in it because it's a Bluetooth keyboard. It doesn't use a smart
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:05.600]   connector. And they say it'll last a year. Obviously they put a massive battery in it. It weighs a
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:11.360]   pound and a half. It more than doubles the weight of the iPad Pro. And it makes it twice as thick.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:16.800]   So if you want your iPad Pro to weigh twice as much and be twice as thick, this is the product for you.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.080]   Well, you should do it. You always put two iPads together and then they can make a Lenovo.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:24.320]   Yeah. Did you see that? They're going to do a folding screen.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:32.320]   That's actually very interesting. I don't think foldable screens are durable enough yet to
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:37.360]   maybe want to spend more than $80 more than any amount of money that I would care to lose.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:45.520]   Honestly, Saran. Yeah, exactly. But it was the interim. So when it's closed, it is a sealed.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.800]   It's like having a tablet where you don't have to have a tablet cover on it because when it's
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:54.560]   closed and it's in your bag, like the screen isn't being exposed. You unfold it and you have a full
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:59.600]   sized tablet or full sized window device. But the really what really intrigued me was they have
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:04.640]   a when it's sort of half unfolded and you've got you're holding in your hands like a book,
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:08.560]   you will have like a left screen and a right screen sort of configuration.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:12.800]   So you can either use it as a read like as a book reader, we're seeing two facing pages
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:17.120]   or you can have like here is the on the left side here is the thing that I'm reading on the right
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:22.320]   side. Here's a notes app where I'm taking notes with my with my pen. It's it just goes to show that
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:28.640]   as silly and premature as I think that every single foldable device we've seen yet is it really does
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:36.560]   show it really has open up a difference between after 20 years of no longer having just a keyboard
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:41.680]   and a screen separated by a hinge here is a lightweight keyboard and a screen separated by a hinge.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:47.040]   Here is a games games quality huge keyboard and screen separated by a hinge.
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:52.400]   So this is a prototype, but here's a video from the verge of what it looks like.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:55.680]   You imagine Apple like three years ago saying, Hey Jim, come take a look at this thing.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.440]   We're going to call the iPhone 10. It's a design verification task unit, but just come
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:03.680]   make a video of it. Yeah, that's crazy, isn't it? But that's the modern world we live in.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:08.320]   You know, Lenovo says, just what do you think? You know, tell us what you think.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:13.120]   I like the moleskin. It doesn't have a real keyboard. That's the problem. I mean, you could
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:18.160]   I guess use it as separate keyboard. It's shipped with a Lenovo keyboard that you can put together
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:23.280]   and make like a third a quote unquote 13 inch laptop. Yeah, see, but that that too is interesting.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:30.240]   That the I used to have a if you moved into a motocross race course. Is that me?
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:35.520]   Who is that? Oh, I know it is. It's terrible. Are they chipping the wood again outside?
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:39.920]   Oh, man, I muted it. I didn't think you could hear that.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:48.720]   It sounds like motocross is going on in your living room. I'm sorry. I did. I have been muting
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:53.280]   it. Maybe I didn't read it. We could do it from here. Probably that's that's a better idea.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:56.640]   Just wave if you want to say something.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:06.640]   I had the mic muted for the past few minutes while they were, you know, buzz sawing my
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:12.320]   trees or something. It's not it's done now, I guess, or at least I apologize.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:22.400]   So one of the reasons I have a Lenovo laptop, which I like a lot is as a developer, I just I
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:26.560]   just can't stand the Mac keyboard. But the Mac is definitely the best development tool. And by the
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:32.400]   way, not just for iOS and Mac, because you've got BSD, you've got Linux and under the hood,
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:38.320]   you've got not Linux, Unix under the hood, you've got a real terminal, although I use iterm,
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:45.120]   which is a fantastic terminal. You can install Haskell or Perl or Python or closure or whatever.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:49.360]   You know, I've got I'm running e-max on it for my list development. It's really nice.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:58.320]   But Michael Sy on his blog, one of the great Mac developers, quotes Microsoft saying they'll be a
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:08.960]   full Linux kernel coming soon to Windows 10 as part of its WSL to Windows Linux
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:15.760]   hybrid beast with two backs. Sy says, what a time to be alive. Does this mean that
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:21.040]   Microsoft will now ship more up to date Unix tools than Apple? And a number of comments from
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:29.760]   all over the internet. And some of them from Apple developers saying, Hmm, Marco Arment,
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:33.760]   this perspective should be most worrisome to Apple. The MacBook Pro seems designed for other
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:39.600]   people's needs, not mine, especially coming from developers, which Apple has said are the
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:44.000]   largest category of pro users. I have to point out no one's ever going to use Windows 10 to develop
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:50.880]   for the Mac or iOS. Yeah. So Apple's kind of got that lock in. One of the one of the comments I
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:57.120]   enjoyed here. See if I could find it was somebody's never going to happen. Kyle Howell's unrealistic
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:04.480]   WWDC wish list. Gatekeeper for iOS relaxed app store restrictions with new categories like Dev
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:12.320]   Stools, UI kit for Mac uncrippled, redesigned and relaxed non, redesigned and relaxed notarization
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:16.080]   system. We were talking about that a couple of weeks ago, pro user automation and performance
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:20.880]   focus, a sign that easy things should be easy, hard things should be possible, has been deeply
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:28.240]   and culturally accepted into Apple iOS and Mac OS. Kyle writes, the current philosophy is easy,
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:30.880]   things should be easy and anything more is a security risk.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:36.320]   I like accurate. Brad, Brad, charcut.
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:42.320]   Brad says, after years of endless jokes, 2019 is truly finally shaping up to be the year of the
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:47.120]   Linux desktop. That's Steven Sinofsky actually by a Steven Sinofsky.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.800]   No, again, the fastest way to get Apple to change something is to make people start leaving
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.440]   them and then they're going to just do anything possible to fix that.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:57.680]   I mean, my response to Linux kernel on Windows is why don't you just put Linux on your damn
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:04.080]   computer and be done with it. Then you get a real Linux, a real kernel and all the tools.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:09.840]   And it's a lovely environment. I'm very happy with Linux on my Lenovo. But now you said
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:14.080]   something that intrigues me because I do love Mac books and I do love Macs and I have
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:21.120]   a deep love for Mac OS if they would just fix that keyboard. So what are you here?
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:26.880]   I think it's because I saw other people talking about it and I saw Gee talk about it
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:32.640]   two other day, but the scuttlebutt is that along with the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which is basically
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:36.880]   the 15-inch with that with smaller bezels, which lets you get closer to the 17-inch screen.
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:42.720]   So the 16-inch MacBook Pro, it'll come with a new keyboard, quote unquote fixed keyboard.
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:47.440]   And you never know how far to believe this stuff, but the rumors it'll be more like the
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:52.800]   magic keyboard, which has very low profile scissor switches on it and they will even fix the inverted.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:56.080]   Like right now there's no inverted T on the arrow keys, which just drives people out of their
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:59.840]   minds because they're absolutely should be one and that that's on the list of things that'll be
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:04.240]   fixed as well. Would that be an S-June?
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:09.760]   I mean, they have done MacBook Pros in June. They have done MacBook Pros in October. So I guess
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:15.040]   it just depends on how close it is to being released. I got $8,000 burning a hole in my pocket ready to
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:22.560]   buy a MacBook Pro. And what about the Mac Pro? It's been very quiet around the Mac Pro.
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:28.000]   Preview with WDC is apparently the aim that it has to be at a certain point where, I mean,
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.800]   they've been burned before by showing things off before they're ready. So part of it wants them
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:36.720]   to wait. But also this is the big developer show. And if you're going to ship this year,
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.080]   like with the iMac Pro in 2016, was it 2017?
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:45.440]   But how long does it take to develop a computer even from scratch? It's been two years.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:52.640]   I mean, the problem is that they're bandwidth for Mac is like they're only making like two or
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:57.920]   three iPhones a year. The Mac is a way bigger product category. Even iPads, now iPads are big
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:02.400]   all of a sudden, but they were only making one or two iPads every 18 months, which is not a hard
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:08.880]   thing to do. But there's like five, six Macs that they should be updating every year. And even if
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:12.960]   it's just new processors, there's a lot that goes into like the, like you can't just shove
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:17.200]   the processor in the old computer because then you get the thermal problems that we've been seeing.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:20.560]   So there's a lot of stuff they have to do. And they have to go back and finally fix that damn
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:25.520]   keyboard. That pushes something else out by the amount of time it takes that team to fix that
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:29.520]   keyboard. So it's really like a prioritization thing, but they have gotten better over the last
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:33.600]   few years. Like there was just no excuse for all that stuff lingering for as long as it did.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:38.640]   But now we have the MacBook Air finally, the Mac Mini finally, so many finally send the Mac Pro.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:44.160]   The only concern is that from some people, they really just want what they have fixed. Like they
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:49.600]   would just really like the 2016, 2015 MacBook Pro back with modern processors. And they really
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:55.120]   just want the cheese grater back with modern processors. And Apple's sort of like, no, we can
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:04.400]   do better. And you're like, please don't. Yeah, there's actually, I think last week there was a,
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:11.680]   someone had a render here it is that this is the kind of kind of Phoenix. Yeah, not, not true.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:18.320]   This is bogus, obviously. Yeah, exactly. Although the shopping list on the left looks pretty good,
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:25.920]   a Xeon W cascade lake, T2 security chip, and X, I don't know what the Apple X2 accelerator would be.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:40.240]   DDR 5, SODIM RAM, three double wide PCIe four slots, single or dual AMD Fire Pro X,
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:46.880]   or as long as we're imagining things, how about an Nvidia Quattro RTX PTO?
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:53.600]   Never going to happen. Thunderbolt three, eight of them. Two HDMI.
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:57.840]   My thing was like, I know the Nvidia, like there's there's still reasons why Apple and
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:02.000]   Nvidia don't get along. And most of the comes down to their both big and accessible and proud.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:07.440]   But I would like them to get along just enough to officially support EGPU because then Apple
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:12.240]   can buy from the AMD for their computers. There's no problem. And people who want the latest,
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:16.800]   biggest, greatest CUDA core thumping Nvidia card they want can just buy it,
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:20.800]   throw it in an enclosure, put it on, and buy a new one every year. That's really what they want.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:24.560]   You can do that now, but the drivers don't exist. So you have to mess.
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:30.000]   Yes. Yeah. The other nice thing about Nvidia support is I would make the Hackintosh community
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:36.320]   very, very happy if there were drivers for Nvidia everywhere. But yeah, it's this, there's so many
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:44.160]   things that give Apple such a great advantage that also in some cases become a big problem.
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:50.400]   The fact that they are the only makers of Mac hardware means that every time they can't just put
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:57.360]   components together in a box, just not in the same way that anybody can go to Newegg or
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:03.760]   a flea market with about 800 to $1,000 and just buy components and build a really, really good
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:08.880]   Windows 10 box. This is going to be the only machine that's going to be on the market as a pro
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:13.920]   Mac machine. And they're going to have to support it for years and years and years and years. So I
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:19.360]   really do think that even if they were weren't, even if they wanted to call it like the Mac Pro
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:23.200]   legacy edition, where they just said, you know what, we still got the tooling for the cheese
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:28.640]   grater. We can put together something that is easy for us to support as the original cheese
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:33.360]   grater and just build it with modern components. And that will at least keep people in the family
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:38.080]   for the four or five years that we want to spend creating the idealized Mac Pro.
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:44.640]   But unfortunately, this is just not how they can do a project like that. It's just institutional.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:49.920]   Again, if it works so well, yeah, exactly. Pulling him off the new one to make the old one.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:56.400]   Hire us again. I'm resting to see how the Mac Pro comes out of this too.
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:04.240]   I mean, that is a very powerful machine, but it's not, you know, as modular or upgradable as what
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:11.200]   the Mac Pro supposedly will be. So that to me is going to be a very interesting trade off.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:16.560]   Is it possible to get one of the new Mac minis and actually it's faster than the iMac Pro,
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:22.800]   which has not been updated? I feel like it is. It's so different because the Zion chips already
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:28.400]   are generations behind the consumer chips. Like there's Skylake still and there are the Cascade
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:34.160]   ones coming out. But they're really for multi-core and there's a limit to the amount of multi-core
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:37.920]   you have in the Mac minis still, or at least the enterprise. And also you have the ECC,
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:42.480]   like there's just so many sort of heavy-duty components that you get.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:53.360]   I just got the Alex Lindsey, one and a half Alex Rico Theta Z1 camera. Alex made me buy.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:58:01.840]   He made me do it. You saw him do that on the show. He twisted my arm. But Rico does make stitching
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:08.240]   software for Mac and Windows. And of course, I'm going to do it on my iMac Pro because of the
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:13.600]   multi-threading and all that. I hope it takes advantage of all that. But when you're doing
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:20.080]   stuff like stitching 360 degree 4K video, you do want some horsepower under the hood. There are
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:25.280]   times when you really need that. I was watching Jonathan Morrison's final cut demos where he was
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:31.040]   doing, I think he was pulling it off the Arri Alexa or just looking at Marquez and they're throwing
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:37.280]   8K red RAW files around and final cut like it's like a 10 normal video. I'm making sure you need
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:45.440]   the horsepower clearly. And those people know they do and $5,000 is not or if you beef it up,
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:52.480]   $15,000 is not too much to spend. Let me just take a picture of you guys, by the way.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:57.360]   There you go. Smile. Alex made so much off that affiliate revenue that he took a vacation.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:06.800]   Oh, son of a... I'm suing him! Talk about Red Seiken. Oh my god. Yeah, where did he go?
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:11.440]   He got me to buy this and then he disappeared. Son of a gun.
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:16.880]   So Apple sell a monorail to the next town.
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:23.200]   But about us drunken slobs, he'll be giving cushy jobs. Monorail.
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:32.800]   Let's talk Apple Pay. Apple has announced that... What is it? One touch Apple Pay now is...
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:40.560]   or no touch Apple Pay is coming to the world. Somebody needs to explain this. It's... I guess
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:49.520]   it's going to support NFC. Apple Pay NFC stickers. And part of this is because the new bird scooters,
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:57.200]   you just walk up to the scooter, tap it, and Apple Pay will pay it. No app, no face recognition,
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:03.680]   nothing. That's a disaster and that waiting to happen. Thank you for taking a scooter ride.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:07.440]   I didn't take a scooter ride. I need to see the demo because I'm not a scooter.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:14.720]   It's hard to understand what model they're like, whether it's an existing account, then it just
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:22.160]   pulls off your... It goes through existing... I have beautiful stuff. There's a new TV app and
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:25.840]   you can just to click to subscribe to shows and people are worried that their kids are going to
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:31.040]   subscribe to all these different channels. But it's for free trials and then you still have to
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.680]   author... But it's hard to understand just based on the quick demos, what's really going on until
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:39.680]   you get down in front of it and sort of walk yourself through the transaction step by step.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:47.440]   Yeah. I really wish this had been an Apple demo. They'd really done it like a keynote demo
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:53.280]   because my first thought is, "Okay, I'm a bad person. I'm going to make up a whole bunch of NFC
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:59.520]   stickers and put them on the top of the NFC stickers that are on the bird scooters that don't
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:04.880]   auto pay, but it will take you to what looks like a very official looking bird side. Oh, we really
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:10.400]   do need you to revalidate. Could you possibly type in your credit card number and we'll get
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:16.000]   you right through." So I don't know... Not that I think that this is a weak thing that they're doing.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.880]   I just don't understand how it works yet. I'm sure that...
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:23.200]   I'm sure that I'm really happy. Well, I'm sure Apple's... I'm not going to chop them with you.
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:29.760]   Yeah. I'm sure Apple's thought this out. I mean, if nobody... I mean, Apple's number one in security.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:34.720]   This was announced at an event called Transact, a conference for mobile payment technologies in
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:41.040]   the Las Vegas. It was Apple's vice president of Apple Pay Jennifer Bailey doing the demo and she
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:48.000]   announced that the company's partnering with bird scooters, Bonobo's clothing store, and pay-by-phone
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.360]   parking meters for the initial rollout. She also announced that inside the wallet app,
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:56.480]   users will soon be able to sign up for loyalty cards with one tap.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:04.720]   So yeah, and it's not clear exactly how it's... I mean, there's like Oyster where you can just
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:08.560]   tap and go through like sideways and all that stuff has worked out. I just don't understand what
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:14.080]   the model is here yet. A lot of it is because below a certain purchase amount, the system
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:19.200]   doesn't even bother validating until the transaction is complete. So they figure that for...
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:26.160]   When I buy my plane donut and Dunkin' Donuts at Back Bay Station, it goes through immediately because
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:31.040]   they figure that no one's going to try to steal like a dollar or nine cents. And if they do,
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:37.440]   they have my ID, they'll catch up with me later, or they'll try to make it right later on.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.920]   I don't know what the threshold is, but it's something like...
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:40.960]   20 bucks. Yeah.
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:45.600]   Yeah. Or it might be even less than that. Basically, I think the metric is a cup of coffee.
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.400]   So this is America, so that could be 20 bucks.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:55.600]   Welcome to the strawberry frappuccino with the pineapple twist.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:02.240]   As a matter of fact, there is actually a scam going on where someone will have...
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:08.000]   On the subway, we'll have like a disguise NFC reader, a point of purchase reader,
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.640]   and they will just sort of sneak up to you and just like bump into you and just like tap your phone.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:19.120]   It does. I've heard people say that this exists, but I don't know how they would be holding it
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:24.160]   closely enough that the actual transaction would go through. But it just goes to show that for a
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:28.960]   dollar and for a dollar and 10 cents, they're really not willing to... It's got to cost them a lot
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:34.720]   more money to prevent theft of dollar and 10 cents versus just refunding the money when they
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:39.040]   think that you've been scammed. The details are it's bank specific. As you know, your MasterCard
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:45.040]   or VisaCard is backed by a bank. So the bank that backs it decides. In some discount stores and
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:51.840]   supermarkets, VisaCards for transactions of up to $50, $50, $50 without requiring a pin or card
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:57.360]   holder signature. In other words, just tap and go. MasterCard features a similar limit for debit
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:04.320]   card customers. Not all banks allow it. It's a hundred in Canada. You can tap to pay for
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:10.640]   anything up to $100. American Express has no limit in many situations. The only problem we have is
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:15.200]   that the interface, even though the interface notes $100, it'll still present the tap thing
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:19.840]   over $100. Like $150. Tap to pay. You're like, "Oh, great. Sorry. Not accepted." Just fix that at
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:24.080]   the interface level. Yeah. I mean, that what they could do is say, "Okay, here now you need to give
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:28.000]   us a pin because it's over a hundred bucks." That would not be a weird way to do it.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:34.080]   So that's why it's confusing. A lot of times in the airport, I'll buy a sandwich before I get
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:40.480]   on the plane. They just say, "Go ahead. You're done." It's like, "You don't want me to sign it or anything?"
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:44.800]   No. But you don't ever know. You never know. It just depends. I'm shocked in the US. Like,
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:48.480]   they'll say, "I start to walk away and they go, "So you have to sign." Like, "What? What century is
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:52.640]   this? What does that do?" Yeah. And by the way, you could sign it any way you want it. I don't know
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:57.200]   if you ever... You go, "Whoa, whoa, whoa." And last time a waiter took my card away, I haven't seen
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:02.800]   that since the '80s. Oh. We're savages down here, south of the road. You feel like you're not
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:07.200]   chasing them down and tackling them. Give me my card! Yes! How are you going?
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:13.920]   For those of you who've never been outside the US, in most other countries, the waiter comes to
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:20.320]   you with a thing that he swipes in front of you and prints out the thing. You don't even swipe
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:26.000]   anymore. He brings it to you, you tap it and he walks away. Right. Some day we'll live in your
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.640]   future, your Canadian future. Yeah. Our frozen flooding Canadian future.
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:38.000]   Since we're light on topics this week, can I just complain that we're in that horrible in-between
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:46.400]   transition where almost every point of purchase area that I enter has some sort of a screen and
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:53.040]   a chip and card reader, but only, let's say, 70% of them take tap to pay. And so I'm kind of embarrassed
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:57.920]   to even try tap to pay because I'll be the person who's holding up the line by doing something stupid.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:05.120]   I correct this behavior after about two and a half months of not knowing what to do at this one
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:10.800]   particular store. I still put out a little sticker. Every time I fly, I print out a boarding pass
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:17.360]   because I don't want to be the one guy who's got his QR code and his Apple watch. It's going like this.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:21.200]   I do it for security now because there's so many horror stories about devices being
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:26.720]   demanding passwords at the border. That's interesting. You want to wipe all your devices before you
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:30.960]   go anywhere. No, because apparently the laws cover that. I just walk to the paper boarding pass
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:36.240]   of my own business. Isn't that? I've been bombed back to the Stone Age and I'm happy.
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:44.640]   It's really a light day. Purple phones, Leo. Purple phones. Oh, you want to talk to Andy?
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:52.720]   Did you get a purple-ish Pixel 3A? No, I'm deciding which one to order, but I got to say that if
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:58.080]   the rumors about the new colors for the new phones could become true, that's another point in the
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:02.320]   that's another point in the points raised to get me to switch back to iPhone as my daily driver.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:09.920]   I saw 10R2 with purple and green, Leo. Yeah, and I mean real purple. I'm disappointed in the
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:15.520]   Pixel because they should have just called it lilac. It's kind of like a pinkish lilac. It's a
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:20.960]   good world. This is 2019. We don't have to be so caught up in. Oh, no, we can't sell pink
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:25.360]   phones to everybody. Oh, I'll buy a pink phone. But yes, I will also buy the hell out of a purple
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:29.840]   phone. Do you think this is bad? Especially if they will give me an option where I can replace the
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:38.560]   Apple logo with the Prince logo. I would buy two of those. Purple phone, purple phone.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:43.760]   And that actually also fits in with the rumor there'll be three lenses. So they'll be like
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:47.520]   like in like in his last series of albums where he's wearing those three lens,
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:54.240]   three lens, there you go. Oh, I forget what it was. It might have been Taloza Tech, but someone was
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:08:00.800]   someone was posting a picture of the yellow iPhone 10, iPhone 11R with Pikachu showing how
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:04.960]   it looks like his two eyes and open mouth, Leo. So you can get the yellow phone and it'll just
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:09.680]   I do like with the Ryan Reynolds. Yeah. That's how you see it. Yeah.
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:14.400]   By the way, have you seen it? Yes. I took my God kids on the weekend. See, everybody I ask,
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:20.400]   they go to see it, but it's always, but I took the kids. No, so they were the only ones who would
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:26.800]   go with me like full disclosure. That's the truth. They took uncle Renee. It was cute, but my God
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:29.920]   kids both said, Oh, I like that way more than I thought I would. You know, they weren't expecting
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:33.840]   much because they've been burned by video game movies before. I think that's the Ryan Reynolds is
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:37.520]   darn charming. Yeah. And Deadpool being Pikachu was just amazing.
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:44.720]   Explain to me why Mark German tweeted a photo of shards of glass to talk about the different
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:48.480]   colors. Mark is tweeting a lot. I wonder if Bloomberg takes too long to get his stuff up.
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:50.480]   Yeah. He's just tweeting it. Those are like,
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:55.280]   those are just broken off pieces of the back plate from the iPhone 10R showing some of the
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:00.720]   different colors. They're pretty. Yeah. And then Ben Gescan on Twitter, recolored them
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:04.640]   closer to what he thought that they were and took some of the the render. Yeah, because this might
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:10.320]   be darker when you had a backing on it or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. The rendering is probably
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.080]   give you a better, a better sense of it. I like to green. I think that's kind of pretty.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:18.400]   It's all about that purple, though. I mean, the green looks like the Hulk. That's fine,
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:25.680]   but I like the purple. I need a darker purple. Yeah. I've heard that. There you go. I've got
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:30.000]   two. I see the back, Jim, because the sides on the on the 10 are very different than the back
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.760]   plate. So I'm waiting to see what that back plate looks like. Yeah. I bought the
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:40.880]   product Red 10R and I love it. I just read it. Beautiful. But you're always put these
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:45.280]   things in a case. So the clear case though, I mean, it still looks really good in a clear case.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:49.600]   Yeah. You like to live dangerously, Mr. Del Rimble. I've never used a case. Well,
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:55.040]   actually, that's not true. The only time I used a case was with one of the older iPhones. I
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:59.760]   when I would travel and the battery wasn't as good, I'd use a Mophie case.
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:06.320]   But other than that, I don't use a case of batteries. I use a smart battery for that now.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:11.360]   Copy 386 says the reason Mark Gurman tweeted those shards is so we'll know what our phone looks
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:19.680]   like when we break it. I bought when I bought, I don't know. I just thought, oh, why not? Let's see
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:25.440]   how much money I could spend on a Samsung Galaxy S10 plus. So I got the ceramic back.
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:32.320]   Was that the 5G? No, no. They didn't have the 5G yet. And there's no 5G carrier even within a
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:37.520]   thousand miles of it. It's not the point, Leo. It's like Bitcoin. You've just got to get it.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:41.360]   It's half the average. Well, it's as dumb as buying a ceramic back for an extra couple hundred bucks,
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:44.960]   especially since I carry it in a case all the time. But it is lovely.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:50.880]   Once in a while, I'll just take it out and go. Oh, yeah, that's pretty. I suppose, though,
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:57.280]   how do you keep from dropping it, Jim? You just hold on tight. I dare drop. I don't think about it.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:03.680]   If I think about dropping it, I'd probably drop it because I think I don't even think about it.
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.440]   Probably the back wouldn't break, but that doesn't mean the front's any less thoramic
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:13.760]   shadows, glass cracks, plastic, plastic splits and metal bends. I mean, like, it's just material
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:20.960]   science, Leo. You can't win. As soon as my phone stops to drop, my beard shuts down and just
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:28.320]   grabs it. It reaches out. I know there's tentacles in that beard. I got just asking around. And
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:33.040]   apparently the cameras are arrayed the way they are on the back because there's some mathematical
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.760]   advantage to having all of the different, like the telephoto, the wide angle and the
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:43.520]   ultra wide angle, all within the same, all at the exact same distance apart.
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:48.320]   So we think that those images are actually accurate.
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:57.040]   So these are the, because they're molds, right? So I guess, I don't know.
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:01.920]   Is that everything? We've had the three stages of Leo. We've had the molds.
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.720]   We've had the prototypes. We've had the plates.
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:10.800]   And it does come from Mark Gurman. So it must be true.
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.680]   I mean, why you just tweeted out?
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:19.520]   The arrangement is like a triangle kind of. There's two and then there's one in the middle
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:24.080]   between it. And then what are these little things? That's the flash and the microphone.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:27.760]   Microphone. Okay. And then so this would be the
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:32.400]   10 R gets to the max. Oh, this is, this is the 10 R in the middle.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:38.720]   Yeah, the 11 and the 11 max get the three cameras and the 11 R gets the two cameras.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:44.960]   I have three cameras on this galaxy and I love the ability to have three different focal lengths.
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.320]   I think it really is nice. Yeah.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.280]   Not really weird that they go down.
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:53.920]   Just to extend the concept of what they were doing with the twin lenses before,
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:58.400]   to have this really, really slick zoom feature with an extended range without having to do with
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:02.720]   any of the mechanics of having an actual mechanical zoom. It really is very, very slick.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:06.880]   I'll show you. I don't know. Can you see how well can you see this over my shoulder? I don't know.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:10.720]   You'll find it. It's one of those cameras in there.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.920]   You don't have an over the shoulder camera. The port cam.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:18.320]   There it is. So that's the close up. That's the middle.
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.960]   And then the wide gets like everything.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:25.040]   So that's really cool. I'll do it again. Close up.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.280]   That really is kind of a zoom.
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:31.040]   Now, will Apple do that? Will Apple give you?
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.640]   They did that with the 1X2X. I think that's just a very easy extension.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:38.960]   Yeah, it's just like the 1X2X, the 1X2X3X or whatever the next thing is.
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:42.960]   I use the wide a lot, even though there's a little barrel distortion. I really like having.
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:47.280]   Like when you're taking pictures as I did last night, we had 12 people at dinner.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:48.960]   Everybody's in it. It's easy.
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:50.560]   Everybody lean in.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:54.720]   The really cool thing Gurman was talking about is that it can fire all three cameras,
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.960]   even if you're using the middle camera, for example.
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:00.560]   And then if you cut somebody off or a damage, it can just reclaim that data
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:03.520]   from the other camera buffer and repair the photo for you.
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:04.720]   How googly of them.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:11.680]   And it's also more data, even if you're just using a focal length that's equivalent to the middle
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:17.600]   camera, it'll get information from the telephoto. It'll get information from the wide angle
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.680]   to do things like skin smoothing, to do things like foreground extraction.
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:25.760]   Every piece of data is going to be wasted.
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:28.400]   You're sending electrons to all three sensors anyway.
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.320]   You may as well actually make use of them.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.120]   Yeah. Or photons even.
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.800]   Yeah.
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.880]   Let's take a break.
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:38.320]   It's interesting to look at the 10R.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.000]   Sorry, can I just add one more thing?
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.040]   Please.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:46.000]   It's interesting to look at it because Apple plans these phones two years, three years out.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.720]   So the phones we're getting now were planned long ago.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:53.200]   But they're sticking with a slightly worse camera and slightly lower resolution
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:58.560]   and different screen technology as the way of lowering the price where Google with the 3A,
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:02.160]   they're keeping the camera, everything they can possibly do to keep that camera,
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:06.080]   even if they have to reduce the processor and the processing speed and all of those things.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.320]   And it feels like if somebody could figure out a way to put a really good processor
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:13.840]   and a really good camera and just compromise on everything else.
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.640]   And there'll be nothing to complain about about the inexpensive phones anymore.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:23.520]   Now we will take a break to tell you about the best place to make your next website or maybe
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:29.040]   your first website. In fact, I really want to talk to people who think that having a Facebook page
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:35.200]   or a Twitter account gives you a web presence. It does not. You need a website. Sure, you can
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:40.240]   link back to your website from your Facebook or your Twitter. But having your own site is
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:45.600]   so important as an individual, doubly so for a business. And where's the best place to do it?
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:52.240]   Well, we're one third of the entire internet does WordPress.com. WordPress makes it easy to
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:58.720]   build a gorgeous website, powerful site building tools, thousands of themes. And the best part is
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:04.640]   if you ever have a question, support 24/7 from actual WordPress experts and enthusiasts.
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:09.040]   It's not somebody just reading a notebook. This is somebody who really knows their stuff.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:13.600]   And I've loved it. Every interaction I've had with the support team at WordPress. That's where
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:19.680]   my blog is. Leo Laport is at wordplay. Laport.com is at wordpress.com. I self-hosted for a while,
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:24.640]   and I realized WordPress.com does it better? They take care of all the hosting, all the updates,
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:30.080]   all the patches. They give you all the plugins you could ever want. And by the way, no blog
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:36.480]   platform has better plugins, a better variety of plugins in WordPress. WordPress.com lets anyone
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:41.840]   pursue whatever it is they love by launching a site that's free to start with room to grow.
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:47.920]   In fact, I started with the free tier and now I'm using the business tier because I just love
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:54.080]   having all those capabilities. But it's easy to start. No two-week trials. There's no hidden fees.
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:58.720]   And most importantly, the reason why you have to have your own website, that's the only place you
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:05.760]   can go where you own your content forever. Upload, text, images, movies, music, whatever you want.
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:12.640]   Download it whenever you want. It's yours. It's your content. And wordpress.com is built to grow
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:16.720]   with you to get you where you want to be tomorrow. If you're a business, you can sell on wordpress.com.
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:21.200]   They've got great e-commerce solutions. It's a great way to put your name out there so that when
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:27.680]   people Google your name, they find your best stuff. WordPress is so flexible, so powerful.
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:32.160]   Many of the biggest companies on earth just say, "No, we're going to use wordpress.com."
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:39.520]   Kind of wish we had after seeing the final bill for our website, wordpress.com. That's why
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:46.480]   fortune.com is our WordPress.com site. That's why Quartz, that beautiful quartz site, is a WordPress.com
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:51.360]   site. Millions of people use WordPress.com every day to turn their dreams into reality. Shouldn't
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:59.840]   you go to wordpress.com/macbreak and you get 15% off any new plan purchase. WordPress.com/macbreak
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:06.320]   for 15% off your new website. Do that for us. When they see that, they go, "Yeah, we like these guys."
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:13.280]   They send us some traffic. And we thank wordpress for not only giving us a little ad buy here, but
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:19.120]   for supporting my site, Steve Gibson site. Everybody, I know they do such a great job.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:28.320]   WordPress.com/macbreak. I'm stealing a little thunder from Steve. I'm sure he'll cover this
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:39.040]   in an hour on security now. Zombie load. Zombie load. Yes, another Intel vulnerability.
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:46.320]   Intel chips. And that includes Apple devices, four bugs that can allow hackers
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:52.160]   to steal sensitive information right from the processor. Go directly to the source.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:19:00.080]   Zombie load, they say, is just as serious as meltdown and specter. Here's the good news.
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:07.520]   Thank you, Apple. If you're using Mac OS 1014.5, that explains why you got that update. You're safe.
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:16.640]   It affects every Intel computer dating back to 2011, not ARM, not AMD. Here's the demo of zombie load.
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:25.440]   Zombie load in action. So I don't know if you can gather anything from this demo, but
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:31.600]   basically they're spying on your web browsing. And so what you see on the right is the text
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:38.080]   that tells the hacker what you're doing on the left. But you could also use the use of steel
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:46.880]   passwords. No reports so far of any attacks using zombie load. Intel has released microcode
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:52.960]   updates for vulnerable processors. And the Mojave, this is why you want to install that update you
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:59.760]   got yesterday. The Mojave 1014.5 update will fix that. And all physical access, right to exploit it.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:04.080]   Oh, well, that's good. If that's the case, it's nothing to be set your hair on fire for.
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:13.040]   But let me see. Oh, by the way, there is a performance hit. An Intel spokesperson told tech
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:18.160]   crunch most passenger consumer devices could take a 3% performance at worst. Data center 9%.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:24.160]   That's where a Spectre meltdown and I gather zombie load is an issue is on a shared processor
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:28.640]   as in a data center, where you could have a malicious process running on the same machine as
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:32.400]   your process. And are those hits cumulative? Like, do we have to add those to the previous hits we
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:36.880]   took from the previous multiple medications? It's like 1% a year, 2% they're all of a sudden
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:41.840]   it's real percentages. So according to tech crunch, zombie load is easier than Spectre,
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:46.800]   but harder than meltdown. And it requires a very specific set of skills.
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.560]   We have need some stay away from my computer.
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:58.880]   Skills that make people like you very scared. Every Intel chips since 2011, it's just Intel's
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:03.840]   the gift that keeps on giving. When is Apple going to put their own chips in the computers?
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:06.880]   Do you think that's what? It feels like sooner and sooner, right?
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:10.480]   Yeah, I think that's what's holding up the Mac Pro is maybe they want to be make that be the
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:14.800]   first one with its own. It's hard to imagine the pro would be the first one just because to go from
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:21.600]   Zion to arm is a big jump. We're going from core. They call them core I5 now. I still think
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:25.360]   their M5s, whatever those seem like a much more. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:32.320]   I didn't even know this was possible. Did you know that there is a government
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:39.760]   group called the Committee on Foreign Investment within the US or Cepheus?
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:50.000]   Yes, you did apparently. Your dog did. Cepheus has ordered the Chinese company that owns Grinder
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:22:00.080]   to sell by 2020. You might wonder why a Chinese company would buy a popular gay dating app.
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:06.480]   Although I think if you have some imagination, you might have some ideas. Beijing Kunlun Tech
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:11.280]   Company said it reached an agreement that prohibits the company from accessing information
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:18.400]   about Grinder's users and requires a sale before June 30, 2020. Nor will Grinder be able to transmit
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:25.760]   any sensitive information to any entities based in China. It's a security agreement. And I think
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:31.120]   you can imagine that the Chinese government might be very interested in anybody. They could
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:35.920]   blackmail if they're not out. You should think they could have stopped the sale before it happened
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:40.880]   rather than killing it back. Really should have. Really should have. But at least, you know,
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:49.520]   it's done. Amazon announced next day delivery. They said it's going to cost us $800 million.
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:56.480]   Walmart says, yeah, we could do that. And we could do it today in Phoenix, Las Vegas in Southern
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:00.000]   California. They'll reach 75% of the country by the end of the year one day. You're going to
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.200]   send it to you before you order it. We just want to think you want it. We know what you want.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:10.400]   Free next day delivery. If you order more than $35, you know, this benefits is Google because
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:16.400]   Google, the problem Google Assistant has is, you know, it's not Amazon, but Google has cobbled
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:21.200]   together a bunch of commerce partners, including Walmart for their assistant. And if you can,
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:25.120]   you know, I mean, I honestly still use the Echo just because I can buy stuff that way. But
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:34.480]   if I get next free next day from Walmart, maybe $35 will be the minimum for the two free one
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:43.600]   day shipping Google Google has changed its express requirements several times. It's kind of confusing
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:52.720]   now. I mean, first it was, we'll deliver anything for free, which wasn't viable. Then we'll deliver
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:59.280]   a certain amount for free. And then it went to we'll pay a monthly fee and we'll deliver whatever
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:05.840]   you want for free. And I think now it's back to a certain amount. So I, you know,
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:12.560]   those kinds of things when it just jumps around and it seems like they have no idea what they're
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:16.320]   doing. It's not a good thing. You just kind of stop using it. Yeah. Well, you're going to love
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:20.000]   this because you don't know what you're going to be charged. You only get next day delivery. If
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:26.480]   all the items you're buying are at the same warehouse. You do know which warehouse your items are at,
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:33.520]   right? Of course. If one item, I'll just use my apple pay to get a scooter and go pick it up.
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:42.480]   It's also really difficult because like Amazon, for instance, is trying to, they're trying to
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:47.600]   avoid hiring people who work for Amazon and deliver, which is why they went to all of the
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:52.800]   trouble of saying, hey, independent contractors, we will help you independent contractors,
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:56.720]   create your own independent contracting business that only delivers for Amazon,
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:02.960]   which they could get this all up and running so much faster if they just simply said,
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:09.520]   we are a huge company. We can afford for certain cities where it's worth our while to actually hire
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:15.680]   more people to actually buy or lease trucks of vans to make these quick short-hop deliveries.
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:21.440]   But if they keep relying on sort of an Uber task force that are probably within the next two or
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:28.160]   three years going to start to fight to unionize or start depending on the mood of the federal
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:34.400]   government or state governments, start to become, get limitations on how much you can treat a full-time
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:38.320]   employee as they will that don't work for you. It's just not going to work out.
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:44.000]   It's also amazing because they say one day, one day shipping, but it's not. It's like one day
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.240]   delivery once it ships. I was watching a YouTuber try it out and you ordered five things. It might
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:53.200]   have been John Prosser. I don't want to get that wrong. Three of them took four days and two of
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:57.280]   them still haven't arrived because they just haven't shipped yet. So delivery doesn't really matter.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:01.120]   Not really one day then, is it? It's one day once they ship you.
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:12.400]   No. It makes you think about how Google at IO last week expanded the feature of a Google
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:19.520]   assistant to actually interact with real world, like people in real world, real world websites as well.
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:27.200]   If you were to ask Aliyosha or ask your Google assistant like to, I just need this as soon as
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:32.560]   possible, ideally tomorrow, will your assistant then be able to navigate multiple websites to
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:38.240]   look for local stores that actually have it in stock where you can pick it up today or local
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:42.960]   stores that will actually do next day delivery for you. And then doesn't matter whether it
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:46.720]   came from Amazon, whether it came from Walmart, whether it came from Best Buy, at least you know
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:51.360]   that with an hour, you can have this thing. So Google can abstract them the way they abstracted
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:57.440]   Google. Yeah. I wish they would do that. That's the problem with these assistants. They're just
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:02.880]   not very bright. If they would only-- I want to see that Google robot assistant
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:11.680]   get on and deal with press one if you want this or press two. I want to see how it navigates that.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:21.360]   I think within three days it would learn the operator. Operator is not an operator.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:27.600]   Operator. I want to see that Google assistant get mad and slam the phone down.
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:33.920]   So a couple of Adobe stories. First of all, the good news, there's good news in the bad news.
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:39.040]   What do you want? Good news or bad news? Here's the good news. Bad news first. All right,
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:45.840]   I'll give you the bad news first. Adobe has sent out a warning to users of the older versions of
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:54.320]   creative clouds, including Photoshop, Premiere Pro and Lightroom, saying you could be sued if
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:28:00.240]   you continue to use these, which is a little confusing. It's apparently not being sued by Adobe.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:07.440]   A little legwork from Apple Insider came up with the-- well, here's what Adobe's statement to Apple
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:12.960]   Insider was. Adobe recently discontinued certain older versions of creative cloud applications.
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:17.760]   Customers using those versions have been notified. They're no longer licensed to use them
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:22.800]   and were provided guidance on how to upgrade to the latest authorized versions.
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:28.800]   Unfortunately, customers who continue to use or deploy older unauthorized versions of
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:33.200]   creative cloud may face potential claims of infringement by third parties.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:39.920]   Well, we can't comment on claims of third party infringement as it concerns ongoing litigation.
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:50.880]   So they did a little research. Turns out, Adobe has been suing Adobe over copyright infringement
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:59.200]   in brief to contract. The theory is that Adobe licensed some Dolby technologies with an agreement
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:06.800]   based on how many disks were sold. But when the software went online, the company's renegotiated,
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:12.880]   but Dolby, according to the legal filing, when Dolby sought to exercise its rights to audit
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:18.000]   Adobe's books and records to ensure proper reporting and payment Adobe, refused to engage in even
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:25.200]   basic auditing and information sharing practices. Apparently, Dolby says-- and this is in the lawsuit--
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:30.080]   Adobe determined that it was better to spend years withholding this information from Dolby
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:34.320]   than to allow Dolby to understand the full scope of Adobe's contractual breaches.
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.560]   Wow. Better call saw.
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:37.680]   God bless.
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:38.720]   So bad.
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:43.600]   So the thing that's so frustrating is as a creative cloud subscriber, I think I have the
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:46.960]   latest version of Photoshop. Then every once in a while, I go in there and I find out they put a
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:51.360]   new version up and it's not automatically upgrading me. I have to install the new version and then
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:54.240]   do I install the old version? That takes away some of the components of the new version.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.840]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:56.480]   This is the problem, is there--
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:56.480]   --is the problem is there--
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:56.960]   --is supposed to fix all this.
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:01.840]   A lot of people choose to use older versions of Adobe products because they don't want the changes,
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:06.080]   even though they're subscribers to the creative cloud. And that should-- it would feel like,
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:11.120]   well, I'm paying Adobe their monthly fee. I don't understand why. But well, now you know,
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:15.840]   there's collateral damage in this war between the dinosaurs, Adobe and Dolby,
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:23.840]   and that's how it damages you. Yeah. So that was the bad news. The good news, Adobe is now
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:28.640]   opening Photoshop for iPad beta signups. So if you're a creative cloud subscriber,
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:37.200]   search your inbox. I haven't gotten mine yet for an email saying inviting you to apply so that you
[01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:44.400]   can get pre-release versions of Photoshop for iPad. It was announced way back when Adobe Max.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:53.520]   Yeah. It would be fun to play with it. I'm excited. I think probably iOS 13, right? That's when
[01:30:53.520 --> 01:31:00.320]   everything suddenly turns into real computing on the iPad. Maybe.
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:01.040]   Yeah.
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:08.720]   Good Mark. It's going to be interesting to see how long they can get-- how long Apple can continue
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:13.840]   with the idea of, no, you don't need a mouse. We're not going to support a
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:19.680]   pointing device for the general population as opposed to special needs people. And no,
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:25.600]   we'll let you use a keyboard, but it's not really that important. It's going to be funny if they ever
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:33.040]   find a time where the most natural iPad product to put into expand the line would be to build a
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:40.080]   two-in-one like a yoga style notebook where the screen can fold 360 degrees to the back.
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:45.840]   And suddenly have to say, I know this has a keyboard and a trackpad and a screen that is
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:51.040]   attached via a hinge, but this is not a MacBook. Please keep keep buying MacBooks.
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:53.200]   By the way, was it? I forget how long-- how long did it--
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.160]   All right.
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:57.440]   Will they skip on Lucky 13 and just go straight to iOS 14?
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:57.600]   No.
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:57.600]   No.
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:02.000]   Well, I mean, they skipped iPhone 9, so anything's possible. But I was going to say,
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.440]   how long did it take-- I remember when the Mac came out, there was like no arrow keys and no
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:09.360]   terminal because you had to learn to use the GUI. Damn it. They were not going to let you
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:13.280]   just keep using your-- but then like after a while had arrow keys and a CL, I think like the
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:16.800]   Apple has this philosophy where they're not going to give you the old input until they're
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:20.480]   darn sure that you invested your homework young man and you learned that you input it.
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:25.120]   And after a while, it's like, all right, fine. Just take your darn old input technologies.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:30.160]   I don't think it was just the users. It was also the developers saying, I know that you're going
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:36.400]   to want to simply make a version of PFS file that just uses all the command keys. We're telling
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:40.720]   you that we don't want you to do that and we trust you so much. We're not-- we're actually
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:44.160]   ripped out the keys from the prototypes to make sure you have to do that.
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:49.920]   If you're using WhatsApp, update it now. Apparently--
[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:50.960]   --he'll believe this story.
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:51.760]   --or delete it.
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:53.600]   Or delete it, which would be a better idea.
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:57.920]   Unfortunately, a lot of people have to have it because that's how they communicate with
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:02.880]   other people who refuse to use anything but WhatsApp. It's a zero-day exploit.
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:12.080]   An exploit that comes from an Israeli hacking firm, the NSO group, they build exploits
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:16.080]   and surveillance ware that governments purchase.
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:25.120]   And apparently, they sold a package called Pegasus to some government unknown,
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:30.640]   which then got snuck into a silent infection into WhatsApp.
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:40.160]   And I guess discovered by security researchers, WhatsApp, prior to--
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:43.120]   It's like a buffer overrun, right? That could do a executable code.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:49.200]   A buffer overflow vulnerability that requires no input from the user whatsoever.
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:52.560]   Yeah, you could call them and whether they answered or not, you could send this code,
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.720]   which would then put Pegasus on there.
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:57.920]   And of course, their WhatsApp account is tied to your phone number, so they call it.
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:59.120]   You got Pegasus on there.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:03.920]   So it's basically a phone call. We'll hack you.
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:10.480]   Engineers at Facebook scrambled over the weekend to patch the whole and updated WhatsApp yesterday.
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:14.880]   So please update. If you're using iOS prior to--
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:18.240]   WhatsApp for iOS prior to 2.19.51.
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:24.080]   WhatsApp business prior to 2.19.51. WhatsApp for Windows prior to 2.18.348.
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:26.960]   And if anybody's using WhatsApp for Tizen--
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:34.800]   Yes, you. That one guy prior to 2.18.15 just update the damn thing.
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:39.200]   And it'll be removed. But boy, how long has that been in there?
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:41.760]   Yeah, they don't know. It took them 10 days to patch it.
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:45.760]   No idea how long it was open. And this is like nation-state level stuff.
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:50.000]   So they won't say how many-- they said, I think, a dozen or dozens of people,
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:56.160]   but there's no real way of knowing. And it-- at WhatsApp scale, even a very small percentage of
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:00.720]   people is a lot of people. Well, Citizen Lab, which monitors Pegasus,
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:05.840]   says that they know that somebody tried to use the exploit as late as Sunday night to
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:11.680]   infect a UK-based human rights lawyer's phone. He had helped people in Mexico and Saudi Arabia.
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:20.880]   And apparently, you know, so you can kind of guess who the perpetrators might be.
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:29.440]   So on the other hand, the lawyer was suing NSO, the company that made the spyware,
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:31.040]   but NSO says, "No, we would never--"
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:38.240]   "We would never use our software to attack anybody. It's only used by intelligence and law
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:44.400]   enforcement agencies. Amnesty International and others this week will urge the Israeli military
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:50.080]   to ban the export of NSO Group software on the grounds. It sold the governments with questionable
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:55.600]   track records on human rights." The human rights lawyer told Forbes Tuesday he started
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:36:01.360]   receiving strange video calls over WhatsApp around three weeks ago in the early hours of the
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:06.560]   morning from a number with Sweden's country code. That's when he tipped off Citizen Lab.
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:11.680]   The lab then told WhatsApp, which-- so that's how they found the security hole was this lawyer.
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:17.680]   Okay. And just to be clear, there's a lot of agencies from a lot of countries that
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:21.360]   regard us about how you feel about the country, the agencies that have done things that we're not
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:26.160]   happy with. The thing to remember is that's going to be a targeted attack. They're not going to use
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:31.120]   it against everybody. They're going to be calling specific people that they want to target. And
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:37.280]   you know, if you are a target of a nation state, you're screwed.
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:44.880]   This is coming on the heels of a report that bad people of whatever description you want to
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:50.480]   describe them as have people sort of embedded at Verizon and embedded at phone companies to make
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:55.520]   it very, very easy to clone SIM cards for again. And when you consider that you get the keys to
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:37:03.200]   the kingdom, if you are able to transfer authorization codes and double authorization to your phone
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:09.200]   as opposed to the person that you want to hurt, that's pretty damn bad. I think that-- I really
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:17.360]   do think that as quaint as we feel that stories about the 1930s and 1940s where you could just like
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:21.200]   stand on a road and stick your thumb out and someone would come in strangers, would give you
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:26.480]   rights, places, and banks would leave their doors open and just leave a pencil by the ledger saying
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:30.880]   deposit, whatever you want, take out wherever you want. I think that in 20 years time, people are
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:35.760]   going to be looking at 2019 about digital security in exactly the same way that so many things are
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:41.520]   just so easy because they're almost impossible to prevent this kind of fraud at scale.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:46.000]   We're going to have to find solutions to these because it's just going to get from
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.600]   individually high value targets to what the hell is just see if these thousand people,
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:55.840]   let's see if we can get SIM cards for eight of them. And of those eight, let's hope we can get one
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:38:00.320]   person who has over a million dollars in an investment account that we can move over.
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:02.960]   Fishing to trawling. I'm getting a flip phone.
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:09.520]   And then in Canada, you can leave your phone unlocked, but not over here.
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:14.480]   And then there's the California Consumer Privacy Act, which goes into effect January
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:19.440]   1st. It will be the strongest US privacy law of them all.
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:25.840]   NBC News says the rest of the country is watching closely. No other state has attempted such an
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:35.520]   ambitious, ambitious privacy law, nor has of course Congress. But the California Attorney General
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:43.520]   who is responsible for implementing the law is a little afraid. He says he may not have enough
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:52.560]   staff to carry out the job. The law could collapse under its own weight. He's worried that the law
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:58.000]   bites off more than his department can chew. So this should be fun.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.360]   You're going to need a whole department just for Zuckerberg.
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:03.600]   We're going to need a bigger boat. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:10.960]   This is exactly why you hear every single CEO, Facebook, Apple, everybody saying that we've
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:16.000]   been trying to open a door. We feel that privacy and security is important. And that's why we want
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:21.680]   to work with the federal government, whom we can all we've already spending lots of lobbying money
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:27.600]   for. And we already know we can control rather than negotiate with 50 individual states, some of
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:32.240]   which are not willing to do things just because we ask them and be really mean to them and give
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:39.200]   them lots of money. So yeah, this is this this there is a need for a formal bill of rights for
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:44.560]   consumer privacy. But we're going to have to it's it's it really is we're really are going to have
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:48.480]   to feel our way around these laws. We're going to have to have a whole bunch of bad laws that show us
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:54.000]   how off the rails this can go before we figure out what we need to implement and what we need
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000]   to sort of give up on just to make sure that the wheels can continue to turn.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.840]   I don't think we have to worry. Mark Zuckerberg said the future's private case.
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:04.720]   There you go. Case closed. Oh, well, there you go. Okay. Let's go.
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:08.880]   Privacy on stage this year. He was in this last week. Privacy on stage this year was AI three years
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:14.240]   ago and the cloud 10 years ago. It's just whatever buzzword we needed. It's blockchain, baby.
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:20.160]   And here it comes. So in the annals of dopey hacking, just down the road a piece,
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:29.840]   the chief financial officer of a California school lunch company, choice lunch was arrested
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:37.280]   last month because he was charged with illegally hacking lunchmaster, his competitor,
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:43.600]   to find out. And this is what he wanted to know what's what kids across the San Francisco Bay Area
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:49.680]   like to eat and what they are allergic to. He's been charged with unlawful computer access and
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:54.400]   fraud. And if found guilty faces up to three years behind bars eating food that will almost
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:41:03.600]   certainly be worse than the food in California schools. Yeah. And oddly enough, this is what
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:09.200]   Amazon is also is doing legally right now by being able to observe what people are buying on
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:15.200]   Amazon, what products, what brands, and also what decisions and what decisions brought them there,
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:18.800]   what other things were they looking at with other products had they been buying with the past three
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:24.320]   or four years. That's what fuels the expansion of Amazon's own private brands. That's they will
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:28.720]   start to get into look at it. They will but they will develop their own or license their own noise
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:34.480]   canceling headphones only after three years of the most wonderfully valuable consumer data on all
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:40.240]   of their competitors, customers. That was a thing too. Right. They were figuring out what apps to buy
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:44.000]   and what apps to make based on stealing all the data. Oh, yeah, they were installing using
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:49.120]   Apple's that's why they're certificates. Yeah. Yeah. Well, not only that. Yeah, exactly. That's
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:53.360]   why they bought WhatsApp because they knew that there's a lot of people who are not using Facebook
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:58.800]   messenger. They're using WhatsApp instead. And so they decided to buy WhatsApp. Oh, well. Oh, well,
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:04.240]   let's America. Let's take a break. And then it'll be God bless your pick of the week.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:09.360]   And if there's heavy metal involved, everybody will be happy. But stay tuned.
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:16.080]   We'll find out first a word from the best way to secure yourself. You can't trust the other
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:22.400]   guys to do it. You got to do it yourself with last pass the password vault, the number one most
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:28.960]   preferred password manager with last pass. Your data is encrypted everywhere except on your device.
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:36.240]   It's only decrypted on device. And by the way, every device iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux,
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:42.080]   when I set up a new system or a new phone, the first thing I put on it is last pass because then
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:48.080]   I know I can log in. It's easy. It auto fills the forms. I can install the rest of my apps. I can
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:53.760]   get to all my websites. And if you're a business, you better darn well be using last pass because
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:43:02.400]   password security is the is the sharp point of any attack. And your employees love to share
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:08.960]   passwords. We know that or put them on a posted note on the on the screen there with last pass.
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:14.160]   And we use it here. In fact, I've used it personally for more than 10 years. And as soon as we could,
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:19.680]   we use last pass enterprise, you create an account with one long secure master password.
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:24.480]   Let last pass remember the rest. And I trusted so much I don't just put passwords in there.
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:30.640]   Everything's in there. My passports, my driver's license. I put all my social security numbers,
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:35.280]   all my critical information. It's the safest place on my computer to store the stuff I care
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:41.280]   the most about. And last pass is great for business because you can easily share passwords
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:46.320]   using password folders. All the people in our ops have this have the access to all the ops
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:50.640]   logins. All the people in the business department have access to the business department logins.
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:55.920]   But there's no sharing there. And we can even set it up so that you can log into our bank accounts
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:59.360]   without actually getting the password. So there's no way you could take it and give it to somebody
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:05.280]   else. You just click a button it logs you in and you're there. Last passes for businesses of all
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:11.040]   sizes, manage password security, get yourself administrative oversight. You can safely
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:16.720]   and securely move to the clouds. The actionable security reports over 100 policies. So we set
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:22.080]   standards for what the employees master password can be. We require two factor authentication.
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:26.880]   By the way, last pass makes a great authenticator. Very easy to use one tap password verification.
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:34.560]   Automated user management. We can revoke rights easily, create rights easily. And we control
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:40.480]   shared access. That's what you need in your business. Do not be the next big breach. Last
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:45.680]   pass is a solution for you for individuals. Last pass premium at home. I use last pass families.
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:49.920]   That makes it easy for me to share the family passwords in a family folder. I just put the
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:54.880]   password in that folder. Lisa has access to it. She also has a very nice feature called emergency
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:59.200]   access where something should happen to me. If I become disabled, she can get access to my
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:06.880]   password vault after jumping through a few hoops. But but that is absolutely critical. Last pass
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:10.800]   families. Let's you keep all the family passwords organized, secure at your fingertips.
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:15.280]   We have medical accounts in their credit cards, entertainment, everything organized
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:20.400]   into folders by family member or type of account. And that digital contingency plan emergency access
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:27.520]   is a life saver. Last pass for teams. If you have a small company, 50 or fewer, and then the big
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:34.160]   boy, we use it last pass enterprise. Last pass is the way to protect yourself. Try it today. Join

[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:54.800]   at last pass.com/twit. Thank you so much for their support and for keeping us secure. Jim
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:46:03.520]   Dalrymple rock and roll. Pick of the weeks. All right. So I'll explain to you the band that I
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:12.000]   pick the reason that I picked them. But the band that I wanted to highlight this week is ACDC.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:19.440]   The reason that I wanted to pick ACDC this week, even though they're such an old band,
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:30.400]   I started listening to a lot of the old ACDC again. And I realized just how good it was.
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:34.160]   Lisa is going through a Bond Scott phase right now. And it's just awesome.
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:45.760]   Oh, it is just so incredible to hear a lot of that old stuff. Now, we can even say that back
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:52.400]   in black is old stuff. Back in black came out in 1980. It was the Brian Johnson, his first album
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:47:00.400]   with ACDC. But that was still a long time ago. So when you start listening to the old Bond
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:13.760]   Scott days, from the mid 70s up to 1980, the music is just so incredible that I know that a lot
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:21.920]   of people listening know who ACDC is. And they say, oh, yeah, yeah, go back and listen. I went back
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:31.680]   and started listening and was just blown away all over again at the albums and the music in those
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:37.760]   songs and those albums. So it's hard to pull yourself a favor, go back and do it. He's been gone
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:46.640]   since 1980. That's just God, it's hard. Yeah, he died in 79s, almost 50 years. It's amazing.
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:55.280]   Crazy. Yep. Well, I couldn't agree more. And in fact, we're sitting we're watching billions on
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:48:03.760]   Showtime. And there's a big boxing match. And Lisa said, they're going to play TNT. And they did.
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:11.360]   There you go. They did. It was she was like, it was uncanny. She was channeling the TV show.
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:13.520]   She said, this is an ACDC moment for sure.
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:20.240]   She actually wanted a Bond Scott song, but that's okay. It was so great. Hey, thank you so much.
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:27.280]   What a great pick. Jim Dowlrymple loop insight.com. Do not fear this beard. He is a pussy cat.
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:31.920]   Jay Dowlrymple on the Twitter. It was so great to have you. Thank you, Jim.
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:36.720]   Thanks. Thanks a lot. You're a real. We love having you on your pick of the week, Mr.
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:43.840]   Nino. We were talking about web apps at the top of the show. And I just decided to recommend a
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:52.720]   really cool web based image editor called photo P P E A. And it really is like a Photoshop of,
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:58.720]   let's say, three or four years ago, maybe five years ago, but entirely done as a web app. So it'll
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:04.320]   run on your phone. It'll run on your right. It'll run on your desktop. It supports layers. It
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:11.920]   supports tools. It'll support raw. It'll import export PSDs. It's really and we'll and we'll also
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:22.080]   work with the Apple pencil. It also supports vectors or supports text. It's surprisingly good. And the
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:30.000]   only thing that's kind of better than a really good $5 app on the on the app store is something
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:35.520]   where you just bookmark it in your browser in Safari. And it's synced to every device. You have
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:39.520]   every the bookmark synced to every device that you have. And when you suddenly realize that,
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:45.760]   oh, I really need to just change the aspect ratio of this or change someone sent me something as a
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:52.640]   PSD. I need it as a JPEG to be able to just open it up in the in your web browser, make the fixes
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:57.360]   that you need to do, make even some kind of sophisticated fixes like adding gradients and
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:02.800]   things like that, and then be able to export it back into the camera roll is pretty darn nice.
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:08.560]   It also will work with the standard with the files app. So if you can, you can open documents
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:13.600]   or ros or whatever from Dropbox, you can open files from URLs, you can open things from the
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:18.640]   camera roll. And then when you're done, when you do a save as you choose the format, the size,
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:24.880]   everything you want to do. And then it will just simply appear as a kind of like a download link,
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:29.840]   even those coming directly from your own device that you can then direct to again, the camera app,
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:34.160]   excuse me, the the files app, the camera app, anything else that you want to target it at.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:40.320]   So don't think this is going to be as responsive as or as feature filled as something you'd pay
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:46.240]   $30 for on the App Store. But once again, as something you can just simply drag into your bookmarks bar,
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:52.080]   so that when you really do need something, it's right there. It's a it's a really handy thing to
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:56.320]   have. It's supported by ads. So you might see if you don't have an ad blocker going, you might see
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:02.240]   a little gutter in the side that will show you an amazing offer about something that will enhance
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:07.360]   and incredible your real life. But again, it's it's free. So I think that's kind of okay.
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:12.800]   There is a paid version as well. And it looks like this is a progressive web app. So you can install
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:17.520]   it. And this is an example of why I think progressive web apps are so important. Here's
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:24.240]   something you could do on an iPad or a pixel book, a Chromebook without having any additional
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:30.320]   stuff installed. I think that's really impressive. Thank you. Good tip. I have not
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:35.280]   aware of this, and I will definitely be using it. Photo P as in in a pod P E A.
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:41.280]   Dot com. Thank you, Andy. Wow. That's a nice thing. Just remember that it has been developed
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:45.360]   since 2013, it started off as a student project. So it's not as though this something that just
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:51.280]   came just came from out of nowhere or just came out of some Russian developer a year ago,
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:55.120]   right after the election. So it does have some pedigree to it. I think there's a lot. I mean,
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:52:00.560]   this has layers. I mean, you can it reads and writes PSD files, Photoshop files. This is
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:08.160]   impressive as heck background removal. It's pretty darn good. Wow. Wow. It's got Gaussian
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:16.000]   Blurs. What more could you see it? Yeah. Gaussian Blurs. No, yes. I wish somebody to do a lightroom
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:23.680]   like this. That would be very cool. Yeah. Again, it's such a great idea. There's people
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:29.120]   don't understand exactly how good something that just uses web technology that uses the web as a
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:34.400]   as a as a as a software platform can be. And it's just not taking advantage of it. I think
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:40.560]   possibly because people, app developers can get so much more information off the device as a
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:45.520]   regular app as well as do make it more responsive and take advantage of more features. But I really
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:50.160]   think that it should be a web platform in and of itself. I'm going to take a picture of myself
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:59.280]   inside the app, create a new project and then edit it. Let's get the bags out from under my eyes
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:07.040]   right away. Photopee Renee Richie, your pick of the week. So I'm going to make up for the lack
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:12.640]   of Alex by trying to pick something as close to a couple Alex's as possible. Just toward. Yeah,
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:17.680]   just so he's with us in spirit still. So I haven't owned a robot. I always love these little home
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:22.480]   robots. And I haven't owned a Roomba in many, many years. I was waiting for home kit support because
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:27.600]   I just want to say you're Jimbo. Yeah, go and clean this and that. But yeah, it does support Alexa,
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:32.240]   does support Google Assistant does not support home kit yet. But if you are brilliant like Federico
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:37.040]   Vitichy, you can put up a web page that tells you how to use if this then that to create series
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:42.400]   shortcuts that control it. So where there is a will and a Federico, there is a way. But this is
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:47.440]   basically what I've been looking for for a while because I've had the old Roombas and you'd run it
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:51.280]   and then it was stopped and you'd have to clean it out. But this is like the mother of all Roombas.
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:57.680]   This is like the Hulkbuster armor of Roombas. This is the Roomba that Roombas go to. So it basically
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:03.280]   does everything that a Roomba does, but then docks with this tower that then offloads the
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:11.600]   local amount of of dirt and dust and debris into a vast tower of dirt and dust and debris.
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:16.240]   Meaning that the human only really has to intervene every several weeks instead of every time you use
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:21.440]   it. And it sounds like this is like the height of laziness. Yeah, it just sounds like a side
[01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:24.880]   of ladies in this and it's like, oh, you're not even vacuuming. You can't even bother to empty
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:29.520]   the vacuum. But once you don't have to vacuum, you sort of don't want to have to empty the vacuum.
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:34.000]   And this will let you go several weeks. You can also target specific rooms. It's very good for
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:39.760]   different surfaces. And I have the studio floor now where it's all hardwoods and it just it gets,
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:42.800]   I don't know where the dust comes from. I think there must be just dust, you know,
[01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:48.320]   spontaneously erupting all over the place. But my goal is just to let this thing run and then as
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:55.680]   little as possible, maintain it and see if I really love a robotic future. A thousand dollars.
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:54:59.840]   Yeah, again, it's a double Alex Lindsey of Roombas. But,
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:08.320]   wow. But I know I agree with you, Renee. The demographic of people like me who doesn't want to
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:13.120]   vacuum also doesn't want to have to empty up the dust pan. If I could just throw a thousand
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:17.920]   dollars at the problem where I can just, and anytime, like anytime someone complains about
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:25.200]   my dirty house, like, oh, that darn Roomba. You know, I forgot to cover the new Apple TV app.
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:30.080]   Is there anything we should have mentioned in there? I guess I did a video on it. It's really,
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:36.160]   so it is both a may. So let me back up for a second. There is no Apple music for video yet.
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:39.760]   Like you can't just go to one service and get everything. We're like several services.
[01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:43.120]   There's no Apple music, Spotify, whatever. There's still a bunch of different
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:47.760]   fiefdoms that have exclusive content that expect you to get separate and manage separate subscriptions
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:52.480]   for each of those. And nobody, including Apple, can change that. So what Apple's doing is kind of
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:56.960]   creating a unified view where even though there are all these services in the background, they
[01:55:56.960 --> 01:56:01.760]   will give you this presentation layer that not just links to different apps, but actually plays
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:07.040]   the content within the TV app. There are some holdouts like Netflix who don't want anything to do with
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:11.920]   this. But in the US, at least you have HBO involved in this, you have several others.
[01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:17.680]   It varies a lot by region because like in Canada, the CRTC offers minimal protection. So Bell and
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:22.240]   Rogers locked up the rice to everything very quickly. But in some places, there's going to be a
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:27.440]   bunch of different apps that you can get free trials of with one click, subscribe to, all that
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:33.680]   stuff will show up for you in like the what's up next column. It'll have editor recommendations,
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:39.040]   machine learned recommendations, and this really nice new interface where you don't have to browse
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:45.360]   browse, click in, click out browse, browse, but just go in swipe across, play trailers inside the
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:51.680]   little thumbnails. It doesn't fix the problem because nobody can fix the problem of actually
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:56.640]   making one service with almost every amount of video content. But I think it comes really close
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:02.160]   to solving a lot of the user facing problems of just managing all of this, these different
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:08.320]   five times. So you now have homework, boys and girls, go and download, update all of your devices.
[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:16.640]   There's a new iOS. There's new watch, there's new TV, iOS updates, new pride 2019 face and watch
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:21.200]   OS. Oh, yeah. Nice. Yeah. We're gonna be having a new band hopefully. Yeah, I think, well, they
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:25.360]   have a pride band from last year. They're gonna do a new one. They did one two years ago and
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:30.320]   another one last year. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But isn't it annual? Did they have a different one last year?
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:34.560]   I think so. And the Apple internal got a band and a little pride thing on it when they finished
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:40.800]   their fitness challenge, which I'm right, lusting after. Yeah. Complete your collection, collect all
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:47.760]   800 bands. So your homework is download and update all the stuff, including Mac OS. That's an
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:56.080]   important one. And then go to imore.com and read up on the new Apple TV app. Renee's got a video and
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:02.720]   images all you'd ever want to know about the Apple TV app. The problem is they tell me stuff, Leo,
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:06.880]   and then I feel like I have to explain all of it. And then it's never in it gets like to be a very
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:12.800]   long, but you know what? It's the good news about it. Everything. Everything is in here. The only
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:18.320]   article you need to read. You can even with those small confusing part is like if you subscribe,
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:23.120]   if you already subscribed to HBO or you get it through your provider or HBO now, it works
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:27.360]   differently than if you subscribe to HBO within the TV app, which then gives you full integration,
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:31.520]   lets you download episodes and do all these extra things because the world is still confusing and
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:38.000]   awful. But it's only getting better. Si, it's not Apple's fault. That's for sure. It's all these
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.720]   silos that we have to live with. They don't want to be the music industry. They don't care
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:48.480]   about us too. Renee, Richie is at imore.com. Vector is at imore.com/vector.
[01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:55.520]   You must live there from now on. There he is. Good looking fella. Please, we'll come back again
[01:58:55.520 --> 01:59:00.640]   and see you next week. But in the meantime, Vector will be there for you. Thank you, Renee.
[01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:05.520]   Andy Inaco, Boston Public Radio, WGBH. When are you going to be on?
[01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:14.400]   Monday at 1130 at WGBH in Boston, WGBH News.org. You might want to tune in early because John
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:20.000]   Waters is going to be in studio a half hour beforehand, which means that I'm going to be there
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:26.000]   45 minutes beforehand going, Mr. Waters, I just want you to know that serial mob is one of my
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:31.840]   favorite episodes. Yeah, so yeah. I might be a little flush when I'm actually on after meeting.
[01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:36.560]   And I might have grown a little pencil mustache just in the honor of the band.
[01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:44.160]   Have fun. And of course, Jim Dowerimple, loopinsight.com. Go tend to the dog in the wood shipper.
[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:50.640]   Not in that order. Sorry about that. No, no, no, no. It's worth it. Anything to have you on.

[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:30.320]   I hope Lori Gill is having a wonderful time with her mom today in Disneyland.
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:35.760]   Ah, so good. That's all that Instagram says. She's going to the Star Wars. Because Star Wars,
[02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:40.000]   oh, it's not open yet. It's open and many. Late. She's avoiding the rush.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:45.440]   Yeah, we wanted to go, but there's apparently booked for the next five years.
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:51.440]   So anyway, have fun. Lori, we'll see you next week. And thank you all for joining us. We'll
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:01:06.640]   see you next time. But now it's time to get back to work because break time is over. Bye-bye.
