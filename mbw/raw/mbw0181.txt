[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   and the PadEye and all that stuff.

[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Mr. Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core in Stu.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Hello to you today.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Nice to have you here, Alex.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   So good to be here.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Yes.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   So good to have you here.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Also, also in the Bay Area, but not in studio.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Yes, just out of spite.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   I decided to come within about 50 miles of your studio, but stop right about here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   And I could have gone all the way, but in studio, but I thought that it'd make
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   more of a statement to simply say, "I'm willing to move 20, 2,941 miles,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   but not the Rek'Sut 60."
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   It's just the kind of guy.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Andy, and I go from the Chicago Sun Times in the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And on her President's Day, his mutton chops are trimmed to be an exact duplicate
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   of Martin Van Buren's.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Very nicely done.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Very nicely done.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   The great emancipator.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Got us out of World War III.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   He did.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And now that laughter could be none other than the great Merlin Man of 43Folders.com.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Back with us once again, Merlin, you're making it a street here.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I got nowhere to be, Leo.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I discovered I actually don't have anywhere to be.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I'm going to be here anyway.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I'm going to be just be typing on the internet, so I might as well have a camera on.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Might as well.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Why not?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I just discovered also I can do these dramatic zooms.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   So I may be doing this sometimes when I want to be.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Oh, geez.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   It's nose.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   The nose.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Is that that program that you were doing?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Hang on.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Let me just do this.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Let's see.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Dramatic zooms.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Don't, don't.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Don't, don't.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Don't, don't.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   What are you trying to do?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Dramatic?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Yeah, it's trying to work.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Really good.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Get back and we can do a zoom in dolly out move.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   That'll be impressive.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Make every conference, like I've been doing a good fellowship.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Okay.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   If I could have 10 minutes, I'm going to do the beginning of-- do that scene in Goodfellas,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   where they go through the restaurant.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   That's good.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And you need the steady--
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   It's nice to be back.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   It's starting to get to hang out with you at the Mac world.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.760]   I grew up most of the time, yes?
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.040]   Yeah, and I did some Mac break stuff.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.040]   I did like-- how many did I do?
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.240]   I was like 60 Mac break segments.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.000]   You were prolific.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.560]   We did a total of 38 from the floor.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.840]   I'm surprised you found that many to do, because I have to say, I have to admit, I
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.840]   went to the show.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.840]   I went to the floor.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.840]   I walked around the floor.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.720]   I looked at everything and I was out in 30 minutes.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.360]   What really turned out well was that we had so many different people between Merlin and
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.240]   Justine and Andy and Kenji and Kiki and myself.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.400]   Everybody had their own interests.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.560]   I think it's much better than just having a handful of people.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.160]   We had a whole bunch of people finding the things that they were specifically interested
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.160]   in.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.440]   I think that it turned out well we shot 38 episodes from the floor a little coming out
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.920]   over the next week or two.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.480]   So you go to pixacord.tv to see those?
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:52.640]   Go to pixacord.tv to find Mac break video in iTunes.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.640]   That's probably the best way to do it.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.360]   Because you'll find us Mac break.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.880]   We're the audio--
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.880]   Right.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.880]   --affiliate of it.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.880]   Exactly.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.480]   Can I pay you a sort of view by extension?
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.480]   But your folks, they were fantastic.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.480]   Great team.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.480]   Doesn't he have great people working for him?
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.480]   I don't know.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.520]   Every time they do anything with them, I don't know why they treat me like this.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.680]   Maybe you demand that they do.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.840]   But they're always really nice to me.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.080]   They're super professional.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.760]   And they just swarm in like these five people.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.120]   John and his guys were just fantastic.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.240]   And I just want to say that in front of everybody.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.680]   If I, hopefully I suck less at this every year, hopefully.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.840]   But if it's good at all, it's just because those guys were amazing.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.840]   I am so--
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.000]   You should be really proud of them, Alex.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.400]   I am so proud of my crew.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   So that we-- it gets better every year.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.040]   And John Riley, who is managing the crew now, is just-- man, he's a task master.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.880]   He keeps everybody on target.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.040]   And we just have-- as said, it's been getting better every year.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.040]   And yeah.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.880]   You tell us a bouncer, too, because he'll just walk up to somebody.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.880]   I want to talk to it at Booth.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.040]   And he's like, you know, if you got a really pretty daughter, it'll be shameless.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.840]   You didn't want to talk to the chipper.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.880]   So what was your favorite product, Merlin, that you saw at Mac World Expo?
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.040]   I almost called it Mac Break Expo.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.040]   That's next year.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.040]   That's next year.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.040]   That's next year.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.840]   I got to disagree, Leo.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.760]   Tiny Town was tinier than ever and in the most awesome way.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.760]   Two of the--
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.920]   Tiny Town, I should explain for those who haven't listened to this show every-- religiously,
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.240]   every week is the little booths, the tiny booths.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.240]   Well, there was-- and this year there was Tiny Town.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.240]   There were tiny, tiny booths.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.240]   There were micro-town.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.760]   Because they had iPhone apps, right?
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.280]   No, wait.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.280]   Do you hear?
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.280]   There's two kinds of tiny.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.000]   So when we say Tiny Town usually, just on-- what do you mean when we say that?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.680]   We're talking about these areas that are not like the freaking FileMaker Pro booth, which
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.840]   I don't understand at all.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.800]   That's just my deal.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.360]   It's usually a booth that's like if you've won a design award or if you've won any kind
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.080]   of an Apple award, I think it's how it works.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.400]   You get this little booth.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.280]   It's like you kind of share it with other people.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.240]   Then this year, they had these ones in this little-- I think it's mostly iPhone developers,
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.520]   this little pavilion of four people per tiny little table.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.280]   And I did interviews with people there.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:06.320]   And then I guess literally the day before Macworld, they offered people-- can I say how
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.320]   much this was?
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.320]   Because I know how much it is.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.320]   And it's unbelievable.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.320]   You get a booth at Macworld for $1,200.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.320]   Really?
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.320]   Like how big a booth?
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.320]   A tiny--
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.320]   It's in the very far corner by where the pipe and drape starts.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.560]   You're by the bathroom.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.880]   And if you watch the Macbook, you'll see you are in the absolute corner of where Macworld
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:22.880]   was.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.240]   And two of my favorite things I saw were at the very end.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.240]   Well, you're favorite things.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.440]   So it wasn't something to put your iPod in to smell like strawberries or something.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.520]   It was genuinely cool, independent applications that do a single thing extremely well.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.680]   Those are the ones that I-- in the interview that's up right now, the one with the Apisara
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.680]   Sky, I was like, if they filled this entire conference area with apps this size, I would
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.400]   be the happiest guy in the world.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.400]   You know?
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.720]   Well, there's no money in being-- well, I guess there's some money.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.200]   But it must be tough for an app's publisher to pay for a booth.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.640]   I mean, how much money you make in an app, right?
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.640]   Well, it depends.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.600]   I mean, increasingly, because of the race to the bottom, as everybody calls it, as I
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.120]   understand it from my friends and associates who've tried to do this, you make the most
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.520]   dough when it's tied to another offering.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.000]   So if you've got an application that extends the desktop functionality of something, you're
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.960]   more likely to do well than if you're B minus WikiP.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.960]   You're a flashlight.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.960]   Right.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.960]   So--
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.960]   But that makes sense.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.880]   I mean, that's always true that the apps that are most functional and useful are the
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.880]   ones that shop with booths.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.880]   But you know what?
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.880]   So when this-- now, I talk on this AppSaurus.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.880]   AppSaurus is actually pretty bad.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.880]   I think later, I hope we'll talk about the carriers that want to start an application
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.880]   store.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.880]   Yes.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:35.880]   Saurus, guys.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.720]   It's a team of, I think he said three people who've come up with this algorithm.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.800]   And AppSaurus, which is a combination of application in the Saurus, you go in, you
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.880]   tell it what apps you like, and it uses a collaborative filtering technology to go out
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.560]   and find other apps you're likely to like.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.560]   It's very polished.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.720]   Now, why am I mentioning this?
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.160]   Well, first of all, it's a really cool app.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.480]   But second, I think it's not about selling apps.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.560]   I think that's about getting a lot of exposure to a piece of technology they spent three
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.840]   years building.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.560]   So when we look at what it costs to be a Mac world, it's not simply a matter of how
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.360]   many 99 cent apps that I sell.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.360]   Right.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.360]   Right.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.880]   Well, and I think a lot for a lot of developers as well, it's getting in front of press because
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.360]   people are also wandering around the floor with cameras.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.280]   And so, I mean, that kind of exposure is difficult for a small developer to-
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.280]   It's really worth it.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:25.680]   You know, and Paul Kent, I'm sure the guy who organizes all of this IDG is-
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.680]   Was very great.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.720]   He was certainly grateful to us for being there.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.440]   And I'm sure he was extraordinarily grateful to you because those cameras make a huge difference.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.800]   I'm sure for the people who buy a booth at Mac world Expo.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.960]   Now, the attendance seemed okay, right?
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.400]   I mean, there were a lot of people there.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.960]   The attendance last year was 30,000.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.800]   And they said the reports are that the attendance was actually pretty close this year to the
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   same.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.800]   Paul said the first day.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   He didn't-
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.800]   Okay.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.800]   I only talked to him about day one, which was Thursday.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.800]   Day two was still pretty busy.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.360]   He said day one was just a few hundred below that last year.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.080]   But I can't imagine they got the 30 cents.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.080]   Well, what was Saturday like?
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.080]   Was there any-
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.080]   I wasn't there on Saturday.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.080]   Saturday was thinner.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.080]   There it was.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.080]   Okay.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.080]   Well, that's not terribly thinner.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:10.680]   It would be about as about the same crowd that was there, let's say, later in the afternoon
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.680]   in the first day.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.680]   Okay.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.960]   So still, you can make your way around the show floor, but you were walking around thinking,
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.880]   my God, this place is thin and dead.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.920]   I really, I do have to say though that the first, I was very, very pleased when the very
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.360]   first thing I heard on Thursday, when I passed to the lobby before I hit the show floor on
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.680]   day one, were two people complaining that, oh, it's too damn crowded down there.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.960]   I can't even move around.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.960]   That's good.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.480]   I'm like, are there two shows or is this really good news for Paul?
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.680]   Well, it was interesting because Friday, I was there all day Friday.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.840]   We did our Mackerel Live at 2 p.m.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.360]   Friday morning, it was a little sparse, but by noon, it was jammed.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.200]   People got off work and they came in.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.040]   What I was surprised is that it was just, you know, I think there was a lot of, I mean,
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.440]   even I was just not sure what to expect when we, you know, when we got there.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.800]   And I thought, well, this might be the last Mackerel.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.360]   And I have to admit that I wasn't left that way when I was there.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.520]   When I went to the comp, when I went to the-
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   It seemed pretty vital, but, but different speakers though.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.520]   Different speakers and the conventional-
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.520]   Well, it was a lot smaller.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.520]   That's a lot smaller.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.520]   It was a lot smaller.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.520]   I mean, they normally would have a North Hall and a South Hall.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.520]   The South Hall was what Apple was.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.120]   The South Hall was closed.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.920]   That's one of two canards though, Leah.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.920]   Canard number one is-
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.240]   When you say canard, do you mean duck?
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.240]   I do.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.240]   Okay.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.240]   And if it looks like a canard.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.720]   No, I think-
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.720]   Fallacy would be the-
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.720]   I think those are-
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.720]   Fowls.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.480]   I think those are data points that may be true, but not telling.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.560]   Data point number one is that there was- I've heard two half numbers that I want to learn
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.560]   more about.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.840]   Half number one was like there was half the number of way of space, like half the hall,
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.840]   right?
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.600]   I think that there was half as many- I guess half as many exhibitors.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:49.880]   Well, first of all, if 30% of the half that wasn't there was crap to put your iPod in,
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.360]   that's okay with me.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.800]   My concern is people buying smaller booths who are serious like movers in the industry
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.480]   that attract other people.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:04.440]   And then as far as the number of exhibitors, I guess I'd want to know what is the net loss
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.040]   of income rather than net loss of exhibitors?
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.520]   Because that's going to be the more telling-
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.520]   It has to be profitable.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.240]   Do you know what I'm saying, Elle?
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.920]   Like when people go, "Oh, half as many exhibitors."
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:20.080]   Well, in net number of booths or in- so if you lose 15 of those giant ass booths, that's
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.160]   going to hurt.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.320]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.920]   It's kind of a number that's a little deceiving, but-
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.920]   But we don't know-
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.920]   I'm just going to go to West.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.920]   I should go to West.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.920]   Move it to West, put it all in one place, and let's just go partner.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.920]   I really wish- I really wish-
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.200]   We don't know what the break even point is either for it, right?
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.360]   I mean, we don't know what IDG needs to make it worthwhile.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.360]   We just don't know.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.160]   Well, and I really would prefer to have it all in the West Hall, because the West Hall
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.680]   is so much nicer than the North and South.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.680]   The North and South Halls are kind of, you know, they're in the basement, literally.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.120]   Just can you set up-
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.120]   West is upstairs.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.120]   West has got upstairs.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.120]   There's an exhibit.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.120]   Well, that's where all the other talks were.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.120]   The conference is on.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.360]   When you do WWDC, it's all in the West Hall, and you have the Expo is all down in the West
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.920]   Hall, and it's small enough now.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.000]   I'm sure that there was some kind of scheduling issue, which is why they weren't using it,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.040]   or maybe they thought it was going to be bigger than it was.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.360]   The North Hall would give them a little more headroom than the West Hall.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.880]   Because the West Hall I think is a little bit smaller than the North Hall, and much smaller
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.360]   than the South Hall.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.360]   It's cozy though.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.360]   It's cozy.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.720]   It's big enough to do stuff.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720]   Sorry.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.160]   All I can say is that it felt like a Mackerel X-Bow.
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:24.280]   I think we've all been at the last gas, New York Mackerel shows, and the last gas, Boston
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:29.320]   shows, and those are the ones where you're humming Anatefka as you're strolling through
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.760]   these streets because you know that soon I'll be a stranger in a strange new place, searching
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.480]   for an old familiar place from Mackerel X-Bow.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.120]   But that wasn't the vibe I got this week at Mackerel.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.080]   It just felt like another regular show.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.400]   And they were able to do a lot of things that they were not able to do in previous years.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.880]   Do you think that Apple would have let them get away with an entire hugely packed session
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.760]   on a product that they have not actually released yet?
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.680]   I think that's one of the big failures.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.680]   I'm serious.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.040]   No, that was the problem is that there was nothing to say.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.840]   Well, no, no, no, I'm saying.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.720]   But getting back to the point, we did a huge pack, pack, pack session on the iPad.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.280]   And it wasn't a topic that people were really interested in.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.520]   It went over really, really well.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.240]   But you had a Styrofoam model of the iPad.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:14.560]   But the big deal, he said, finishing his sentence, is that Apple had no control over the message,
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.120]   no control over the content.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.760]   If we were going to spend 90 minutes slagging this thing off and coming up with all kinds
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.840]   of half truths that just weren't true, Apple was not there to counter it.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.280]   Apple was not there to shape anything more than anything else.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.640]   They have thrown away the big stick that once had to say, you can have this on the floor,
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.800]   you can't have this on the floor.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.800]   You can't have it.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.960]   You have a billion for this for developers who can have a pavilion for iPhone users.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.160]   They still have a stick, Andy.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.880]   We tried to get John Hodgman, for instance, and he said, well, I don't think Apple would
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.880]   like that.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.600]   I mean, they have a stick.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.560]   Believe me, if you're an Apple ISV, if you're a developer, if you have any relationship
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.920]   with Apple, you're not going to piss off Apple, whether they're at the place or not.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.960]   Even Macworld Magazine is probably going to be a little hesitant, right?
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.520]   Well, I don't think so.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.360]   Remember that panel was headed by Jason Snell.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.360]   Yeah, he doesn't care.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.360]   Yeah, he doesn't.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.760]   Yeah, and Warren was everywhere, too.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.960]   But, and I think that what I liked about it was that it wasn't dominated by these big
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.960]   booths.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.760]   As someone who asked, when we're covering stuff, what we're generally looking for is
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.160]   not the big companies.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.720]   We're looking for the more independent developers, the guys with the smaller booths.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.120]   That's what we want to pick out because everyone, everyone can hear about the other stuff.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.200]   They have a marketing, you know, they have marketing budget dollars.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.200]   They have all these other things.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.240]   We're looking for the smaller guys to cover, and it was a lot easier for us to do that.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.920]   In this event, it was a lot easier for us to move around.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:34.120]   I mean, so I actually enjoyed it, you know, a lot more at the size that it was at.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.840]   I think it could grow up a little bit.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.600]   But it was a little bit like rationalization.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.920]   No, I don't know.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.680]   I hated walking around both things before.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.680]   I really feel as though Leo and I had totally different experiences.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.080]   I thought it was a great show.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.080]   It was a smaller show.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.640]   It was definitely a reinvention show, but it's seen more like a transition towards a much
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:58.880]   bigger and much more successful show in 2011 rather than the downslope of the curve.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:06.680]   I will admit absolutely full on that the reason why I made it to Macworld Expo was number one,
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.680]   inertia.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.640]   It's hard for me to consider even not going to Macworld Expo.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.560]   Number two, the fear that this would be the last show and then I would really have nothing
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.080]   else to do, and then I would have missed it.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.080]   And number three, and this is the deal breaker that I managed to luckily line up a speaking
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.800]   gig that said, "Okay, well, you'll get paid to speak at this place, and, you know, that
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.800]   offsets any expenses.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.800]   Okay, fine.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.800]   That's the deal breaker.
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.840]   So, and so that was turned around completely on the show.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.640]   Next I've already got my money budgeted for the travel for next year's show, unless some
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:40.200]   meteor smashes into something that I'm fond of and is impossible to rebuild it in time.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.200]   I will definitely be here next year."
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.440]   Okay, I want to make one of the quick observations, something that did not occur to me any year
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.440]   until this year.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.880]   We see people walking around, and let's be honest, like, so there's got to be a vast
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.880]   majority.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.960]   Would you guys agree that a majority of the people on the show floor are probably exhibits
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.960]   only?
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.840]   I thought the majority of people were hot chicks.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.840]   I must have been looking at a different thing.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.680]   Well, again, you did have a different night.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.120]   No one, you had a, you were in the wrong show.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.480]   Are you sure you went to the right place?
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.720]   You sure you didn't go to like a, you did a noise or something?
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.280]   A lot of love and a lot of love and elevator playing over the speakers, because that could
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.880]   have been a totally different show floor.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:24.160]   You know, there's, there's even be a lot of booths with hot curler irons, shampoos.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.400]   Maybe I was at the wrong show.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.400]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.920]   You know, it's funny you walk around though, and you can tell the exhibits only folks
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.800]   because they've, they're every, they will take everything.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.440]   It's like the free sample people at Safeway that block the aisles.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.080]   Like they're going to take everything they can get and you see people walking around
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.920]   with a bag full of stuff.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:46.440]   People who do buy stuff at Macworld, in my experience, seeing other people, you'll occasionally
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.240]   buy something that's going to be delivered.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.240]   But what do you buy?
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.280]   You buy a new media device, right?
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.040]   Excuse me, in terms of on the show floor, you buy like a cool hard drive that would
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.840]   be hard to get where you live.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.280]   You know, you get little stuff that you can fit in a suitcase.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.840]   Something that didn't occur to me until this time.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.800]   And the biggest thing I've ever bought was probably like a bag.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.840]   But think about how many people bought iPhone applications on the floor that day.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.040]   During our interviews, Alex, I bought two.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.720]   And it took me about 10 seconds.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.720]   Really?
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.720]   I never thought about that before.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.280]   And you think about how disruptive then with the iTunes store, it's not like people are
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.000]   going to run around, you know, buying music at a, at a music, music fair.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   It's interesting.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.080]   I think one interesting piece of growth is bringing people in because if you do get this
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.960]   in front of a lot of influential people, and by influential, I just mean they're going
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.960]   to spread the word for you.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.920]   And people who are really genuinely interested in just buying, I mean, I spend so much on
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.920]   applications, it's mind blowing.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.360]   And I think a lot of people are like that.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.680]   Can I ask you a question?
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.680]   Stupid question.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.960]   How do you buy applications on the show floor?
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.960]   I mean, there was some model.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.960]   No, just on your iPhone.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.160]   Oh, you just see something and you say, oh, I've got to buy that.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.560]   Isn't that, it's a crazy thing with that market.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.760]   And I think that's going to be, you're going to see that with the iPad as well, where
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.720]   you just, you immediately see something interesting.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.720]   I do that all the time.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.720]   I see something on whatever.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.480]   And I just go to my iPhone and I start downloading it.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.480]   You know, it's-
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.480]   And I wouldn't do that.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:07.480]   I wouldn't do that for Adobe Photoshop, CS for enterprise development, CS, CS, or whatever,
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.120]   because I don't want a giant box of, you know, whatever.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.040]   And so one way to, I guess what I'm getting at is a couple things.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.480]   If you do want to attract people to get in front of these people, and they've got a
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.920]   little bit of dough for whatever reason, man, make a pavilion where people can come in and
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.800]   just, you know, demo their stuff.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.960]   I talked to the guy, what's his name?
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.520]   It's not Alex, but the guy who does the postage app.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.840]   A great little, just a little cheap, like $4 app.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.400]   I got up a bunch of stuff like that.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:37.360]   Okay, so your favorite thing about Mac world, Merlin was Tiny Town and Tienci Tiny Town.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.600]   My favorite part about Mac world is what I can say.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.600]   I like about Mac world.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.080]   I like hanging out with people.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.080]   And you know what?
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.080]   I'm going to say that though.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.080]   Because I told Paul Kent this probably five times last year.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.120]   The thing that matters more than anything else in this economy, with being such a pain
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.080]   to fly with all of this stuff, people are not going to go there, just see somebody in
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.920]   Apollo shirt talk to you about enterprise databases.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.880]   You want to go because you want to drink with Gruber.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.520]   You go because you want to see Andy talk.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.520]   No, I think that's true.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.760]   Andy, I've told you this story three times.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.360]   I'll never forget the day that I introduced myself to you at Mac world before you hit any
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.360]   clue who I was.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.760]   And I must have looked like John Wayne Gacy to you.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.600]   You just had crazy like here in the headlights.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.600]   Well, the makeup kind of helps.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.600]   I love these things back week.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.600]   I love these things.
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:23.900]   But I think bringing those big head characters in, no offense, but anybody who's like a
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:28.000]   meh perceived as a max, somebody who's on that badge, you've got Leo, get those people
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.040]   in there and have them show people how to do stuff and meet with people.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.720]   I think that and then, you know, for the people who do have something to sell, give
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.080]   them a platform for that.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:43.440]   But my favorite thing, apart from that, I could talk about specific apps, but I really
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.200]   always like going to the people who are there because they're hungry.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.960]   They're not there because it's what they do to collect a check, no offense.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.760]   But when you go to the Microsoft booth and you see like a hundred people in polo shirts,
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.120]   it's not the same as somebody who spent a bunch of dough to come there and go like,
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.200]   I care intensely about this app.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.000]   So I'll always love that, you know?
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.200]   I will say the worst thing there was the Microsoft Dancing Excel logo.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.200]   Oh God, that was disturbing.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.200]   I missed that.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.200]   I missed that.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.200]   It was like, bummer shots.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.200]   It was like corporate moment shots.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.200]   Bummer shots.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.200]   Bad moment shots.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.200]   Look at me on Microsoft.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.400]   I don't know who they were.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.760]   You know, is that the business user they were going for there?
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.160]   I don't know exactly what that was.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.160]   I like all the hang, you know, all of your favorites.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.160]   What was your favorite part of Backbridge?
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.160]   Well, my favorite is generally the stuff like the Twit meetup.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.480]   And we're the, you know, the, the, that was awesome.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.600]   Well, thanks to my rejoice for putting that to go.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.600]   Those are the kind of things.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.040]   And there was, there was one that I just got the tail end up, which was the podcasting
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.040]   meetup.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:40.200]   There was, you know, there was, there's all those kinds of things that everyone's in town.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:45.000]   And that's the thing that you can't reproduce with a virtual, you know, conference.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.240]   You can't reproduce with, with going online.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.200]   Well, that's the problem with conventions, right?
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.360]   Is that you could get the information online.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.360]   Right.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.520]   But you know, what you miss is that, that, you know, having those, you know, get togethers
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.520]   and seeing people.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.480]   I also thought, I hope they do something with the videos that they shot of, I know they
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.960]   didn't, you know, the, the Mac world live with you, but also like, I don't know if they
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.120]   could ever post what Kevin Smith said.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.120]   Was it wild?
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.120]   Oh my gosh.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.600]   It was, it was really funny.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.600]   It was very blue.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.440]   It was very impossible to ever post anywhere I think, but, but I'm sure he wouldn't care.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.600]   I felt guilty about Kiki's latex body suit.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.600]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.600]   That was nothing.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.000]   I can't even repeat what Kevin was talking about.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.400]   But the, and then, you know, I only got a, we were shooting, so I only got to stick my
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:32.440]   head in, but it looked like the, the video of the 20 year Photoshop with Russell Brown
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.040]   and David B. Edney.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.040]   And you know, there was a, you know, talking about really, these are the guys that were
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.600]   there at the beginning of Photoshop.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.040]   And you know, those are the kind of talks that I think are great.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.160]   Don't you have to buy to see some of that stuff?
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.920]   That was, I think some of that was conference pass.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.760]   Well, then they have to figure out what makes sense.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.760]   Cause some of those, I think some of those were opened and some of them weren't, you
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.760]   know, type of.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.280]   Kevin, Kevin and my keynotes, David's keynotes were all open to anybody.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.400]   And they were, yeah, we were sold out.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:01.280]   You couldn't get in F towards the end, but, uh, uh, I think to see things like that Photoshop
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.240]   20 years, you have to, I think I might have, I'm hoping that they're going to do something
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.240]   with those videos.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.960]   I think that there's an opportunity that are streamed those as well.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.160]   I'd love to see that.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.160]   So your favorite thing was people.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.160]   I think we're actually all in agreement.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.120]   That's the, for, for a conference, that is what makes it an opinion.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.840]   Andy, what do you think?
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.320]   Uh, I have a unique perspective because I'm there working.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.160]   So my perspective is kind of the flip side of what the exhibitors want to get.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:31.080]   I want to get the most bang for my buck, the ability to meet up with, I'll see a lot of
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.800]   people, a lot of things that I had not heard of, uh, either because they've been around
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.480]   for a while, they just haven't been on my radar.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.840]   I've never seen a live demo or heard someone talking about it or because it's just so
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.600]   new, uh, or for any of another, uh, million different reasons.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.760]   That's the stuff I want to see.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.120]   I want to have these opportunities that, you know, uh, I've, for a long, long time,
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:55.280]   I've been, it's been on my to-do list to stop looking at digital comics from a user perspective
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.240]   and just have, start those like really long, intensive.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   Okay.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.240]   You develop this.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.240]   Tell me what's on your mind.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.640]   Tell me what you're thinking when you're doing this.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.040]   So I was able to have really nice meetings with Iverse and panel fly.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.640]   Uh, they were showing me, uh, Iverse particularly was showing me, uh, what their
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.640]   iPad app is looking like right now.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.640]   Uh, it was a very, very valuable to me.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.880]   There's, these are the things where I would not, you know, pay a thousand bucks to fly
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:22.480]   out for one meeting, but I'd pay a thousand bucks to have 20, 30, 40 meetings plus hang
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.760]   out with friends plus feel as though I'm getting, I'm broadening my experience and my knowledge
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.960]   and plus feel as though I'm contributing to, uh, to a much, much larger thing.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.120]   Um, I really think that the, the selling point of Mac Roldex, who is the idea that you're
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.400]   going to boots on the ground is better than a hand on a mouse any day.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.480]   I talked to people from all over the world, people who came from New Jersey even who were,
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:47.120]   uh, who were really happy to be there and, and, and said this is, uh, we were at some
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.600]   of our T house and having a cup of tea, which was really fun.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.600]   That's a beautiful place.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:56.440]   Uh, upstairs from where the expo center is and, uh, uh, there was a woman there from Australia,
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.280]   a woman from Boston and a woman from New Jersey.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.240]   They said we've never met before in person, but we were old friends online and we thought
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.680]   what better place to meet the Mac world.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.520]   So that they all came and they were, and I said, well, was, was a trip worth it?
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.520]   They said, absolutely.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.520]   I mean, Australia.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.840]   Well, and I think that continuing to encourage that kind of, um, thing, I think that's one,
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.200]   I mean, I sometimes keep on talking too much about it, but like when I went to Ted Africa,
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.120]   uh, you know, what really made it, what made it work was these huge hour and a half breaks
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.560]   between every talk, every set of talks that people could just sit there and hang out and
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.560]   and network.
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.720]   And I think no matter how you do it, finding ways for people to finding lots and lots of
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:34.440]   ways for people to network with each other makes the, makes the convention, uh, or the
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.680]   conference, uh, relevant.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:40.800]   Well, you're quite right there and I'm talking on my budget just a little bit but my understanding
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.260]   of the way that a lot of the serious dough transpires at these things.
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.760]   If you think about where the really serious dough comes from it's not going to come from
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.040]   a guy with a cool iPhone app who spends $1200.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.260]   I always follow my Got Pro as my whipping boy for these things.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.640]   Anybody who gets a giant booth at one of these things because what are you going to do?
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.960]   You're going to bring in a lot of people.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.880]   A lot of the people you're not going to see in the booth, in a polo shirt, is the business
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:10.280]   development people who are there to talk to other business development people.
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.360]   Every conference I've ever been to, now, Mac, obviously it's more consumer focus but every
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:18.240]   trade show I've ever worked at it's been all about business relationships and the reason
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.320]   you go is because everybody's there.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.240]   So when you say networking, I think that's one way you have to measure the longevity of
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:29.360]   whatever this is is if you're going to try and make a play to bring in a phalanx of guys
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.120]   in Brooks Brothers, they're whatever.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.560]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.520]   You have to have a network effect for that to happen.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.280]   It really has to, for a show like that to be successful, it has to be like an episode
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.680]   of the love boat where you're going to have multiple intersecting story lines, so to speak.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.960]   You've got the business band who's trying to keep the software company afloat.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.640]   You've got the user who wants to learn something.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.720]   You've got the media person who wants to get interviews in line.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.760]   If it's just about user training, that's fine.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.640]   You can rent a Ramada in for a lot less money than it costs it stays in Mac world expo.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.200]   If you want to make it for a media event, well again, you can rent out a hall and have
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.880]   a big press event for a lot less money than that on and on.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.000]   It really does have to be four or five different shows at once.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.440]   I really can't think of a single area in which 2010 didn't at least meet the USDA federally
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.240]   mandated minimums on each one of those categories.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:23.600]   One thing that I do think that not just Mac world, but Mac world and CES and NAB need to
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.880]   start looking at is co-opting what we're really seeing with stuff like showstoppers, which
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.400]   is that they should be doing that.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.320]   They shouldn't wait for another firm to do that, which is-
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.320]   What is that?
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:40.080]   Showstoppers has built up for people who don't want to spend money on the booth.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:48.520]   What they're doing is they'll rent out a big area, usually a hotel, a ballroom or whatever.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:54.520]   All of these guys for three or four thousand dollars can get the table and everyone there
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.720]   is press.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.640]   You have to be registered press.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.360]   They're actually pretty particular about it.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.240]   There's really good food and it's this whole different little world.
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.680]   I didn't even know about it until CES.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.760]   Everyone's got their little booth.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:14.280]   When you see all the stuff from CNN or CES or different companies, they're just walking
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.800]   through showstoppers because it's a one-stop shop.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.720]   Some people have booths in all sort of there, but a lot of people don't get the booths and
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.720]   are there.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:25.000]   I think that that's something that it's much easier for press to cover it.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.480]   I think that the conference itself should create that rather than have it necessarily
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.680]   done by a third party.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:39.800]   What if our IDG says, "Our business model, our business requires more attendees or more
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.600]   booths or whatever we're going to..."
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.800]   As they did in Boston, we're just going to stop doing Macworld Expo.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.800]   Well, we'll do it.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:46.800]   Well, that's the question.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.640]   Would it be worthwhile for somebody like you to pick it up?
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.640]   The only reason we didn't do one this year is because Paul said we're doing one next
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.640]   year.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.640]   I wouldn't do one.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.640]   I wouldn't do it.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.560]   It wouldn't look like a gnome deck, for instance.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:05.120]   But I would absolutely take it on if IDG stopped.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.120]   We wouldn't let a year go by.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.080]   No, CES was going to be dying when we went to CES.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.080]   It was doing very well.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.640]   There is some room for trade shows like this, but now CES covers 100 different industries.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.080]   Macworld Expo, unfortunately, relies on a really narrow niche, which is Apple.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.320]   With Apple's support.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.840]   The niche is getting wider and wider.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:28.440]   Next year, you already saw how much impact iPhone had, not just iPhone cases, but iPhone
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.080]   software and iPhone hardware.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:35.560]   Now that we're going to add on iPad software, iPad hardware, iPad accessories, I think this
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.040]   is a growing crop proposition.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.240]   Yeah, and actually, I believe that one of the reasons it was a small show, and it seemed
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:46.560]   to me a little less exciting than it had been in the past, is that everybody...
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.560]   The iPad...
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.240]   Apple had kind of almost taken the wind out of their sales by announcing the iPad but
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.920]   not having any more information about it.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.400]   Sometimes I wonder if that was on purpose.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.400]   I wasn't.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.400]   They don't care that much.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.400]   That would be...
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.400]   I mean, come on, they don't really...
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.160]   I think it's not even on a race rating.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.680]   But I think by announcing the iPad and saying it'll be out in two months and then that's
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.240]   it, a lot of what we've been deciding about that...
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.240]   What?
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.240]   The next week is a month after the next...
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.240]   Two months, they said 60 days.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.400]   Oh, in 60 days, I thought it was 30 days.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.800]   I thought it was 60 days to...
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.800]   My heart just like what?
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.800]   What?
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.800]   No, it was 60 days.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.800]   It was 60 days, never mind.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.520]   The other part of that though is that I think you guys have both...
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.560]   I've all gotten at this but I'm overtly sad.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.560]   I think it's...
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.920]   If I were gonna start over tomorrow, I would make it three different shows, one of which
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.200]   already exists twice in some ways.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:41.280]   The developer highlighting piece of it is kind of already taken care of in some sense
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.520]   by WWDC and C4, which are both doing a fantastic job.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.520]   What's C4?
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.000]   You know, was it Wolf Ranch?
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Is that his name?
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   The guy who does the...
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.400]   It's like the kind of the go to hip-mat conference.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.520]   It's up there with WWDC in terms of hard drinking.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.200]   Everybody goes fun.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.800]   And I think there's two other ones.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:06.600]   And one of these is one that I am talking to a ton of different people to work on.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.040]   So there's the development piece.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.040]   There's the...
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.720]   I think there's just an iPhone and mobility and not Mac stuff piece.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.480]   Calling it Mac world in some ways, I get the equity at this point.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.960]   That's why you call it Mac world.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:20.680]   But at the same point, I just have to guess that in the area that's gonna be likely to
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.520]   grow the most, not the area that's staying the same, not the true believers, but the
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:29.560]   area of growth is gonna be with people who don't regard themselves as Apple fans.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.560]   Sorry.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.000]   If you're somebody who bought an iPhone this year, there's a really good chance you don't
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   consider yourself to be an Apple person or a Mac person.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.520]   Another third one is creative work.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:42.200]   And I think that's what I'm super interested in, is looking at the people, how the Scott
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:48.320]   Borne type sessions, learning how to do stuff, how to make things, and making connections
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.800]   with the people who you respect and admire who make those things.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.760]   So I think those could be different conferences.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:54.960]   I agree with Andy though.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.120]   I mean, the years that you go to these things, you leave with a cold and feeling overwhelmed
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.680]   just because it's just been such a wash of fun stuff from every angle.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.680]   You see everybody.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:10.040]   It's just that it's hard to make a tent that big that's sustainable and scalable.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.040]   All right.
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.040]   Well, I stand corrected.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.800]   You sound no, no, no.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.840]   I'm curious, Leo, because you sound like I would explore more of how you feel.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.040]   You feel like you're kind of like, man, I don't know.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.400]   You sound like you just weren't at that end to it.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.400]   No.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.400]   I think with it.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.400]   I got you.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.400]   Got your go.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.400]   What's your beef?
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.400]   What's your go?
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.400]   Well, I wandered around for half an hour.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.400]   I mean, I like seeing the people.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.400]   Of course, that's great.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.400]   I'm in a little different position.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.560]   I talk to you guys and I see you guys all the time.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.160]   So I don't, you know, no novelty.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.160]   No novelty there.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:44.160]   God knows.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.840]   It just didn't, it wasn't compelling to me.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:49.760]   And I just, I felt like if somebody came all the way from Australia to see this and saw
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.160]   it all in half an hour, that it might be a little bit of a disappointment for them.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.160]   I mean, I guess it wasn't.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.160]   I asked a lot.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.240]   If it was only for Expo, but I think if you're coming from all, you're going to pay to come
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.240]   from all the way from Australia.
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.920]   I think most of those people had conference passes.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.280]   I don't know if I'd come all the way from Australia to be the expert.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.280]   I did not, I did not go to the, any, I went for one day.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.800]   I didn't go to the conferences.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.280]   You know, so I probably missed what all the fun was all about.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.280]   And I know the conferences are great.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.800]   What do you think the growth is though, Leo?
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.280]   I mean, I'm getting so interested.
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.320]   Actually, Brett Simmons from, you know, Net News Wire, from News Gateway.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.720]   Had a wonderful post the other day about why.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.720]   Did you guys see this?
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:24.720]   Why he thinks developers was, it was basically he wrote an email to a friend of his who's
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.880]   a developer that he redacted.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.960]   But he was saying like, why I think we should all go totally snow leopard.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.040]   And he had this list of really, really interesting reasons.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.480]   You know, a lot of having to do with support costs and ability to innovate.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.520]   He said the most interesting thing that's so obvious, but so smart.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.120]   He's like never developed for an OS.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.360]   It's shrinking rather than growing.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.360]   Right.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.840]   Because the more cycles that you burn on something that you never haven't realized yet
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.840]   is dead.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.840]   And we see where I'm going with this.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:50.840]   So Leo, I'm curious.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.760]   If you, if you, Paul Kent came to you and you know, took you out to Tonkali Kia's little
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:59.480]   sandwich restaurant around the corner and said, Hey, what do I do?
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.760]   Where is the growth and how do I leverage that?
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.760]   What would you say?
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.440]   Well, he essentially asked us all that last year and we said, community.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.440]   I think you're very clear community.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.440]   Exactly.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.440]   Exactly.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.400]   And you know, I put a vote in for the conferences because I know that a lot of people get a
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.800]   lot out of those conferences.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.200]   I've never gone to the conferences.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:23.040]   I don't have the time, but I'm not, I'm not a professional Photoshop user or a prof, you
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:26.360]   know, I would have loved to have gone to some aperture classes because I started using
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.840]   aperture three, but I didn't, I just don't have time.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:33.280]   So I guess community, but that, but the question then is begs the question, well, do you need
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.320]   all of this for that?
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.440]   I mean, do you need to do a big trade show for community?
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.440]   I don't, I don't know if you do.
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:42.040]   I, I think that, you know, I thought, I thought about it a lot last week and I think that
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:46.440]   if I was, if I was doing Mac world, which you could be, who knows?
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:50.400]   Yeah, is, is that I would, you know, for me, I, I'd have it be a three day event.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.480]   The first day event is just, is just press.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.320]   So you have a big, you have a bunch of press meetings and you have them going through the
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.400]   no booth can be more than 10 by 10.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.880]   So every booth is the same.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.880]   It doesn't matter whether you're a file maker or a Microsoft or, or an independent developer.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.280]   You can make ones that are smaller than 10 by 10, but the maximum size is 10 by 10.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:11.000]   So you have a much smaller footprint and it makes it easier for people to get around.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.320]   It makes it more equal for independent developers.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:19.040]   And then what I would do is have two days, the second two days I'd have be a very Ted-like,
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:25.680]   you know, lots of lots of 20, 20 minute presentations split up by hour and a half breaks where people
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.800]   can sit there and chat with each other and go through the booths.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.760]   And you know, so it's two, two, you know, two days of that.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.480]   What I would do is I'd have like two hour sections where we're going to talk about max
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.760]   being used in science, max being used in art, max being used in education, max being used
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:40.760]   in these sections.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:44.120]   You're saying those become more like, rather than being like, if you look at the schedule
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.720]   for these things, yeah, rather than it's like, it's like a stack of Oreo.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.280]   It'd be one big experience, the one big experience.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.560]   Or there'd be an expert, you could get an expo and you just just go look at the, the
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.520]   little 10 by 10 booths or this conference and I charge a reasonable amount of money for
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.520]   it.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.800]   And it would all be in one big, it'd be like the Palace of Fine Arts, it'd be a thousand
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.040]   seats, that's it.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:06.680]   You know, and we're all going to experience how max are used all the way across the spectrum
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.480]   from how they're, they're developed and you get an hour and a half.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:14.240]   You know, but it becomes a unified experience among a thousand people that they, then they
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.240]   get big chunks of time to do it.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.240]   You know, it'd be different.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:21.120]   It'd be much smaller experience, but I think that that community would be developed.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.240]   I would enjoy that as a separate event.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:27.680]   I don't think it would fulfill the same sort of role that Mac Rolex does because a thousand
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.320]   people, that's, that's a hell of a small group of people.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.960]   That's a very small sample.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:37.200]   And also it's probably, if once you start limiting the tenants like that, the group tends to
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:43.160]   self select to us, those people who are most motivated or best scheduled or can easily,
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.400]   can most immediately make the purchase decision.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.600]   I still leave it open to the expo, the people can come in and look at, you know, there's
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.400]   still be an expo and it would be smaller booths, but there's still be an expo.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.920]   And that would be open to as many people that want to come in as possible.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.120]   But I don't think there's that many more than a thousand people doing the expo now.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.120]   Look how much they do.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:02.800]   I do like the idea of having like a day one, at least an unlimited set, a press and, press
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.000]   an industry only version of it.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.920]   They do that when Comic Con and San Diego started getting way out of hand.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:13.120]   They started adding another day that was only for people who were exhibitors and only
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.840]   for people who are registered media.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:19.520]   So everybody, everybody who needs to conduct business there in theory gets one day of the
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:24.800]   show all of themselves before like the 400 pound guy dresses bat woman, you know, starts
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.680]   to clogging up the aisles and with his four long boxes full of comics.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.120]   I want to make a, I want to make one quick.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.120]   Yeah, we're going to move on.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.120]   Go ahead.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.120]   One more point.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.120]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.880]   I just, I had this idea in my head of this paradox that goes way beyond Mac world.
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:41.080]   And I think it's germane to a lot of stuff that each of us cares about a lot.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:44.440]   And it's just this that there's, there's a trade off.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.800]   Um, first of all, we just take it as red that things change.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.160]   Everything evolves and you can't just keep things the way you are and you can't just
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.760]   say, well, I like the six cell spreadsheets.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.120]   So I'm going to run the rest of my life based on what fits in here.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:58.920]   I think that there's a trade off that everybody has to accept or should accept, which is that
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:02.280]   ideally you can be big and flexible.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:06.680]   Um, but really you kind of have to pick one, like you can be really big or you can be really
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:07.680]   flexible.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.200]   And once you commit to being really, really big, you have to make, like for example, I'll
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.840]   tell you why it wasn't in West, I will guess it's because they booked that thing.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.480]   They probably booked years ahead and had no flexibility.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.160]   I'm going to guess it's just that you can, you have more if you want to be flexible,
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.800]   but don't care how big you are.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:27.280]   You have so many more interesting choices because A, the barrier for failure is less
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.280]   harrowing.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.760]   Do you know what I mean, Leo?
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.680]   It's like the problem becomes you go like, Oh, when we keep talking about what is Macworld?
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:36.600]   Well, Macworld is this giant thing that we don't know to cities, but it's like, I think
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:41.240]   the key is to say, you know what, I'm willing to give up being quote unquote big in the
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.960]   interest of finding out what's going to work for the actual people who care about this,
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.600]   rather than just kind of keeping my Excel spreadsheet the way it is.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.720]   I think that's true for music.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.720]   I think it's true for anybody.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:53.880]   You can take out the factor of big, flexible, it gets so much easier to do.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.680]   But more expensive, Ted cost $6,000 to attend.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.320]   I mean, you have to pay for the whole.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.400]   It just depends on, but Ted is also top notch everything.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.600]   I mean, it's, it's, you have to pay for the whole.
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:05.600]   How much you charge?
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:06.600]   The whole is in that expensive.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.600]   It's not that expensive.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.600]   Okay.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:12.000]   If I had six, if I had six booths, I could get the Palace of Fine Arts for three days.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   Okay.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   You're describing the pod thing you guys did, which was awesome.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   The, that pod changed.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   GMT.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   That was fantastic.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   That was so well done.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   So many people enjoyed that.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   And that was a fun.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   And that was only a hundred people.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.760]   Start, start conference, the Dean and his people did a couple of years ago.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.760]   That's my model.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.640]   It's like, there's one stage and then there's coffee outside.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.640]   I actually agree with you.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.080]   And the Malabi Khan becomes very important.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.080]   The conference outside.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.000]   That, that's an un, it's almost an unconference.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.560]   The biggest complaint we had about Gear Media Tech when we did it was not that we didn't
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:37.560]   give people enough information.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.280]   It was that we didn't give them enough breaks so they could talk to each other.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.000]   That was the number one, like it was, I thought, which I found fascinating.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.720]   I was, I, all I was worried about is people get their money's worth.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:49.960]   I think Ted is the same thing that the conversations that, it's what you go for.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.440]   It's the most, it's, it's, because then it doesn't, you know, watching the Ted online
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:58.960]   doesn't really matter to Ted because they know that the value is that you're there talking
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.880]   to people about what, what it was.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.120]   And it wasn't that, you know, that, that wasn't the fact that, you know, the founders
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.480]   of Google were sitting next to me or Bono was in front of me.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:09.480]   It was the other people that I was talking to that were, you know, that were working.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.480]   You were Ted?
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.480]   Ted, Ted, Ted Africa.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.480]   Oh, the, the Africa, yeah.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.360]   But Larry Page is like, you know, next to me.
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:19.280]   Bono was in front of it front, you know, and, and, but those were the people that I was
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.520]   talking to on the breaks.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:25.880]   The people I were talking to were doing research in Uganda and, and Rwanda was the head of
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:26.880]   IT in Rwanda.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.400]   You know, those are the people that I was really fascinated to talk to, you know, right?
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.400]   All right.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.680]   Well, I, you know, I think this is a great conversation.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.520]   I'm sure Paul can't's listening with, with great interest.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.520]   Right.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:40.200]   And this is the kind of thing they must be discussing like crazy for next year.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   I don't know what they're talking about.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:45.400]   They let us know because I'm, I, I put it out there that I'm, I'm happy to support Mac
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.120]   World and we're there.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.120]   If they're there, we're there.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.320]   We're going to be building it.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.080]   If they're not there, we will be there.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.080]   What we're not.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:56.720]   We're so what you're saying, if I may paraphrase is we'll support the Mac community.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.120]   But what's happened is the Mac community has changed quite a bit because they're, and
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.840]   I think this is what Apple is saying is that Apple is now in a consumer electronics business
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:03.840]   and much more important.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:10.000]   It is its phone, its iPod and its iPad, which is something that you don't get devotays coming
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.200]   to a conference to talk about.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.680]   Their business is really now a consumer business.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.880]   They don't need the enthusiasts that they used to rely on.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.920]   But we talk to the enthusiasts.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:21.920]   We care about them.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.920]   We are them.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.520]   Well, I think this was, this was something that we were talking about, that I was ranting
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:30.120]   them out over the weekend, which was the, the, I hadn't been to the App Store for a little
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.120]   while.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.120]   Right.
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.560]   And I realized that, you know, Apple has completely redesigned it.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.360]   Have you guys noticed the reason I stopped?
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.360]   Okay.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.360]   We're going to talk about that.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:39.920]   We're going to talk about the fact that a lot of the, I know you, I know you, I know
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.920]   you're really excited about this.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:41.920]   All right.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:42.920]   He wants to rant.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.520]   And we're also going to talk, but we, we, we got to move on.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.640]   We also going to talk a little bit about the fact that the phone companies want to do
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.400]   their own App Store.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:58.320]   There's some news about Apple's market share that is very good news and a lot more still
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.320]   to come.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:05.040]   We are talking about Macintosh as a Mac break weekly with Andy Anatko, Merlin Mann and Alex
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.040]   Lindsey.
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.800]   Before we go on though, I do want to mention our friends that go to meeting from Citrix.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.160]   Go to meeting is the great meeting software, Mac and Windows.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:16.120]   In fact, one of the beauties of go to meeting, unlike a lot of the online meeting software
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:20.000]   you can choose is that it, it operates beautifully.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.880]   So you can hold a meeting on your Mac for Windows users.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.440]   You can hold a meeting on your Windows machines.
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.360]   Well, I don't know why you'd want to, but you could for Mac users.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.520]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:33.200]   It is a beautiful product from folks who really know what they're doing.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.760]   The folks at Citrix and I'm going to give you a chance to try it absolutely free for
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.760]   a month so you can have as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.760]   No, watching the clock, no counting the meetings and you can start today.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.760]   Go to go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.640]   In fact, if you've got a meeting coming up, just try it.
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.640]   This would be good.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:55.200]   You know, one of those teleconferences that you know that I'm online with Andy and Alex
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.520]   and Merlin and Alex is playing Tetris.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:04.480]   Merlin's checking his email because he wants inbox zero and he's looking at the birds.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.120]   It's just, you know, there's nobody paying attention.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.800]   With go to meeting, you give him some to focus on.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.000]   You give him a look at your desktop in real time.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.840]   You can collaborate on documents together.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.760]   You can let them control your desktop.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.120]   So it's great for training and they can switch it.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.800]   So they're showing you their presentation.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.800]   It's just fantastic.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.800]   Say it.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.800]   Give me a data point.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:22.800]   Give me a data point, dude.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.120]   I'm going to give you a data point on that.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.560]   This is an unpaid, well, it's kind of paid.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.640]   I guess I could pay for this.
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.640]   So disclose whatever.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:28.640]   It's slightly paid.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.720]   Here's my data point on that.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.880]   I started doing the inbox zero talk in whatever 2006.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:35.880]   This is kind of my job now.
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:36.880]   People come.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:37.880]   I do these talks.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:38.880]   I go in.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:42.240]   Can I just say that like in the last year in particular, I felt this incredible shift
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:46.880]   where I go to a company and yeah, you know, email has almost has become this thing almost
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.800]   like petty crime where people are like, well, it sucks.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.040]   But you know, I'm never going to make it go away.
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.040]   Meetings.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.600]   Meetings are the thing and everybody is losing it about.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:59.680]   I haven't used good at meeting, but I'm just going to say that it's interesting to me
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:04.840]   that like there's people out there are scrambling for a solution because I know a lot of people,
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:09.720]   including my lady when she was working at UC seven hours a day in meetings that you
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.480]   don't even have time to do anything of meeting.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.840]   This makes them efficient.
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:16.880]   And don't even don't even start about the travel.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.840]   Don't even start about the travel.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.520]   You know, and so in fact, I'll give you a data point.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.800]   According to American Express, they have this in the copy here.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:28.320]   The average cost of a business trip is $1,000 for one trip.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:29.320]   So this is $49 a month.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.800]   Yeah, it can cause more.
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:35.040]   We're definitely moving more and more to these kind of online rates.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.040]   It's just really nice.
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.040]   Well, this is the one.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.040]   Try it.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.440]   Go to go to meeting.com/macbreak and that's all I'm going to say.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.400]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.600]   We thank them for their support.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:49.600]   Some data points, some news stories.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:54.760]   Some big news stories actually Verizon has announced that it is going to allow unlimited
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:59.880]   Skype over 3G on some of its phones.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.680]   A little bit to AT&T.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.400]   I think it's pretty exciting.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.040]   That's amazing.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.040]   And that's something that you keep.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.040]   That's throwing some lumber around there.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.880]   That's saying we got space to burn.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:10.880]   Go nuts.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.880]   It is.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.120]   You know, that's the, that is like semiotics.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:17.120]   That's the semiotics of it is AT&T doesn't have the bandwidth we do.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:21.320]   Well, you know, on the flip side, they, I, it's, there's the other big announcement for
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.880]   the past few days of bandwidth hogging is that sling box, sling player is going to
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:30.040]   be available for over 3G streaming, that's streaming audio and video.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:34.960]   That's, they'll kick any, any Skype audio, audio chat bandwidth built up to the floor.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:35.960]   And that's AT&T.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:39.640]   In fact, my sources of sling say that it was AT&T that were landed on that that said,
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.960]   okay, you can do 3G.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:48.080]   The funny thing is you'd been able to do 3G on the sling app on, on a blackberry on AT&T
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:51.300]   on, you know, I mean, it's, so it's, for some reason they just were worried about
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.300]   the iPhone.
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.300]   But yeah, that should be in the store.
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:54.300]   I think that staged last night.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.200]   So that should be in the store or the night before that should be in the store.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:45:01.200]   Now if you want to upgrade your sling player, also on a blackberry, you know, talking via
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.200]   voice is still considered a very cool thing.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.280]   It's true.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.440]   It's true.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.760]   Another story.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.760]   And we'll tie this to your rant, Alex.
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:15.200]   AT&T and others are announcing their want to do an app store themselves.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.640]   I don't understand that.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.640]   Who has that story?
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.640]   Who knows about that?
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.420]   I think Merlin knows more about it than- What's going on, Merlin?
[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.180]   Well, in my weekly, okay, let me type a little.
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:28.740]   I'm just pulling up my notes on this that I prepared for an hour before.
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.420]   As usual, I got a second week in a row.
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:31.700]   I guess this is from Michael Sippy.
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:32.700]   I saw this.
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.620]   And it's based on, I think, Groover talked about it too.
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.380]   Are we talking about the same thing here?
[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:40.580]   It's an interest in the carriers and going out- Well, this was announced, I think, at
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.580]   Barcelona.
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:42.580]   So this was on Marketplace yesterday.
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:43.580]   Yeah, yesterday.
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:48.620]   So it's a major new app store, according to this CNN interview.
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:54.440]   So the idea is to have an app store that everyone can use.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.240]   So all the other characters, all the other smartphones, everything, trying to build this
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.840]   kind of Uber app store, rather than each one.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:02.600]   I think each one of them have realized that by themselves, they're going to have a hard
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.880]   time competing with the Apple app store.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:09.120]   So what they're doing is they're trying to get all together so they can all make it work.
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:15.200]   I think that the big challenge there, of course, is going to be still not going to be the same
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.400]   applications for the same.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.600]   So you still have to sort through which application.
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:22.320]   Yeah, it's an NBC selling PAL VHSs or something.
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.320]   Like, yeah, it's interesting.
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:26.000]   You might make some dough, but I'm not really sure that goes to your core competency.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.720]   Let alone solves the problem.
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.120]   Couldn't you, Joe, though, I mean, if I go there on my iPhone, it would just show me
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.120]   iPhone apps.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.120]   I'm sure it's smart enough to do that.
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.200]   Well, it's not going to show you any iPhone apps because you can't buy the iPhone apps
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.200]   there.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.880]   So it's only going to show you your Android apps.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:42.900]   I mean, everyone's trying to, everyone, including companies like Adobe, I mean, Adobe has been
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:46.800]   talking a lot about Flash on the Android this week, you know, during this big conference
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:47.800]   in Spain.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:52.300]   You know, they're really trying to, you know, show that Flash is available on every smartphone,
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:55.420]   except for, you know, the iPhone.
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:47:02.300]   Because I think that Adobe is getting more worried about the ramifications of a Flashless,
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:03.300]   you know.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:07.700]   Well, in fact, you know, five Adobe's working hard to block HTML.
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:09.700]   That's John's been talking about that.
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:14.500]   It's not necessarily AT&T after that got traction made of very, very unequivocal comments saying
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:15.500]   we're not blocking it.
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.500]   We have no opposition to it.
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:18.900]   We're like, we'd like it to keep going.
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.700]   Can we make it any more clear than that?
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:21.700]   No.
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:22.700]   Okay.
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:23.700]   Then let's move on.
[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:26.860]   And as yet, no one has come up to someone saying, well, yes, you are blocking it.
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:32.460]   So that they're either lying or butts off sticking out their neck very, very far or someone is
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:37.100]   sort of misinterpreting why certain why the HTML5 standard hasn't been officially, you
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:39.300]   know, stamped into brass yet.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:48.100]   John Nock in his Adobe blog says in a word, I can't say the word BS.
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:49.900]   Adobe is sabotaging HTML5 BS.
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:55.420]   He says, here's a clarifying comment from Adobe Rep. Larry Massenter.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:48:01.220]   No part of HTML5 is or ever was blocked in the W3C HTML working group, not HTML5, not
[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:05.140]   Canvas 2D graphics, not micro data, not video, not by me, not by Adobe.
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:06.140]   Neither.
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:07.140]   This is pretty unequivocal.
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:12.340]   Adobe nor I oppose our fighting are trying to stop, slow down, hinder, oppose our harm
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:13.340]   HTML5.
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:16.340]   He seemed to have touched a nerve there.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.340]   Yeah.
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:18.340]   Okay.
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:19.340]   So I'll never mind.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:22.140]   I'll drop that line of attack.
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:26.820]   Speaking of attack, Apple's redesign, you say the, the, and I don't know when this, this
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:27.820]   travesty happened.
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:31.660]   I just want to say that it, you know, so I don't know, you know, I have to admit that
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:33.540]   I've been very busy over the last few months.
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:36.300]   And so it could have been, you know, and I have to, you know, we're doing a lot of stuff.
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:37.300]   We published stuff.
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.060]   We, we, we were, and I worry about pixx.tv.
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.380]   I don't go to the iTunes store that often.
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:45.500]   Usually when I find out about a, about an application or it's from a webpage or it's
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:50.140]   from PR or someone sending me an email, you know, so, so I don't go and try to actually
[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:51.140]   find something.
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:54.100]   And so over the weekend, I thought maybe I'm just going to go browse a little bit.
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:57.060]   I'm thinking about what I want to do as a picks for the week and I was inspired by Mac
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:03.220]   World and I go, I go up to iTunes and I realize that Apple has basically buried any way of
[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.540]   getting to verticals.
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:10.700]   So like for instance, if you want to try to find tech podcasts in the, in try to find
[00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:13.020]   tech podcasts in the iTunes store.
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:14.700]   You can't do that anymore.
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:15.700]   It's it.
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:20.900]   Well, you can, what you can do, you can't do it without kind of what you can do is you
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:23.060]   can search for, you can search for.
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.060]   All right.
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:25.060]   So I'm, I'm okay.
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:26.060]   I'm going to go to the iTunes store.
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:27.060]   Don't, don't, don't do a search.
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:28.060]   I'm going to go to podcasts.
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:29.620]   I'm on the, I'm in the directory right now.
[00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:30.620]   Okay.
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:31.620]   Let me know if I'm, if I'm maybe I.
[00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:32.620]   Examine it.
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.260]   Or let's see feature.
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:36.940]   So what you're saying is I'm going to search, I mean, they don't have the category.
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:37.940]   They have publishers.
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:40.100]   The category used to be, there's publishers down the side here.
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:41.100]   It is.
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:42.100]   It has power search.
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.100]   Let's see, power search, podcasts.
[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:44.100]   Yeah, there's category.
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:45.100]   Let's see.
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:46.100]   You're right.
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:47.100]   It's buried.
[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.460]   Go to, go to the podcast drop down menu and there's technology.
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:50.460]   Yeah.
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:51.460]   It's just more buried.
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:52.660]   It's just that they buried it.
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:56.780]   They're burying a lot of the, I mean, it just it, what I was surprised at is that it
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:00.340]   would, it used to be on the surface where you could just very quickly find, you know,
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:05.260]   what, and I, and here's the thing is that, is that it's not that you can't get to it.
[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:10.220]   It's just that it's so buried that it greatly affects independent app developers.
[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:12.860]   It focuses on, on mass market.
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:13.860]   What is hot?
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:14.860]   Yeah.
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:15.860]   It gives more, it gives more.
[00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:16.860]   It's more overtly featured.
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:17.860]   What's been shared?
[00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:18.860]   Yeah.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:19.860]   Let's get back into the complaint you used to have.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:23.260]   Well, give the, this gets back to the complaint that you used to have about the arbitrary nature
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:27.900]   of, of, you know, the ability to control all of this now.
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:34.340]   You know, that's the, you know, because if you go into, if I go into the app store, see,
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:39.180]   once you click on the app store, you know, what I can see is I can see the top free apps,
[00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:42.580]   the top grossing apps, I can see the top top of everything.
[00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:46.660]   When you first got to that, there was a power search or whatever, but now, you know, in
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:50.220]   the main pages, all you're seeing is whatever Apple's promoting, you know, what is new and
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:54.180]   notable, what's hot, what's, there's no, there's, but I just, I, all I want to get to
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:57.820]   is for instance, I just want to get the productivity, you know, and I, and then go,
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:01.620]   go to the top, go to the top of the window, click on the app store, I dropped out many
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:05.300]   of those and you click on productivity and one click here and where's the, where's the,
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:06.300]   where's the productivity?
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:10.060]   See, see where it says app store on the black bar at the very, very top of the iTunes window.
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:11.060]   Right.
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:13.980]   See, now there's a, there's an arrow indicating a drop down menu.
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:14.980]   Never mind.
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:17.380]   Well, that was the shortest rant history.
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:20.460]   Well, here's the thing is that, is that, is that, so, so here's the thing.
[00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.060]   I, I, I, I, now you've learned a little something.
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:24.060]   I like to drag.
[00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:27.740]   So what happened was, is, is just so you know, I just, what I did is I clicked on
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:32.020]   the app store button and I get to the app stores and I don't see it at all.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:34.620]   What I didn't see was the little arrow until you pointed the role of the rare.
[00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.380]   No, I think it's not as obvious as it was.
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:38.100]   What was really, it used to be right down the side.
[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:39.100]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:40.100]   You know, you'd have, you know, all the,
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:41.100]   I'll back you on that.
[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:42.100]   It was, it was just as easy as it was.
[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:45.420]   And it just, it concerns me that it gets, you know, that it'll get hidden.
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:52.020]   So there is a little, a little chances that it's giving me for productivity apps include
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:57.020]   such great apps as fascinating girls, fascinating mates, fascinating teens.
[00:51:57.020 --> 00:51:58.660]   Well, that's productive in a certain way.
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:01.500]   Now, how does this crap, what's your, that makes you produce something?
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.980]   How does this crap get approved?
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:04.980]   Right.
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:08.260]   And stuff that I want, like Google voice get blocked.
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:09.260]   I don't understand.
[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:13.420]   Now I'm going to go off on a rant because, because those are incredibly unambitious programs
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:16.180]   that do nothing but display content.
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:17.180]   Whereas.
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:20.260]   So vaguely, vaguely are rated content.
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:22.700]   Well, vaguely are and that's okay.
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:24.340]   Softars, PG 13.
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:27.380]   No, I want porkies to level pornography.
[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:30.900]   We can get it, but you know, you want to say it's for showable.
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:35.260]   Like every time there's every time there's a storm and the storm and fury about an application
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:39.860]   being banned, usually it comes out that, well, here's this one piece of technology that Apple
[00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:41.580]   doesn't think works properly.
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:45.540]   This app decided to do an end run around it to get a really good feature going, but that
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:48.700]   really good feature is powered by something that could break very, very soon.
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.500]   Well, and just a minute, I'm going to announce my app pick of the week.
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:56.220]   It's fascinating queen, a collection of premium hot sexy and beautiful babes coming up a little
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:58.140]   later on on Mac break weekly.
[00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:01.620]   I mean, I just I'm glad it's in the store.
[00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:08.020]   You know, I want to I want to pick open source open source Gutenberg text version of Jane
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:09.820]   Austin number 760.
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:10.820]   That's hot.
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:13.660]   It's pretty much the same as every one of them, but that's the one that kills me.
[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:14.660]   Who's got his churn?
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:16.100]   How they get away with this?
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:17.100]   There's a lot of.
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:20.340]   He just grabbed everything off my project Gutenberg, wrap it and then put it on the store.
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.580]   I can't believe that somebody's not detecting that.
[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:24.260]   It's more like a penetration attack.
[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:27.940]   I can't believe they're not seeing one person uploading thousands and thousands and thousands
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:28.940]   of apps.
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:32.100]   You know, there's one really famous guy, I guess who is doing this.
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.540]   I don't know the guy's name, but it's huge.
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:35.940]   You go in and like it's it.
[00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:37.180]   I look at something like that.
[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:38.180]   Absar is up.
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:42.860]   I'm not here to pimp that, but it's interesting to me like it is really, really hard even with
[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.220]   keyword searches.
[00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.620]   People are doing what SEOs call keyword stuff.
[00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:51.060]   Where they will actually go after like somebody else who has a service mark or whatever or
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:55.420]   something, put differently something you really associate with a certain application.
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:59.660]   And you know, they're turning up looking exactly the same.
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:03.060]   In terms of usability and how Apple thinks and approaches it, I have to imagine at some
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:07.660]   point they're going to have to figure out a page rank like mechanism for getting that
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:08.660]   better.
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:10.140]   There's gotta be.
[00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:13.500]   You know, bubbling up interesting stuff because it is garbage.
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:14.500]   You're right, Leo.
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:15.500]   It is.
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:16.500]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:21.420]   So I think in a way we can back you, Alex, in saying that Apple's made it a little hard
[00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:24.580]   to find stuff or at least changing the UI.
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:29.660]   I feel like it was hard and now it's gotten much harder, which is fine if you're a mass
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:32.700]   market because you end up on top and you work through the promotion process and everything
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:33.700]   else.
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:34.700]   But I think it's hard.
[00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:38.340]   And the reason that I bring it up is that I do think it's our job to bring this up and
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:42.100]   to talk about it as a concern because, you know, I think a lot of people that are listening,
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:43.620]   this is this affects them.
[00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:47.660]   I don't, it's not, I don't know anybody who works there, but I'm just going to make,
[00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:51.780]   I'm going to make just a curious, I guess kind of a counter argument, which is if people
[00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:54.340]   really want to find tech podcasts, I don't think that's hard.
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:58.300]   I think I think that that's why tech podcast is a good category because those people will
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:54:59.300]   find it.
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:00.300]   Right.
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:01.300]   You know, I agree with you, Alex.
[00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:04.420]   I think this is a little bit what sort of similar what Leo was saying, you know, two
[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:08.140]   or three years ago for apps or whatever.
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:11.540]   I mean, for one thing they have done that's cool, I think, is they put stuff on the web
[00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:12.540]   now.
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:16.180]   So I'm still honest to God web page exists for every iPhone.
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:17.180]   Is that up now?
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:21.820]   Well, yeah, go to a search on like whatever one password or some, some app and you'll get
[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:22.820]   it will forward.
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:25.420]   It will attempt to auto forward to the iTunes store, at least for me.
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:30.140]   I guess it might have an I TMS protocol, but it there is an actual page.
[00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:33.220]   It's not one of those screwy things where Google lets you like have a fake page.
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:35.100]   It's really something else, which I hate.
[00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:36.780]   It is actually a page I believe.
[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:41.380]   Well, I do think, I do think it's important for developers to realize whether it's podcast,
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:45.300]   you know, producers or developers that they do have to have a web presence.
[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.740]   You can't just throw it on the app store.
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:50.220]   You have to find a way to promote it to your web page because the best way to get people
[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:54.300]   to your application or to your podcast will be from your web page.
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:57.820]   That's going to be your, you know, just putting it up on the store.
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:01.180]   It used to be getting on the store was going to get you sales and now getting on the store
[00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:03.580]   just is you're now getting into Walmart.
[00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:08.540]   You're not getting into some small shop where you're going to instantly do okay.
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:12.180]   So I just went into the search on, you can probably do a better keyword search than I
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:16.500]   did search for like one password, iPhone app store.
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.500]   Yeah, I did that.
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.660]   And then I get the one password web page.
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:20.660]   So I just look right.
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:24.940]   I think you directly to look for the iTunes dot apple dot com sub domain in on Google
[00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:26.740]   and click on that one.
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:27.940]   Oh, okay.
[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:28.940]   Good one password.
[00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:29.940]   So site.
[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:31.500]   I to ask you complicated.
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:35.620]   No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm doing all I search for is iPhone application one password and
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:39.420]   the fourth return is iTunes dot apple dot com dot, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, and
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:41.620]   when you click on that, I can send you the URL for this.
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:42.620]   No, I got it.
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:43.620]   I'm looking at it.
[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:44.620]   So that doesn't launch it ms.
[00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:46.060]   Oh, I see it does.
[00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:47.060]   There's a page.
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:51.300]   It will also bring up the iTunes as you can see there, but there's a page that if you don't
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:54.740]   have iTunes installed, for instance, gives you exactly the same content as you would get
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:55.740]   in iTunes.
[00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:56.740]   I see what you're saying.
[00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:59.260]   I think it would be smart because I can say one thing I I the iTunes preview they call
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:00.260]   it.
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:01.260]   I don't know.
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:02.260]   This is an earth thing.
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:03.660]   I don't mind the iTunes opening at all.
[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:07.340]   It's open all the time for me anyway, but it drives people crazy.
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:09.900]   If I do like a bitly link, it turns out to be the iTunes.
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:10.900]   Really?
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:15.100]   I don't know if that's because if you didn't want to program launch it, launch something
[00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:16.100]   that's true.
[00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:18.740]   You don't want to go to one second of idle curiosity and just turned into like you were
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:20.540]   just five or 10 seconds of launch.
[00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:21.540]   Okay.
[00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:22.540]   All right, fair enough.
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:25.260]   But I mean, that should show my brain to me that that's like opening a control panel
[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:26.260]   or whatever you call it convenience.
[00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.460]   No, no, I was I'm sorry.
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:29.460]   I was mocking.
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:32.980]   I meant literally even if it's five or 10 seconds, it's too much time.
[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:34.860]   If I did not want something to launch, right?
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:35.860]   Fail.
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:36.860]   Yeah, totally.
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:37.860]   I agree.
[00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:38.860]   I get that.
[00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:40.780]   So if you go to iTunes.apple.com, then I guess I presume it links off to a directory
[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:43.700]   of iTunes apps as well so that you could then go through.
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:44.700]   That's cool.
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:47.780]   Apple is such a terrific example of White Hat SEO.
[00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:51.140]   You know, all these douchebags are out there trying to get you to like fool you into looking
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:52.140]   at their site.
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:53.540]   Just go look at Apple's pages.
[00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:57.380]   I mean, obviously it helps that they get a giant amount of traffic and linking, but
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:58:00.100]   they're so smart about their Earl structure and all.
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:02.380]   I mean, it's really, really well done.
[00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:04.740]   I think it's one of the reasons they score so high is because they've done a really
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:09.820]   nice job with making a sensible human readable Earl structure.
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:11.740]   That's true.
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:12.740]   Other news.
[00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:13.740]   What are you know, it's Marty Groh.
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:14.740]   Happy Marty Groh.
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:15.740]   Fat Tuesday.
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:18.940]   We've all got to give up something for Lent.
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:24.860]   According to senior bishops in Great Britain, might be a good idea to give up technology.
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:27.220]   Maybe throw out your iPod.
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:30.060]   Senior bishops are calling for a personal carbon use for each of the 40 years.
[00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:34.460]   50 days of Lent, including less meat, flushing the toilet less often, cutting vegetables,
[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:39.700]   thinner so they cook faster and giving up television, cell phones and iPods.
[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:42.020]   It's carbon fast.
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:44.300]   I think I need to pick one.
[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:46.940]   I was thinking of giving up Twitter for Lent.
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:47.940]   I do it.
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:48.940]   It feels so good.
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:49.940]   I wasn't even Catholic.
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:52.060]   I just thought this is kind of a neat discipline, right?
[00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:53.060]   Leo, it feels so good.
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:54.940]   Put it in your host file, block it.
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:55.940]   Just do it for a month.
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:56.940]   You'll feel so good.
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:57.940]   You've done this.
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:00.660]   It's like five times.
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:01.660]   I can stop anytime.
[00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:02.660]   Exactly.
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:03.660]   What exactly is it?
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:04.660]   I can't talk to you.
[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:05.660]   Who is her Renee Descartes?
[00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:07.420]   And why do I care?
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:11.900]   Well, now that there's buzz, I could probably live with that Twitter.
[00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:13.460]   I would like to give up.
[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:14.460]   Really?
[00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:15.460]   Yeah.
[00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:16.460]   Do you really like buzz?
[00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:17.460]   Love buzz.
[00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:18.460]   I get really.
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:19.460]   Yeah.
[00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:20.460]   And everybody can comment on everything.
[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:21.460]   It's like friend feed, right?
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:22.460]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:23.460]   That's what I like it.
[00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:24.460]   I love friend feed too.
[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:25.460]   Yeah.
[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:26.460]   People love you though.
[00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:27.460]   People say nice things to you.
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:28.460]   But you get hostility.
[00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:29.460]   No, not really.
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:30.460]   Not really.
[00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:31.460]   No.
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:32.460]   Everybody loves you too.
[00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:33.460]   Stop it.
[00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:34.820]   I did one post just for fun.
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:37.700]   I was like, "Ha ha, my privacy is going away and I'm meeting a burrito."
[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:38.900]   I love that, by the way.
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:39.900]   That was hysterical.
[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:41.420]   That was a great post.
[00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:43.420]   I want to see more from Merlin.
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:46.260]   And where I am and what I'm pissing about on the internet.
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:47.260]   Yeah.
[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:48.260]   I've been doing that a lot.
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:50.460]   Because it's built into the Nexus One maps, the Google Maps.
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:51.940]   So there's a buzz app.
[00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:52.940]   Buzz the layer.
[00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:54.740]   Did you talk about this on all the other shows already?
[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:57.300]   You probably talked this to Death, the privacy stuff, right?
[00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:58.860]   We do a show called This Week in Google.
[00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:00.980]   We spend some time on that and then on Twitter as well.
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:02.820]   But they fix the privacy issues.
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:06.900]   They fix the thing where like, it was not clear to people that if you did that while
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:09.700]   you're in the maps app, it would be public.
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:10.700]   Well, that's--
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:11.700]   I don't know about that.
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:12.700]   I don't know about that.
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:14.660]   You know, my wife went to, she's pretty smart.
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:15.980]   She went to Bard in Santa Cruz.
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.580]   She's gone to school and stuff.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:21.180]   And she was like, "I have no idea how to, why am I following 14 people?
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:23.580]   I don't remember who this person is.
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:26.780]   I don't think it's transparent how that stuff is wired together."
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:27.780]   Anyway, sorry, rattle.
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:29.140]   No, I think you're right.
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:30.140]   I think Google--
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:31.380]   Well, that tends to be why I don't like--
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.380]   I mean, that's--
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:36.180]   Google engineers kind of say, oh, it's Maps application, of course.
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:40.780]   There's a-- I think there's a certain type of people.
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:42.780]   And we work with a bunch of them.
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:47.700]   That for them, the totally integrated Google environment, like the totally integrated Apple
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.900]   environment, for me, really, really works.
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:54.420]   And for them, everything being tied in, for me, it makes the way Google ties everything
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.500]   together makes me a little insane.
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.900]   So it's just a different personality.
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.740]   No, no, I agree with you.
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:01.740]   I think both are true.
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:04.500]   I wanted all together, but I wanted to choose what I wired together.
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:09.100]   Dana Boyd had a wonderful essay about-- on her wonderful site-- about how teenagers--
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:11.020]   everybody thinks teenagers don't care about privacy.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:14.020]   What teenagers care about is a high level of granularity in their privacy.
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.420]   And I happen to agree.
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:19.060]   In this instance, what I said to my lady was, well, you know, it's against Google's core
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:23.740]   competency, apart from selling ads, which is that they-- think about how many millions
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:27.580]   of people trust Google with their health information, with their personal information,
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:29.420]   with their everything information.
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:33.980]   And Gmail, in particular, is not an application that I use personally based on thinking whether
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:37.260]   anybody will want to track information as a result.
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:42.020]   And even if you're only triangulating by showing who people email to, that is huge.
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:47.140]   It's like, you know, if triangulating the three Starbucks nearest to my house, for example,
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:49.300]   would give you a pretty good idea where I live?
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:52.540]   If I've cared intensely about you not knowing, that would make me sad.
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:56.620]   But even more importantly, if you showed the three Starbucks I go to the most, if I had
[01:01:56.620 --> 01:02:00.140]   told somebody inaccurately that I'd stop drinking coffee, you're going to prove me a
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:01.140]   liar.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:03.740]   And I never, I never asked you to show that.
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:06.220]   That's-- you know, I don't think you can have that functionality.
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:08.060]   You just tell people, I want these things to talk.
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:09.060]   They do with Google Health.
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:11.860]   You have to log in every time to see Google Health.
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:14.700]   You have to log in every time to see Google history.
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:17.980]   They've added extra layers of protection to all of their most precious stuff.
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:20.780]   And I think location, especially for women, is like giant.
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:22.220]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:23.220]   And I'm sure that they'll respond.
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:27.020]   They were very quick to respond within a couple of days to the privacy issues on Buzz.
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.020]   And they made it opt-in.
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:31.380]   They made a much more visible button to let you know.
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:33.980]   Yeah, that's classic Google, though.
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:38.060]   Their greatest strength is that they understand how technology talks to technology.
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:41.260]   Their greatest feeling is that they haven't the slightest clue how human they interact
[01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:42.260]   with technology.
[01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:44.060]   That's the last thing they would ever think of.
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.060]   I think they admit that.
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:47.900]   And the implications of this feature we've just wired, and they just ship it.
[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:48.900]   Yeah.
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:49.900]   No, they admit that.
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:53.220]   Bloomberg literally cannot understand why this would bug anybody that they care so little
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:55.620]   about their own privacy as he does.
[01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:57.340]   It's astounding to me.
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:01.860]   Well, and the truth is, I think people who complain about privacy are still using Facebook
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:05.060]   and they really ought to start thinking a little harder.
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:08.340]   Yeah, but I mean, just because my name's in the film book doesn't mean I want people
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:09.340]   coming to my house.
[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:10.340]   Right.
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:11.980]   That's a good point.
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:15.740]   Well, yeah, I feel like once you get on the internet, you're giving up.
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:16.740]   How clear is it?
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:19.940]   You know, I'm doing a, I don't put stuff on the internet that I want to be private.
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:31.940]   I'm doing a seminar up here at the kids school called Wired Families Safe Kids, talking about
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:36.020]   this with my wife who's a psychotherapist and my daughter who's very wired about this
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:41.740]   exact issue to kind of expose to parents and kids the risks.
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:42.740]   Right.
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:47.220]   At the same time, you can't tell, I think it'd be a mistake to tell kids, don't get on the
[01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:48.220]   internet.
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:51.660]   I mean, that's like saying, you know, please don't learn to drive a car.
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:55.140]   You learn to drive a buggy because it kills your credibility to it makes you look completely
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:56.500]   out of touch.
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.980]   So so that's the question is how do you manage it?
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:00.980]   I think it's not an easy thing to do.
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:05.260]   But at least the most important thing I think is to at least raise awareness that when you
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:08.820]   are on the internet, you are exposing stuff.
[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:15.260]   Maybe, maybe Madeline should come because to this because it's the kind of thinking you
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:19.980]   have to generate and people saying, well, I'm using a maps app and I'm about to post
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:20.980]   on them.
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:23.540]   It does say very clearly on the maps app, your location with a dot.
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:24.820]   She hadn't even used it.
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:26.060]   She's just like everybody's talking about it.
[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:32.100]   I flip it on and suddenly people she doesn't know can tell who she's emailed.
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:36.180]   I mean, I mean, I guess I'll say the obvious thing that everybody else has said, what
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:39.020]   if you're cheating on your mate, what if you're looking for another job?
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:40.860]   Just by turning on the maps app that does that?
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:44.860]   No, just by flipping on the people they're guessing you should follow is based on who
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:45.860]   you are.
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:46.860]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:49.820]   So what they did is now when you say hello and they said you want to use buzz and you
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:55.260]   click yes, they show you a list of who they're proposing you follow with a check with check
[01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:58.460]   marks next to all of them and an OK box, but you can.
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.900]   They're effectively, I think, no, I don't know.
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:05.260]   Maybe they should try this with some other non sophisticated users, but it looks to me
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:08.540]   like they're saying, here's who we're going to have you follow.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:11.220]   They probably should have a big thing by following these people.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.140]   She defaulted to following 14.
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:15.020]   That was the first that was the first iteration.
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:16.020]   They changed that.
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:18.740]   Yes, they changed that on Saturday.
[01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:19.740]   So I agree with you.
[01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:21.100]   That was a real problem.
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:22.660]   And then the world went crazy.
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:23.660]   Well, and I have to.
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:25.940]   I don't know why we're talking about this because it's really not an apple thing.
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:30.700]   The only thing I'd say is that the one thing I learned with with Apple, I tend to buy stuff
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:36.100]   like I would have paid for the iPad six months ago and just waited for it with Google.
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:39.700]   I tend to be happy with, you know, I'm going to let everybody else kind of stick their
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:44.620]   toe into that water and get it watch them lose a couple toes.
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:47.460]   And then I'll step in a week later or two weeks later or three weeks later after they
[01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:51.220]   figure it out because with, I think we're much more of gamma testers for Google than
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:53.340]   we are for Apple.
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:54.340]   That's true.
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:57.140]   Gamma at least maybe beta, beta, beta, alpha.
[01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:59.500]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.060]   We're going to come back and we're going to get your picks of the week.
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:02.540]   There's a lot more to talk about.
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:08.220]   Okay, I do a couple more stories because there's a huge story about Apple's market share,
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:13.060]   January, fantastic, fantastic week for Apple market share.
[01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:21.340]   Max sales growth 36% in January on pace for 2.8 million Macintosh's in the first quarter
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:23.300]   of 2010.
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:24.700]   Piper, Jeff Ray and analysts.
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:26.380]   This is from apple insider.com.
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:31.300]   13 Munster provided the latest NPD group data for January the first month of the March
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:36.980]   quarter, 36% growth over 2009.
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:40.980]   This is by the way, more Max and even Wall Street's expecting the sell.
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:47.780]   Are we in one month, 30% in one month or in a quarter in the month of January, 30%
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.820]   36% year over year.
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:56.700]   So January 2010 was 36% bigger than January 29.09.
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:59.380]   That's craziness.
[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:01.780]   That's good, right?
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:04.460]   And I think any minute now, right?
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:10.220]   New Mac laptops based on the new chips, the new Arundale chips.
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:12.220]   Yes, we think any minute now.
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:14.820]   Very, very soon.
[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:18.620]   They started leaving breadcrumbs behind and the places that accidentally happened to get
[01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:25.060]   load of devices that they think things like websites and also benchmark collators that
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:28.540]   keep an eye on a device idea they've never seen before.
[01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:33.540]   And so a new Mac book that has yet been identified in the field showed up in one of these reports
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:34.900]   and had one of them.
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:38.060]   Pepe knew Intel iProcessors that you've heard so much about.
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:39.900]   So rumor has it.
[01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:43.500]   That's field rumors that we're very, very close to release of new Macbooks.
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.500]   And so we're definitely overdue, don't you think?
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:47.500]   Yeah, I'm waiting.
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.300]   I'm going to buy a 13 right now.
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:50.300]   I guess some say I should.
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:51.540]   I'm moving to a 13.
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:53.620]   Yeah, I should have it in the next one.
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:54.620]   I have it.
[01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:55.620]   You already bought it?
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:56.620]   Oh, I've had it.
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.260]   We had one in the company we were using for producers laptop.
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:07:59.260]   So I just got out.
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:03.620]   Because these new, these new chips, these i357 chips, these Arundales are good, I think.
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:04.620]   Yeah.
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:05.620]   Fast, real power.
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:07.620]   If you really loved your audience, you'd go out and buy it.
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:08.620]   I know.
[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:09.620]   Yeah, because we just get it over with.
[01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:10.620]   So we can feel the pressure.
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.020]   I'm feeling the pressure.
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:14.780]   I thought it was enough to buy three thirtings last year.
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:23.420]   And apparently I need to buy more about my wife, my mother, and my sister a 13 inch
[01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:24.420]   last year.
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:29.100]   I'll throw in my two first generation kindles and we can make a little house.
[01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:31.500]   I can't wait to replace my Kindle with the iPad.
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.500]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.500]   Come back with more.
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:35.980]   We've got your picks of the week coming up in just a second.
[01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:39.020]   But right now it's time to pick an audible book for everyone.
[01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:44.660]   Audible.com/MacBreak is the place to go to take a look at the most amazing, most wonderful
[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:46.740]   place in the world.
[01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:49.500]   It's like umpelumpelland for readers.
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.980]   It's audibleaudble.com.
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:51.980]   It is.
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:56.740]   It's a little candy store, little, a little candy store where you're going to turn purple
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:58.900]   when you eat these great books.
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:01.900]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:06.140]   Audible is about 70,000 books.
[01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:08.180]   The newest from Stephen King just came out.
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:09.500]   That's always a good bet.
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:13.580]   Stephen King makes books that are perfect for audiobooks.
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:14.820]   But there's history in there.
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:16.500]   I learn a lot.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.700]   When I went to China, I brought seven or eight audiobooks that I listened to as we were writing
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:20.700]   around in the bus.
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:22.700]   I mean, it's just a great resource.
[01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:23.700]   Audible.com.
[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:29.180]   Now, if you go to audible.com/MacBreak and sign up for the gold account, no charge for
[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:32.380]   the first month, you get that first book free and you can keep it forever even if you
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:35.300]   cancel at any time.
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.300]   What?
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:38.580]   You got one for us, Mr. Andy and I'll go?
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:39.580]   Yes, I do.
[01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:45.820]   That's an ironic audible selection because on the gold plan, I get one credit per month.
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:49.060]   Sometimes depending on how short the previous book was, it takes me a while for the new
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.060]   one to come through.
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:54.380]   I've been sitting on one credit for a little while now, chiefly because I've had so many
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:58.700]   in my wish list that I haven't been able to decide which one to get.
[01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:00.740]   Because it's such a complex decision.
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:07.780]   One of them being, I tend to like more entertainment sort of books as opposed to deep spiritual
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:12.060]   and deep profound novels about dead dogs dying and pools or whatever.
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:14.740]   Because I'm driving along, I want to be something else.
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:18.180]   Also something that I can listen to a 10 minute chunk at a time, then maybe another one where
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:19.820]   I'll be able to listen to it for an entire hour.
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:22.300]   There are a lot of variables.
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:24.220]   Here's where the irony comes in.
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:28.580]   Then I spotted the book, How We Decide by Jonah Lehrer in my wish list.
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.100]   I said, "Yep, let's buy that.
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:33.460]   Let's take that one as our next book."
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:40.060]   I first came to my attention when the author was interviewed by Terry Gross on Fresh Air,
[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:41.140]   really great interview.
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:45.340]   It's a book about how the brain is wired up to make decisions.
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:49.420]   Here are the two disconnects I would be likely to have when I'm pitched a book like this,
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:54.020]   that, "Oh great, it's a how to empower yourself on the Oprah show through self-determinacy
[01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:56.660]   by bringing the three bells of decision making."
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.940]   It's like, "Okay, that's BS pop psychology crap.
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:00.620]   I really don't waste my time on it."
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:06.020]   Then there's the serious psychology books that I just absolutely hate, which is, "We
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:10.860]   ran a controlled monkey study and also applied a test towards 400 grad students that were
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:14.660]   offered an orange baseball and a plank of wood."
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:18.900]   The fact that 33% could be influenced to choose the plank of wood means that I, Dr.
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:22.660]   Finney S. K. Wungewong, understands everything there is to know about the human brain.
[01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:24.900]   I don't like that either because it's so much guesswork.
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:30.060]   This is more like a very readable, very entertaining book about what goes into decision making,
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:34.100]   how the hardware is set up to make decisions.
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:39.940]   Sometimes these chapters are backed up by really interesting experiments that were conducted.
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:44.300]   One experiment was made to try to figure out how many different things can the brain
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:48.220]   keep track of at once when it comes to trying to juggle a decision.
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:51.700]   Really interesting study where they had one group that was spent half an hour to an hour
[01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:55.220]   just doing nothing but memorizing two digit numbers.
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:59.540]   Another group, they were told to, they had to spend a long time trying to memorize seven
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:00.540]   digit numbers.
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:04.540]   So then half hour later, they were allowed to go out, get a fresco, come back in and then
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:06.180]   just make some simple decisions.
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:10.020]   The ones whose brains were focused on just two things at a time were able to make really
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:12.860]   simple, very, very good, very, very quick decisions.
[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:16.100]   The ones whose brains were trying to juggle lots and lots of information were totally
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:17.100]   failures.
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:24.740]   Then there's also real life situations in which examples of people who had to juggle,
[01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:28.940]   people had to make a snap decision with a lot of really important things falling off of
[01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:29.940]   it.
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:34.740]   Like if you're looking at, if you're in the military and you're tracking an inbound,
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:38.860]   what the computer is telling you is an inbound missile about to hit your ship but might be
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:43.140]   an actual friendly airplane coming in for landing, the computer is telling you giving
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:44.140]   you too much information.
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:45.860]   You don't know which is which.
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:50.860]   This airman had to make a snap decision and he basically went with this doesn't feel like
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:55.340]   a, this doesn't feel like an airplane, this feels like a missile and made the order say,
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:57.380]   I suggest that we blow this thing up.
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:01.780]   This was a classic case because the military was using this as a way to sort of figure
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:04.900]   out how people make these decisions as it turns out he guessed correctly.
[01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:09.260]   But they figured out that there was something about the period of data that was coming in
[01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:14.340]   that he sort of was able to into it was not the sort of thing that an airplane would be
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:16.620]   making as a return signature.
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:18.700]   So it was just, I've only read the first two chapters.
[01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:23.180]   There's another thing where I buy so many of these audible books, thanks to my, thanks
[01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:26.900]   to be able to download the first two chapters by Kindle.
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:30.340]   And so this interview and plus the first couple chapters really got me interested in it.
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.820]   I don't think it's a self-help book.
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:33.740]   I don't think it's a science and medicine book.
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:39.020]   I think it's a very, very good read that might even help you figure out how to navigate
[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:42.260]   through tough decisions in a much more efficient, a much more satisfying way.
[01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:43.780]   So I'm looking forward to getting through the whole thing.
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:48.220]   I listened to that, that interview as well on the fresh air and I put the list on my
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:51.500]   book on my list as well because that just sounded really, really interesting and kind
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:56.380]   of counterintuitive that for instance, he said, you know, the whole Klingon thing about
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:14:00.500]   being purely rational would actually make it harder to make decisions.
[01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:04.020]   There's a, there's a, I guess a group of people who've lost the emotional, their limbic
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:05.020]   system is non functioning.
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:07.060]   They've lost their ability to think emotionally.
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:12.620]   So they're hyper rational and they would be completely unable to make a decision based
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:16.780]   on only the, based on only the fact they needed that emotional leap.
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:18.140]   It's kind of what you were saying.
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:19.140]   Maybe it's intuition.
[01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:20.140]   I don't know.
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:22.700]   But they needed that emotional leap to make the, make the decision.
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:23.700]   Yeah.
[01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:24.700]   I'm using the personal thing.
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:25.700]   I think I'm, I think I'm about to not cry out and wait.
[01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:26.700]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:30.540]   Klingons are, I'm so sorry.
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:33.580]   You know, when I go to Dragoncon, I'm like, it's actually stoned, aren't I?
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:35.220]   I mean, like, you want to Dragoncon?
[01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:36.220]   Yeah.
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:37.220]   Maybe I better fix this before.
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:38.220]   We'll talk.
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:39.220]   Yeah.
[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.220]   Thank you.
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:41.220]   Can you just give me like a cheat, cheat something?
[01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:42.220]   Well, no, I'll have a headset.
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:43.220]   You'll have the earpiece in your ear.
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:44.220]   Good.
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:45.220]   And I'll say, hi, dark ivory.
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:47.220]   You must be a big fan.
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:48.220]   Dark ivory.
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:51.220]   You must be a big fan of Joe Linsner.
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:57.460]   Oh, Mr. Panfant, he's going to pass.
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:58.460]   I need a heads up this thing.
[01:14:58.460 --> 01:14:59.460]   There's going to be a video.
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:00.460]   There's going to be a video.
[01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:01.460]   Did you see the ball in Leo's back?
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:03.180]   There's a ball under his, under his jacket.
[01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:05.580]   That's my Cylon light system.
[01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:07.300]   Preparing it right now.
[01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:08.300]   Not that pause.
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:11.300]   I think he's getting, he's getting, he's being fed the answers.
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:12.300]   Oh, dear.
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:15.180]   That's a big problem in the chess world, actually.
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:16.940]   There's, there's all these debates.
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:22.220]   I can't remember who the masters are, but, you know, there's a certain amount of paranoia
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:23.500]   that goes with being a chess master.
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:24.980]   It just kind of, it makes you crazy.
[01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:25.980]   It's the thought process.
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:26.980]   You have to think about it.
[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:27.980]   Mine is crazy.
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:31.380]   Because there's all these accusations that chess masters are wearing earpieces now at
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:34.020]   the world championship events and getting moves, fed them.
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:36.340]   And the reason is because computers are better than humans.
[01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:38.660]   So if, I mean, frankly, even at the top level.
[01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:45.380]   So if you could have a team somewhere analyzing the game on a high powered computer feeding
[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:47.940]   the moves into your ear, you could win.
[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:51.180]   And so it's a really, people have gotten very paranoid in the chess world about these ear
[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:54.340]   pieces and they're out there looking and they say, he went up, he went up, he got to
[01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:55.820]   the bathroom and went to three times an hour.
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:56.820]   That can't be right.
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:57.820]   You know, it's, anyway.
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:58.820]   Walk the cells like you'll.
[01:15:58.820 --> 01:15:59.820]   How we decide.
[01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:00.820]   Right.
[01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:01.820]   How we decide.
[01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:02.820]   What a great choice.
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:03.820]   I can't wait to get.
[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:04.820]   Yeah.
[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:05.820]   Yeah.
[01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:07.220]   I just, I think Audible is just such a great resource.
[01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:09.500]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/Macbreakit.
[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.060]   That first book free.
[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:12.340]   I can, I'll be honest with you.
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:13.900]   You're not going to stop with one book.
[01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:14.900]   It's, it's.
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:15.900]   It's fantastic.
[01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:19.540]   Because I have, I have like 20 books on my iPhone and so I don't, I don't really finish
[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:20.540]   any of them.
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:23.220]   I just kind of listen to like, oh, I'm in the mood for this kind of book or I'm in the
[01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:24.220]   mood for that kind of book.
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:28.640]   I don't really go from the big, it's so linear to go from the beginning of one book to the
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:30.060]   end of it and then another one.
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:31.060]   I just listened to all of them.
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:33.620]   I am listening to so many books at the same time.
[01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:35.180]   It's so, it's so A-D-D.
[01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:37.940]   And then I get confused because you got to be careful because for instance, I'm listening
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:44.380]   to both the mist of Avalon and the song of ice and fire, which is essentially the same
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:45.380]   book.
[01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:49.700]   So you get very confused because you say, well, wait a minute, was, why isn't Merlin, oh,
[01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:50.980]   no, he's not in this book.
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:53.300]   And I don't mean you, Merlin.
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:54.300]   I mean the other one.
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:55.300]   Yeah, of course.
[01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:56.300]   Yeah.
[01:16:56.300 --> 01:17:00.060]   By the way, in, in, in, in, Miss of Avalon, he's called the Merlin, which just, I think
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:02.260]   helps me distinguish between a Merlin.
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:04.500]   That Randall, that Randall guy calls himself that, I think.
[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:05.660]   Yeah, he's another Merlin.
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:08.780]   Yeah, he's a, he wants to be like Merlin prime.
[01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:09.780]   So confusing.
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:12.500]   How's the sniff your Wi-Fi out here?
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.700]   He does sniff your Wi-Fi.
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:19.300]   You guys should come on this next Mac, mania Mac, mania 11, the one in a year from now.
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:21.220]   This is Argentina to Patagonia.
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.220]   Patagonia.
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:25.380]   I've always wanted to have a, you know, I, I really, I told, I told my wife I wanted
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:28.180]   to have a house in Zimbabwe and in Patagonia.
[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:29.940]   And she's like, why do you want to have a house in Patagonia?
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:31.940]   I was like, dread pirate Roberts.
[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:37.620]   I was like, he's been, you know, he's been now retired for 10 years and has a house in
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:38.620]   Patagonia.
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:39.620]   He had thought Robert.
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:40.620]   He's slipping down.
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:41.620]   He's wearing all black.
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:42.620]   Yeah.
[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:44.340]   He could be the next.
[01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:46.420]   I want to be the next dread pirate Roberts.
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:47.420]   I wouldn't mind that.
[01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:48.420]   I thought you wanted to move to the Seychelles.
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:49.420]   I was thinking of becoming a Seychelles.
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:51.420]   No, my wife, I think, wants to move to the Seychelles.
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:52.420]   I want to move to the Seychelles.
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:54.520]   I just, the only reason I want to move to the Seychelles is because it's a shorter flight
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.520]   to Nairobi.
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:59.220]   My wife, my wife wants to be there because there's no natural disasters.
[01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:00.620]   There's a perfect beach.
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:02.020]   There's lots of dusky native women.
[01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:03.420]   That sounds like a place for me.
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:04.620]   It's a pretty nice place.
[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:05.620]   Two percent unemployment.
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:08.620]   Two percent unemployment, which means even I could find a job there.
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:09.620]   Do they have?
[01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:10.620]   Do they have?
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:12.060]   I have a related audible note.
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:13.780]   I can't believe my eyes.
[01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:14.900]   The kid stays in the picture.
[01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:18.940]   The world's greatest audiobook of all time has been really hard to find for a really
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:19.940]   long time.
[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:20.940]   I've seen him stop caring for some reason.
[01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:22.220]   My old copy still works.
[01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:23.220]   Thank God.
[01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:26.020]   But it looks like for anybody who's been listening or watching the Tumblr.
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:28.020]   Bob Evans biography.
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:31.500]   Without a doubt, is there any better audiobook than you?
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:32.980]   Andy has recommended this, I believe.
[01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:33.980]   I don't recommend it.
[01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:34.980]   I've been talking about it.
[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:37.980]   Well, there's Robert Evans reference in our last podcast.
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:40.580]   So I was showing people where that comes from.
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:43.220]   Did I show them the Robert Evans reference?
[01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:44.220]   Oh, we did talk about that.
[01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:45.220]   We did?
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:46.220]   We talked about this book.
[01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:47.220]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:48.700]   Andy's recommended every good Hollywood book.
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:49.700]   This one is-
[01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:50.700]   Every mistake there is.
[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:51.700]   Sure I did.
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:53.340]   But I make them again in a heartbeat.
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:55.460]   Have I learned anything?
[01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:56.460]   Not likely.
[01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:58.900]   That's it, pretty much.
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:18:59.900]   That's the book.
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:00.900]   Right there.
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:01.900]   You've heard this.
[01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:02.900]   Did the press love me?
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:03.900]   No, they did.
[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:06.660]   This is the abridged version.
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:08.660]   It's brief, but you know, I'm pithy.
[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:11.300]   Your first version should just be called You Bet Your Ass.
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:12.300]   I did.
[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:14.580]   You bet your ass I did.
[01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:15.580]   Did I do it?
[01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:17.220]   You bet your ass I did.
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:18.220]   Charlie Pludhorn.
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:22.500]   I really, anyway, so anyway, I'm just going to all post this.
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:23.500]   And then what's the code?
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:24.500]   Is it Mac Break?
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:25.500]   You put in Mac Break and you get it for me.
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:26.500]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:28.660]   We'll make it a double pick today.
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:29.660]   I bought it most.
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:30.660]   So good.
[01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:31.660]   So good.
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:32.660]   It is a great book.
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:35.500]   And then, you know, you have to go back in time and listen to all of Andy's recommendations
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:38.180]   about Hollywood because the Biscan books have been great.
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:39.980]   I've just been loving them.
[01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:41.300]   That's how I built my collection.
[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:43.500]   I just wait for Andy to tell us what I'm going to buy.
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.300]   And he's so good.
[01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:48.860]   Speaking of it, anyway, Audible, this ad is devolved.
[01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:49.860]   Audible.
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:52.260]   God, did they get their money's worth?
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:53.260]   Value for money.
[01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:54.260]   Value for money.
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:20:00.940]   Really, the ad is only like 30 seconds on the beginning and the end of this rat hole
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:03.420]   that is about books.
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:04.420]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:05.420]   Give it a try.
[01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:06.420]   See, that's it.
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:07.420]   That's all there is.
[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:10.420]   And we should just say this book section is brought to you by Audible.com/MacBreak.com.
[01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:11.420]   Yeah, we should do that.
[01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:12.420]   That's really what it is.
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:13.660]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:16.780]   Our audiobook recommendations today are brought to you by Let Me Check.
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:17.780]   Oh, Audible.com.
[01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:20.740]   Andy, you're not co, my friend.
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:22.340]   Do you have a pick of the week?
[01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:23.340]   Yes, I do.
[01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:28.420]   And I'm a little bit self-conscious about it because we spent so much time talking up
[01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:29.420]   Macworld Expo.
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:33.220]   And the thing that we would be complaining about is, well, we hit two weeks, three
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:34.220]   backworld expos at Apple.
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:36.820]   It's nothing but booze, but iPod cases.
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:40.660]   Now when I'm recommending an iPod case or an iPhone case, it's not the only great thing
[01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:41.660]   that was there.
[01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:43.900]   It's just that the only great thing that's on my mind.
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:47.580]   And it also allows me to be a big freaking nerd talking about it.
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:49.140]   That's fine with me, dude.
[01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:50.140]   Okay.
[01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:51.140]   Okay.
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:52.140]   With that warranty in place.
[01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:57.020]   It's a case made by a company called Treksta, T-R-E-X-T-A.
[01:20:57.020 --> 01:21:02.220]   And it is a very simple plastic clip on the iPhone case, just the back.
[01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:05.900]   Actually the back is covered in a nice drawable sketchable paper.
[01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:07.660]   Oh, what a good idea.
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:08.660]   It's awesome.
[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:13.700]   No, no, they missed a big, big trick here because in the booth they have, of course,
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:15.580]   hey, your kid can draw things on it.
[01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:16.580]   You can just take notes on it.
[01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:20.620]   But your kid, how adorable would it be that you just give this to your kid and he'll draw
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:22.340]   like, yeah, love you, daddy.
[01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:23.340]   Oh, isn't that adorable?
[01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:24.340]   Thank you.
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:26.340]   The best photo you ever had.
[01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:27.340]   Exactly.
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:31.620]   As a nerd though, it's like you get a pack of five for like not much money.
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:36.220]   And so the next time I go to a major comic con, I'm going to give Jim Lee an iPod case.
[01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:40.300]   I'm going to give Adam Hughes one of these iPod cases, you know, and 50 bucks.
[01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:42.860]   Can you please draw me a Wonder Woman iPod case?
[01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:44.660]   I want a good idea.
[01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:50.860]   It is actually very, very, the paper has a lot of tooth to it.
[01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:54.900]   They were using crayons and colored pencils on it.
[01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:56.500]   I don't think it'll take watercolors.
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:22:01.700]   It's actually sort of a brownish sort of, it's a brownish sort of paper.
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:05.900]   But it's, it's, it's the sort of thing where you just want to have one in your bag because
[01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:09.740]   you feel as though it's going to, you feel as though it's going to, it's going to come
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:12.580]   in useful at some point in the future.
[01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:15.380]   So it's not on their website.
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:17.220]   So I guess it's something they asked it, Mac.
[01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:19.020]   Yeah, really cool.
[01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:21.020]   I can imagine having one and then just getting on.
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.020]   Let me understand.
[01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:23.020]   It's the whole case paper.
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:24.660]   No, it's actually white plastic.
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:26.820]   I just sent you a link to where you can find it.
[01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:29.420]   A good picture at another site.
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:32.460]   But it's actually just a simple plastic.
[01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:37.540]   It's sort of a glued down, like sort of if you can imagine a paper mache back on top
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:40.860]   of that plastic, that's what you're going to be seeing.
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:43.620]   It's almost, it's almost like a grocery paper.
[01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:48.260]   I'm going to geek sugar.com, which is where you recommended.
[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:49.260]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:50.820]   I placed you and you were all that would take you directly to it.
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:52.300]   Yeah, but you're on a different computer.
[01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:54.100]   So I can't just click the URL.
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:55.100]   It's not that easy.
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:23:05.060]   Well, how about if you just do t r x t a Mac world and do a Google search with that work?
[01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:07.540]   Oh, I'm sure I'll find something.
[01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:09.620]   So okay, this sounds really cool.
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:11.100]   I hope they start selling it.
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:12.100]   Oh, look, there it is.
[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:13.100]   There it is.
[01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:14.100]   There it is.
[01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:15.100]   Oh, that's so cool.
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:16.100]   Oh, that is so cool.
[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:17.100]   Again, I'll tell you.
[01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:19.300]   Now, can you peel that off and have another layer?
[01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:20.380]   You just have to get another case.
[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:22.500]   I believe it's one use only.
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:23.500]   But that's why they sell them.
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.100]   I believe in a pack of five.
[01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:26.100]   Right.
[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:28.180]   That's what I've had.
[01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:32.540]   Also to be fair, I mean, if you're handling the back of this case for like days and days
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.180]   and days, you have to retire.
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:39.060]   You have to like clear coat it after you get something really pretty drawn on it or re-resign
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:40.300]   the factory and use it again.
[01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:41.300]   That's what they should do.
[01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.420]   They should sell some fixative that you could spray on it.
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:44.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:45.860]   Well, that's easy to find in any art store.
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:50.740]   But I'm absolutely certain that if more people find out about this, the next big convention
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:52.940]   I'm going to is the Boston Comic Con in April.
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:54.660]   And I'll have a few of these in my pocket.
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:57.140]   I'll be very surprised if you don't...
[01:23:57.140 --> 01:23:59.820]   They'll probably the last con I go to where someone says, "Oh, God."
[01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:00.980]   And it doesn't say, "Oh, God."
[01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:02.740]   Another one of these.
[01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:03.740]   Very good.
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:04.740]   Very cool.
[01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:07.540]   From T-R-E-X-T-A.
[01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.620]   I guess they're not selling it yet, but soon.
[01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:11.980]   They're not selling it on the website yet anyway.
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:14.340]   And Mr. Alex Lindsey, a pick.
[01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:19.380]   So I'm taking a Leo pick and extending it to the iPhone.
[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:22.380]   Oh, if you do Plants vs. Zombies, I'm going to be mad at you.
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:23.380]   Okay.
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:24.380]   Pick something out.
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:25.380]   Go ahead.
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:26.380]   Go ahead.
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:27.380]   Go ahead.
[01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:28.380]   I'm going ahead.
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:31.540]   If I got ahead of you, I knew I could get it and if I got behind you, I'm going to find something
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:32.540]   else.
[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:33.540]   No, go ahead.
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:34.540]   It's okay.
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:35.540]   I'll find something.
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.540]   I'd like to tell everyone how I lost an hour last night.
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:38.380]   Whoever wins, whoever gets it first wins.
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:47.020]   So Leo suggested a while ago Plants vs. Zombies on the Mac, which I liked.
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:50.100]   It was good, was addictive, but it was on the computer.
[01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:51.820]   And I don't really play games when I'm on the computer.
[01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:56.300]   I play games when I'm waiting for something or I'm in between things and everything else.
[01:24:56.300 --> 01:25:02.940]   And so I was like, "Well, when Plants vs. Zombies is available on the iPhone, I'll be set."
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:07.340]   Well, it is and it's really good.
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:11.980]   And I was like, "I wonder, I'm just going to see if this is as good as the desktop version
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:14.180]   of Plants vs. Zombies."
[01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:16.220]   And I did that last night at about 12.30.
[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:20.060]   And suddenly I looked up and it was 145.
[01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:23.740]   And I was like, "Oh my gosh, I have just played this for an hour and 15 minutes."
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:25.900]   And I finally figured out what it is.
[01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:29.260]   It's that it gets harder at such a slow level that it just keeps on sneaking up.
[01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:30.260]   Like you're surviving.
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:31.660]   You're like, "Oh, I keep on winning.
[01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:32.660]   I keep on winning."
[01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:34.340]   But it is getting harder and you're getting better.
[01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:38.940]   There's something about this that is a great example of how to teach someone something because
[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:43.020]   you're figuring it all out, but you're not losing to figure it out.
[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:44.460]   You're winning all the time.
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:45.460]   It reinforces it.
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:48.060]   It just keeps on reinforcing your ability.
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:49.660]   You're very rarely losing it.
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.900]   I think that's what makes it so addictive.
[01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:56.460]   That it keeps on building up so slowly that you have an hour and 15 minutes of feeling
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:59.460]   successful.
[01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:01.660]   Yeah, it's really addictive.
[01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:02.540]   Here, I'll give you one more.
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:04.540]   I'm playing it right now.
[01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:11.020]   So this was a flash game from PopCipe Games that we fell in love with when it came out.
[01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:13.140]   And now it's a $2.99 iPhone app.
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:14.540]   And just a real time set.
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:17.180]   Be careful of when you turn it on because it's very addictive.
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:22.980]   The only thing that I regret, and look, Janet's already installing the thing.
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:26.940]   The only thing that I regret about this is at least the desktop game ended too soon.
[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:29.380]   It was like, "Yes, you got better and better and eventually you beat it."
[01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:30.780]   And then it was over and that was kind of sad.
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:33.580]   Did you have a quick play version that's, I guess, randomized on here?
[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:34.580]   So that's good.
[01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:37.980]   You have to finish the adventure before you get the randomized version.
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:38.980]   Great music.
[01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:41.500]   And the animations are fun and simple.
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:43.180]   I mean, these are the kind of games I have to admit.
[01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:44.340]   I don't like the complex games.
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:46.100]   I just like simple world gaming.
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:49.540]   And can you imagine what the iPad is going to be for stuff like this?
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:51.140]   It's going to be amazing.
[01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:53.620]   It's going to be such a time sink.
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:54.620]   Yeah.
[01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:57.380]   I really try to, you know, other than last night when I was testing it because I was
[01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:59.980]   looking at it for today, I really try to not turn it on.
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:05.420]   I don't feel bad because I have a game that is even more addictive and depressing than
[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:06.420]   that.
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:09.820]   But before we go there, let's go to Mr. Merlin Mann.
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:11.540]   Merlin, what's your pick of the week?
[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:16.740]   I'm trying to decide if I understand this application enough to put it to demo it because it's
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:17.740]   so freaking cool.
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:20.740]   I don't want to get it wrong.
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:21.740]   You know, I'm going to try.
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:25.340]   Is there any point in me trying to demo an iPhone app on the thing here?
[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:26.340]   Probably not.
[01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:29.660]   Well, I can download it in demo it if you tell us what it is.
[01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:30.660]   It's just so cool.
[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:31.660]   I saw this on Gruber site.
[01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:33.980]   Have you guys done liquid scale or the iPhone?
[01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:36.060]   No, what's that?
[01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:37.300]   Liquid scale is an app.
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:39.900]   I'll try and do a little crappy demo for you right here.
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:44.140]   Do you remember a few years ago, a couple of three years ago, when there was that demo
[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:48.340]   everybody was talking about where somebody had an algorithm where you could take a picture
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:52.260]   and then like, let's say you had something at the far, you know, let's see, that's your
[01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:53.260]   what?
[01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:54.260]   That's your left.
[01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:55.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:55.260 --> 01:27:56.260]   You're right.
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:58.100]   And anyway, and you could take out the space in the middle and it like didn't over distort
[01:27:58.100 --> 01:27:59.100]   it.
[01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:00.100]   Have you seen the Sandy?
[01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:01.100]   Yeah.
[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:02.100]   Exactly.
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:04.100]   The Adobe Photoshop does that.
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:05.100]   It's intelligent.
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:06.100]   So you could take, oh, this is great.
[01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:08.140]   So you could take your girlfriend out of the picture.
[01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:09.140]   Yep.
[01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:10.140]   There you go.
[01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:11.980]   And then it's just your wife and child.
[01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:12.980]   That's fantastic.
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:14.980]   I don't want to step on Merlin's recommendation.
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:15.980]   I'm not going to jump in.
[01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:19.340]   That's a cool bonus feature that it has as opposed to the cool regular feature.
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:22.420]   Here's, you see, you go in, you got, you got some goofy looking guy here, right?
[01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:23.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:24.420]   Yeah.
[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:26.060]   And then you say like, what's important to keep and what's not?
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:29.300]   And it's got this little kind of, this is going to make no sense to the folks on audio.
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:31.940]   I apologize.
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:35.940]   So I can go in and say, for example, just narrate as you talk.
[01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:36.940]   So right here, okay.
[01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:39.100]   So what I'm doing is I'm coloring a big bunch of this and saying that's a part of
[01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:42.540]   the part, I just kind of pushed all over my face and made it all green so that when I
[01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:46.380]   do change this, oh gosh, now I've really screwed it up.
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:47.380]   God, what a mess.
[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:51.100]   But then when I change it anyway, it'll crop it in such a way that it retains the part
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:53.300]   that it's useless to show on the radio.
[01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:57.380]   My pick of the week is WikiPanyon Plus for the iPhone.
[01:28:57.380 --> 01:28:59.900]   You know, Wiki's WikiPanyon Plus, it's even better.
[01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:00.900]   Okay.
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:01.900]   No, no, show us some more.
[01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:02.900]   Come on, come on, come on.
[01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:03.900]   Safari is a hell of a browser.
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:08.780]   No, I'm looking at the, I'm looking at the page on the iTunes store.
[01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:09.780]   That makes perfect sense.
[01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:13.180]   Yeah, so your options are then anyhow, you can go in and let me see if I can.
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:14.660]   So it does more than just the scaling, right?
[01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:15.660]   It does other stuff.
[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:16.660]   Well, it does.
[01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:17.660]   Andy, you take it here.
[01:29:17.660 --> 01:29:18.660]   I think you can take stuff that you can fit in.
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:22.580]   Basically, the gist of it is that you've often taken those pictures where there's, they're
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:24.340]   like significant, oh, here we go.
[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:29.380]   Here's the live demonstration where if you have a picture of these two lovely nationally
[01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:30.900]   advertised beverages right here.
[01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:31.900]   Yes.
[01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:32.900]   Okay.
[01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:36.300]   On a background and then take a picture and you get your, you're on the bus and the
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:37.860]   way home and you realize, oh geez, that's stupid.
[01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:40.340]   There's all that dead air in the middle of it.
[01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:46.020]   Normally you could, if you try to squish these two together to make it, to make it look like
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:50.500]   that, what happens is to do a cut and paste, do a careful thing, or you could just squish
[01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:52.460]   the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the
[01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:53.620]  , make this all tall and skinny.
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:57.700]   What this application does is it recognizes that those trees in the background are just
[01:29:57.700 --> 01:29:58.700]   background.
[01:29:58.700 --> 01:29:59.700]   These two things are significant.
[01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:03.940]   So if you tell us to please squish it, you'll, it'll just intelligently sort of collapse the
[01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:08.980]   center of it, it'll disappear sort of into like hyperspace and seamlessly transition
[01:30:08.980 --> 01:30:10.460]   into a photo like that.
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:12.380]   Now the other thing this application can do.
[01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:14.220]   What happens to your head when that happens?
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:16.980]   Does your head, assuming that I'm not in the pub.
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:17.980]   Oh, okay.
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:18.980]   We're in fantasy land.
[01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:19.980]   Yeah.
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:21.940]   They do the same thing here on the, on the web page.
[01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:24.980]   But that's, that's an, that's an example of a really cool extra feature that this one
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:30.740]   does where let's say that this is the picture and I realized that my, my stupid face between
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:34.820]   these two is probably not the best way to advertise a Mexican Coca Cola.
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:39.660]   I can simply, with this application, I can simply draw over my face indicating the application
[01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:42.540]   that that thing in the middle, I don't regard that as significant either.
[01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:43.540]   And it's like, okay, great.
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:46.220]   I would have, if I were going to be guessing the application says, if I were going to be
[01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:49.700]   guessing on my own, I would have said that she would have thought that the head is actually
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:50.700]   important too.
[01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:54.340]   But okay, if you say so, and then you can sort of collapse it like a mad folding and then
[01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:55.500]   it will just look like that.
[01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:56.500]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:57.500]   Well done.
[01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:58.500]   Yeah.
[01:30:58.500 --> 01:30:59.500]   It's clever.
[01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:00.500]   I'm going to be guessing on my own.
[01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:01.500]   I'm going to be guessing on my own.
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:02.500]   I'm going to be guessing on my own.

[01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:12.500]   Sometimes it's his layer, but also his website,
[01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:15.500]   www.cwob.com.
[01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:17.500]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:18.500]   Remember, you can watch this show.
[01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:22.500]   We do it live every Tuesday, sometime between 11 a.m.
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:25.500]   Pacific and 2 p.m.
[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:28.500]   Usually around 11 a.m., 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:29.500]   We go for a couple hours.
[01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:30.500]   You can watch it live.twit.tv.
[01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:31.500]   You can also download the podcast.
[01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:35.500]   And soon the video from iTunes and Zoom and everywhere else.
[01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:37.500]   You can watch it on Ustream.
[01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:39.500]   You can watch it on Justin.tv.
[01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.500]   I think you can save it on Justin.tv.
[01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:43.500]   You can watch it on Big Gravity.
[01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:44.500]   You can even watch it on your iPhone.
[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:45.500]   This was huge.
[01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:48.500]   Now in the browser, if you use Safari, you don't need any application at all.
[01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:52.500]   Use Safari Surf to Live.twit.tv on your iPhone.
[01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:55.500]   We'll just start up automatically.
[01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:56.500]   You can watch it live.
[01:46:56.500 --> 01:46:57.500]   What's it using?
[01:46:57.500 --> 01:46:58.500]   What's it using to stream that?
[01:46:58.500 --> 01:46:59.500]   H.264.
[01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:01.500]   Webstreaming, baby.
[01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:03.500]   That's the future for all the platforms.
[01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:04.500]   It's only on the iPhone right now.
[01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:05.500]   Roku, of course.
[01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:06.500]   We don't have streaming on Roku yet.
[01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:10.500]   But with Live.twit.tv works on iPhone Safari, which is a huge breakthrough.
[01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:14.100]   And that's thanks to Ustream, which is, I think, like a lot of other companies saying, maybe
[01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:17.500]   this flash thing is not the only way to do streaming videos.
[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:19.500]   So they're not doing streaming H.264.
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:21.500]   And it looks really good.
[01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:22.500]   Scales beautifully.
[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:25.500]   I'm very happy about it.
[01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:26.500]   Friends, I'm Leo LaPouin.
[01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:27.500]   Thank you for being here.
[01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:28.500]   We'll see you next week on another Mac Break.
[01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:29.500]   It's broke.
[01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:39.500]   [MUSIC]
[01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:44.500]   [MUSIC]
[01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:45.500]   Thank you.
