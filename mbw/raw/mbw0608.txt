[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.920]   call. We're going to be talking about Mr. Tim goes to Washington for a state dinner.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.480]   We're going to be talking about a Mac book keyboard that despite our low expectations
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.940]   is still leads our lower expectations. And we raise a glass. As we say goodbye to one
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:39.240]   of our favorite Mac rumor bonkers who goes on to greener pastures.

[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.480]   matter. I am Andy Anaco. I'm not Leo LaPorte. I am wearing a tie. This is I'm cosplaying
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.740]   as a responsible adult because I am in the host chair right now. But I am backed up fortunately
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.760]   be even better than the cosplay responsible adult tie. Other people who are going to make
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.840]   this show very, very good are as usual. Renee Richie from I'm or Renee. How's it going?
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.520]   I feel like I'm in the safest hands like I'm just being cradled in podcast excellence.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.240]   And I can't I can't hope it succeed. Andy. Oh, you got so you got the Andy Anaco guest
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.160]   host complimentary fleece that I sent to all the green rooms. It's good. It's getting
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.280]   warmer, but it's not warm. How's that? There you go. Also joining us as usual and as welcome
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.560]   is Alex Lindy from the Pixel core. Hey, good to see you. You're looking for outdoors.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.840]   It's not just it's not just the stubble. It's also you've got the woodland sort of like
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.960]   I'm a lumberjack shirt. And no glasses. I just got up this morning in a different mood.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.240]   That's all I got to say. I felt like a lumberjack. You look very Northern California. You got
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.960]   the glow about you that doesn't mean pregnancy, but it means that you've been forced to spend
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.640]   some time outside. I have actually spent more than 10 minutes outside for in this week.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:08.040]   So it's been good. And welcoming back one of my favorite people to podcast with from
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.200]   app camp for girls Kelly Gomont Kelly. Thank you for coming. Hey, it's good to be here.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.400]   It's going to be a lot of fun. Well, we'll see about that, but it won't be if it's not
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.400]   fun. It won't be any of your fault, but we can we can only hope of what I mean. We're
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.120]   definitely going to be having a better time than Tim Cook will to later after after we
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.140]   record the show. Apple is going to be having their second earnings call in which Tim explains
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.400]   what happened during the March quarter. The most of the stuff when you Google for this
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.700]   sort of term comes up with Apple as doomed to looming to looming to have the worst quarter
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:55.220]   ever as iPhone 10 sales plummet into subterranean levels. So they got they got some stuff they're
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.580]   going to have to be talking about. As of about an hour ago when I check Apple stock is up
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:06.880]   one and 1.43%. It's there. There's some things that we're kind of worried about quarter.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.480]   The second quarter is generally not a barn burner. You're not getting the lift from the
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.800]   iPhone sales, but we have until the call comes we have a whole bunch of analysts predictions
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:23.560]   to look at Wall Street Journal probably quoting Gene Munster, I think here is predicting 60
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.160]   61 billion in March quarter revenue or that would be 15% year over year growth, which
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.300]   would be about pretty much what Apple had predicted in the last call. Gene Munster, Loop
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.260]   Ventures is one of the guys that one of the people that I look to for artificial intelligence
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.380]   on this. He thinks that Apple is going to forecast revenue between 48 and 51 billion
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:51.460]   for next quarter and 18 to 20% growth for services, which as he notes very clearly, he's
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.140]   becoming really, really important as Apple tries to make sure that they're not just making
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:01.400]   money off of iPhones in the future. He's saying that the results are going to be about 3%
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.900]   down off of the street. Street predictions, based quoting, if there's going to be about
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.660]   only a modest risk from negative comments that were in the press from two key iPhone
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:22.140]   suppliers, Taiwan semiconductor and who creates CPUs and AMS who supplies 3D sensing modules.
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.580]   They are two key suppliers for the iPhone 10 and both of them in their public comments
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.820]   had to say that, well, we had a major supplier not up their orders as much as we thought they
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.900]   would. They're also joining Samsung who made similar comments about, again, a big supplier,
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.060]   a big customer of theirs for OLED screens, Cognix, which is a company that sells services
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:51.100]   and stuff to help people make exactly the iPhone X screen assembly services. They had their
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.300]   call on Monday and they said that they are way, way down. So people are expecting not a whole
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.340]   lot of exciting news about the future of the iPhone 10. Gene Munster and his letter did
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.460]   say that the company is a safe haven in terms of protecting user privacy, calling that out
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:18.340]   specifically. It's hard to know what's going to happen. Renee, what do you think Tim has
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.820]   to talk about? What do you think that we should be preparing ourselves for?
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.540]   The biggest threat to Apple right now is the same that has been for the last many odd decades
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.420]   and that is investors. Apple could literally make a trillion dollars a day and investors
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.180]   would say, why aren't you making a trillion point one tomorrow? Because they really are
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.300]   growth focused and Apple, the PC business, which includes the Mac is mature, the smartphone
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.020]   business, which includes the iPhone is mature. We're seeing all these doom and gloom articles,
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:53.540]   but when you actually read the articles, iPhone sales will be up, but smartphones are mature.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.540]   Apple's made even more money off the iPhone 10, you'll be on 35% of revenue by smartphone,
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.140]   but it's too expensive and people hate it. Apple's going to be selling less phones as
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.740]   you're well, I guess if you include iPhone 8 and iPhone 10, they're actually selling
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:10.020]   more phones, but we feel like saying they're selling less phones. But to Gene's point,
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.420]   services are perhaps the one thing that Wall Street is smitten with with Apple and they're
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.020]   doing good business on that. They're continually up on that and there's rumors are going to
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:24.260]   be adding texture back to Apple news, magazine subscriptions to that number.
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.260]   So if there is a Rosie Glow, it'll be that. But I think this is really a perception war
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.700]   and given Wall Street, those are almost always impossible to win.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.700]   Yeah, that was another note that Gene Munster made specifically that he expects them to
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:43.940]   really be even further investing in other media, not just movies, not just TV, not just apps,
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:50.180]   but also what would we use to call print publishing. And he was talking about texture,
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:56.180]   but also talking about other opportunities that they may have. He was also said something
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.860]   that I found kind of interesting because I've never really seen it before. And again,
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:05.300]   this is once again, excuse me, this is from Neil Seibart in his above Avalon newsletter,
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.780]   different analysts saying talking about what Apple tends to go is going for in these calls
[00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.620]   now, he says, and I quote, instead of iPhone sales or Apple services revenue gaining importance,
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:20.100]   Apple's balance sheet strategy is driving the company's new Wall Street narrative.
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.980]   So they're not trying to put the focus on here's how many iPhones we're selling. Here's
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.860]   what Mac sales are doing or iPad sales are doing. But look at what we're doing with our
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:34.340]   money. We're being very, very smart with it. More boring numbers. The company repatriated
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:40.140]   $269 billion because of tax holiday that the Trump arranged for them. So they paid it discounted
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:45.620]   $38 billion lump sum in taxes to bring that money home. They could have they would have
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:51.020]   otherwise had to spend $80 billion to bring that in. They also put $13 billion in Ex escrow
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:56.380]   to fight the European Union tax dodge penalties that they that they're going to be fighting
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:00.380]   against. But they can't fight it until they put the money that they quote, Oh, when quote,
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:05.140]   in someplace where they can't get at it. They also announced $30 billion in capital expenditures
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:10.500]   over the next five years, partly for the news campus for tech support.
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.580]   But you're right. I mean, these are I'm glad that I'm hosting this week. So I have the
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.380]   responsibility of rattling off the boring numbers instead of being the person who has
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:27.420]   to say, yes, but what does this mean to someone who's shopping for a new iPad? Kelly, is this
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:32.020]   just like inside baseball or is this just some way to fill time for 20 minutes during
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:37.240]   a Mac break that tapes on the day of this of the call? Well, partly I have to call
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.420]   shenanigans on this because it doesn't matter what numbers Apple comes out with like Renee
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:46.260]   was saying. Somehow we've ended up with this third measurement system that we have. We
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.460]   have like imperial measurement like we use here in the US and then we have metric measurement
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:56.980]   which the rest of the world uses. And then we have the one that whatever Apple says,
[00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:01.300]   it needs to be just this much more like there's this whole other set of measures that we use
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:06.900]   if you took anything about any of these numbers that people are predicting for Apple and you
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:13.700]   find and replace Apple with Dell or Microsoft or Samsung, like those exact same investor
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:19.580]   advice sorts of people would be fainting over the amount of unmitigated success that we're
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.940]   seeing right now. And when Apple does it, it's just never quite good enough. And that's
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:28.180]   the part that I find sort of frustrating in listening to some of this analysis and in
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:32.900]   listening to some of the questions that they get at the end of the call is the kind of
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.300]   stuff, you know, where people are like, yeah, so you made a billion dollars and you sold
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:43.300]   four iPhones a second for every second of the entire quarter. And you know, really what
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:48.500]   we want to know is why you didn't sell five every second for the whole quarter. And it's
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.420]   hard to it's hard to listen to that stuff because like I said, if it was any other company
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.300]   coming up with these kinds of numbers, they would be considered an unqualified success.
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.580]   But when Apple does that, it's not enough. Or if they actually do a little bit better
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.780]   than they have said that they were going to do, then it's, well, how long can this last?
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:09.660]   Because clearly they can't continue to like be really successful. Like we just won't allow
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:13.980]   it, you know, it's kind of how this comes out. And it's not a good look on anybody.
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.420]   And part of why I find it frustrating is because I want to know if this is the same thing in
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.180]   other industries, like if it's not tech and people are looking for advice on stuff like
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:26.460]   this, like is there some, is there an Apple in a different field, you know, in healthcare
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.300]   or something that like whatever they do would be amazing if it was any other company. But
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.380]   because it's these guys, like it's never quite good enough. Because it seems like that's
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.340]   not the best kind of information to have.
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:43.380]   Yeah, that Apple's difficulty part of it is that they're famous for making a cajillion
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:49.100]   dollars off the iPhone. But they're also famous for making 61 to 62% of their money off of
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:53.860]   the success of the iPhone. So part of this has to be storytelling to say that, yes, if
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:58.340]   everybody forgets that they want a smartphone that's really, really super cool, and they're
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.980]   willing to spend upwards of 1000 bucks for them sometimes. What does Apple have planned
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:10.180]   other than selling iPhones? Alex, as the CEO of a, excuse me, as the head of a wonderful
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:15.540]   company, like is, is, does Tim have to engage in a little bit of footwork? Or can they just
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.300]   simply say, look, dudes, I mean, if you want to sell your stock, we're buying back. So
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.140]   we'll buy it from you if that's your problem.
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:25.700]   Well, and most likely we'll see you buy back. I mean, you know, I think that that I think
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:31.020]   Apple usually tries to take advantage of any kind of stock softness in buying back stocks.
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.420]   This is probably a good time for them because the stock has been a little softer recently.
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:41.460]   So I would expect $50 to $100 billion of stock buybacks is announced today to use that.
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.820]   I don't think, I think that I personally think that dividends are a waste of time. I mean,
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:51.020]   I think that they should just do stock buybacks and continually pull that back in as opposed
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:13:00.540]   to just handing out free money. I think that Apple, if you have a really great phone, and
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:05.460]   I think the iPhone X is the best phone that I've used so far, and it's making more money,
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.780]   it doesn't really matter if it's selling the same number. If it's generating the same
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.820]   amount of revenue, I think that it, you know, from Apple's perspective, I mean, I think
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:20.020]   that the analysts can say, oh, no, everything's sliding, but that's also a you have a clientele
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:24.660]   paying for that that you probably can sell more services into than folks that are getting
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:29.140]   free phones. So there's it's a whole different, you know, really focusing on what makes them
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:33.660]   different as opposed to trying to just just go after the mass number of phones probably
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:39.220]   makes sense for Apple, especially if you're trying to move into a service based, you know,
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.700]   if you're trying to add services, what you want are the people that are most likely going
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:48.060]   to buy those services. And what makes Apple different is it's secure, it's stable, it's
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.580]   a good experience. Those are those are all things that are there of a lot of value, I
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:55.460]   think, for for Apple. And I think that it's better for them to focus on those things than
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:14:00.740]   necessarily market market share, which they they've lost and which is great for them,
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:05.140]   by the way. I mean, it is incredibly good for Apple not to have the majority of the
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.540]   market share because it keeps them out of all the things that that would reduce their
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.620]   ability to move. If they were a majority holder of the market, they wouldn't be able to do
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.820]   a lot of things that they do, it would be seen as antitrust. And so by remaining a
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:21.620]   minority stakeholder, it gives them even though they're the largest company in the
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:25.060]   world, it gives them a or publicly traded company in the world, it gives them a lot
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:29.380]   of flexibility to to be aggressive in a way that they can't they couldn't be otherwise.
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:32.300]   And so I think they're still in a pretty good position. I mean, obviously they need to
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:37.340]   continue to figure out how to expand. I think they'd figure out how to how to expand that
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.180]   market, how to I don't but I don't I don't think it's about getting more iPhones. They're
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.220]   going to keep on selling enough iPhones to keep keep the company open for quite some time.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.220]   So, you know, I think we can we can look at it. I mean, there's there's another decade
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.740]   of them selling phones and coasting on that. Maybe it doesn't make as much money. I mean,
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:56.420]   the big problem you get into with stock prices is not so much whether the stockholders are
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.940]   happy or not or whatever. But if the stock prices go down for too long, they have talent
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.380]   retention issues within the company. You know, people have, you know, so much of what
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:08.860]   you make in one of these technical and these technology companies is your your your your
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.900]   stock. You know, you're getting you're getting stock pie outs. And so so one of the big challenges
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:18.020]   for them is if the stock is going down or if it's sliding, it actually makes their their
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:23.420]   engineering staff more flexible as far as where they want to work. And so that's probably
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:28.460]   the biggest reason for them. Otherwise, they're not really in any kind of particular particular
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:32.380]   danger. So, you know, and so it's it's good news to talk about how much trouble they're
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.140]   in, but I don't think they're not much.
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:44.340]   Well, it's just fun to see any any CEO who is as smart, talented, rich and good looking
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:49.180]   and apparently healthiest Tim Cook have to spend a day in the dunking booth because we
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.980]   don't get to be handsome or talented or smart or rich. So but it's nice to see him have to
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:59.020]   see somebody in that position have to do a little bit of fancy footwork. And you do make
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:04.460]   a point that this is we're of course watching this for cues as to what Apple thinks the
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:08.260]   direction of the company is going to be. They don't talk. They certainly don't talk about
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:13.540]   unannounced products, but this is where they start to tip their hand as to we feel as though
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:18.380]   this market is very, very interesting. And we continue to avidly follow events in this
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:24.020]   space. This is also the place where they can't, whereas they can say whatever they want at
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:29.300]   a keynote event and there are no legal repercussions for defending the deletion of the headphone
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:34.340]   jack on an iPhone. If they say things that are misleading or a little bit shady or a
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:39.060]   little bit weird, there are legal repercussions to saying that in an official communication
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.660]   to shareholders. So those things are really worth taking a look at. But nonetheless, this
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:47.780]   is a financial call. Again, in Munster again was talking about what they're expected to
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:52.820]   do with with the money they're making. He said that the additional profits expected to go
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:58.100]   into boring things like servicing debt, paying dividends and doing stock buybacks, which are
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.660]   all about transactional stuff that's for the monetary health of the company, as opposed
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:07.300]   to we're investing in this company where we are moving into this additional market.
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:13.540]   But is it Alex, excuse me, Renee, do you think that they can, is there anything they could
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:17.620]   tip their hand about? There's something that's not, and I don't think we should, it's time to talk
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:22.100]   about Apple's AR/VR headset. The more rumors are kind of floating about, but those are so
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:27.060]   premature at this point that it's you may as well talk about Apple getting into a line of
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:31.540]   designer wallpapers and fabrics at this point. But do you think Apple's in a position where they
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:37.620]   can start talking about we are interested in creating new products as opposed to creating
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:43.380]   improvements on the lines that we already have? I mean, in order to dodge questions about China,
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:49.860]   it could be fun. Apple has started, they hasn't done that. I mean, the closest they've come is
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:54.260]   Jeff Williams once mentioned that the car was the ultimate mobile device and Tim Cook
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:58.660]   talked about AR quite frequently and more recently talked about autonomy and autonomous
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:03.700]   technologies, which is what the car project ultimately is becoming. So there's always a chance
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:08.900]   that he can swing back around to autonomous technologies. But I think Apple hasn't shipped
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:14.580]   airpower yet, and that was discussed back in September. So I think there's danger in sort of
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.700]   talking about future products when all the current products haven't shipped yet.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.380]   Yeah, that could be during the Q&A afterward in the phone call. That could be something that
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:28.500]   no one's looking forward to at Apple talking about, okay, well, HomePod was
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:34.420]   looked like it was set to be an incredibly hot seller for the holidays. And that got delayed.
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:39.140]   You kept talking about this air charger that hasn't shown up yet. The only news you have about
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:44.020]   the Mac Pro update is that it's certainly not going to be this year and it might be next year.
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:51.060]   Does Apple have a problem with having people believe them when they say that we've got a plan
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:56.020]   for something and we're shipping something? Is Tim going to have to explain all these shipment delays?
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:00.900]   Which has really never been a problem for Apple. Tim Cook famously was the one who got all those
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.700]   products shipped on time. And sometimes at prices that were astounding to people who worked in
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:12.820]   logistics. And now we've had AirPods and keyboards and Apple Pencils and AirPower and AirPods.
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.500]   And it sounds like they're struggling. I mean, they're shipping way more products than they
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:22.660]   ever did before. But at some point, you sort of have to huddle everyone back together and say,
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:26.180]   this stuff has to go out on time or we're not talking about it till it's ready to hit the stores.
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:30.980]   I think that we're seeing some of the pressure that Apple is getting from Google and from other
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:38.100]   folks as far as the products that Apple has. This idea of announcing products that are two months
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:43.380]   out or three months out or six months out. When they do that, when they don't wait until they're
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:49.460]   going until it's done and ready to ship, that means that they're worried about
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:55.060]   other people taking market share before they get that out there and they have to talk about it.
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:20:03.300]   I think that if you look at the Apple speaker, it's two years too late, most likely. It is a
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:14.420]   Alexa has in Google home to some degree, but Alexa especially has taken that market. They got out
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:19.540]   there early. It wasn't perfect. It didn't matter. They got it done. And I think it's going to be
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:24.020]   hard for them to catch up. So I think that you see them trying to make sure that they can stay out
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.620]   in front of those things. I don't think that they're in any risk with AR right now because I don't
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:32.900]   think anybody else has it figured out or anywhere near figured out. But I think that's also a massive
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:37.460]   market. I mean, it's starting to be clear from some of the testing we've done internally and some
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.300]   of the stuff we've seen other people working on that we're not going to be using our phones forever.
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:46.980]   So the AR is the replacement for the phone. We just don't know exactly when or how.
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:54.740]   And Kelly, this is another thing that bothers me about these rumors about Apple having this
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:21:01.460]   really cool AR/VR headset with 8K individual displays and not making you look like a total
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:08.020]   dorker in my case anymore like a dork than I already am. I don't want to fall into the trap of saying
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:13.860]   something that could be misconstrued as Apple can't innovate anymore. But I don't, when I think
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:18.420]   about my mental picture of Apple these days, I don't think of them as someone who breaks a new
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:24.260]   technology that I think of somebody who refines an existing technology at a market that kind of
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:30.260]   work. And the fact they took so long to get into these smart speakers. But I mean, am I off-bafes?
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:39.140]   Is the magic still there? Well, Apple was never for like they haven't been first, I guess,
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:43.860]   for a really long time. They didn't make the first mp3 player. They didn't make the first phone that
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:49.060]   you could get email on. They didn't make the first laptop. They didn't make the first, you know,
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.820]   any of these things. They didn't make the first tablet. They didn't make the first home speaker.
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:22:00.020]   But in a lot of cases, like it didn't matter. Like, you know, how many people remember what mp3
[00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:04.180]   players were like before there was an iPod and how many people remember what there was
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.420]   aside from Blackberry? Because remember, that was practically the generic term for a phone you could
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:15.060]   get email on before Apple came on their scene. So the problem is, does it matter? Because, you know,
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:21.140]   like we were talking about before, like Apple can't win. So remember, like, they released an iPad in
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:26.340]   the spring and then they released an iPad later in the year and people went, Apple's innovating too
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:32.980]   fast. This is terrible. And then, like, when that iPad hit, like 12 months, people were like,
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:38.260]   clearly Apple can't innovate anymore. So like, it doesn't matter, you know, but
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:44.820]   like the thing that I wonder about is like the announcement. And like, I have a whole bunch to
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:49.860]   say about the HomePod mostly because I don't think it's necessarily the head-to-head comparison
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:56.100]   with things like the A-Lady and the Google Home stuff that it tends to get portrayed as because it
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:02.260]   has an assistant in it. Those were an assistant and the delivery mechanism for that assistant was
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:06.740]   that speaker. Whether it was the tall canister of the echo base or the little hockey puck of the
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:13.140]   dot, it doesn't like Amazon needed a way to get that into your house. And so they sort of slapped
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:18.260]   a speaker on it so that you would start using the A-Lady to do all of your stuff. That was the point
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:24.180]   of it. And Apple is trying to sell people a really nice speaker that you happen to be able to talk
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:29.300]   to, which is like not necessarily the opposite approach, but it's the other way to do it. If
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:34.020]   you're going to give people a speaker that you can talk to, like Apple made a great speaker that
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:37.540]   you can happen to talk to and everybody else made a thing you can talk to that happens to have a
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:44.420]   speaker in it. So I feel like there's probably more to be done there and, you know, because like,
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:49.860]   I have a great sound system. So I was never the market for the HomePod and I was never going to
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:55.220]   be a person who could talk to Siri, like on a speaker for that because I already have
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:00.260]   awesome speakers and I don't care that I can't talk to them because I have a couple of, I have
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:08.260]   an echo base and I use that and I talk to that all the time instead. So for me, this is going to
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:12.500]   be another one of those things where it doesn't matter. Like if Apple releases something super
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:18.100]   innovative, you know, they they're not going to win because like, oh, what's Apple doing with all
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.180]   of this instead of, you know, whatever. And then if they turn around and ship everything that they
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:28.100]   said they were going to ship and let's say we get a Mac Pro this year and the AirMat or AirPower,
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:33.700]   the thing for your air, for all your stuff that charges magnetically, like when that comes out
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.660]   that I can't remember the name of because they told me and I forgot about it because it never showed
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:42.580]   up. When that comes, when that comes out, like if they shipped everything this year, if they just
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:47.060]   cleared the decks of all the stuff that we've heard about forever, you know, and they're like,
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:56.420]   here's your 5G MacBook Air and here's a new another new iPad and here's the iPhone 11 that does this
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:02.500]   other great amazing thing and here's the Mac and here's the Mac Pro and you know, and here's an 8K
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:08.580]   Apple TV, you know, like will it matter because it's not going to make it's not going to make any
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:12.260]   difference. It's just going to give people a different set of things to complain about. Like
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:17.940]   Apple released too much stuff. What are we supposed to do? Well, you know, like there's never going
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:23.460]   to be a good spot for Apple in this, but it has been notable to me that we've had so many
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:29.620]   announce wear items from Apple instead of shipping things. So what would be surprising to me,
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:34.260]   or at least interesting to me, is if today on the earnings call, we got one of those, like we got
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:38.660]   occasionally in the old days of, you know, we've talked to you about this thing and it's coming
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:44.820]   out tomorrow or it's coming out Monday, you know, like really, really close to right now and we're
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.620]   we're going to be able to release it and we're just going to casually mention it in the middle of
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:52.660]   an earnings call. Like that new version of Mac OS, it's out now or you know, whatever it is. So,
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:57.940]   that's part of what I want to hear in the call is to find out if maybe there's something they're
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:01.460]   going to announce. Maybe we're going to find out that we're like two weeks from everybody having
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:07.700]   the Air charging magic. Yeah, I mean, we'd like to hear something anytime we hear something
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:13.860]   tangible from Apple. That's really good news. But my my source of itchiness a little bit about
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:19.620]   Apple is that yes, they weren't the first with the iPod. They weren't the first with the iPhone.
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:25.060]   They weren't even first with the with the iPad. But in each case, it fell into this
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:31.460]   this predictable rhythm of Apple saying, no, we weren't we waited to see what you could do with
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:36.020]   a digital music player and what the pain points are. And we realized that what what a digital
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:40.100]   music player needs is a lot of capacity. So we're using this brand new tiny hard drive and a really
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:45.220]   great way to move music from from your computer to the device. So we got iTunes with the iPhone.
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:51.620]   They said, as the these keyboard, the software is kind of terrible. Multitouch is the future. We
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:56.980]   built this iPhone. The engineers were saying explicitly based on what we hated about our current
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:04.580]   phones and the iPad fixed tablets. And I think that it also also fixed a cheap $200 computers,
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:10.580]   like inexpensive computers too. But when you see when I see the HomePod, I see we built one of
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:16.340]   that's a popular product that Amazon introduced and that Google has built upon. We built one as
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:27.300]   well. How about the Apple TV, which we also have a streaming box. Also, it's it's I don't necessarily
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:32.980]   associate them now with whenever they came up with an AR device, they will absolutely crack it as
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:37.940]   opposed to the look what's at what Oculus is doing. The look excuse me, the look with all these what
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:43.220]   all these other immersive experience devices are doing and then find a way to make that that
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:50.020]   enhances the Apple ecosystem. So that's just something to follow. I guess I make the one thing.
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:54.660]   The advantage that Apple does have with some of these devices, as someone who has probably all of
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:28:00.980]   them in my in my office, is that that they'll be stable and they'll probably work. I mean, the
[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:06.900]   problem is that my HTC Vive and my Oculus and even the those are all like you don't know
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:13.140]   if it's actually going to work today or not. Windows runs a forced update and now Oculus doesn't
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:17.060]   work or I connected both of them and now that neither of them work. And then I you know, there's
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:22.740]   there's just so many things that go wrong on that platform that you know, that it is you know,
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:27.220]   that's the big opening that they have that they're leaving open because they're not stable.
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.820]   You know, and dealing with all the little bits and pieces is something that I think Apple
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:35.460]   stands to be able to work better because they're working the problem that Oculus and Vive have
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:40.100]   right now until they pull all of that internally. And I think the Oculus Go is a good example. And
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:44.020]   the you know, like those are things that they're starting to go down that path. But depending on
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:51.060]   any external hardware is you know, and depending on Windows is a massive weakness for a lot of
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:59.140]   that stuff for high performance AR and VR. Okay, Renee, you did mention China. What do you think
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:05.700]   that Tim might have to talk about if people have a chance to ask him anything about China? What's
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:14.100]   the what's the red flag word? China is a huge market. It's probably going to surpass the US
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:19.620]   in terms of potential if it hasn't already. And Apple was doing pretty well in China, but local
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:25.700]   brands, Huawei and ZTE, they're doing really good work now. They're becoming increasingly
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:30.580]   popular. Apple's fallen into the other category of vendors in China. And there's also an incredible
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:35.860]   amount of trade uncertainty under the Trump administration about whether there will be tariffs
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:42.500]   the US government has already banned phones by Huawei. And I forget the name of the second company
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.980]   that they banned. I don't think it was ZTE. It was the other one whose name escapes me. But
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:53.620]   and there might be retaliation, for example, with China barring Apple or American phones from
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:58.740]   coming into the market. So you have a highly competitive market where Apple's only advantage
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:05.780]   is that it's considered a sign of face, a sign of affluence to have an Apple product. But other
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:10.740]   companies are making very good technology stacks now too. And you have what might be an incredibly
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:15.780]   hostile environment for American companies going forward. So we've seen Tim Cook actively,
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:21.300]   go to the White House, the state dinner, have meetings in the Oval Office about this. But
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:27.220]   it really is beyond, a lot of it is beyond his control in terms of where the trade practices go.
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:35.060]   But also Apple's positioning. If you are considered the hot brand, it only takes someone considering
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:40.660]   something else hot to really undermine your position. So I think there's going to be a lot of questions
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:46.980]   about Apple's ongoing role in China. >> One of the difficulties is in every single category,
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:52.420]   what once was cool and hot, at some point becomes what your parents thought was cool and hot,
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:31:01.140]   which makes them much, much, much less hot and cool. But yeah, it's also notable, probably based
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:06.420]   on all that sort of stuff, that Tim Cook was invited to Donald Trump's very first official
[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:14.580]   state dinner. This one was in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron. This is so interesting.
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:20.420]   It was a smaller event than Obama's first state dinner. So a little bit more exclusive. It wasn't
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:26.580]   necessarily top heavy with tech execs. So okay, that's interesting. But also interesting that
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:34.260]   he brought with him as his plus one, Lisa Jackson, who is Apple's Vice President of Environment,
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:39.860]   Policy and Social Initiatives. Interesting in and of itself, but she's also a former Obama
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:47.220]   administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. So it feels like maybe Cook was trying to
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:54.900]   have his cake and eat it too. If he's invited to a state dinner, it's a really good idea as not only
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:32:00.980]   the CEO of Apple, but also as a leader in a certain industry who wants to retain a certain
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:07.220]   amount of influence to accept that thing. But also to bring in a former head of the EPA
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:15.860]   at the state dinner for administration, whose current EPA administrator started off as being
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:22.260]   an outspoken enemy of everything the EPA stands for and might wind up under some form of indictment.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:26.980]   That does seem like a notable ask. It's not like Zee-
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:32.660]   Not an old white dude. It's sort of like when you when you're invited to the White House
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:36.980]   Correspondence Dinner and you choose to bring like one of the cast members of Jersey Shore,
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:44.180]   it seems as though you're trying to rattle things up. Alex, you spend more time in Washington
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:50.740]   for other reasons than I do. Is this a finger in the eye? Is this like him bending the knee?
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:55.540]   What do you make of this? I think that he did too. Number one is Facebook probably more than
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.700]   anyone else has realized what happens when you don't spend enough time in an effort in Washington,
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:06.820]   DC. There is a flow of things that can occur. A lot of tech companies,
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:11.380]   some tech companies that have definitely spent a lot of effort in DC.
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:17.380]   Then there are other tech companies that have just thought they can just ignore them and not do
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:22.340]   anything. I think that you find that a lot of the the the ships suddenly come against you.
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:31.380]   If you start to go down, if you don't pay attention. So coming to a dinner when you're invited by
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:36.260]   the president is probably a good idea. I think to avoid being seen as someone who's just coming
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:41.300]   to the dinner, bringing someone who is a signal that you're coming but you're not necessarily
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:47.540]   capitulating, I think is not a bad positioning statement in that area. I'm sure that it was
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:51.940]   probably a lot of appropriate conversations. She probably was not combative. I think it's just
[00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:56.020]   the presence in that picture that you saw was the important thing for Cook. That's my guess.
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:05.220]   And so I think it's an astute, various-to-choise to be a little bit there and a little bit not there.
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:15.380]   But ignoring the president or DC is probably not an advisable solution if you're the CEO of
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:19.860]   the largest company in the world that can be affected by things like tariffs and all kinds of other stuff.
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:27.540]   Kelly, do you think that Tim and Apple are facing problems by being seen as being more political
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:33.700]   or even just more social? I'm sure they are because again, this is a thing that you can't win because
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:41.380]   whatever position he takes, if he's on the middle, there's going to be people on the extreme ends
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:44.980]   that both don't like what he's saying. And if he takes something a little to the left, the right
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:50.020]   won't like it. If he takes something a little to the right, the left won't like it. So being
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:57.860]   public at all, that's one thing that Steve Jobs never really got involved with for the most part
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:03.060]   was just like he kept a really low profile in that kind of stuff and washed his hands of the
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:10.500]   whole thing so that there wasn't this kind of concern, I guess. I don't mind that Apple does it,
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:16.580]   whether I agree or disagree. That's one person of many within a company. And I'm not saying that
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:21.300]   because he does stuff that I don't agree with so far, I've agreed with all of it. But it is
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:27.060]   interesting to see them sort of get a little bit more political and I don't know how much of that
[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:33.620]   is the climate we are in now. And so they sort of feel like they have to in some way.
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:38.420]   And how much of it is just Tim was always going to be more public about stuff like this. And
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:46.420]   we should just expect that Apple's going to have a little higher profile and stuff like this going
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:52.900]   forward. Yeah, he also did meet privately with Trump a day later. And although this out to everybody
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:36:00.900]   does, does anybody think that Tim has a good chance of not just looking for the staying in the
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:08.740]   loop, not just getting the best for Apple, but also influencing Trump on issues like how problematic
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:15.220]   a trade war with China would be all the way up to like DACA and other social things that that
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:20.260]   Tim has probably stated are very, very true to his heart. Do you think that he has any kind of
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:26.820]   level of trust where he can start to say maybe the immigrant stuff is not a really good fit for
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:32.580]   America as the employer of many immigrants? Is that even possible? I think that I think that
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:36.900]   the one thing Trump has proven is that he can't be moved around. I mean, as far as his opinion goes.
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:43.060]   So sometimes it changes like the weather. So so I think that it is a, you know, I think that
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:47.540]   having a conversation, you just have to figure out, I'm sure it comes with a lot of
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:52.420]   congratulatory and very nice comments. But in between that, I think there is an opportunity to,
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:59.460]   I think he's Trump, my guess is a lot more less, less dogmatic than many other presidents have been.
[00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:04.420]   And probably is a lot more flexible to the right kind of conversation. I don't think that,
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:11.060]   it's got to fit inside of his world vision. But I think that, you know, Tim putting the right,
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:15.620]   at least the right thoughts with him and his people may have some effect. I mean, he's the only one
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:19.140]   that's going to assign those things. But I think that it's not a bad idea to be able to at least
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:23.940]   give him your two cents and have him, you know, thinking through that. I just don't know. I mean,
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:27.540]   I don't think Tim Cook will ever be in a position where he gets to be the last person who spoke
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:32.660]   about it. And then it's the person who's in the mind when the policy is, I don't know if policy
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:36.580]   is made or when the reaction happens. So he'll go in there and you'll talk and it could make all
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:42.260]   the sense in the world. And then by the time it gets down to actually enacting the policy,
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:46.580]   it's whomever is in the office with them, whatever is watching on television that makes the biggest
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:51.300]   impact. So, but I think this really does show Tim Cook's consistent policy has been engagement,
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:56.340]   whether it's business practices, Apple didn't like countries that had policies Apple didn't like,
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:38:00.580]   or regimes that Apple had issues with, they want to stay engaged. And they believe,
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:04.580]   Tim Cook has said that they believe that if they aren't engaged, they can never affect change.
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:08.180]   So, there are probably people, to Kelly's point, people who are more
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:13.460]   on the left, who are really upset with Apple and how it works with the Trump administration on
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:18.340]   tax policy and repatriation. And on the right, who are really upset with their stance on civil
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:23.940]   rights and immigration and all those things. So at least he's pissing off almost everybody equally,
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:28.820]   but he's staying involved and he's part of the conversation. And the alternative is not to be
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:32.740]   part of any of it. >> See, and I don't think it's going to move the needle at all for him to talk
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:36.820]   to Tim Cook, because as far as we know, Trump doesn't have an iPhone, so he can't get any
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:41.140]   support from Tim Cook. So, he's honestly not, it doesn't gain him anything to have that
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:44.340]   comment. >> He does, they took away his Android phone and they gave him an iPhone, and I think
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:49.860]   it only has Twitter installed on it. >> Really? Okay, well then, I take it back.
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:53.380]   Then that- >> Can you put me some more apps on Tim? Can you give me some more apps?
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:57.700]   >> Yeah, what's with the words? I hear they're very angry. I'm hearing, yeah.
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:03.860]   >> But before we go to our first ad, one last question. Who do you think has more influence
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:10.100]   on Trump at this point? Tim Cook or Kanye? >> I think that would definitely be Kanye.
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:17.060]   >> Kanye. >> Well, let's see what Tim's album does next. But before we will leave that for
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:23.300]   future discussion, because our friend and leader, Leo LaPorte, who is off vacationing at this very
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:28.500]   moment, however, before delegating his responsibilities to Renee and myself, he
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:33.380]   decided there's things that he should best handle himself, including delivering advertisements for
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:40.020]   our wonderful sponsors. Leo, what you got for us? >> Oh, man, I have a delicious coffee to share
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:45.300]   with you. And something I learned about coffee just the other day. >> Mm-hmm.
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:52.820]   >> Oh, that's Trace Pontas, P-O-N-T-A-S. You've heard of single origin coffee. This takes it to the
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:59.780]   next level. This coffee, Trace Pontas, is from a single family farm, the race family coffee farm,
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:05.540]   in that they're near the town of Trace Pontas. It's in Brazil, Brazilian coffee. It's the best.
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:11.860]   And in fact, this is from the mountainous regions of Brazil, the Trace Pontas mountain range.
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:16.500]   Some of the best coffee beans in the world grow there. For over 100 years, three generations,
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:21.140]   the race family has been growing. Some of the best premium gourmet coffee in Brazil. And now
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:26.820]   you can buy it directly from them. This is the first time they've ever exported their coffee to
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:33.620]   the US. I was a little skeptical until I tried it and I'm blown away. Now, there's a couple of
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:39.620]   things that make this the best cup of coffee you'll ever have. First of all, because the coffee is
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:45.700]   grown in Brazil. It's one of the few coffee growing regions where they can do something called
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:52.980]   natural pulping, I guess they call it. It's pulped naturally. It's not washed. In many other
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:57.700]   regions, because they're extra hot regions, they have to wash the coffees. And in washing,
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:02.500]   they wash off some of the most important part of the flavor. And they wash in, I'm sorry to say,
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:07.300]   a lot of the bitterness that you're probably used to in coffee. Trace Pontas is naturally pulped
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:14.260]   because it comes from Brazil. They don't need to do that kind of washing. And that means it is the
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:22.340]   smoothest coffee. There is no acidity. It's 100% arabica beans, non GMO certified, certified kosher,
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:26.900]   hand picked, and then they roast it by hand in small batches right before they ship it to you.
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:32.580]   In fact, if you look at the package, the beans, every package labeled with exactly where it came
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:38.660]   from. This came from the Garcia race farm in Minas, Jarese, Brazil. 1,100 meters.
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.540]   Paul, naturally, you're going to, I'll show you the bean in a second. You'll like that.
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:46.900]   And I love this part. This is fun. When you get a new bag of coffee, by the way, notice roasted
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:54.020]   on date. So you always know it's fresh. And do you see that the QR code on there? This is so cool.
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:42:00.900]   You scan this and it goes to the website and shows you exactly on the map from Google Earth,
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:05.380]   a satellite image of the exact place his coffee was born. That is pretty cool.
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:13.940]   I mean, a picture of the coffee's birthplace. That's the farm. This coffee came from. I love
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:18.660]   that. Let's open it up. I can't resist. I smell it. It smells so good. This is our,
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:23.140]   as I said, this is the, we got a medium roast here. This is from the,
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:31.460]   it's a cut to eye pulp, natural medium roast. I always get whole bean because I really,
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:36.820]   I'm a fan of the whole bean. Actually, let's just cut it open. Save time. I can't,
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:42.900]   I'm going to brew some right now. Oh, so fresh. You know, they have the little pressure relief
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:50.180]   valve in here so that the oxygen leaks out so it doesn't. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Look at that.
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:57.700]   Oh, that is, that couldn't be, that was last week. That was in Brazil. Oh my gosh.
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:05.940]   You know, so good you could eat it. Pulp wash, which means the bitterness is gone. It is fabulous.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:12.100]   Tres pontas. It's the freshest coffee you've ever had. It's the most delicious. It's the
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:17.780]   smoothest. It's the best coffee flavor. You can get it roasted light, medium, dark and French roast.
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:22.180]   Although if you're really a serious coffee connoisseur, I mean, I would get a little bit of that each.
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:26.020]   I use the French roast of my espresso, but really to appreciate this coffee,
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:37.620]   get a good drip filtration system, a Melita or a, you know, Chemex or maybe an arrow press. That's
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:43.220]   what we use. Get the lighter, the medium roast. See, the flavor is really there. You will be blown
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:47.940]   away. You know, most coffees, if you roast them dark enough, it doesn't matter if they're any
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:52.340]   good, you're burning it anyway. So that's why if you really want to see how good this coffee is,
[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:58.580]   how smooth, how luscious it is, get a bag of the medium roast. You can get it shipped to you every
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:03.540]   week, every two weeks, every four weeks. You do the subscription by all means, 12 ounce bags.
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:07.540]   So that, you know, they, you know, they're fresh and they, you'll use them up quickly enough so
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:12.180]   that you won't have to worry about it getting stale. You can get it ground if you want, but,
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:17.300]   you know, I would say get the whole bean, get a good grinder, get the medium or light roast,
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:21.460]   put it in the arrow press, you will never have a better cup of coffee. Free shipping in the US,
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:27.860]   you'll save 10% off if you sign up for a subscription, 10% off every bag of coffee,

[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:31.700]   delicious. TracePontas.com/macbreak. Okay, I'm caffeinated. What about you guys? Back to work.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:38.660]   You know, I mean, it's always have, always have Leo read your ad copy. I have literally
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:43.300]   so drunk four cups of coffee in my life. I'm not joking. I can count them. I've had four cups of
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:48.180]   coffee in my life. And now all I want is a cup of coffee. I can smell really great coffee in my
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:54.340]   office right now. So I didn't get the TracePontas. For the last week, it's delicious. It is, it is
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:47:00.020]   legitimately delicious. Oh, God, I don't want to get hooked. That's the one I've already got.
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:07.140]   I already have my caffeinated vice. And I just, I don't know if I needed another one.
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:16.260]   But hey, I got, so this, I have the new $329 iPad that was announced at Apple's
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:21.060]   event. This is Apple's loaner. This is not mine. But I'm actually kind of thinking about buying
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:27.300]   one firm itself, because the last part of my testing was last week when I went on, I was in
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:32.660]   New York City for five days for some business and some pleasure. And I said, okay, great. I'm
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:38.100]   going to leave behind the Mac book. I'm even going to leave behind my 12.9 inch iMac Pro.
[00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:47.300]   Excuse me, of course, my 12.9 inch iPad Pro and just rely on the $329 iPad paired with a Bluetooth
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:54.100]   keyboard of my own, my own abstraction. But still just that in the Apple pencil. And I got to admit,
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:48:00.180]   it did the job. It's like I wrote about three or four thousand words. I took about two or three
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:06.020]   thousand pictures, some of those pictures, I felt like I wanted to edit them in Lightroom mobile and
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:10.260]   then post them or do something else that was cool with them. I was managing my inbox. I was
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:14.420]   managing calendars. I was doing a whole bunch of stuff for business that's going to be happening
[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:20.100]   in the next three or four weeks. I have to say that I did miss having the larger screen real
[00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:26.900]   estate of my iPad Pro. I was missing how easy it was to have like a work pane. And then on the
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:33.300]   other third, just a Twitter pane or just a picture and picture, it's not as though this iPad can't do
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:38.420]   stuff like that, but it becomes a lot more, a lot more little pusion when you're squeezing things
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:45.860]   down to that. And so it's not as though I felt as though I'm on the countdown to buy a brand new
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:50.900]   iPad Pro this year next year, because I did buy the very first model that came out. It was the same
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:58.340]   day it was announced. But I was sort of thinking that when the next model that comes out with a
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:05.540]   good and interesting new feature set, I would certainly be liable for another $1,000 purchase.
[00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:13.060]   Now I'm like, it's kind of nice. The size was the only thing that was, I'm a little bit torn on
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:20.900]   whether the size was a positive or negative thing, because it's certainly smaller. My other iPad is
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:26.580]   an iPad mini, which unfortunately is now so old that it really feels really slow when I'm using it.
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:33.220]   And this is nothing, no speed glitches whatsoever, even when I was doing video, even when I was doing
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:38.500]   photos. And it's small enough that I can one-hand it very easily while still being big enough to
[00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:44.740]   read comic books and stuff like that on. And fortunately, it's just a little bit too big for
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:51.220]   my usual, I have one bag that I designate as the bag I take when I don't want to take something as
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:56.900]   big as a laptop bag. This is just it's small enough that I can fit in there so long as I don't also
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:02.500]   have like a camera lens and a charger and other things. It's okay for a few hours out, but maybe
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:10.980]   not okay for a trip. But I was surprised that even just simply as a solution to a future problem of
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:17.540]   what I need to get a new iPad, I might even want to get the 10-inch iPad Pro. I might want to get
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:22.420]   this because it does the job. And I can for the money that I would have budgeted, I can certainly
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:29.540]   afford to max out the RAM and it would just still do everything for me. So we have everybody who's
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:35.940]   in this conversation does way more traveling than they wish than as a kid, they'd be shocked that
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:41.700]   we're so are you complaining you get to travel so much? Yes, son, we're adults. The fact that we
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:45.460]   were home for three days and we have to eat all of the perishable stuff in the fridge because we're
[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:51.220]   going to be leaving for another two weeks after that. That gets old after a while. So starting
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:58.820]   off with you, Kelly, what do you think is the best, even just for you, the best Apple product for
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:04.420]   someone who travels who has to do a certain amount of work, your kind of work, what can you get away
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:10.260]   with and what's ideal for you? Well, I'm going to say ideal and yes, I totally admit that I'm
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:17.220]   biased about this. And before I get too far down that road, I just want to say that the Apple's
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:22.500]   education event in Chicago was super amazing and it was probably my favorite Apple event of all time.
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:27.780]   And that is because Tim Cook stood on stage and said Appcamp for Girls Out Loud.
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:33.620]   And I'm still kind of back at that. I had to tweet that out. It was like, yay,
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:40.420]   wasn't just a logo in the cloud of logos. It was, he actually said the words. I'm so happy about that.
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:46.420]   He said it. He said it out loud where people could hear him in public and I promptly freaked out.
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:59.460]   So putting that aside, I have the 10.5 iPad Pro. I got one for Christmas and I really like it.
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:06.260]   And part of the reason that I sort of held off was because I have a first generation air
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:12.900]   and it's that same slightly narrower on the sides bezel, the leaner-meaner form factor.
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:20.980]   And that's a great size. I would honestly say that if you are not a person who has a specific need
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:26.900]   for the extra space, then the latest iPad, I haven't spent a ton of time with the newest one,
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:34.580]   the one you have in your hand. But it's a great device and I would absolutely recommend that to
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:43.060]   somebody who doesn't have a specific need for it. And when I travel and need to take notes or
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:51.540]   you don't necessarily need my entire computer to do anything, then I take my iPad and I have an
[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:58.100]   Apple keyboard, the not magic one, the Apple wireless. And I take that and I just pair that up with my
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:05.300]   iPad. And then because no matter how good I get on the glass screen, I will always touch type faster
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:10.020]   than I can type on the screen of an iPad. And it doesn't matter how big the iPad is.
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:16.820]   I envy the cast members of Sir Trek, the next generation. They're really good at managing that
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:22.500]   L-car system with just glass to type on. Unfortunately, I'm stuck with 21st century brain and fingers
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:29.380]   and I will type on the glass keyboard, but I will bring a keyboard if I can deal with anything else
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:36.340]   in my bag. Renee, the thing that makes this interesting question to me is that Apple doesn't
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:43.780]   make any laptops that any mobile, any Macs that aren't, mobile maps, Macs that aren't really
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:48.420]   transportable. They have the MacBook Airs, they have the MacBook Nothing, which are tiny, tiny,
[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:53.860]   tiny, thin machines. But even the MacBook Pro is pretty thin and pretty light compared to the
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:54:01.380]   horsepower that they're packing. So you're running a media empire as you're struggling between countries.
[00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:05.860]   So what do you travel with and what do you think could be improved in the product line at this point?
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:13.060]   So I have two answers to that. Typically, I've been taking the 10.5 inch iPad Pro with me because
[00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:18.260]   it really does combine. It's just it's got built-in LTE so I can use it anywhere. I don't like
[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:23.140]   connecting to coffee, hotspots or hotel hotspots for security reasons. So I love that it's on my
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:27.300]   own network. I can use it anywhere. I love to use the Apple Pencil. I actually really like the
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:33.380]   smart keyboard. It's the only thing that I miss from the 9.7 inch iPad. We've established on the
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:38.420]   show previously that I'm really such a terrible typist that I can use any keyboard that anybody
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:43.780]   gives me. So I'm just as productive on that as I am on any generation MacBook keyboard. So to me,
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:47.540]   it's so sleek, it's so slim, it's so easy to travel with. I take it all the time,
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:54.020]   except when I have to do video work. I know Serenity Caldwell can just kill it with the iPad and
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:59.540]   iMovie and some of the other apps, but I'm just not as good. I started video editing on the video
[00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:07.780]   toaster. I'm a relic. I edit better on a Mac than I do on an iPad. I know intuitively I should be
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:12.420]   able to just like I watch her. She swipes and cuts and moves and it's amazing. It's like casting
[00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:18.740]   magic, but I just I can't do that yet. I need like the warm Linus comfort blanket of a Mac. So I've
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:24.500]   been taking the 15 inch MacBook Pro with me and I vowed after having a 17 inch at my old day job
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:30.980]   years ago. I'd never go big again. But when I see the video, just the speed with which it can chew
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:37.220]   through 4K video files and it's really 4K that tipped me back into the bigger MacBook Pros with
[00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:43.220]   the beefier graphics cards. But it just takes so much less time to do anything video related on
[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:48.420]   a 15 inch MacBook Pro that I now sort of have this two tiered system where I have the star
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:54.420]   destroyer of the 15 inch MacBook Pro. And then I have the Imperial shuttlecraft of the iPad Pro
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:56:00.020]   and I leave the star destroyer in orbit as much as I can and I only take it out when I have to.
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:02.340]   And then I scuttle around on the shuttle as much as possible.
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:10.420]   Yeah, well, Alex is interesting in that we were when the when the when the quick
[00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:15.220]   routes box version of the Mac Pro came out, you were saying how wonderful it is to be able to
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:22.180]   throw these in a backpack and use it as as a portable Mac. Like during given the heavy duty
[00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:27.380]   stuff that you have to work with when you travel. Do you have like a designation between the stuff
[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:31.460]   that's going to have to be able to render green screen immediately, but you still have to travel
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:36.420]   with it versus the stuff that you're going to use just to like play games and do email with.
[00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:40.740]   Like is it is it possible for Apple to make anything that's portable that can actually handle the
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:45.300]   sort of work that you have to do? I think it might be possible. I mean, I would love the form factor
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:50.580]   of the surface to be honest with the Mac OS would be my preference. I really like it.
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:55.220]   So the detachable keyboard like a transport. Yeah, well, I'd rather have a better keyboard for
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:59.700]   typing. I still think that it's easier. I have this kind of odd thing where I'm constantly moving
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:06.340]   between my laptop, which is still a 2015 retina. Because I hate the USB stuff. I don't have my
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:11.860]   Mac. My mag safe is the number one thing that keeps me on my retina. But I'm saying. Yeah. And so
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:16.820]   but so if I had a mag safe, I don't think the rest of it wouldn't matter to me. I'd get I'd
[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:22.020]   immediately get a new laptop. It's just literally if you're traveling, whoever designed a mags
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:27.860]   took the mag safe out of them out of the computer doesn't travel period. And so and they don't
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:32.420]   realize how big of a deal that is and how it's every day and all the time. And so so I have a retina.
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:38.340]   I'm down. I'm not I'm not accountable for as much as I used to be. So I'm down to one retina at a time
[00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:44.260]   which is which is a good thing. Usually I used to have a primary in a backup that usually was there.
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:49.540]   The I wish I just wish I could draw on the screen. So I have this kind of odd thing that I go back
[00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:55.540]   and forth between my iPad and I know it sounds a little weird. I have a one iPad that's all like
[00:57:55.540 --> 00:58:01.060]   it's really got my I'm logged into it. And then I have another iPad that I'm not logged into that
[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:06.100]   it's because we hand our we have a bunch of stuff that manages questions and interactions and stuff
[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:09.620]   for hosts on shows. And so I need to have one that doesn't have any of my accounts on it and
[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:13.780]   it's got its own account that I can send links to and stuff like that. And so so I've one of those
[00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:20.340]   usually plugged in there. I do most of my thinking on my iPad. So I have a lot of drawing programs
[00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:25.540]   and so I sit there and I'm sketching and working on ideas and building like I won't touch keynote
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:32.900]   until I've actually gone through and sketched all the all my slides because it's much faster.
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:36.820]   And so I do that do all that and then I go back to keynote and I build them all out. And so
[00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:43.220]   and I build I build a deck almost a deck a day on average. So it's something that I it's definitely
[00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:51.060]   a process. And so so anyway, so I think that I do most of my actual interaction with with people
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:55.540]   on my phone. So I mean, that's probably I definitely spend more time on my phone than I spend on
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:59.540]   anything else. And so I definitely like when I thinking of paying for an iPhone 10 doesn't mean
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:03.380]   anything to me because that is the number one thing that I spend time on. So I take my photos
[00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:07.140]   with it. I we work on Slack. So you know, I run the whole company, you know, the whole company's
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:14.740]   run on Slack. So it's it's a and then I'm jumping between messenger and messages and hangouts and
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:21.460]   depending on who the client is or who we're talking to. So it's it's a you know, so my phone is
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:24.260]   probably the most important thing. If I'm going to walk out of the house, I'm not really thinking
[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:28.820]   about my iPad, I'm thinking about my phone and I can really write a lot with with two with two
[00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:35.220]   thumbs. So you know, I've written pretty long emails with it. And so so anyway, so I think that
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:38.900]   my phone is the most important thing if I'm going to walk away, walk out of the house with and then
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:42.980]   and then I will take an iPad, I'm just trying to think I like to stay away from stuff. And the
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:47.620]   problem with the iPad, replacing the laptop is a getting video into it as hard. And be
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:53.460]   the latency of getting from one thing to the other is high. So cutting and pasting is still
[00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:55.940]   this like pain in the neck. And you don't know if you're actually going to be able to cut and
[00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:58.980]   paste. So there's some apps that won't let you cut and paste or some web pages you can't cut
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:03.140]   and based. And that turns out to be a pain in the neck. And so if you're trying to do something,
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:07.380]   build something really fast, I find that the iPad and you're using lots of different
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:11.060]   sources, you're jumping from this app to that app to bring something in, you're going to go
[01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.460]   fix this picture, you're going to bring it back in, you're going to do this thing.
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:18.580]   It's not that the iPad, you can't do it on the iPad, but it's a quarter of the speed.
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:24.260]   You know, and so I think that that is the I want to go to the iPad every day. I want to go to the
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:31.140]   iPad, but I haven't found a way to get to sever myself from the laptop just yet.
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:35.700]   And I and I at home, I use my iMac. I don't big screen, you know, it's connected to all my hard
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:42.740]   drives. So my laptop even is only used when I'm on the road and needing to do, yeah, do that kind of
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:49.300]   work. Yeah, the file sandboxing has gotten a lot better since the first time I decided to go on a
[01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:55.060]   long trip with just an iPad. But it's still the sort of thing where you have to plan way ahead to
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:01:00.900]   make sure that at no point are you going to encounter a file that you have to be able to get onto this
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:05.700]   device and open with a compatible app. So you have to plan ahead to make sure that whatever you need
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:13.300]   to do, you can get that done or be so all in on the iCloud infrastructure that it will be a
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:18.500]   transparent move from your Mac to your iPad. And yeah, there were a couple, there were still a
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:23.540]   couple of times where, not barn burners, but times where I was thinking, Oh, what I want to achieve
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:30.500]   would be so achievable if I could just Bluetooth a file from my phone to this to this device. But
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:34.820]   of course, I couldn't because you can't do that. But before we move off, though, is there,
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:43.780]   it seems like the iPads are getting so powerful. And the less expensive Macs and even the MacBook
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:49.540]   Pro in some instances is so limited in the sense that they're starting to let's make these super,
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:53.620]   super thin less delete ports, let's delete certain expandability options.
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:02:01.380]   It's sometimes I wonder if Apple's trying to make the case for anybody who come for the people who
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:07.700]   come into the Apple store with let's say $1,000 to spend on a MacBook Air or $1,200 to spend on
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:13.940]   a MacBook, nothing. And someone complained when I refer to the MacBook with the MacBook that has
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:19.780]   no suffix after it as the MacBook nothing. I use that only for clarity. I'm not saying this
[01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:24.340]   computer is a nothing. I'm not saying that you are nothing for using or liking these things. I'm
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:31.780]   just trying to create a word picture of clarity here. But people who might be coming in for a
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:36.900]   MacBook Air or a MacBook nothing to at least give them the option of saying, well, gosh,
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:42.660]   if you want a super light and affordable mobile computer, that's not going to be you're not going
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:48.020]   to be able to plug stuff directly into any way. Why not get this wonderful iPad Pro? Because
[01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:52.580]   they probably do what you want to do. I'd say 90% of the population could use an iPad Pro just fine.
[01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:58.900]   I don't think that it is an iPad and phone or whatever. I look at my kids, my kids,
[01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:03.380]   they jump back and forth between computers and iPads and so on and so forth. But they spend most
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:10.580]   of their time on their iPad and they just move through the iPads really. The only reason they
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:18.900]   want to use a laptop is because you can't create Roblox environments on an iPad. So that's their
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:26.420]   primary development issue. But I think that outside of that, they're fluid.
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:33.140]   And when I look at my parents, I think my mom spends more time on her iPad than she does on her
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:37.380]   computer. And I think that people who are not doing anything that is that what I'm doing,
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:40.500]   which is that whole, I'm going to throw things back and forth and I'm going to do all these
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:45.700]   other bits and pieces. I got to connect a lot of peripherals. I would definitely, if my life got
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:50.420]   simple enough that I could do that, I would never look back and just use an iPad. And I think that
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:55.060]   a lot of people, I think that a lot of people would. And so I think that Apple's on the right,
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:59.540]   I mean, that tablet experience and the phone experience is the right solution. And it is the
[01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:03.940]   replacement for a vast majority of the population. I think there's a handful of us that are probably
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:08.020]   on the show that can't quite sever it just yet.
[01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:09.140]   Yeah.
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:15.220]   I think it was kind of a mistake for, I thought not the best message for Apple to send when they
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:19.540]   had that commercial of the little girl using her iPad to do all these sort of things with the
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:23.780]   course of the day. And then her mom's like, "So, what do you do in your computer?" And she goes,
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:29.940]   "What's a computer?" Because it makes us all feel about 18 years older than we really should be
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:35.860]   forced to feel like. But also, I think I like the idea of Apple's insisting that no, it is a
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:39.780]   computer. Instead of thinking of the iPad as something you have never used before and you don't
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:45.220]   understand, it is just a computer. It's a computer that is extra thin and extra light and
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:48.900]   extra convenient because you only take a keyboard with you when you feel like you're going to need
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:53.300]   a keyboard. So I kind of wish Apple would stick to the messaging that think about buying an iPad
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:58.500]   instead of not just a Mac look.
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:04.820]   Well, the not the computer is not that not the computer forces every other computer
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:11.380]   manufacturer to play on the iPad's playing field. And that puts everybody else at an
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:16.740]   advantage, disadvantage. So that's definitely why they're doing it. Because by redefining what is
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:26.580]   called a useful productivity appliance as not a computer, they're creating an uphill slope for
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:31.700]   everybody else that can't build a tablet as good as they can. And right now, I think that's everybody.
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:39.780]   And I've upgraded a number of people from older Windows laptops to an iPad. And part of that,
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:44.100]   I think goes hand in hand with technological honesty. Sit down and tell me for real what
[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:50.340]   it is you really do with that computer. And finding out that it's, well, I have a little bit of
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:58.980]   online banking and I have some Facebook that I have to do. And I look at web pages for different
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:03.460]   things, like, you know, whatever those things are. And then being able to sit down and explain to
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:08.580]   somebody, like, how you interact with those is going to be a little different, but you're going to be
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:14.500]   better off with this other device. And having that, I've done a bunch of that flawlessly for
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:20.340]   a nonzero number of people. Like, it's been quite a few people who like, yeah, the Windows
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:25.460]   machines on its last legs. And I just don't know if I want another one. And well, what if you could
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:29.540]   have a computer that you could carry around with you everywhere? Like, you could sit in living room,
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:34.020]   you can take it with you when you go someplace else. You know, if you want it, if you want to be
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:38.580]   able to do that, like, you have the opportunity and then getting them to sit down and really think
[01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:44.900]   about what it is they do with their computer. And an iPad is more than up to the task for a lot
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:50.180]   of people. But I think particularly long time users remember when you had to get a new computer
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:55.060]   every six months or at least a new graphics card every six months. And all of that was, you know,
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:58.260]   you have to upgrade your computer once a year because you have to upgrade your computer once a year.
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:04.740]   And now that we've sort of gotten out of that, and there's been more maturity in the platform,
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:08.900]   and you don't have to worry about that kind of stuff anymore, I think it's gotten a lot easier
[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:13.140]   for people to sit down and go, you know, I don't really need all that extra stuff. I don't need
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:20.660]   that whole monitor. I don't need to be dedicating the corner of my kitchen or my whatever room,
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:24.180]   you know, where I have this whole desk and this giant thing. Like, maybe they don't have to.
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:29.060]   Like some people, it doesn't make sense for them to continue to have all of that hardware
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:31.140]   when they could do everything that they want to do on an iPad.
[01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:37.860]   Yeah, that's critical. It's when you get people to say, you get yourself into so many ruts when
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:43.060]   you simply buy this thing because you always, you've always bought this thing. And if you start
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:48.820]   forgetting that a computer or a camera or an oven or even a car is a solution to an exist to a
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:54.580]   problem that you have. And sometimes the because in the case of, let's say, a car, the problem you
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:08:00.100]   had at age 16 might be different from the problem you had at age 30 or 35 or 40 or 50.
[01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:05.460]   And maybe the solution is not a car. Maybe your solution is something else. Similarly,
[01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:09.220]   if you have if you're if you're always buying brand new laptops every time you need a new
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:14.260]   computer quote unquote, what do you do? What do you use a computer with? And could you do that
[01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:21.140]   thing those things more efficiently if you had a magazine style computer that lasts for 12
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:26.340]   hours on battery doesn't get any viruses almost never fails or at least if it fails, at least it
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:31.300]   bounces you elegantly back to the home screen instead of giving you a blue screen of unhappiness.
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:37.940]   Well, speak of unhappiness though. Gosh, we have to talk about that MacBook Pro again, don't we?
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:43.300]   Apple Insider has been following up on a lot of anecdotal stories about people who
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:50.100]   keep saying that they're they're Apple they're 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pro keyboards, the super,
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:57.300]   super flat keyboards with the extra luxurious 0.55 millimeters of key travel, brand new design,
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:02.820]   and guess what they seem to be doing very, very poorly mechanically. They did they decided to do
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:09.460]   some research and they had a poll or a little canvassing of a large group continuing consisting
[01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:14.020]   of actual Apple Genius Bar people who probably were not supposed to be talking to them in the
[01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:19.140]   first place, but also Apple authorized repair centers to get some data on this. So this is
[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:24.660]   based on a selection of these stores. It's not based on all people's usage, but they
[01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:35.220]   say that 2016 keyboards are seem to be failing twice as much as the ones made in 2015. The last
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:41.060]   one with the previous keyboard design, 2017 MacBook Pro keyboards, they're doing only slightly better.
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:47.460]   Here we're talking about they have data for the 2016 keyboards, not enough data yet for 2017,
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:56.180]   but they are saying that of the 1994 service events that they recorded for the 2016 MacBook
[01:09:56.180 --> 01:10:06.900]   Pro's 114 of them were related to keyboard failures. And that's compared to 165 of the 14
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:12.580]   o' excuse me, 1402. So basically, they're saying that there's 11.8% of those service events
[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:20.180]   were related to the keyboard in 2016 MacBook Pros, compared with 6% their year before and 5.6%
[01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:26.100]   the year before that. Also interesting, they also got data on how often were these repaired
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:33.300]   machines coming back. And whereas the previous year, again, the last year with the conventional
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:39.220]   model, eight of the ones that got fixed came back once and none came back a third time,
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:47.060]   who compared that to the 2016 models of 165, 51 of them came back again, 10 of those came back
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:53.620]   a third time. And if you think this is merely an annoyance, realize that if this machine is out
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:58.740]   of warranty and now many of those 2016 MacBook Pros are out of warranty, you don't just replace
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:04.580]   a busted keep cap, you don't just replace the entire keyboard, you replace the entire upper case,
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:13.220]   and that is a $700 out of warranty repair. Renee, I remember one of the times we were talking about
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:22.180]   this, I was, let's, I slightly regret saying that this keyboard was a piece of garbage,
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:27.620]   because I should have gone there. I should have gone there and said, I should have used that
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:32.740]   waffle word that journalists use for many users. It's a piece of garbage from all but let's say a
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:37.700]   handful of sets of expectations, the logical rational response is that this keyboard is a piece of
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:43.700]   garbage. I was mostly referring to how it felt like typing on it, that was also incorrect,
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:51.220]   because garbage has more than 0.55 millimeters of travel, unless you're, you know, anyway, Renee,
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:57.860]   does Apple have a problem on its hands now? I don't know anybody who likes typing on it,
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:02.420]   who doesn't add phraseology, like I don't, keyboards aren't really important to me,
[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:07.460]   and you have not only that, you also have now problems where it's now starting to get documented
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:12.580]   that these damn things are failing. Does Apple have a problem? Does Apple have to talk about this?
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:17.780]   Does Apple have to invite four or five journalists to a top secret area inside Apple to promise
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:22.340]   them that at some date to be determined later on, they will actually give us a keyboard that is
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:26.340]   comfortable to type on and doesn't break after a year? I leave the 40s.
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:34.100]   So, yes and no. So the, when I spoke to Mike, who did awesome research for Apple Insider on this,
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:40.100]   and he chose to focus on the percentage out of incidents that were keyboard related,
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:43.860]   which is super interesting and is one of the internal metrics that Apple uses, as far as I
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:49.620]   understand, but when you look at the actual numbers, 2014, you have, like you said,
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:58.340]   2120 incidents, 118 keyboard, 2015, 1904, 114 are keyboard related. In 2016, those are down to
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:04.260]   1,402. So overall, the MacBook, whatever Apple did in 2016, resulted in a far more reliable or at least
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:09.940]   a MacBook that required less repairs than any year before, except for the keyboard.
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:16.580]   And the keyboard is up to 165 incidents. Apple will tell you they sold more 2016 MacBooks and
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:20.500]   they sold in the previous couple of years. That's probably true given the pent up demand. So it's
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:24.500]   hard to adjust the numbers, but I think it's undeniable that keyboard incidents went up with
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:29.700]   the 2016 Mac, won the rest of the computer went down. But then you look at the 2017 numbers and
[01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:33.940]   they're not finished yet because the computer went on sale in June and we're just beginning May.
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:38.420]   So there's like a month and a half of data that's missing, but they're on track to be about the
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:44.500]   same as they were prior to the 2016 MacBook. And the incidents in total are way down again. They're
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:50.500]   down to 1161. So maybe that ends up being 1200 1300. So they're still down significantly year
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:55.140]   over year. And the keyboard ends up being flat. So it's the one component that wasn't significantly
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:59.060]   improved. And when you look at how Apple handles this stuff, like Apple recently did a battery
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:04.820]   replacement program for this very MacBook for the escape key version, it has to hit a certain
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:11.060]   threshold. And then these procedures take place. If it's if it's encountered more often than it's
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:17.220]   typical or acceptable to this device and the keyboard even granted that it has a higher
[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:22.500]   rate of failure than pre generations is still nowhere near that. So in terms of if this was
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:27.380]   any other year, any other MacBook, and I say that as someone who had to have their 2014 MacBook
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:32.580]   Pro keyboard replaced and it was a $400 repair that luckily was still under Apple Care because
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:36.580]   I'm paranoid and I buy Apple Care all the time and they had to replace the entire top assembly
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:43.620]   because the E key wasn't working and had that repair done. These numbers aren't
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:51.140]   recall level much less replacement program level yet much less recall number.
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:56.020]   But the sentiment in the media and I'm not including Andy in that. But if you just look at everyone
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:15:00.820]   from Casey Johnson, the Casey Neistat. Excuse me, I don't write for the Chicago
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:06.420]   sometimes anymore, but I am part of the media. So I take. I just meant you weren't doing hysterical
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:10.820]   and sensational. I was being sensitive. I was being hysterical and sensational.
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:14.980]   No, I don't. So I include Andy as someone who's sold the seats of dissension and hate about this.
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:19.140]   No, I'm just kidding. But the media attention, you have Jason Snell writing about whether they need
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:22.500]   a recall. You have John Gruber writing about how terrible the keyboard is. These are people who
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:29.940]   are traditionally very fond of Apple. The perception is so bad that I think regardless of what the
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:34.020]   numbers are and I'm super happy we have numbers because I think it really does add context to what
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:39.460]   was previously an anecdotal discussion. I think these numbers no longer matter. I think that the
[01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:46.820]   sentiment is such that the product is almost toxic, certainly damaged. And Apple, more than likely
[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:51.540]   will. I don't know if they'll address it or they'll just improve the keyboard and then Jim Dallenpull
[01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:55.780]   said this on the talk show earlier this week. When people ask about it on background, they'll say,
[01:15:55.780 --> 01:16:00.420]   yeah, yeah, third generation switches or something. And I think the irony here is that these
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:05.220]   butterflies switches, the whole keyboard was designed to reduce ingress as part of the ability to
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:09.380]   make these machines more reliable. And the side effect is when something got in, it's much harder
[01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:15.540]   for it to get out. So it's, it's, I think it just it went wrong. And Apple has to course correct it.
[01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:23.940]   Kelly, what happens when they have a feature that at best there are the most the most love I ever
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:30.420]   hear about that keyboard design failure rate notwithstanding is that I got used to it. At what
[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:34.660]   point do you simply say that perhaps this is an area of there's Apple say this is an area that
[01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:39.620]   perhaps we can improve things. And no one would complain that we got rid of that super flat keyboard.
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:45.220]   Because that keyboard just looks like it's green and glowing at this point at something you could
[01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:50.260]   make so many people happy by creating a new MacBook that had a halfway decent keyboard on it at this
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:55.540]   point. Even exactly the same MacBook and just give it a better keyboard. And the problem is,
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:17:01.300]   I'm not the person to ask about this because this is my keyboard. And I will show you why this matters.
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:11.700]   That's the stuff. Old school, clacky, giant, heavy, like, I don't travel with this keyboard.
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:17.700]   I don't even like, I haven't liked them since we got away from the PowerBook model,
[01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:24.020]   where in the MacBook Pro model with the silver keyboard. Yeah, that was springy. Like I, that was
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:29.940]   the last attached to a laptop keyboard that I like. As soon as we went chick-a-klee's, I was out.
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:35.300]   Like I actively started using an external keyboard on purpose because I don't like the
[01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:39.940]   chick-a-klee's. I don't like that they're so thin. I don't like that I'm wearing them away
[01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:45.300]   just by using my computer all the time. I do like that it's backlit, but that's a thing that
[01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:49.540]   I'm happy to give up in order to have a keyboard I actually like typing on. Because I don't like
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:53.700]   that the throw on the little keyboards anyway. I have strong opinions about this. So like I said,
[01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:58.340]   I'm not the reverse to ask. It makes my fingers tired to spend an extended, I keep looking over
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:02.900]   there because there's my laptop. It makes my fingers tired to type for an extended amount of time on
[01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:09.060]   that keyboard because I'm like bottoming out all the keys all the time because I'm used to using a
[01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:15.460]   keyboard that has actual throw. And so for me, like it's a frustrating experience all around. So
[01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:20.980]   not liking the one that I have and then finding out like everything you hate about that keyboard
[01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:25.300]   is just magnified because the thing that you don't like is that there's no throw. And this one has
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:30.900]   way less throw than the one that you don't like that doesn't have any throw. That feels like it
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:35.940]   would be the most frustrating experience. So I've been actively really happy with my computer for
[01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:43.060]   that reason alone. Well, okay, not that reason alone. I really love MagSafe. I pink puffy heart
[01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:48.740]   MagSafe all the live long day. And I was never a fan of that keyboard in the first place. And
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:54.260]   I've spent a little bit of time typing on like the first iteration of it and really like actively
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:59.460]   hated it. Like I don't like the keyboard I have now, but I hated typing on that one. It was the worst.
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:07.700]   And so like I think it's interesting that this we've got this like and Tana gate sort of optic
[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:13.140]   situation with this thing right now. I'm going to be interested to see what Apple's next move is
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:18.980]   going to be with it. You know, after seeing like and part of that is because I feel like there's a
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:23.300]   philosophy that brought us this keyboard, which is the computer always needs to be thinner than
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:27.380]   the last one. It always needs to be lighter than the last one. And I don't subscribe to that.
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:33.620]   I would be happy with a computer that's exactly the same thickness that had a decent keyboard on
[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:40.420]   it, even if they just went back to the the chocolate model that has a tiny bit more throw than the
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:46.660]   one that that exists. Like, I don't know, I don't know anybody who would say, you know,
[01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:52.020]   the problem with my current Apple laptop is that it's just too thick and too heavy. And I need it
[01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:59.140]   to be lighter. And I'm more than happy to spend the bulk of my time that I use this computer
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:04.020]   with this terrible keyboard when the primary thing I do with it is type on the keyboard all the time.
[01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:09.460]   That's frustrating. I think that one of the things that's interesting listening to you talk
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:13.380]   about it is I really, really, there's some of us that are truck drivers about our computers. We
[01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:17.700]   need big computers. We need them to last long. We need them powerful. We need the keyboards.
[01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:22.980]   And we're the last ones using the computer. So the thing is that when you think about Apple
[01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:29.460]   like specializing, you're absolutely right that making the computer thinner for the people who
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:34.340]   want it to be more powerful is going the wrong direction. In a lot of ways, it might make more
[01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:39.300]   sense for Apple to say, okay, we're gonna make iPads that are great and they're thin. And that's
[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:44.420]   for everybody who cares about thin. Then we're gonna make laptops that are horses that are
[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:49.220]   that have the keyboards that we want to write on. They last for 18 hours.
[01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:56.180]   Those types of things and they have a magsafe. But we're not trying to make them thinner and
[01:20:56.180 --> 01:21:00.740]   thinner and thinner and more efficient because you're solving a problem for a group of people
[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:06.580]   that are going away rather than allowing us to have, for us, for me, for a Mac Pro,
[01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:12.980]   I want the next Mac Pro, I'm hoping is rack mountable. I don't need a round. I want a 3U rack mount
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:17.300]   and just make it modular and call it a thing. As a group of people, though, like, even if we're
[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:22.900]   going away, like, I don't care if my computer is too, if I get a new computer, I don't care if
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:28.740]   it's two ounces lighter than the one that I have. Like, I don't care if it's two pounds heavier.
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:34.420]   If someone said it's two pounds heavier, you're gonna have a real keyboard and you're gonna be
[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:39.540]   able to last 18 hours and have a magsafe. I'd be like, just, just where's the money? You know,
[01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:44.500]   like, there's not enough of you, though, Alex. And that's like, that's, I think,
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:47.780]   but we're only making the computer. There's not, what I'm saying is,
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:53.220]   Apple sales skyrocketed, at least in turn, like the most computer they, we vote with our wallet
[01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:56.500]   as much as I love, like, all the Mac minis and the Mac Pros. When we vote with our wallet,
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:22:00.020]   people overwhelmingly buy these small, sexy computers. Even if they don't need them,
[01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:03.940]   they just decide they want the MacBook Pro and they buy it. But what I think is incumbent on
[01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:08.020]   Apple, like what they're doing with the MacBook, with the MacBook now, the modular MacBook,
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:12.180]   is to make that computer, even though it doesn't sell a lot. So I was perfectly fine with this
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:17.540]   MacBook Pro, but they made the low end model with the Escape key and the one port that's fine,
[01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:21.780]   MacBook Air, whatever replacement, but they didn't make the one on top. And if they'd made the one
[01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:27.380]   on top that had the big graphics card and didn't last that long, like, did everything else the
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:32.740]   same, but added one skew on the top for people who really want that Alex Lindsey machine,
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:35.060]   then I think they would have saved themselves two years of pain.
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:40.500]   I don't know. We were in the same part of the company. Kevin Hanson in our company has a,
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:45.380]   he still has the 17 inch and when he opens it up, I'm just like, "Oh, yeah, I just missed."
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:50.100]   And he has it because it has an Nvidia chip in it and it runs some, it still runs some stuff
[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:58.180]   faster than the current MacBooks. And so anyway, it was just, it's still, I still miss my.
[01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:00.740]   Yeah, make that. Make that just like you're making a Mac Pro.
[01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:04.020]   Yeah, just do it. You're right. You're right. Give us one more, because I think that the problem
[01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:07.780]   is that, yeah, people are buying the smaller ones, but not as, maybe they're buying them
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:09.700]   because they're thinner, maybe they're buying them because they're cheaper.
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:14.580]   No, they're buying them because they think they still need a laptop. And if I want to
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:18.420]   unplug it and take it somewhere, it's not a whole thing. Like it was with the 17 inch.
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:25.620]   I still know a couple people that have the 17 inch powerbook. The issue is that between model
[01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:28.900]   years, I don't necessarily need it to be any thinner anymore. I feel like we've gotten to that
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:34.260]   point. We ditched an optical drive, we ditched the spinning hard drive. Like everything in it is
[01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:39.220]   flash and solid state. It's got a good reputation. It's got good battery. It's got great battery life.
[01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:45.700]   And like, I don't feel like I need it to be any thinner and any lighter than it is now.
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:49.620]   You know, it's the same thing I think about my phone. Like, I don't need my phone to be any thinner.
[01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:52.820]   Go into Best Buy and do that. They lift them up and they see which is the lighter one and
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:55.940]   you buy the lighter one. It's the same reason they buy the terrible television sets.
[01:23:55.940 --> 01:23:58.740]   I think you want to see that. Then you want to go get an iPad.
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:01.860]   I've never seen that. So I can't say that that's the thing that actually happens.
[01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:07.860]   But like for me, that's the thing that I've looked at is like, I don't need it to be any
[01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:13.300]   thinner. I don't need it to be any lighter. What I need you to do is give me a better graphics card
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:18.660]   or give me a better looking screen or give me a nicer keyboard or do something cool with the track
[01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:28.020]   pad. Like they did. I have one of the first models of the Macbook Pro with the nice non-diving board
[01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:32.980]   trackpad. And it's been really, I really enjoy that tiny little thing. And my computer didn't
[01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:37.700]   have to be any thinner or any lighter for them to give that to me. And that would be great.
[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:42.180]   I would say that the number one reason I have friends moving away from the Mac platform is
[01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:48.580]   because they're buying PCs that are more powerful with more battery power. And those PCs are
[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:53.460]   twice as thick and twice as heavy as the Mac. And they want something that they're not going for
[01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:58.820]   thin. They're going for power. And I think that Apple is, Apple may be selling a lot of those,
[01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:03.380]   but I think that Apple has a market where they have to decide what the Mac is going to be doing
[01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:08.900]   in its last little bit. And I think that there's iPads for 90% of the population. If they want
[01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:14.740]   to serve that last 10%, and maybe they don't. Maybe they have a shelf life for the Mac that
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:19.060]   they're trying to move us all towards. But they're bleeding out a lot of people who are
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:25.700]   like me that I have a PC, I have a razor that I do my stuff on because I can't,
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:29.300]   not because I have apps that I mean, I have some apps that only run on it. But the primary reason
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:36.820]   I do it is faster. Yeah, the Mac is across the board, including all models, 9% of sales right now.
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:45.140]   And Apple has a responsibility and a problem in that they have to manufacture every single Mac
[01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:52.180]   that's available for sale. And so it becomes difficult for users. It becomes difficult for Apple
[01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:57.140]   when they decide that we are not going to give you any choice of keyboard, whether you give us $800
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:26:05.540]   or $4,000 for a laptop, it will have this horrible .55 millimeter of travel keyboard on it. You can
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:12.740]   give us $10,000. It will still be this .55 millimeter keyboard. So I don't think that Apple has proven
[01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:18.740]   that people like thinner stuff. It's that they don't hate them as much enough to switch to windows
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:25.060]   over it. Whereas if they if there was one manufacturer, if they were still, if they signed such a
[01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:30.180]   horrible deal with power computing, they were so desperate for money. But the thing is,
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:36.900]   it was that if that if they sign such a horrible deal that it's like the deal that Marvel signed
[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:41.380]   when they sold the rights to Spiderman and the expense saying you get to make movies as long
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:46.100]   as you want, so long as you keep making movies, you don't we can't cancel this for any reason.
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:50.740]   If we suddenly become bought by Disney and become a multi billion dollar because the only dog corporation
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:55.700]   if this company decided we're still in business or was leasing its rights to Lenovo and Lenovo
[01:26:55.700 --> 01:27:01.300]   could make one think pad that runs the Mac operating system. So you get a great keyboard,
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:04.660]   you get actual ports, you get the same performance, you get the same screen,
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:09.140]   then we get to stack that next to the MacBook Pro and see if people actually like thinner,
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:15.300]   lighter, terrible keyboard, all USB C ports. Otherwise, we have to decide that people are not
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:20.020]   hating this enough to abandon all of their apps and all their services and all their workflows.
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:24.260]   Well, if you if you wanted to, if you I still think that if Apple wanted to burn the house while
[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:30.420]   they're leaving it, so there's a PC market and everyone's got all their ideas and everything else.
[01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:33.780]   If Apple wanted to burn that down, what they would do is they would license the operating system
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:38.100]   because suddenly all these guys could, you know, because the thing is they don't need it anymore.
[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:44.260]   Back then, Apple needed the revenue from the Mac and they it was going to kill the company to do
[01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:48.900]   what they did. And the primary problem that Apple had back in the 90s was that they licensed it out
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:53.140]   and they try it. They want to do prime their primary license for the the G3 was supposed to go out to
[01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:58.180]   everyone else and the G4 was going to be the the app one that Apple maintain more control,
[01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:03.940]   made more money. The problem was the G3 team built a larger L2 cache. And so the G3 was actually
[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:10.420]   coming out as as powerful and more powerful than the G4. And and and so the problem they had was
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:13.940]   the low cost computers were about to outperform the high cost computers. And if they didn't plow
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:18.500]   them all into the ground, they were gonna it was gonna it was gonna kill it what it was going to
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:25.300]   wipe the company out. You know, and so the and so the thing is is that the and that's coming from
[01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:30.580]   chip guys, you know, like they were and they're all in the same company building the chips.
[01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:35.220]   One team just said, well, it was like one of those notes. We're gonna make the L2 cache bigger
[01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:38.660]   and no one really noticed didn't realize what that was going to do, you know, and and when they
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:44.020]   figured it out, Apple was in big trouble, you know, and but now it's like almost a rounding error
[01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:48.820]   what they make on on their max, you know, and if they wanted to really push people like put
[01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:53.940]   create havoc in the PC market, push people in more towards iPads, all those things would, you know,
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:58.660]   it would create chaos if Apple suddenly made that operating system more available, let people
[01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:03.300]   customize it, let people, you know, have the computers they want with the operating system they want.
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:09.060]   That that all of that stuff would, it's a much different place than than they were when they did
[01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:14.020]   it before. They don't need the money. What they need to do is I mean, it would do them good. I mean,
[01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:18.740]   from a MacuVellian perspective, to create havoc in a market that they don't need anymore.
[01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:27.220]   All I want is for Apple to allow me to run it in virtual box on a thinkpad. That's all I want.
[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:33.220]   Ben Behren, before the rumor started, he said that the, you know, the PC market is finally getting
[01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:37.620]   profitable and the best thing Apple could do is release an updated MacBook Air and slash 100
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:40.900]   bucks out of it. And it would suck the entire air out of the PC resurgence.
[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:45.700]   And now, you know, that's a hot rumor now, although the rumor now is that it's going to move from
[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:52.180]   WWDC to September. But there's still a lot of room for Apple to move in the PC market. It's just not
[01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:54.500]   not a direction everyone, especially traditional Apple people.
[01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:59.460]   I mean, as a hardcore user, I want to build a PC with four GPU, you know,
[01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:04.260]   four 1080 cards or 1090 cards and have a thread ripper in there and put all the stuff in there
[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:09.540]   and then turn, you know, install Mac OS on it and, and then do do the work that I do, you know,
[01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:13.140]   and I think that there's a lot of people that would do that, you know, and I think that,
[01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:18.900]   you know, I think, anyway, Apple's never going to do it, but we can dream. We can dream.
[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:26.980]   We can, we can dream. And while we dream, let's, let's, let's, let's go back to Leo for another
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:29.860]   wonderful message from a sponsor for whom we are very greater.
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:36.580]   Mac Break Weekly brought to you by, oh, we love this texture, texture, the Netflix and magazines,

[01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:21.780]   the Hollywood gospel magazines without actually buying them. Oh, I don't read those. Well,
[01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:26.580]   I also read the highbrow stuff, The Atlantic, The New Yorker, love national geographic,
[01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:32.100]   those images look so good on texture on that iPad screen, much better than print. In fact,
[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:36.100]   really in every way this beats print, it's much more compact. You don't have all the clutter,
[01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:40.180]   your coffee tables on groaning, you don't have the guilt of magazines piling up that you haven't

[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:21.540]   way, congratulations to them. I think they've done quite well for themselves, if you know what I mean.
[01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:23.620]   Texture.com/twit.
[01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:32.180]   We're going to get to their picks of the week after, but not before what I have to designate with a
[01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:42.020]   heavy heart. The, well, I mean, nothing gold can stay, Pony Boy, spring and summer and fall are
[01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:48.740]   filled with winter. There is no coin that has the heads, but no tails. We must, there's a time to
[01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:56.820]   every purpose. Shala, la, la, la. And so it's with heavy heart that I announced that I declare that
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:33:06.420]   this is Mac Break Weekly's last segment that is fueled by incredibly good, well-sourced Apple
[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:14.580]   rumors provided by analyst Ming Chiquo of KGI Securities. I'm going to give that,
[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:19.460]   I don't spend a little bit of air as we collect our thoughts and our feelings about this.
[01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:24.660]   And while we are finding our own personal peace with that news,
[01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:33.140]   wishing Ming Chiquo a very, the best of success. We're sorry to see you go, but he is leaving
[01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:39.860]   KGI High Securities. According to the China Times, his last day at that firm was April 27th.
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:45.300]   And he is taking a job with another firm where he's going to focus on larger markets and emerging
[01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:51.940]   industries and not simply focusing on Apple. That is the, those, the three syllables, Ming Chiquo,
[01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:58.420]   are what you, if you heard that anywhere within the airspace of an Apple rumor, you thought,
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:06.180]   I've got to take this rumor seriously because Will Albedar and he could say that that Tim Cook is
[01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:11.860]   developing genetic profiling that will allow us to surgically implant a third leg upon many
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:16.580]   Olympic athletes. And you'd have to say, if Ming Chiquo got rumor of this, there has to be
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:19.380]   something to it. I don't know how they would monetize that.
[01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:21.300]   It was being dumped on a Foxconn pipeline.
[01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:28.980]   Maybe, maybe. So this is probably the last bull here of something that is, again, we don't really
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:34.260]   have to think as hard about it as we normally would because, again, Ming Chiquo saying that
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:42.740]   his last report was about a week and a half ago about plans for the new iPhones. He says
[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:47.780]   it's 2018. They're going to be three coming out. And okay, we talk a lot about iPhone rumors,
[01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:51.940]   but this is kind of interesting in that he's specifying that there's going to be an iPhone
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:58.820]   plus that's 6.5 inches, which sounds ginormous, but also a cheaper iPhone X, excuse me, iPhone 10
[01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:04.580]   SE, if you want to call it that, the idea being let's give it a set of let's find Apple finding
[01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:10.340]   ways to retain the signal, most of the signature features of the iPhone like Face ID while finding
[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:16.980]   ways to make it less expensive, such as switching from an OLED display to LEDs, keeping the face ID
[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:22.820]   camera on the front, but switching from two cameras in the back to just one, maybe even swapping out
[01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:30.260]   the glass back for an aluminum back and also ditching wireless charging entirely. But the other
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:39.060]   interesting bit is that Apple would be deleting 3D touch on this less expensive iPhone 10. I'm
[01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:44.020]   sorry, the other really interesting thing is that he says that it could be as inexpensive as $550.
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:48.500]   He has been adjusting that for the past two or three weeks, but the idea of something as cool
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:55.220]   as the iPhone 10 with Face ID selling for much less than the stock iPhone answer has always been
[01:35:55.220 --> 01:36:01.380]   is really, really cool. But saying that because basically that one of these three iPhones will not
[01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:07.780]   have 3D touch again as a cost cutting measure, and but also it kind of makes sense not just because
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:14.660]   Minshi quote is talking about it, but also that I it seems like something that Apple could get rid
[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:20.260]   of and not put a whole lot of noses out of join. Face ID, they can't really get rid of that. They
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:24.020]   can't get rid of touch ID on less expensive phones because those are signature features
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:29.540]   that feed into so many things that people use the iPhone for touch ID because it's never been
[01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:36.580]   platform wide as has never developers have never been able to make it sort of a mandatory
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:43.220]   feature. It's a nice it's a nice power feature, but I've never really missed not having it on
[01:36:43.220 --> 01:36:52.260]   say my iPad that Kelly as a developer. Will the will would 3D touch be missed and how important
[01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:56.020]   do you think it is that developers consider 3D touch as part of an interface?
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:02.820]   I think it's important. See, this is kind of a weird question because it depends like
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:10.340]   there's times when it's obvious like when you when you press on the camera icon and you can take
[01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:15.860]   selfie or take a video or just use the camera, you know, you can do that or using the phone like
[01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:20.500]   this is the one I use constantly because I'm still one of those weird doesn't make phone calls and
[01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:26.260]   I can force touch the phone icon and choose which person I want to call right from there or messages
[01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:31.700]   probably the only one I use more than the phone the phone 3D touches the messages 3D touch and
[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:36.420]   I use it constantly and those are places that make sense and there's probably applications where
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:41.140]   it doesn't make the most sense like you know I don't know what angry birds would gain for example
[01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:47.860]   from having 3D touch on the icon I don't know what that would give you. But mostly like the
[01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:52.260]   thing about it is that it's an interesting it was an interesting technology to me because it sort
[01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:57.700]   of brought right click to the iPhone and I thought that was really exciting and I'm a little disappointed
[01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:02.500]   that not as much stuff uses it as I thought was going to end up adopting it. I really thought it
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:08.180]   was going to be a thing that was going to just spread and maybe it's just because the apps I use
[01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:14.980]   the most don't have it or I don't know like how I use the app doesn't lend itself well to that
[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:20.660]   3D touch interaction but I don't understand how that's a thing that they would get rid of only
[01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:26.980]   because it's a feature that you get for free like they've done all the R&D they've released it on
[01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:33.540]   more than one model it's reliable on on all those devices and so you get it for free it was one of
[01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:42.180]   those things that I sort of always attributed the 4s to when they just continued selling the 4s
[01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:48.820]   like two years more than the regular life of an iPhone up to that point like you could just
[01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:54.420]   still just keep buying a 4s and I always thought it was because like they did all the work to turn
[01:38:54.420 --> 01:39:00.020]   it into a thing and so everything they got out of doing that like is free from now on like you
[01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:05.700]   know the portion of the the purchase price at that point is a lot more profit you know when you
[01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:11.380]   bought it after it had been out three or four years then it was on on day one so like I don't
[01:39:11.380 --> 01:39:15.380]   understand why they would get rid of it I feel like there's more to this story because it seems
[01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:20.820]   like a lot of times when I read stuff that he's written and let's pour one out for him because
[01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:26.900]   you know he's gonna be gone part of the reason that I I sort of doubt it is because like a lot of
[01:39:26.900 --> 01:39:31.380]   times when I read the article like he says it's gonna be this or it's gonna work like this or
[01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:36.260]   there's this thing that's that's coming or going or whatever it is and and then he says you know
[01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:44.180]   or not kind of at the end and there's there's like a lot of bet hedging and you know and when you when
[01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:49.060]   you come out that way and don't just state it outright then you know you can point to well they're at
[01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:54.180]   the bottom I said or not so see I'm right because they didn't well you always got you always got
[01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:59.780]   to make sure that you say that I have nuts there's hedging and then it's also saying I will stand by
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:05.780]   this with my last dance last out of my child's blood but that's but no you never know what's
[01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:11.140]   gonna happen in the future right that's that's kind of okay but part of the problem part of the
[01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:16.580]   problem is that it's I've got my Android phone and I I've always had even on the iPhones I've had a
[01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:22.180]   problem telling the difference between well a 3d touch and simply a long press if I long press the
[01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:28.500]   camera icon on my Android phone I also get take a selfie take a video and really I did want to
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:32.820]   I'm sorry I did want to hear a lot from me because I know that you're avid user of 3d touching you
[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:38.420]   really love it I mean but it did you also you also said it's some cool stuff about the difficulties
[01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:44.660]   in getting it to work with the with the iPads that's also kind of always struck me as kind of a problem
[01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:50.420]   that if you can't get this feature as a signature feature of iOS and it's just limited to the iPhones
[01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:56.900]   is that the best way to get this done so I mean there's a lot to unpack there one is I'm not
[01:40:56.900 --> 01:41:01.620]   pouring anything out from minkjiko because I think KGI securities will just get someone else to
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:07.140]   exfiltrate information from the Chinese supply line I mean he was singularly gifted at only you
[01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:11.460]   know going to the supply lines and getting them to tell him what apple was working on and that I
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:16.900]   think is imminently replaceable at KGI I'm super interested in R2D2 water bottle like the point
[01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:22.740]   my water bottle is amazing and it has my name on it which is very important and well you wouldn't
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:27.860]   you win the internet no seriously yeah no that that you know so I think you know we'll be getting
[01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:33.300]   tons of rumors from KGI going forward oh for 3d touch apple apple set an expectation that
[01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:38.740]   you don't have 3d touch on the budget devices the iPhone SE hasn't had 3d touch and people have
[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:42.260]   been super annoyed but at least people keep complaining why is apple not bringing your wins
[01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:45.940]   going to be your people complain that it's not on the iPad and it's that lack of consistency and
[01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:51.700]   it is hard on the iPad because for led displays apple uses the defamation of the glass being measured
[01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:59.220]   by the led to determine the point and the amount of force being applied and that doesn't scale
[01:41:59.220 --> 01:42:03.620]   across a very large surface it becomes very hard to measure that accurately on the iPhone 10
[01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:07.300]   because they have OLED which doesn't have a backlight they had to create a whole new touch layer
[01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:11.220]   which is probably more expensive just because it's all new and bringing that
[01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:16.180]   not that'll be what's in the new iPhone iPhone 10 - or whatever they call it who knows
[01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:20.980]   but if they're making a lower price phone just like with the iPhone SE they may not include it
[01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:24.740]   the other reason it's not on the iPad is that part of the reason apple developed it was because the
[01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:30.820]   iPad is a split view controller it's got the detail the master detail view so the list of
[01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:34.900]   the master detail view one on each side and you don't have that on iPhone typically
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:39.140]   except for the really large one in landscape but they wanted a way for you to be able to preview
[01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:42.900]   your mail me like on an iPad it's super fast you go down your mail messages and you just see them
[01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:47.540]   one after the other really rapidly in the in the detail view or you go through your messages and
[01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:52.020]   you see everything in it but on the iPhone it was tap go to the next view tap back tap go to the next
[01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:56.340]   view tap back so they were hoping that you would just press a little bit peak press peak pass peak
[01:42:56.340 --> 01:43:00.580]   and be able to go through that very quickly so you don't need that part of it on the iPad but
[01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:04.900]   the shortcuts have proven among some people at least that you know and he's some users
[01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:08.980]   the previous segment have found it really handy to be able to do things like
[01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:14.740]   do the force press to bring up what Kelly was talking about like even the battery shortcut to
[01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:18.180]   go into low power mode immediately or go into selfie mode and I think the best thing apple
[01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:23.220]   could do there is just merge long press and 3D touch they shouldn't be discrete gestures because
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:27.540]   that creates too much collision and they're trying to try to put jiggly mode on to delete
[01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:32.500]   app icons when you're you can't press too hard but you can't press too quickly it won't work I mean
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:38.100]   it's just it's infuriating but if if it didn't matter whether you did 3D touch force press I'm
[01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:42.980]   just gonna call it force press or long press and you could do that on you know on on either device
[01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:47.380]   we just long press on the iPad that's fine and you could do that on the iPhone but if you know about
[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:52.260]   3D touch you can just press it hard because I think fits his law for glass surfaces is the
[01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:57.780]   angry you are the harder you press and just naturally naturally goes to 3D touch I think that would work
[01:43:57.780 --> 01:44:03.700]   better and 3D touch was not great for me until I went into the preferences and found the adjustment
[01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:10.260]   level that I needed because I was doing a lot of force press instead of long press and you know
[01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:16.980]   like oh I want jiggly mode and no yes once I was able to make that adjustment so for people who like
[01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:21.300]   maybe want to play with it a little bit more or have tried it and failed at it like go adjust
[01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:24.660]   those preferences it's one of those things like if you take a couple of minutes like if you have
[01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:29.620]   trouble with touch ID if you take a couple minutes and go delete your fingers and go put them back in
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:33.140]   just like you know it's the same thing if you go in and and look at that preference and make a
[01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:38.260]   little bit of an adjustment then it can be a lot more useful and that was that was basically the
[01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:43.380]   magic for me and then trying it on stuff like just remembering that it was a feature that I could
[01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:48.820]   play with and then using it like adjusting the the brightness of the flashlight so that I can go
[01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:54.340]   from full on blinding to slightly less blinding you know if I if I need it to be a little bit less
[01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:59.300]   blinding and then using all the different uh for such features the apple built into stuff like
[01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:07.380]   um finding those was was part of what I liked about it because it gave me new ways to find the
[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:12.020]   apps useful and to be a little bit more efficient like I don't have to tap four times to go in and
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:16.340]   call somebody you know that's on my favorites list like I can just force press and it's right there
[01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:23.460]   hmm oh I don't I don't know if anybody would be pouring one out for the for 3d touch like I said
[01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:29.860]   it's I love if they did what Renee said which is to combine uh long press and 3d touch because
[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:35.780]   even even on when I spent like a month using an iPhone to test it out as my exclusive one I was
[01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:40.420]   still by the end of the month still kind of confused as to what happens when I long press I will I
[01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:45.220]   will say I will thank you for referring to jiggly icons because all while you're talking I've been
[01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:48.820]   thinking about the pokemon jiggly puff and hearing his song in my head
[01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:53.700]   which is not the sort of thing that someone who's hosting the show should be focusing on instead
[01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:59.380]   of what the guests are talking about oh well uh let's get two picks of the week uh before we do
[01:45:59.380 --> 01:46:05.780]   though uh make sure we want to convey a programming note uh we normally record on Tuesdays next
[01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:12.100]   Tuesday is going to be uh google ios big big keynote and so we have been dislodged for one day so the
[01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:17.300]   twit uh can cover that stuff live uh so if you do like to listen to us uh speak live we're gonna be
[01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:22.500]   one day late I believe same bad time uh but we're gonna be hearing us live on wednesday podcast
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:27.380]   listeners I don't think that ain't no need to break your stride but once again if you want if
[01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:31.540]   you want to get the live show with all the cursing in tech uh you're gonna have to come a day late
[01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:37.060]   uh Alex Lindsay let's start with you what is your pick of the week so I'm doing an anti-pick
[01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:43.060]   so I'm kind of a reverse to you throwing something out will this give me back money Alex is that
[01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:51.540]   what this is gonna do sorry I like it already yeah so years ago I recommended an app on the phone
[01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:59.780]   called the NPR app all right and it was kind of something that I used every day all you know
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:05.540]   morning and afternoon I what I do is I would I would download I would open up the NPR app I would
[01:47:05.540 --> 01:47:09.620]   grab the stuff I wanted from morning edition if I hadn't listened to afternoon you know all
[01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:14.660]   things considered the day before I grab the the stories and say I like NPR but I don't like all
[01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:18.340]   the I don't like everything like I can listen to marketplace all the way through but an NPR I'm
[01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:22.820]   like a lot of boring stuff at the same especially the end of the hours and so I would just grab the
[01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:26.740]   things that I was interested in I'd reorder them so that just in case I ran out of time I was able
[01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:32.180]   to listen to them and um and so I I'd put all that that my little playlist together and then I would
[01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:37.140]   start driving and that's usually how I built my drive time and then if I and if I didn't if I got
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:40.100]   through that then I'd listen to marketplace then I'd listen to twit then I'd listen it was like
[01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:47.620]   this this kind of like mixture of of how much time I have so a couple weeks ago NPR updated the app
[01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:58.820]   and it is possibly the most the stupidest most back I won't swear idea that that I've ever seen
[01:47:58.820 --> 01:48:04.340]   anybody do to their own app which is they basically burning he's burning his tote bag and disgust
[01:48:04.340 --> 01:48:09.140]   I'm never giving the money again like until they put until they put the the the playlist back
[01:48:09.140 --> 01:48:14.660]   they will never get money from me again you know this is I don't I can't think I can only think
[01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:19.140]   that they're trying to get people to listen to the radio more you know like because they took it away
[01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:23.220]   you know and because and what I will admit is that once you got used to building playlists on the
[01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:28.740]   NPR app the idea of listening to the radio was absolutely painful like the idea that you would
[01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:33.540]   turn the radio on and be stuck with you know all the stuff that you get stuck with on a radio
[01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:38.260]   broadcast mostly just the stories being in the order that they were you know once you get used
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:41.780]   to the playlist that's all you listen to and you got to get I was listening to this before the app I
[01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:46.580]   was listening to it on the flash player that they had in 1999 you know so this is something that
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:52.820]   they've had for a long time that they just they literally severed the best part of the app and
[01:48:52.820 --> 01:48:57.140]   now you there is no and then they have NPR one you can kind of build something and then I don't
[01:48:57.140 --> 01:49:00.900]   want them to choose anything for me I don't want them to figure it out like I just want
[01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:05.460]   I just want my app back you know I just want my playlist back from NPR and literally it's been
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:09.220]   it's been interesting because now I've had a couple weeks of not listening to NPR which
[01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:16.340]   hasn't happened since I was 12 you know like you know so so you know like it you know it
[01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:20.660]   is bred to be severed because you can't go back to the radio once you're used to the playlist and
[01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:23.540]   you know like you can't you just frustrating and just angry you're like I can't believe I'm
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:29.620]   listening to this you know and and so but it is it literally is a great example of an app
[01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:33.620]   development where when you take something away like you really should think about like how people
[01:49:33.620 --> 01:49:40.820]   are using it because I I can't I can't understand like I you know I'm I can't understand the thought
[01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:44.500]   process in fact I've I've actually going by going through my old phone scene if I have the old
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:49.140]   version and then I turned updating off and then that one will just sit in my car so that I can
[01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:55.220]   actually listen to the radio you know like it's just it anyway is the most amazingly stupid
[01:49:55.220 --> 01:49:58.420]   update ever and so I've taken it off my phones because I don't need it anymore
[01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:02.900]   anyway that's their feud not that I not not not that I have an opinion about it or not and no
[01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:07.940]   no I mean there there are a few things more heartbreaking in like technology than when you have
[01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:13.220]   an app or pieces of hardware or whatever that you love and then they quote update and improve it
[01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:20.180]   unquote and it's ruined in your eyes it's like literally NPR until I get that playlist back
[01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:29.380]   NPR is dead to me so so your best your best friend has just he's just upgraded downgraded
[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:34.340]   from alcoholism to pure meth addiction and you feel like you need to you need to kick him out of
[01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:39.780]   your life until he got alcohol alcohol them everything was fine you know like it was a great
[01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:45.460]   friend we got along really well and then he immediately went to killing my dog that's that's okay
[01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:49.060]   that's that's a pull quote that's going on the bottom just saying like
[01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:55.940]   that's maybe stealing every because he gave the dog back I probably forgive him I really like
[01:50:55.940 --> 01:51:01.140]   I really like him I you know but he took my dog you know like it took my dog
[01:51:01.140 --> 01:51:08.260]   anyway there you go wow oh no he took my dog as the show title for yeah for this
[01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:13.700]   no no and here's the thing here's the is my request for everyone listening to the show is to go to the
[01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:19.460]   NPR app and give them one star that's that's my request I'm going to try to use the okay we're
[01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:26.020]   going to show the power of a Mac break right now is go to NPR the NPR app give it one star so they
[01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:31.380]   get a message that they should put the playlist back so anyway that's okay well it uh I'm not
[01:51:31.380 --> 01:51:36.180]   saying this as someone who occasionally does tech stuff for Boston's public radio station then
[01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:42.340]   who was on uh uh morning edition this morning as a matter of fact I'm I'm as a as a completely
[01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:49.780]   independent observer and thinker I just want I just want I just want to say Alex by all means so
[01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:54.900]   listen to Alex if you want to listen to Alex I will as as a bookend to that as a companion piece of
[01:51:54.900 --> 01:52:02.100]   that I will only say I have a particular like uh that's one star reviews are to me like I
[01:52:02.100 --> 01:52:09.140]   particular button because that to when I see it one star review I'm thinking that uh so if I
[01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:17.700]   downloaded the end part NPR app and I said and the NPR app just simply like repeated all over and
[01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:23.540]   over and over again just Alex you suck Alex you suck Alex I hate you Alex everybody hates you Alex
[01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:28.260]   you stink Alex you're horrible Alex you're ugly you could it would still have gotten a one star
[01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:33.460]   review meaning that there's no way it could possibly have received this is why I let this
[01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:38.660]   is why two star reviews are very significant to me because someone says that I acknowledged that it
[01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:44.260]   could be worse than this but I didn't like it so I that's that's that's all I'm saying again
[01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:49.940]   everybody speak with your heart uh and now Renee Richie please speak with your heart what is your
[01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:55.540]   pick of the week so I also uh don't have a pick I have a tip this week and it's it's actually an
[01:52:55.540 --> 01:53:00.100]   honor of this show apple you know we talked about this previously apple's not going to have a new
[01:53:00.100 --> 01:53:06.420]   modular Mac pro ready until 2019 so we have one of our writers on i'm more Anthony Cassella is doing
[01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:11.060]   a series on how to update your cheese grater Mac pro you know if you absolutely possibly do not
[01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:16.020]   want the garbage can and no one should at this point and if the iMac pro is simply not for you
[01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:21.300]   he's doing everything the current article is how to uh add bluetooth capabilities to it so that
[01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:27.060]   it can be it can work with continuity and the other modern bluetooth 4.0 based features he's going to
[01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:31.540]   do uh i think the article is working on for tomorrow is how to upgrade the processor he's putting
[01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:37.620]   a west mirror if if memory serves a 12 core processor into what was originally in the halo
[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:43.380]   Mac pro and he's going to go through component by component upgrade the storage the graphics card
[01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:48.900]   I think he's putting uh I forget what he's putting in there an AMD something or other um I'll double
[01:53:48.900 --> 01:53:54.820]   check with him but he's going to go through and make this machine as badass as it can possibly be
[01:53:54.820 --> 01:54:02.500]   until apple decides to finally give us the the hot new sexy until they bring the sexy once again
[01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:09.060]   yes we we we must believe that they will bring the sexy uh kelly what kelly what is your pick of
[01:54:09.060 --> 01:54:17.220]   the week uh mine is is probably an interesting one and that is um i have this one foot apple
[01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:24.500]   charger apple watch charger um it's iPhone certified or made for i mean it's mfi which i guess also
[01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:31.620]   means watch um but it's like it's legit i got it um i got it on amazon and um the thing that i like
[01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:40.260]   about it is that um so i don't need it all the time but i have an original issue apple watch so
[01:54:40.260 --> 01:54:45.060]   sometimes if i'm out and about and like maybe if i had a workout during the day or something then
[01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:49.300]   um i can be out and about in the evening and my battery will get low and so i have my little
[01:54:49.300 --> 01:54:54.900]   anchor battery here i have a little 10,001 it's like deck of card sized basically um
[01:54:54.900 --> 01:55:00.820]   and super lightweight there was another one that i i almost bought but it was way heavier and so
[01:55:00.820 --> 01:55:06.020]   uh it comes with the little nylon pouch and so i just drop the apple watch cable in here and then
[01:55:06.020 --> 01:55:10.500]   i have a really easy way to charge it um the other nice thing about that is that if i have it
[01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:16.420]   because that usually that lives in my purse all the time and so if i'm traveling then um i don't
[01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:20.500]   have to worry about making sure that i have an apple watch cable with me because i always do
[01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:25.620]   so i can always plug that into my wall charger or um you know plug it into my battery if i really
[01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:33.140]   want to and uh make sure that my phone is or that my watch is 100% uh when i start the day so um
[01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:39.460]   that's what i picked because uh like it's great to have the super long apple watch cable for nightstands
[01:55:39.460 --> 01:55:44.740]   and when you have a bunch of tricky wiring to do and stuff but um when i'm traveling or if i just
[01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:49.300]   need to to give it a enough juice that i can get home and and put it on to charge properly or
[01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:54.820]   something uh then it's really nice to have the the much more portable cable so that's my pick
[01:55:54.820 --> 01:56:03.380]   awesome uh and my pick of the week unsurprisingly is the new $329 ipad i suppose i suppose i have to
[01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:09.940]   call this the ipad nothing because i've now i've now got the apples right here there's the ipad
[01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:16.580]   pro the ipad mini 4 and the ipad comma new so i will simply have to call this the ipad nothing
[01:56:16.580 --> 01:56:22.980]   because for all the reasons i said before but the commercial reasons is that um you the next the
[01:56:22.980 --> 01:56:30.100]   ipad pro the the the 10 inch one is the cheapest one you can get is about $650 this one is $329
[01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:39.220]   so you have the choice between getting a 64 gigabyte ipad 9.10 inch ipad pro or you can get the 9.7
[01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:48.340]   inch 329 one but also get it upgraded to 128 gigabytes also get uh cellular and wifi and also
[01:56:48.340 --> 01:56:53.060]   have an apple pencil for about that same amount of money uh and if you don't want an apple pencil
[01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:59.060]   you can swap that up for your vapel care and be under the wire uh and so yeah if i had 650 bucks
[01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:07.700]   to spend i would be given that the ipad plus the pencil alone is so much more powerful to me than
[01:57:07.700 --> 01:57:14.180]   an ipad pro and no pencil uh i would be inclined to recommend that like i said i did not ever run
[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:18.100]   into a situation where i felt like i'm running something that's really really slow and really really
[01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:22.900]   old and really really can't keep up with the normal stuff that i do when i'm doing three or four days
[01:57:22.900 --> 01:57:29.540]   of uh business in new york city uh so that's it for mac break this week uh before we go though uh
[01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:35.540]   kelly gamont appcap for girls of what let give us your pitch for app camp for girls because it is
[01:57:35.540 --> 01:57:40.340]   collectively and i'm spring to me of course but everybody in this conversation and almost everybody
[01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:48.420]   who's listening who's heard of it one of our favorite organizations in tech okay uh so app camp
[01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:54.980]   for girls is day camp and over the course of a week we teach girls uh the basics of ios development
[01:57:54.980 --> 01:58:02.580]   we take uh girls transgender and gender non-conforming so uh going into eighth and ninth grade and um
[01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:08.500]   you build a complete app at the end of the uh at the end of the week you pitch your app to a panel of
[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:13.780]   investors at the end of the summer we take all of the apps collect them all into a compendium and we
[01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:19.940]   release that in the app store for 99 cents you can actually go purchase uh any of those now and see
[01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:25.620]   the actual apps that were built and and designed and all the artwork for them all the icons for them
[01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:31.780]   uh they come uh we put like i said we put all of them in one and so uh any developer who attends
[01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:38.500]   camp uh ends up becoming a published developer in the app store which is pretty great and uh it's
[01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:41.620]   it's been a lot of fun it started in portland Oregon we're in four cities this year we're in
[01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:47.140]   portland seattle chicago and minneapolis which is uh this is our first year in minneapolis it's
[01:58:47.140 --> 01:58:52.580]   gonna be a lot of fun i'm gonna be there and uh it's it's a really great organization and the
[01:58:52.580 --> 01:58:57.860]   opportunities that it gives the volunteers as well as the opportunities that it gives uh the the
[01:58:57.860 --> 01:59:04.340]   people who attend it are really really fantastic uh i've i've made tons of friends um i'm actually
[01:59:04.340 --> 01:59:08.660]   learning development i ended up with a ticket to dub dub this year so i'm actually going to
[01:59:08.660 --> 01:59:14.020]   help as as an actual developing person and not just a person who is going to be in the area at the
[01:59:14.020 --> 01:59:20.500]   same time that dub dub is happening um there will be an app camp party on uh wednesday night of of
[01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:27.380]   dub dub week so uh we're we've got ticket stuff ticket information coming out about that uh soon so
[01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:31.860]   uh keeping an eye on twitter for that sort of stuff it's gonna be um it's gonna be a good time uh we
[01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:35.620]   always have a lot of fun at the dub dub party and uh i would like to see lots and lots of people
[01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:40.820]   there so uh you should show up if you're going to be in the vicinity and i will i'm it sounds like
[01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:49.620]   i'm gonna see rene there one way or another so um so andy i hope you can make it and um the
[01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:53.620]   the thing about app camp is that it was a thing that actually started at dub dub which is which
[01:59:53.620 --> 01:59:57.780]   is part of what's interesting about it is that our founder jean mcdonald realized she was sitting
[01:59:57.780 --> 02:00:01.540]   in a room with everybody that was attending dub dub and couldn't see another woman from where
[02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:06.660]   she was sitting and so she said about helping fix that so that's part of what we're doing and
[02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:12.740]   i'm really excited to be part of that because it's a it's a concrete action and it's not one of those
[02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:18.660]   hand-ringing blog posts where people go gosh what can we do like we're trying to do it and and you
[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:24.820]   know that that's the part that to me is really exciting is that i am taking active steps and
[02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:28.340]   spending time out of my life to make sure that nobody else has to do what i had to do
[02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:31.700]   which was sitting computer class and be the only girl and try to prove that you needed to be there
[02:00:31.700 --> 02:00:36.020]   that it was okay for you to to sit in front of the computer and have an interest in technology
[02:00:36.020 --> 02:00:41.220]   and i'm trying to help make that go away and i feel good about it so there you go yeah that's
[02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:47.140]   a just magnificent magnificent stuff and if someone were to be inspired to send app camp for girls a
[02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:56.180]   big box of money how could they do that literally or figuratively um well literally uh i guess
[02:00:56.180 --> 02:01:00.900]   would probably be my address because we don't have delivery at the office so you probably have to
[02:01:00.900 --> 02:01:04.340]   either send to me or the executive director but i can i can make arrangements for that if you do
[02:01:04.340 --> 02:01:09.380]   have a box of money laying around and it needs a good home uh you can go to app camp number four
[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:15.460]   girls dot com and you can contribute to us uh we are officially a non-profit organization it would
[02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:23.380]   be a tax deductible donation um there are uh and if you do decide to do that and you you go through
[02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:28.340]   the form that's scrolling on the page there uh you can say that you heard about it from a podcast
[02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:36.820]   and i have heard that it's entirely possible there may be um goodies that that can show up at your
[02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:44.500]   house if you do that um i've not i can't confirm or deny that um but it's it's definitely a possibility
[02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:53.380]   and uh we but say that you heard about it from from Mac break um and and consider it um one of my
[02:01:53.380 --> 02:01:58.820]   one of my favorite memories actually from app camp is at the end of last year uh one of the
[02:01:58.820 --> 02:02:02.900]   parents came up to me and said i saw you on Mac break a couple of years ago and my daughter
[02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:06.820]   wasn't old enough yet and app camp sounded really awesome and now that she's old enough she finally
[02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:12.660]   got to come so that was really that was really exciting for me to have been like like that's a
[02:02:12.660 --> 02:02:17.780]   very straight line i can draw from like i go on all these podcasts and i go app camp is great
[02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:21.860]   you should really know about it and like we actually got somebody who showed up in person for the
[02:02:21.860 --> 02:02:26.420]   whole week as a result of having done that so for me that was very exciting like we get you know i
[02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:29.940]   know we get some donations and i know that it helps our profile and Andy thank you so much for
[02:02:29.940 --> 02:02:35.380]   giving me the opportunity to tell more people about it um but that was one that that really
[02:02:35.380 --> 02:02:40.340]   stood out to me as um like i saw you and i'm waiting for it like i waited for my daughter to be old
[02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:44.740]   enough and then and then she was able to come and so that was really that was really how does
[02:02:44.740 --> 02:02:51.060]   how does someone get app camp to come to their city uh you can uh well the first thing you need to do
[02:02:51.060 --> 02:02:57.700]   is um fill out there's a contact form on our website let us know and then the next thing would
[02:02:57.700 --> 02:03:03.700]   be to recruit other people uh if you know uh female developers or you know people who are event
[02:03:03.700 --> 02:03:09.940]   planners or um school trip planners or day camp planners or anything like that uh or if you have
[02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:14.260]   connections to a community have those people sign up and get in touch with us as well because if we
[02:03:14.260 --> 02:03:21.780]   get a whole stack of people from a certain place who say i can help with event space i can help with
[02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:29.460]   um snacks snacks are important at camp um i can help as a project team lead because i'm an ios developer
[02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:34.340]   and i want to show up uh if if you are any of those people like there's a whole list of the of the
[02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:39.700]   positions that we need and we need those in every city uh so if you can find some of those people
[02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:44.980]   and encourage them to fill out the contact form on our site we would be able to start looking at that
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:50.580]   um as a possible place for a new location we want to build app camp everywhere that everybody
[02:03:50.580 --> 02:03:55.380]   wants to have it so if you are one of those people let us know and we'll see what we can do to expand
[02:03:55.380 --> 02:04:01.380]   have you thought about doing it online uh we have we're exploring that now um as far as like
[02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:07.300]   logistically what that would take because there's still a certain amount of in-person in a room that
[02:04:07.300 --> 02:04:14.660]   is important with it um but we're looking at it and we're gonna see um we will probably test it on a
[02:04:14.660 --> 02:04:21.140]   small scale like locally uh probably with a Portland camp and then uh see where we can go from there
[02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:28.420]   sounds good well uh Renee how are you changing children's lives in a positive way in a in a
