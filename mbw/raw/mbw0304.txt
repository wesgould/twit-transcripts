[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   the show that covers Macintosh and iOS,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   news everything coming from the great land of Cupertino,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   coming to us from the left coast.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   No, I guess he's on the right coast.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   If my...
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   The correct coast.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   The correct coast.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Mr. Andy Enocho of the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Wait a minute, is that the sun sees the east coast first
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   because the sun wants to see us first.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Ha ha ha.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   They'll get to your east coast eventually.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Someday they'll arrive here,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   then Jason Snell and I will welcome the sun with open arms,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Jason Snell, Editor-in-Chief of Macworld Magazine,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   who's had a busy week.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Good to have you.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   We thought Andy, I mean, Alex Lindsay would be here,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   but he's a...
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   We're not sure, he's MIA.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   He might be on assignment.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   And a little later on from Buenck Software,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   we have an actual developer, Oliver Bridenbeck.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   He's going to talk a little bit about retina displays.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Speaking of retina displays, Microsoft Surface, no.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Actually, they do say it's a retina display.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   They didn't use the word retina.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   They said, "When you hold it at a normal distance,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   you cannot see the pixels."
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   We're not going to call it retina,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   especially if you're holding it the wrong way around.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   But it is!
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   We'll talk about the Microsoft Surface in a little bit.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I'm sure both of you guys have some thoughts,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   but I think for the Apple world,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   the big story is still one week later,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   this MacBook Pro with retina.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And a lot of question marks.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I ordered one and got mine yesterday.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And I was very nervous.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Having read the iFixit column where Kyle Wien says,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   "It's the most unrepairable laptop we've ever seen,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   one on a scale of one to ten."
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Everything's glued down.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And then reading also issues or questions about the display.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   And I'm still a little baffled about the display.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Fortunately, I have smarter people than I hear.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Between Andy and Jason,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I'm sure they're going to explain to me what's going on.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Andy, I think you guys all, everybody here has one.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   This is mine up here.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   I'll show it to you for those of you.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   You can tell by the lack of an Ethernet port
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   on a $3,000 computer.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Does that bother you?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Yeah, it does.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   My review had to be delayed because of all the coverage
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I had to write for about Microsoft yesterday,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   so it's going to be appearing in the Sun Times tomorrow.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   But I love it.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I think it's a great machine.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I think it really is the best Mac that Apple has ever made.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   But that said, boy, you have to have really different expectations
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   off of this machine to be happy with it.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I really do think that for a starting price of $2,200
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   and a more reasonable price of $25 to $26,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   you have a right to expect an Ethernet port.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   You have a right to expect the ability to add more RAM later on
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   if you want to.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And when you look at the reasons why you can't have those things
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   and you come down to, "Well, look, look how skinny it is.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   You couldn't fit an Ethernet port and something like that skinny."
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   But yeah, but this isn't -- it's not that skinny
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   that this becomes a super, super portable machine
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   because this is still a 15-inch laptop.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   I mean, as I've said before, I mean, I've never, ever packed
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   my laptop bag for an airport and I've wanted to put another --
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   a copy of People magazine in my bag, but -- oh, darn, my --
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   my 15-inch notebook is just too thick to put this little magazine in there.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   So that really is the difference in thickness between the two.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   So I just think that you really are spending -- you really are giving up
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   a whole lot for those extra -- like, that extra really, really tiny,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   tiny amount of extra thickness.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And I don't think it's a really great trade.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   That said, I mean, it is cost comparable to what you would spend
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   on a 15-inch MacBook Pro if you were to configure it with a 256-inch
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   gigabyte solid-state drive.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I just think that when I spend that much money on a computer,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   I really want a computer that has more flexibility
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   than what they're giving me.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Jason, you agree?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Yeah, I -- to a certain extent.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   It is the future a little early.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   It reminds me a little bit of that first MacBook Air,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   although it's much more usable than that was, and I had one,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   so I know exactly how slow it was.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   But it did feel like it was a product that was expensive
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   and going to be a limited audience would want it.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   But that you knew that over time it would become the mainstream.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And this product feels like that, too.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   It's a little early, and that's why it's a little expensive.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   And yet you get the sense that in the future, not too distant future,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   all the screens are going to be like this.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   And there aren't going to be any more optical drives.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And everybody's going to have SSD.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And I do think, yeah, like Ethernet, I think Apple's saying,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   like it has with floppies and optical drives
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   and lots of other stuff over the years, that this is not a mainstream
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   technology anymore that most people are using wireless,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   and that they've got a Gigabit Ethernet adapter
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   if you really need to do Ethernet,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   and they're not going to build their laptops constrained
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   for the port size anymore.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   And I think that's okay.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I understand why it will annoy some people,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   because dongles are annoying.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   At the same time, I almost never feel the need.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   I actually used Ethernet on my MacBook Air yesterday
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   for the first time in ages to transfers
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   to migrate some files across from one Mac to another.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   But that was the first time that I've needed that Ethernet cable
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   in at least a year.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   So I think inevitably in the future,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   it's not going to be that big a deal,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   even if it might be a bigger pane today.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   It's sort of like when they drop the modem out, right?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Everybody was like, oh, the modem, now I got out of dongle,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   but turns out most people didn't really need a modem.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   So it is, it's on the edge,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   and it's not for everybody now.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   But I think it's interesting in that two years out,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   are all Apple's laptops going to be just like this?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And are there going to be lots of PCs that look like this too?
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Yeah, totally.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Yeah, I do give Apple credit.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   I think they've all, they made a lot of smart decisions
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   in designing this thing.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   And one of the smartest things they did was to not dislodge
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   the current 15 inch MacBook Pro.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   It's still on the price list.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   It's still very much an active product.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   So if those things are really important to you,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   you can still make that switch.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I think that if Apple had decided to say, no, no, no,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   there's no longer a conventional 15 inch or 13 inch MacBook Pro.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   They're all retinas.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   They're all like a little bit thinner.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   None of them will have these features.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   None of them will have mechanical hard drives.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   I'd be running a much, much harsher review.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   As is, I simply note that it's, it is, as you say,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   definitely the MacBook of 2014 as opposed to the MacBook of 2012.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And also, also to be fair,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Apple's also very, very upfront about that.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   They are, when they're talking public about it,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   they always make sure that they mention this is very much
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   next generation stuff.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   We're not suggesting that this is going to be the right machine
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   to everybody, but we may as well get started in the future today.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Somebody in the chat was pointing out that lack of ethernet
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   could be a deal breaker in a, say, a government installation
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   where there is no Wi-Fi.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   There are places where Wi-Fi is not considered secure and not allowed.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   I do think that ethernet is a much, much bigger deal
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   than Apple, than other people might be suggesting.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Because there's so many times when you're in a hotel room
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   and that is the, there's supposed to be Wi-Fi,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   but doesn't really work, or you're in an office
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   where they're supposed to be Wi-Fi, but you can't get access to it.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And suddenly you think that, yep, you know what,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   if I'd spent $400 less for this computer,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   I would have no problems right now.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   And right now, here I am desperately haunting the streets
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   of a foreign city looking for an Apple store
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   that can sell me a $30 dongle.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Well, so I've had a MacBook Air for,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   since the first one came out.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   And it has happened to me a couple of times
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   that I've been in a hotel that turns out didn't have Wi-Fi,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   but had ethernet, and I didn't bring that $20 adapter.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   It has happened.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   That said, do you constrain how you build a computer
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   for a use case that you feel is small and reducing rapidly,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   which is like the modem argument.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   I think it's the same argument.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And the good thing about what Apple did this week is they did
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   finally release using Thunderbolt, an adapter that does gigabit
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.600]   ethernet, which was the big problem with the USB ethernet
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.600]   dongles.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.600]   It was 10, 100.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.000]   And so now you can get super fast ethernet.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.200]   You do have to remember to pack your dongle with you
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.000]   if you're somebody who needs it.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Here's just the question.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   I think the relevant question here.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Like what you, the reason why that they couldn't put the ethernet
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   port is, again, that this was too thin.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   What feature does the thinness of this 15 inch device
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   bring?
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   It's not so much thinner that it actually is of any practical
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   import.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   So my personal opinion is that they made a style choice that
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   also clobbered some use, potentially useful features.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   And I'm always really, really skeptical of those kind of
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   choices.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   If it makes absolute perfect sense on a MacBook Air because
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   their desire is to make something as thin as possible.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   You have something that's as thin as a magazine.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So thin that famously David Pogue threw his Apple loaner out
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   with the newspaper recycling.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   That was quite famous.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Yeah, because he didn't even notice that was in the pile.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   So yes, that's certainly an important tradeoff.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   And I'm glad that we're finally getting like gigabit
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   ethernet for MacBook Airs.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   But again, I just don't see where the thinness is giving a
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   consumer any advantage whatsoever.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   And then when you see that not only is there no ethernet
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   port, but also they had to make this magsafe port much, much
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   thinner redesign to make it work.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   And it's not as good as what it replaced because man, it
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   takes almost no effort to dislodge that connector from this
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   port.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   I really don't see the thinness of the new MacBook as a
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   handicap rather than a feature.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   I think it's two separate issues.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   There's the strength of the magnet, which I think is
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   actually a MacBook Air issue because as somebody with a
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   MacBook Air 11 inch, the old magnet was so strong that you
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   could pull the MacBook Air off the table with the magnet.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   So they made it a little bit less clingy and that has tradeoffs
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   now because it's easier for that thing to pop off.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   But you're right.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   I mean, thinness, it's hard to read it.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Also physics, it's a longer plug.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   And instead of the cable coming out through the side
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   actually comes out to the back.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   So really you've got a lot of leverage working against you.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Which I think is part of their, it's part of that design that
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   they decided.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   I don't like that it sticks out.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   I think it's going to be much more prone to fraying like the
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   original magsafe was.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   But about the thinness, you know, Apple, that's like an Apple
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   axiom.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   It's just like thinner is better.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Thinner is always better.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Lighter is always better.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Everything is pushed toward thin and light.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   And you're right.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   They may take it to extremes.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   It did force the redesign of the magsafe and it forced the
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   dropping of ethernet.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Although like, you know, I still feel like that was more
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   than more about dropping a port that they don't want than it
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   was anything else.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Same with firewire.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   But it's hard for me to judge because again, I'm an
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   11 inch MacBook Air user.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And it is like a cafeteria tray, this thing.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   It is huge.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   It is just, it's hard for me to judge because it is still
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   weighty and it's still very wide because it's a 15 inch screen.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   So one dimension gets a little thinner.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   But the other dimensions have to remain because of the screen.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   So I'm not quite sure whether it's super important or not.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   I don't think that was necessarily the motivating factor.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   It might be an excuse.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   But I think Apple dropped ethernet for the same reason they
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   dropped firewire, which is they thought they would have to
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   drop firewire, which is they figure they just want to move it
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   along and that most people don't need it, which is very Apple,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   whether it's right or wrong, it is right out of the Apple Playbook.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   The last worry that I have though is that I always, I never
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   used to have to justify a purchase of a Macintosh.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Well, remember like the dark days when idiot windows people
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   and menistoss people say, oh, well, you know what?
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   The Mac is just a toy.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   You can't, if you want a real computer, you have to get windows
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   if you really want to do everything with a machine, you know,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   you don't even want to consider getting a Mac.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   And that was true until like 1986.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   But after that, it was just as capable as anything else.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   My worry is that Apple might really just pull away so far ahead
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   of the mainstream and so far ahead of the users that that's going
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   to be true again.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   That if you, if you have a budget of 2,500 bucks on a notebook,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   you compare what you get on the Windows side versus what you get
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   on the Mac side.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   If Apple continues this trend of saying, oh, we'll be feeling
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   as though 85% of the people are going to miss this.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   85% aren't going to miss this other feature.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   85% aren't going to miss this other feature.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Pretty soon by, by realizing that these are always different
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   85% of the population, you wind up with a computer that's only
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   going to make maybe half of the consumer base or 60% of the
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   consumer base happy.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   And you do get into a position where I'll be at that family
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   wedding and I'll have to say, well, I like Mac's, but talk to
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   me about what you actually want to do with this because Macs aren't
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   good for everything.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   I really desperately don't want that to happen.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   I think gentlemen, you're missing the most important point of
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   this.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   This is the best Mac ever made for Diablo 3.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   And I think that if you really care about computing, I'll check
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   out that retina.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   You can't actually run this at 2880.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   It did.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I tested it at 2880 by 1800.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And it's keeps up, which is impressive.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   I'm a little busy right now at a rack.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   The giant arachnids are attacking me.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   And I just, I don't know.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   I hold on a second.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   That templars, not much help.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Okay.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   I feel much better now.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   No, I think it does do this quite well.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   In fact, the number of people said, if they said in your
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   review, you really have to say how well it plays Diablo 3.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   And I will testify to the fact that actually does play Diablo 3
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   quite well.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Even at the highest resolution, although I don't think you
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   really need to play it at the highest resolution.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   There are, I think both of you are right.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   I think there are three things that you're going to have to
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   buy when you buy your MacBook Pro with retina.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   You're going to have to buy the $10 magsafe dongle so you can
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   use your other magsafe adapters with this.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Here's the, I'm using it right now, in fact, with the, can you
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   have to get over the shoulder shot with that MacBook Air power
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   supply, you just put that on there.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   And then, and then this is an attractive look, I think.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   You know, every computer.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   You can keep it on the fridge.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Yeah, every computer should have something like that hanging off
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   of it.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   I had to stick to my keychain.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   So that's one, you're definitely going to want to buy the
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Ethernet port.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   You know, just because there are going to be times when you
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   have to have it.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   But the third most important thing I think you got to buy is
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   AppleCare.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   And I don't normally buy AppleCare because I believe that
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   those kinds of things are, are insurance policies and I'd
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   prefer to self-insure.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   But in this case, there are really no user serviceable parts in
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   here.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Having said that, I'll agree with Andy.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   It's the best Mac.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Well, I've ever used clearly.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   I have to say, once you use the retina display, it's very
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   difficult to go back to any other device.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Text is just, as it was on the iPhone and the iPad, text is
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   just beautiful in the apps that are not all apps support it,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   but the apps that do.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Like, I've got the chat room up here in Safari and it is
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   fantastic.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   It just looks, everybody in the chat room looks very handsome
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   to me.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   I didn't find it quite that dramatic.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   When I switched from the new iPad back to my iPad 2, it really
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   does seem like the iPad 2 has a much worse display.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   When I switched from my actual 15 inch to this to Apple's
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   loner, it's not quite so dramatic.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   To me, the big effect is just like how much more information
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   it conveys.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Like when I'm on aperture like this, these thumbnails are so
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   detailed that it feels like I can instantly identify the
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   keepers from the ones that are just a little bit soft focus or
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   the ones where we lost a little bit of detail without even have
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   to enlarge these things.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   And I'm really looking forward to seeing more and more apps that
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   use it not just to cram more stuff onto the screen, but to
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   cram more information into what used to be just a sort of
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   like icon or just a little dingus that you just look at and say,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   "Okay, I guess I better click this and find out what it wants
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   to tell me."
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   I would say in college, we laid out our newspaper in
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   PageMaker on the Mac.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   And I remember when you zoom back far enough, it would just give
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   up on drawing the text and it would be just like a gray blob.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   It's just like, "This is great.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Trust me, there's text there."
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   It wasn't even like Greek.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   And I think about this and I think, "Oh my God, you could
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   read every single letter zoomed out so far in a page layout
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   because of the level of detail that God saw."
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   So it'll be interesting to see what applications people find
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   for this screen, but I do think it's inevitable that we've
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   finally broken through the 72 DPI, you know, give or take
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   barrier that we've been at for the last like 25 years.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   So finally, I do think most computer screens will end up here.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Whether that, to Andy's point about whether Apple is truly
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   skating where the puck is going to be, maybe it's two years,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   maybe it's five years, maybe it's ten years, but I feel like
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   it's actually going to happen.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   I think it might happen faster than you think because unlike
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Andy, I really have difficulty now going back to the other.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Let me show you other displays.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   And I think Retina establishes a standard that's going to be
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   very quickly more than just something you want.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   It's going to be something you need.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Here's an example on Twitter, the Twitter application.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   And I don't know if people watching video could tell the
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   different solids describe it for you.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   On the right is the Twitter application, which has not been
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   adapted for Retina display, and the text is very soft.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   And on the left, one of most applications, in fact, that use
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Coco and use Coco, it was built in text drawing.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   We'll have this advantage.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   The text is very nice.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Now I think what you're seeing here, this display is set
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   for optimal for Retina, which means it's 1440 by 900.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   It's not super high resolution.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   It's the same, in fact, that it is your old 15-inch MacBook Pro,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   but it's doing sub-pixel rendering on the pixels.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   So the four pixels, because it's really four times the density,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   it's using those four pixels.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   They're not all the same to give you a much crisper text.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   And I think it really does look good.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   So much of the point where I don't like to use apps that
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   don't support this.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Well, it really does stick out.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   I mean, I had a-- on my blog, I did screenshots of each
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   of the five different screen modes of the Retina Mac.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   And I was really, really surprised.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   I'm writing my review in Pages, which is another Apple product.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   And so I've got a Safari page open where it's beautiful, crisp,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   print quality text.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   But the text inside the Pages doc is just regular 72--
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   All right.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   So the guess is that they're rendering pages off screen
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   and then just basically bled back in to handle all the graphs
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   and stuff like that.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   But you're right.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   When you see those two things side by side,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   it is so easy to spot.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   I think that a lot of web designers are going to be
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   really tearing their hair out for the past--
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   for the next several months realizing that, oh, man, no.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   I can see how many people are using Macs and using Apple
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   devices to actually access our sites.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   And now every single bitmap looks like crap on these devices.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   We're going to have to re-render everything, render new buttons,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   rent on.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Man, we thought we had this check cache.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   You make an interesting point, because Apple did update Safari
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   and its Pro apps to use this Retina display.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   But they did an update I work, which is now really three years
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   overdue for an update.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   I wonder how long before they do that.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   We have a developer in-house.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   And in a little bit, we're going to talk to Oliver Bridenbach
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   from Buynx software.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   They did update their I-Stop Motion app.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   In fact, it's not out yet, but it's in beta.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   And they updated it almost right away.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   I want to ask Oliver what's involved in doing that.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   And Jason, I know you can explain to me, because I still
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   don't quite get it.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   What exactly resolution is this display?
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   And I'll show you when we come back when I'll set it to
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   2880 by 1800, which you can't do without some special software.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   I've had a third-party app.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   I think it's called SetResX.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   It will let me set it to that.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   And you'll see why Apple doesn't let you do that.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   And then you can explain to me, Jason, what the hell retina
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   really means.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   But first--
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   I'll be happy to.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Because there's some-- it's more than-- it's not obvious.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   And I think one of the problems they're going to have to do is--
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   I understand now what happened when you start to use it.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   You go, oh, I get it.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   You really don't want to distribute a display at 2880--
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   or 2880 by 1800 on a 15-4-inch display.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   It just is unusable.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   You cannot have it at that resolution.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   So why, you might ask, make a display at that resolution.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   And that's the question.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Jason, I'm sure can answer in Andy too.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   When we come back, Andy Nocko from Chicago, sometimes here,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Jason Snell from Macworld.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   We're going to talk about the Microsoft Surface too.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   But before we do that, let's talk a little bit about our friends
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   that go to assist-- I'm sorry, go to meeting.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Citrix, go to meeting.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   We've talked about before, great iPad app, great desktop app.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Let's you start meetings on the desktop, join meetings on the app
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   using the iPad's camera to get the HD faces, to get the screen sharing.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   It's really a fantastic technology.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   But I want you to take a look at it because they've now added this HD faces.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   It's fantastic.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   If you visit go to meeting.com and use the offer-- I'm sorry, promo code,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Macbrakes, this promo code on the page.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Go to meeting.com and the promo code Macbrake.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   You could try this free for 30 days.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   And you will see what a spectacular job they've done.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   I can't wait to see this on the right of this play, actually.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   I should start a meeting.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   I'll get this set up.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   I haven't put it on this in a Mac yet.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   And I'll start a meeting on here and we'll see.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   I bet it looks fantastic, especially-- I haven't tried the new camera yet either.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   There's some other features on here we'll talk about.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Go to meeting.com, click the try free button.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   The promo code is Macbrake.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   All it takes is a webcam and a click to turn that meeting into a video conference
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   with high definition video.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   You can do it on the iPad.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   You can attend meetings on your iPhone too.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   You just don't do the video.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   The free app available for iPad iPhone, even Android devices.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   And of course, go to meeting's free for the first 30 days.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   There it is. Look how gorgeous that is on the iPad.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   That uses the red in this play beautifully.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Go to meeting.com and use the promo code Macbrake.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Oh, one more thing.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   They're giving away iPads.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Eight new iPads.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   All you have to do is go to Facebook and like.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Go to meeting.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   And you'll be automatically entered in to that drawing for eight new iPads.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Let me go here. Go to meeting.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   I'm not eligible, but I'm going to like them anyway, because I do like them.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   And then you can enter-- I guess is there more to do?
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   It says then you can enter to win a new iPad.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   And refer a friend if they win an iPad.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   So do you.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Ha ha! How about that?
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Double your chances of winning.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   Like, go to meeting on Facebook.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   You could be ending up using it on that beautiful new iPad.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   I hope you win it.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Don't forget to try go to meeting free for 30 days.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Go to meeting.com, promo code Macbrake.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Here it is.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Do you see that?
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   There's a button.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   iPad sweepstakes.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   So you do have to click that.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   And then you can enter in.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Have a meeting full summer.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Ha ha ha.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Like them on Facebook to get a chance to win one of eight Mac iPads.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   They're giving away.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   All right, Jason.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   So you understand my confusion, right?
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Because I go to the control panel.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   And I look at the control panel.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   And it says in here-- now it's a little weird now because I have it hooked up to the HDMI port.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   By the way, we're using the HDMI port directly to feed our cameras.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   You know, I have to say they've done some work on this because I plugged an HDMI.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   It automatically changed the settings.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Best for external play.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Yeah, it knows what you're doing with that HDMI port and knows you won an actual video resolution
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   instead of some weird computer resolution.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   It was really smart.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   It handled it immediately.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   So I don't even know what resolution I'm at.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   No, what display's control panel has gotten a complete rewrite in the OS version that ships
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   with these new Macs, especially the Retina.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   But it leads to this weird thing where you can't pick a resolution anymore.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   You've got this sort of scaled choice, like you were saying, between larger and smaller.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   And it's doing some very odd stuff.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   When you click on more space, you're getting something that it claims is-- what does it
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   say?
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   It says it's like 1920 by 1200.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   But it's wide.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   But it's not.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   It's actually-- I believe double that in a virtual screen.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.600]   And then the graphics processor on the system shrinks it down.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:10.760]   So it's actually like doing this weird resizing on the fly, which is why it says that it can
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.920]   affect performance.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.960]   But the net result is that it's going to make everything seem a little smaller like it's
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.360]   a higher resolution display because it's got all those pixels.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.360]   It can kind of fake a bunch of different resolutions.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.080]   But to your point, you wouldn't want to go down to one to one because then everything
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.880]   would be roughly a quarter of the size.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:33.160]   Well, I can't show you on our HDMI output because it's going to totally screw with it.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.720]   But let me open up-- oh, you know, I might have taken it off because I just didn't want
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.640]   to accidentally do this.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.120]   The set res X, yeah, I'll have to-- I took it off.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.040]   But yesterday, I did the unboxing.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.200]   And the first thing I did is I put set res X on there.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.160]   And if you had set it to 2880 by 1800, which Apple won't let you do, but you can do with
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.120]   these third parties.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.720]   The reason Apple won't let you do it, everything's too small to use.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.720]   You see it, but the menu bar is teensy.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:58.720]   The text is so tiny.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.000]   I mean, this has been the problem is that if you did a higher resolution screen in the
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.040]   past, there was no support to make things bigger.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.600]   And so then you'd end up with something smaller.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.760]   If you used the high res MacBook Pro, you saw this.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.680]   If you used the-- actually, if you used the 11-inch MacBook Air and thought everything
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.600]   looked a little too small, that's because the 11-inch MacBook Air has a higher than
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.680]   usual screen resolution.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.920]   And this has got such a high resolution that if you show it at one to one, you actually
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:30.440]   can't read anything unless you crank up your text to be like 30-point type to read body
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.440]   text.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.440]   It's that crazy.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:36.520]   So my understanding is that-- and correct me if I'm wrong, you should just say, set it
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.000]   at best for red to display.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.240]   That would give you the best performance.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.520]   You're now-- and this is the thing that it feels a little bit like a cheat to me because
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:48.880]   now the actual resolution is one half each way, so it's one quarter, really.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.360]   It's 1440 by 900.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:56.400]   Except that if you use-- and this is my speculation, tell me, Jason, if I'm misunderstanding this.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:02.000]   When you use an app that is tuned for the red and display, like Aperture, like iPhoto,
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.480]   like iMovie, like Final Cut Pro, it will use all the dots.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.720]   Is it not-- but not all the time, only like in rendering images.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:16.800]   It's actually just like with the iPad and the iPhone with the red and display, where there's
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:22.520]   a 2X mode and there's a non-2X mode, and you have the ability if an app is using a framework
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:28.280]   that supports the 2X mode or has been modified to support it, you can say, all right, if
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.520]   you're on a red and display, if you're on a high resolution display in that high DPI
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:35.200]   mode, they call it, show all of the information instead.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.920]   When you don't have that, then it goes back to this pixel doubling where it just draws
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:44.280]   a single pixel from the old mode as four pixels on this high res display.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:48.560]   And then that's like running an app on your iPhone or iPad that hasn't been updated for
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.560]   retina.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.760]   It looks kind of jaggy.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.880]   Now what's funny on the Mac is that you will have these hybrid situations where some stuff
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.600]   will be jaggy and some stuff won't be because like--
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.120]   >> Sparrow does that.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.120]   So for some reason--
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:05.000]   >> --some resources look fine because they're using standard text.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.480]   standard text is retina friendly, but all of their graphics in that app are still old-style
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.480]   graphics.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.680]   They haven't updated it for 2X graphics, so they look jaggy.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.320]   Text looks good.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.320]   Graphics looks jaggy.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.520]   There's going to be a lot of that as people update their apps.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:23.520]   >> Sometimes, well, Sparrows, the only example I know, but there's others.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:28.200]   On the right, the message rendering window is retina, as gorgeous.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.760]   On the left, the message list is not--
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.760]   >> Right.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.920]   >> --and that is a really unpleasant combination.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.800]   >> Yeah, it's weird because probably they're using the standard WebKit HTML renderer on
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.600]   the right and on the left, they're probably doing something custom.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.600]   The Twitter app is like that.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.600]   >> Twitter does it too.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.600]   Here's the example on Twitter.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.080]   >> Well, to get scrolling to be smooth, a lot of times what these apps will do is render
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.680]   the text and dump it to a frame buffer, which basically they make a graphic of it.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.680]   >> It's pre-rendered.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.040]   >> The graphic is at the old resolution, and so it's not clear.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.040]   >> Got it.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.360]   >> So they have to be updated for that to be.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.760]   So it's not a universal thing.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.640]   It's like the Apple has written it into the new frameworks for the operating system, but
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:09.040]   that doesn't change the fact that if you're using something custom, you got to update
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.240]   your app to support it.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:15.520]   It's funny, you could say, "Well, why didn't the developers know this was coming?"
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.720]   The reality is that Apple's kind of like the boy who cried wolf about this.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:24.200]   Apple's been talking about resolution independent Mac displays for-- I'm not exaggerating here.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:28.920]   I think at least five years, it's been a long-- I can't tell you how many WWDCs I went to,
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.000]   where they said, "It's coming," and it never got here.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.320]   And so this, finally, with the iOS, they figured out the way you do it is not by creating
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.080]   like vector art for everything.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.080]   It's just say 2X.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.080]   You've got two modes.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.360]   You've got 1X and 2X.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:47.680]   And with this display, that's what you're seeing is a 2X mode, and now developers will
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.360]   have to update.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:54.900]   >> Do you guys both agree that the setting-- 99% of the world should use is best for
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:31:00.340]   retina display and then use some other setting if for some reason you need-- I mean, it doesn't
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.540]   seem like there's any reason to--
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.540]   >> Yeah.
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:06.860]   I mean, that's the whole point of what Apple did with the retina display.
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:10.260]   It was never about making a bigger desktop in a smaller form factor.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:14.380]   It's always about taking the screen you already have and making it work better.
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:20.580]   So you'd want to keep it on best and hope that future revisions of current apps are
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:23.100]   going to figure out new ways of taking advantage of it.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:29.900]   Like Jason said, at some point on a standard display, thumbnails of pages have to be sort
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.740]   of greeked up and it'll sort of mock what the thing actually is.
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.500]   But with the retina display, you can actually convey useful information.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:41.740]   So if you were to-- if you were scrolling through, let's say, a 40 page word document,
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:45.940]   you don't know-- don't remember what section of the document you have this graph on.
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:46.940]   Just zoom out.
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:51.980]   You easily spot not only the graphic, but also the graphic within its original context
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.420]   and then zap onto it.
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:32:00.900]   Was I the only person who, during the first day, I've got the dock visible and just marveling
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:05.540]   at how high detailed all these dock icons are and trying to figure out, can I actually
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:09.380]   read that what's written on the cover of the dictionary app?
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:10.860]   I bet I can.
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:14.620]   >> The letter and text edit is the-- here's to the crazy--
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:15.620]   >> Right.
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:16.620]   >> --commercial, isn't it?
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:17.620]   >> Yeah.
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:18.620]   >> I wonder, and the only thing that I've done on it.
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:19.620]   >> No, you still can't read it.
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:23.340]   You don't need to open the application bundle to get the double res icon, actually check
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.340]   that out.
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.340]   You can actually read it.
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:26.340]   >> Yeah, yeah, you have to open the bundle, though.
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.540]   It doesn't display it that way in the dock.
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:32.900]   However, I agree the dock icons look particularly crisp.
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:41.900]   So would you say that somebody should wait on this until more apps are retinized?
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:47.740]   Do you guys find it so disorienting when you see an older app?
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:49.980]   For instance, I'm not going to use Chrome on this thing.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:53.020]   I'm going to use Safari because Chrome just looks like crap.
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.100]   >> I wouldn't say so.
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:58.140]   I don't find it quite-- it's noticeable, but it's not jarring.
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.140]   >> Oh, I do.
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:04.140]   >> But yeah, you're really, really eager for these apps to be updated.
[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:09.140]   I still use pages for most of my work over the past week on this device.
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:14.500]   But as soon as-- I think the first app that actually is optimized for retina, I'm going
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:19.420]   to take a break from pages until pages comes back into present.
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:26.620]   And again, it's hitting miss, for instance, in Facebook on Chrome, I guess the text is
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:31.020]   just rendered-- I guess sometimes Chrome uses the WebKit renderings because it looks--
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.100]   well, no, it doesn't look.
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:33.100]   I take it back.
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:34.100]   You can see.
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:39.100]   >> What we're seeing here is that programmers will always do-- they want the results that
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.340]   they want to get.
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:45.180]   And so if the standard ways of doing things aren't giving them the sort of experience
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:48.540]   they want to give their users, they'll figure out something clever that bends the rules a
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.540]   little bit.
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:54.300]   And that works great until Apple throws a curveball, or as Jason says, makes do, makes
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:58.580]   on their threat that if you boys don't clean up this bedroom, you're going to come home
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.340]   from school one day and will have thrown everything on the floor out.
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:04.020]   And oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.580]   Then the day comes at holy.
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:06.580]   >> Oh, you did it.
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:07.580]   >> Oh, you did it.
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.580]   You did it.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:09.580]   >> Mike from IAF sucks now.
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.580]   >> Great.
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:11.580]   Yesterday, no, it sucks.
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.340]   >> But this really-- yeah, you're exactly what you said.
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:15.500]   If you had-- well, actually, you know what, we're going to take a break and we're going
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.820]   to bring in Oliver because Oliver Biden back is here.
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:25.700]   My presumption is if you had followed Apple's guidelines and used the APIs as you should,
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:27.020]   you wouldn't have a problem, Jason.
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.020]   Is that right?
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:32.420]   >> Well, the standard frameworks for text have been updated for this, but that there's
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:38.540]   lots of custom methods that are not the standard that Apple can't kind of patch like writing
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:44.620]   out to a buffer at 72 DPI or at 1X that Apple can't do anything about that other than
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:48.860]   saying you need to sense that this is now a high DPI and do something different.
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:53.820]   >> And if your graphic assets are not high DPI-- well, actually graphics, it's not high
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:54.820]   DPI, I don't know.
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.060]   >> Yeah, there are two X graphics is what you want.
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.060]   >> You want two X graphics.
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:02.420]   >> And we just did this for our iPad app last year, which is you go through and you say,
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.660]   okay, what are all the graphics in my app?
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:09.620]   I need to go back into Photoshop and redraw them all at twice the resolution.
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.260]   >> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.260]   >> Fun.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:16.860]   >> Not to mention the fact that the web is going to get heavier if people decide that
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:21.460]   they want to make their websites look good on Linux.
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.860]   The question is how many retinas is Apple going to sell and is it going to be an important
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.340]   enough thing that you-- I guess you have to-- you're updating it-- well, I'm going
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:29.340]   to ask Oliver.
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.180]   I guess you're updating it for your iPad.
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:34.140]   >> Is it, is it, Jason, exactly the same as the iPad?
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.140]   >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:40.780]   I mean, I think the iPhone and iPad and now this MacBook Pro are all essentially doing
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.300]   the same thing web-wise.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:48.860]   So if you write your website to support high-res graphics, it should-- at least on the Apple
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.180]   devices, it should pick it up.
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.340]   And so you should do that once and you're going to get on the red in the iPad and you're
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.940]   going to get it on the red in the MacBook Pro.
[00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:01.940]   And it will increase bandwidth, although realistically bigger JPEGs are not huge.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:05.460]   It's not going to-- there was a story last week about how IT managers feared this computer
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.460]   because it will destroy bandwidth.
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.580]   It's like, you know, it's some bigger JPEGs on the web.
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.580]   It's not the end of the week.
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:10.580]   >> You know, I read that.
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:11.580]   It was on the Wall Street Journal.
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:12.580]   It was by a CIO.
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.380]   I thought, this guy's an idiot.
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:18.460]   But then his-- if I just kept reading, it was like, well, because people are going to start
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:23.140]   watching their YouTube videos at 1080p, it wasn't so much that though it's going to
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.740]   kill your bandwidth when they're just doing their almost surfing.
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:26.740]   >> Yeah, maybe.
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:27.740]   >> Maybe.
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:28.740]   >> That seems sort of silly to me.
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.940]   I mean, they're HD YouTube videos there now.
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.940]   You can watch those now.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:33.940]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:34.940]   >> All right.
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:35.940]   Great cast.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.740]   Good time to talk about this.
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.780]   Yes, we still have a lot more to talk about, but I do want to bring Oliver in here from
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:45.580]   Boink Software to talk about what the developers perspective on this.
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.820]   But first a word from hover.com.
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.660]   Just got an email and I did not ask this guy if I could quote his email, so I'm not
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.380]   going to say his name.
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.380]   But he says, wow, that was so easy.
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.060]   Just got off the phone with hover.
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.580]   They answered it before it rang.
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:00.700]   This is a really email I got this morning.
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:04.820]   They're going to transfer my 19 domains from GoDaddy for free.
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:08.020]   I just pay the $10 for a discounted extra year of registration.
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.180]   That's how it works.
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.700]   I talked to a human who knew what he was doing.
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:14.300]   You can show the screen because I want them to know it really wasn't email I got this
[00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:15.460]   morning.
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:18.540]   And no upsells of anything so freaking easy.
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.100]   I can't believe it.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.500]   And I'm so happy not to be giving that other guy my business.
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.500]   Thanks.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.340]   Andy, this was an unsolicited email.
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.540]   And it's one of the reasons.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.100]   I hear people say this all the time.
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:36.460]   We tell you, if it's time to register a domain name, go with hover.com.
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:41.300]   In fact, you can go to Macbreak.hover.com and use the offer code MacBreak and you'll get
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.500]   10% off your new domain.
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:47.140]   They do have-- and it was in the ads before and I don't know if they still technically
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.380]   offer it, but I think Andy's experience is the case.
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:52.980]   If you say, hey, Leo said you would transfer my domains for free.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.740]   They have a domain concierge service.
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.420]   Normally they charge $25 to do that.
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.900]   It takes all the pain out of it.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:37:59.900]   I wish I'd done it.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.660]   I tried by myself.
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.580]   I thought, oh no, I'll do it by myself.
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:06.380]   And I got all my domains locked and I still haven't transferred them all over because
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:07.380]   it's such a pain.
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.580]   Let's have her do it.
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:13.380]   They do charge you $10 to transfer domain over, but you get an extra year on your domain.
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.140]   So it's a very good deal.
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:17.140]   Privacy is built in.
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.180]   Who is privacy is built in?
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.180]   That's really nice.
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:21.620]   They don't try to upsell you.
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:22.740]   Advanced DNS management.
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:26.100]   They've got a great management system for your domain.
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:30.620]   And they really don't try to upsell you on stuff that you don't need.
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:32.540]   They don't even do hosting.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:36.180]   Now if you want hosting, they'll have a hosting tab that can suggest hosting, but they don't
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.180]   do it.
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:40.900]   Really they're a domain registrar and an email forwarder.
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.900]   That's it.
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:46.140]   They do offer 25 top level domains, all the big ones, but also country specific ones
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:53.580]   like IT, Asia, ES, USDA, some of the newer TLDs like .pro.triplex.
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:56.020]   We use .tv.
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.340]   It offers so neat.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.340]   I want you to try it.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:04.300]   If you use the offer code MACBRAKE, you get 10% off your domain transfer on standard domain
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.100]   names.
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.540]   Macbrake.hover.com.
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:09.540]   And thank you, Andy.
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:10.740]   I should have asked you.
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.900]   It wasn't Andy Enoco, by the way, another Andy.
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:17.560]   I should have asked ahead of time, but I just got this literally at 10 a.m.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:23.500]   I got an hour and two hours ago, and I had to share it with you because it says it all.
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:28.100]   He says, I so freaking easy.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.580]   Hover .com.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.580]   Use Macbrake.com.
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:34.580]   Oliver, come here.
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:35.580]   Oliver Bridenbeck is here.
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:39.740]   Oliver is the CEO and founder of Boink Software.
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:44.020]   They do a great video switching program for the Macintosh, all Macintosh, but they also
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:45.820]   do some iPad and iPhone apps.
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.100]   Good to see Oliver.
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.900]   Were you out for WWDCs?
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:49.900]   Yes, that's what I'm...
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:50.900]   Okay.
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:51.900]   And you stuck around.
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:53.060]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:58.980]   So Oliver, you knew ahead of time, of course, as I think most developers did.
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.220]   When did you find out that Mac, Apple was going to do this?
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:08.740]   Well, as Jason pointed out, they had been waving the flag for quite a while, so...
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:11.060]   The writing was on the wall, but you just didn't know when.
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:15.220]   Yeah, well, there were rumors, and so we decided to just go for it.
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.220]   Right.
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.220]   You know, so...
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:19.860]   Even though you didn't really have any hardware to test it on.
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:25.220]   I mean, with the developer tools, there comes a little utility that allows you to turn it
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.220]   on...
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.900]   Or allows you to turn it on the old hardware as well.
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:32.740]   So you take a 30-inch screen or something here.
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:33.740]   Yeah, really good screen.
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:37.100]   And then you can turn it on and then you can see what's going to happen.
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:38.100]   So...
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:39.620]   What has to be done to retinize an app?
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.900]   Why are so many apps not, for instance, not retinized?
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.740]   Well, if you...
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:51.220]   Strictly speaking, if you play it by the rules, then you would be good, but many things can
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.740]   be done with the standard API.
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:41:01.340]   So many developers take shortcuts or do their own thing to add stuff to the graphics.
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:10.220]   And you have to look at your code and see where do you do this and where are you fine
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.540]   and then make the adjustments.
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:13.540]   Right.
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.540]   So you have to figure out...
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:17.540]   Something you have to figure out is what to do with the extra pixels.
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:24.500]   As you said, if just the user interface, it's easy, but what do you do with the content?
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.620]   And there you have four times as many pixels.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.540]   And that's great because that can bring TV.
[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:36.660]   For example, we could use the preview window to actually show the full HD video and still
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:42.620]   have a couple million pixels around it to do the user interface.
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:46.420]   So that's one issue, which is you're looking at a UI redesign.
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.940]   It's not just flipping a switch.
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:56.380]   IStopMotion captures images and renders them so it does video and stills.
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:58.260]   Do you just...
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:41:59.260]   What do you do there?
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:00.420]   You just take a higher resolution?
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:04.260]   No, actually you just use every pixel.
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:05.980]   So you just draw it.
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.380]   You just have to think about...
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.420]   Were you down sampling before?
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.420]   Yes.
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.420]   Instead of that...
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:17.620]   Instead of squishing stuff down to fit it into the preview window, we can just go with
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:19.180]   the full resolution thing.
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:22.180]   So basically the thing is you have two different resolutions.
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:25.820]   You have the resolution for the UI, which is...
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.140]   As you said, what is it?
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.140]   1440 by 900 is it?
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:37.260]   Then you have a window in there where you can go for the full resolution for the content.
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.980]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:42.620]   So regions can be full resolution, even if the screen is...
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:46.740]   The screen is full resolution too, but they can draw...
[00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.540]   They still count the pixels.
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:53.300]   But you can now have half pixel size things.
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:43:00.020]   So one of the things we ran into is that we were tricking to avoid blips in between objects.
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:03.980]   We were drawing them half a pixel wider.
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:11.540]   And now when the display actually can draw half a pixel, it looks kind of stupid.
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:16.140]   So we had to redo all calculations to be more precise here.
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:17.140]   Is it...
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:20.660]   It sounds like my problem is I'm confusing DPI with PPI.
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:22.300]   There is native pixels per inch.
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.820]   This is natively 2880 months.
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.140]   Whatever, 1800.
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:29.540]   But that's pixels per inch.
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.180]   There's also dots per inch.
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:34.340]   Well, it's not exactly the same.
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:43.780]   I think the thing that is hard to grasp is that now the actual user interface is not
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:44.780]   really...
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:47.580]   It's not native in pixels anymore.
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:54.660]   So you draw the operating system just...
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:44:00.740]   That's why it's reflected in the control panel is that you don't really talk about
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:02.340]   pixels anymore.
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:09.780]   So you don't do a button that's 16 pixels wide and 5 pixels high.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:16.780]   That's not going to be the same thing anymore because it depends on what the user has set
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:17.780]   in his setup.
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:20.660]   So what do you use, use inches?
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:23.420]   No, you keep using pixels, but they have like...
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:24.420]   It's a different meaning.
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:26.420]   Yeah, it's a different meaning.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:27.420]   So...
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:28.420]   Okay, I get it.
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.580]   I guess part of what it was kind of...
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:37.460]   I felt ripped off was that I've been taught for so many years that with LCD's native resolution
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:40.580]   is what you want to use because there's no scaling involved.
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:42.500]   But there is no scaling when you're doubling.
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:46.940]   You're just using sub-pixel rendering within those larger dots.
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:50.020]   So you really aren't scaling here.
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.340]   No, no, no, no.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:55.060]   The screen is always still 2880 by 1800.
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:56.060]   Yes.
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.180]   You're just using four dots to render one.
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:00.420]   Four pixels to render one dot.
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:08.020]   Yes, that also depends on what the actual setting is because, as Jason pointed out,
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:14.420]   is that if you go to the even higher resolutions, what they do is actually they render the double
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:19.460]   size on offscreen and then they shrink it down when they display it on the screen.
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:26.660]   So they move a lot more pixels than they used to and that's why the performance of the graphics
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.660]   card takes quite a hit actually.
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:31.060]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:33.620]   This is 220 pixels per inch.
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:36.740]   The 27-inch iMac is 108 pixels per inch.
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.380]   It's half.
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:41.580]   This is twice as many pixels per inch as a 27-inch iMac.
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.580]   It's 2x.
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:44.580]   Yeah.
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:45.580]   Yeah.
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:48.980]   So that gives you some idea of what you have to do here.
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:54.020]   And actually, that's why I was impressed at how well, for instance, Diablo does it 2880
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:55.020]   by 1800.
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.020]   It actually can keep up.
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.820]   For every one's okay.
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:05.100]   So if you want my advice, then you're still better off drawing your graphics in vector
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:06.100]   art actually.
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:07.340]   That is a good scale automatically.
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:08.900]   Yes, and then whatever possible.
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:09.900]   No, yeah.
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:10.900]   Yeah.
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:17.780]   And then you can create whatever pixel size Apple wants to deliver.
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:19.780]   Right.
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:22.780]   How hard was this to do the upgrade?
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:30.620]   It took two of our best engineers and graphics person, the graphics designer, took them about
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:31.620]   three weeks.
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:32.620]   Oh, so long.
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:33.620]   For Estubmotion.
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:34.620]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:35.620]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:38.860]   And when will that be out?
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:39.860]   Maybe soon.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:40.860]   Maybe soon.
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:46.180]   We are editing the remote camera thing from what we did for the Estubmotion iPad, where
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:49.260]   we can use the iPhone as a remote camera.
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:52.420]   We're adding that to Estubmotion now and then we're going to ship it.
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:55.700]   I think that's probably the case is that if somebody's going to push an update to software,
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.260]   they don't want to just make it retina.
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:04.940]   Well, I don't know whether people would, I mean, if we didn't want to charge for it,
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:09.620]   then we would probably just output, but we haven't updated Estubmotion a while.
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:13.540]   So I think we want to do a bigger renovation.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.380]   I'll have a nice to see you.
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:19.220]   Thanks for explaining the developer point of view on this.
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:22.260]   Is it, do you think, I mean, for your app, it's a benefit?
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:23.260]   Yes.
[00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:30.180]   I think it's for all content production apps, it's a good thing because, you know, as Jason
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:38.180]   pointed out, Andy said, as well with photos, there's just much more you see on the screen.
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:39.180]   Right.
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:45.460]   Even if the screen is fairly small with 15 inch, you still think that you see much more details
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.340]   in photos and video.
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:51.300]   People who might have a hard time are people who wrote a gaming app with, or any app with
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:55.340]   a lot of assets, bitmap assets, that's going to be a problem.
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:56.340]   Yeah.
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.340]   Because you got to read raw stuff.
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:58.340]   Yeah.
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:00.980]   Well, if you're using OpenGL, I think a lot of that stuff may be scalable.
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:01.980]   It's also scalable.
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.020]   It might be done for you.
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:05.020]   Yeah.
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.020]   Okay.
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:07.020]   Thank you, Oliver.
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:08.020]   All right.
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.340]   I know it makes me feel like I'm dumb.
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:14.900]   And I just feel like I don't know why, but I'm having a hard time really getting it.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:18.260]   And some of it is because I was brought up in the era where you set screens at their
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:22.860]   native resolution because in the earliest days of LCDs, they didn't scale.
[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:23.860]   Right?
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:24.860]   Right.
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:26.900]   It's like the iPad.
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:29.740]   I think that's the safest way to think of it is it's like the iPad.
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:35.740]   Everything is the same size, but some stuff is now finer because it's got more pixels
[00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:39.220]   to do smoothing and have more detail.
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:42.380]   But Apple's trying the problem with Apple's old approach that they kept trying to sell
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:44.260]   developers on was resolution independence.
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:47.980]   And that was literally like it could be anything and it would scale and there'd be vectors.
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.500]   And it was really hard and confusing.
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:55.260]   And with the iPhone and the iPad, Apple happened upon this other concept, which is 2x, right?
[00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:59.220]   It's just like, look, think of it as that one pixel is now four.
[00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:02.180]   And if you do nothing, it just is in blocks of four.
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:07.460]   But if you support this, then you can use each of those four blocks to do something different.
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:09.460]   So I think that's the safest way to view it.
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:12.900]   You know, if you start to think about what happens when I'm in that small mode and it's
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:16.100]   actually bigger than the screen and it gets meshed down, there's weird stuff going on
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.460]   in the background, but typical Apple, they just want to say, look, would you like it
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:20.460]   to be bigger?
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:21.940]   Would you like it to be smaller?
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:24.340]   And by default, there's actually even a radio button.
[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:27.180]   It's not that five.
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:31.300]   Five boxes only comes up if you change the radio button from optimal, right?
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.700]   So by default, Apple's very strongly recommending.
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:34.700]   Just leave it the way it is.
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:35.700]   It's fine.
[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:36.700]   I think that's what they wanted.
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:39.580]   And they probably felt, well, we can't not put any settings in.
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:43.300]   What if you needed to make it some people say I'm a little bigger?
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:44.900]   People like Leo will freak out.
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:49.420]   Also, a lot of people have low vision and they can't really use a 15-inch screen at
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:50.820]   that kind of dimensions.
[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:57.500]   But yeah, this is a very human oriented solution to a higher definition display because the
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:01.460]   way that you click into the understanding of this is that you really can't make the menu
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.900]   bar any smaller than what it is.
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:09.060]   And every bit of the user interface and every single app in the OS is keyed off of the relative
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:13.180]   size of the menu bar because that's a target that people can hit with a trackpad.
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:16.940]   So yeah, this would be absolute chaos if you had to deal with a really, really teensy,
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:21.340]   teensy, teensy, teensy, teeny, teeny tiny close box on a window.
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:28.180]   I've used, I used to have a really massive Sony HD display, like a CRT tube display that
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:32.660]   required two card slots for the driver.
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:36.700]   And it was really, really cool having this immense display, but oh man, it was like a
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:41.460]   game of operation trying to close a window because it's like, okay, I think it's there.
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:42.460]   I think it's there.
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:43.460]   No, it's not there.
[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:44.460]   I think it's there.
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:45.460]   I think it's there.
[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.460]   No, it's not there.
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:52.780]   Well, that actually is probably the other reason why I'm having a hard time figuring this
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:57.860]   out because I have had 30-inch displays that didn't, that just were native resolution.
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.580]   And I've talked to people all the time.
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:01.260]   Microsoft and Windows, they sell this a little bit.
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:06.620]   They have a DPI setting, which will make this the text bigger or smaller.
[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:08.580]   Does a user really want to know the DPI?
[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:09.580]   No, I agree.
[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:15.380]   That's the same reason why I was setting up a new camera that arrived just last week.
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:18.500]   I always hate it when they ask me, is it daylight savings time?
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.300]   I don't know if it's daylight savings time.
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:21.300]   Don't you know?
[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:24.020]   I, I, I, I, every time I have to go to the web and look it up.
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:25.020]   Are we in daylight?
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:26.020]   Okay.
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:27.020]   Okay, Sony camera.
[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:28.020]   I think it's a very good, light savings time.
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:31.300]   This is a detail that a user does not need to know about.
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:36.380]   It's a very good solid Apple response to basically remove it from contention as something you
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:37.980]   need to know about to set up a monitor.
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:40.860]   And I think it's a very typical Microsoft response to say, well, would you, would you
[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:43.060]   like your DPI to pick?
[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:44.060]   What?
[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:46.340]   All right.
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:50.340]   I, I, I, let me just, Charram, I know I'm being stupid.
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.340]   You all get it.
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:53.740]   Everybody's in the chair and saying, you know, Leo, it's just like the iPad.
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:55.380]   Just think of it that way.
[00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:58.340]   And I think the problem is I didn't understand the iPad, but the iPad, there's no settings
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:51:59.340]   for resolution.
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:00.340]   It just does it, right?
[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:02.020]   There's no control panel on the iPad.
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:05.620]   There's some very nice people in the chatroom saying, Leo, you just need to unlearn what
[00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:06.620]   you can learn.
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:11.420]   Then you'll just, you'll just just keep the screen tuned to channel three.
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:12.420]   What?
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.420]   I'm ever worried about it again.
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:14.420]   What?
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:16.300]   But I'd want to see Oprah.
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:17.300]   Where's Oprah?
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:20.460]   She can, she can tell you're no longer using the TV.
[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:23.060]   No, but Oprah's on channel six.
[00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:27.140]   I have had that conversation.
[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:30.100]   I'm having flashbacks to my parents right now.
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:32.860]   Channel six is just channel three in two X month.
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:36.420]   No, but I, but where's the clicker?
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:38.020]   I need a clicker.
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:41.620]   Use the clapper.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:46.020]   I bought a, because I do have, you know, eight remotes and it's very complicated.
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:49.380]   And I even have a remote control sent out that lowers the screen.
[00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:52.540]   And so I bought the Logitech one as too complicated.
[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:56.100]   I like the eight remotes.
[00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:58.540]   Harmony is too complicated.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:52:59.540]   Wow.
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:04.100]   That really is a, you know, Leo, that really is a user interface point because if you're
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:09.180]   trying to figure out with the harmony remote, it's, you really are in a mode where you have
[00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:13.980]   to figure out, I need to send a command to the TV set to turn off.
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:17.780]   What button do I push on the remote to turn this power button into the power button for
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:18.780]   the TV set?
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:22.980]   Versus just simply, I've got, I don't live on a nuclear submarine.
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:25.500]   I've got room on this coffee table for three months.
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:26.500]   Exactly.
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:29.420]   So given that I only turn the TV off once or twice during the course of the day, it's
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:35.500]   okay for me to pick up a remote that I know can only control the TV and push that button.
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:37.820]   Sometimes it doesn't need to be that complicated.
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:41.580]   Sometimes the, the Logitech way to go is actually the most effective user interface.
[00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:43.580]   I hope those kids get off your lawn.
[00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:44.580]   Get off of my lawn.
[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:45.580]   You catch them.
[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:47.220]   I don't understand.
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:48.220]   You've changed.
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:52.300]   It actually makes sense to use a dedicated remote that has the right button.
[00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:55.700]   You know when I really, the Harmony one, and I love it, it's a really nice universe
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:54:00.100]   remote, but I realized that everything had to be in the same state for it to work like
[00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:01.180]   you can't.
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:02.180]   So everything has to be off.
[00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:04.700]   If something's on and something, and other things are off and you press the button,
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:07.100]   it turns things off when it's supposed to be.
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:10.940]   Well, cause some devices support the screw power on and off and it's a toggle and the
[00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:13.980]   toggle is the worst thing because it has no idea whether it's on or off.
[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:15.500]   I'm just doing the opposite of what I am.
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:16.500]   This is right now.
[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:21.620]   If this is the problem that Apple solves with their Apple branded TV, I will buy 10 people
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:24.860]   and Apple beers just randomly indiscriminately.
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:25.860]   Here is 10 beers.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:27.580]   Please distribute them appropriately.
[00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:28.820]   Kids need to understand.
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:31.700]   You're going to be my age them day two.
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:35.060]   It's not, it's not all putting cream at this, at this time.
[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:40.020]   No, I have to say, with all of the things that we've talked about and we certainly,
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:44.700]   I have made a big point since last Monday of talking about what the potential negatives
[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:45.700]   are unrepairable.
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:48.620]   You have to buy an ethernet, dongle, blah, blah, blah.
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:49.820]   It's not at the native resolution.
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:50.820]   What's going on?
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:52.700]   I love this thing.
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:55.820]   The truth is it's the best screen I've ever used.
[00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:56.820]   It's very fast.
[00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:59.300]   We didn't mention this, but it is noticeably faster.
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:01.140]   The base unit is all I bought.
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:02.140]   I did not upgrade it.
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:06.940]   8 gigs, 256 gig hard drive, quad core i7.
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:09.180]   It's so, so fast.
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:10.620]   The boot times are fast.
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:13.580]   Everything is just, it will spoil you.
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:18.460]   I know you're saying, well, it's big, but as we've learned with phones, thin does kind
[00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:22.060]   of ameliorate a little bit size in that dimension.
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.060]   In the wider dimension.
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:25.180]   But I have to agree with you.
[00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:29.860]   This is the experience in just the past week with this, just with a 15 inch notebook,
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:33.780]   which is what the size I normally deal with every single day with an SSD drive.
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:39.660]   I'm now like, I've got a 256 gig SSD on my Amazon wish list right now, waiting for the
[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:45.460]   day that I decided to pull the trigger on it because the speed up is by no means subtle.
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:46.940]   Get it from a Macsales.com.
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:52.220]   I had the newer MacBook Air, not this current one, but the last year's MacBook Air.
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:55.180]   It was a very easy thing to unscrew it.
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:57.140]   Put in, they make the SSD.
[00:55:57.140 --> 00:56:00.340]   It's not like an S, it looks like an S.O. dim card.
[00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:03.340]   And you just, but except the edges on the short side, you just pop it in.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:05.820]   It was a very easy upgrade.
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.340]   That was a very nice thing to do.
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:08.740]   I was really happy with that.
[00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:12.740]   When I've used every MacBook there ever has been, and I love my MacBook Air, but this is
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:15.180]   definitely replacing everything.
[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:16.180]   This is the future for me.
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:18.420]   I just, cause I can't go back, frankly.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:19.740]   11 inch here forever.
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:20.740]   No, really?
[00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:24.380]   I mean, even after using this, you're going to say 11 inches, it looks like you're looking
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:25.380]   through a...
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:26.380]   It's too heavy.
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:27.380]   I like the tiny laptop.
[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:28.380]   I'm going to, I'm not going to.
[00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:29.380]   You're a good, you're a good, you're a good, you're a good, cafeteria tray.
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:31.460]   It looks like you're looking through a slot.
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:35.300]   I just, I can't, I can't, I can't work on that tiny 11 inch screen.
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:36.300]   No.
[00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:37.940]   I just can't work with it.
[00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:43.460]   Also, I do like on a 15 inch machine to have at least the option of saying, do you want
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:48.300]   to spend your money on having a 256 gig super, super fast SSD?
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:53.700]   Or is it more valuable to you to have a 750 gig or a 1 terabyte internal mechanical drive?
[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:58.340]   Hey, let me ask, do you think they'll do Retina on the air?
[00:56:58.340 --> 00:56:59.340]   Yeah.
[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:00.340]   Okay.
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:01.340]   Retina everywhere.
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:02.340]   If the, if the...
[00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:06.240]   Yeah, I think in like two years, all apples, if not one year, all apples products will be
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.240]   Retina.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:10.460]   I see, I see, I don't, I think that they want that to happen.
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:14.180]   That's certainly a natural thing, a progression for the MacBook Air where they'd small on
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.460]   a smaller display, extra clarity really pays off.
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:23.020]   But remember that if you see, we've all seen the breakdown photo of this new MacBook where
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:27.020]   one half of this internal body cavity is nothing but battery.
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:28.020]   Oh yeah.
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:29.020]   And on the iPad, right?
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:30.020]   Right.
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:31.660]   I mean, it's huge battery too.
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:32.660]   Right.
[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:37.020]   So, so I don't know what the power consumption would be on a 13 inch or an 11 inch screen.
[00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:40.720]   I don't know if there's enough where they have to actually make it the sacrifice, the
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:45.720]   taper of the, of the MacBook Air in order to be able to fit enough batteries and to
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:47.960]   support the super density display.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.080]   But yeah, I absolutely agree.
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.480]   That's what Apple wants to do.
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:52.480]   Not, not this year, right?
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:56.760]   Maybe next year, maybe it'll take two years because technology will have to improve.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:59.200]   That's why it's on this big system now.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:03.840]   But I do think that's the direction that goes going in and that'll be awesome when it happens.
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:08.220]   I'm calling this the MacBook Elite because it's not for everyone is for people who have
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:14.340]   deep pockets and are willing to spend to have the latest greatest, but it is the BMW, you
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:15.340]   know, of MacBooks.
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:18.480]   It's just, I just, I'm, I'm kind of fond of it.
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:20.920]   I'm physically in love with it.
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:25.280]   I wish I had the link in front of me, but a friend was sending me a blog post that was
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:31.000]   going around comparing the design of the Apple 2 Plus next to that cutaway picture of the
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   MacBook Pro.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.240]   Where you have like nothing but open slots, nothing but socket and ramp to this close
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.240]   thing.
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:41.400]   And underneath that is a photo of like a classic BMW where anything you want to do to the hood
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.400]   up, anything you want to do.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:47.320]   But next to that, a concept version of the BMW where everything is sealed off with like
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:51.960]   fiberglass and plastic and you can't, you can't even add windshield washer fluid if you want
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:52.960]   to.
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:54.960]   It's no washer fluid.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:59.440]   Um, it's just, it's nirber, it's nirber grained, washer fluid.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.960]   No, no, you don't want to be, you don't want to be messing with high performance.
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:08.640]   And then yes, it's a colloidal suspension of silver and then compare that to the Microsoft
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:09.640]   Surface.
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:11.360]   That's what we're going to do when we get back.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.840]   Good bad, ugly, we'll find out.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:19.560]   Just a quick programming note on Twitter on Sunday, we had a cupcake that was unidentified.
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:23.280]   And now thanks to Twitter, I know what the name of this cupcake is.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:28.200]   Remember, thanks to a, see Christian Scott who's tweeted this, we had cupcakes, we had
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:30.240]   all different kinds of cupcakes that Corey brought.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:33.320]   And there was one with pink icing and almonds on the top and white cake.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.040]   And I couldn't figure out what it was.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:39.920]   It is the battle royale, the almond cake with a blueberry tequila filling topped with
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:43.400]   Asai Berry cream cheese frosting.
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:47.080]   It was the winner of the cupcake wars on the food network.
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:48.200]   And I didn't need it.
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.200]   Who ate it?
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.360]   Brian, Brian ate it.
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:51.360]   Bastard.
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:52.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:53.920]   Brian, he wasn't even here.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:54.920]   No, he edits to it.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:57.120]   Or Brian, Brian Burnett, not Schwood.
[00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:58.880]   Oh, Brian Burnett gets to eat it.
[00:59:58.880 --> 00:59:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:03.560]   Schwood, no, nothing for you, Schwood.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:06.360]   Hey, let's talk about audible.com.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:11.360]   Audible is, of course, a longtime sponsor of this show and all of our shows on Twitch
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.400]   because we are such fanatics.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.840]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:18.680]   And it is the audio bookstore.
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:22.200]   I'm going to sign in really quickly because I want to make sure I can show you.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.960]   Yeah, here we go.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:28.120]   All the latest audible books are right here.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:31.720]   Boy, I don't even know where to start.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.720]   So many great books.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.320]   Did you see that the Kane mutiny now is finally in an audio book?
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.320]   I would love to.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.320]   Ooh.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.320]   That's a great book, of course, Schwood.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:40.320]   I got it.
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:41.840]   The strawberry ice cream was down.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:42.840]   It was a machine.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.840]   It was a cop machine from the strawberry ice cream.
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.520]   A duplicate key has been made.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.120]   A key has been made.
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.120]   So sorry to say I'm like Sammy Davis.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.120]   I'm going to stop.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.120]   Sorry.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.560]   Man, there was a key.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.560]   I know there was.
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:00.560]   I'm very happy.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.960]   I don't believe Humphrey Bogart is in this, but I think it would be a wonderful book to
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.960]   listen to.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:05.960]   You know, that's great.
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:09.040]   They're going back and they're re-recording in many cases books that were never made
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.200]   available in audio.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.960]   This is an audible recording.
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:15.040]   They have a beautiful, they have nine beautiful studios in their headquarters.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.040]   I visited them in Newark.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.520]   I thought I recorded a little mini book there.
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:22.280]   And this is an opportunity for them to get these great books.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.200]   Winds of War or Hermann Weilch.
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.200]   That would be cool.
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.480]   I'd love to listen to that.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.640]   I liked long books.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.640]   It's 45 hours.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.640]   45.
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:32.880]   And again, this is another one that Audible came out.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:37.920]   The book came out 40 years before Audible was able to make an audio book out of it.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:38.920]   Finally.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:43.640]   Anyway, what do you, I'll give Andy the pick because he always gets such great books.
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:47.640]   And in fact, I've picked almost all of the books Andy recommends.
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:51.920]   This is a book that I must have read about 20 times in the past 25 years.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:56.200]   Fahrenheit 451 on my Ray Bradbury passed away last week.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.680]   And so I'm looking around seeing is there any oftentimes I'll go into audible.com and
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:03.560]   look for books by authors that I'll have favorite authors.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:08.200]   But you know, there's always that one or two books that you just never got to.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.640]   And so you'll just download this book.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:13.720]   And imagine my pleasure to see that there's a, there are two versions of unabridged Fahrenheit
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:14.720]   451.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:18.080]   And one of them is actually read by Ray Bradbury himself.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.080]   And this is a tough choice.
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:23.120]   Cause the other ones read by Christopher heard and they're both really, really good.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:29.320]   I wound up listening to the Ray Bradbury one for about as long as the preview lasted.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.920]   And I'm going to find the Ray Bradbury one.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.920]   It's not as polished.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.920]   It's not as professional.
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:33.920]   But it's him.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:34.920]   It's very Bradbury.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:40.640]   It's like the, when the, when the guy who actually wrote the, the, the story is, is now
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:41.920]   writing the story.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.600]   That's something pretty special.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.560]   And so it does take, I think a couple of minutes to get used to his delivery.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.240]   But after that, it's like, tell me, read another chapter.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.760]   I'm not even halfway asleep yet.
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:58.880]   You know, you can on audible.com, listen to any previews of any of them at the books.
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:01.720]   And that's a good way to, to check it out if you like the reader.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.480]   It's very, you know, each of these is a performance.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.920]   It's not some drone reading these books.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:07.440]   They're, they're performed.
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:12.560]   You know, you can actually, uh, in, you know, sometimes you're the author read, that's always
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.200]   risky.
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:20.000]   Sometimes here, a great reader read William Golding actually reads the Lord of the Flies.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   I can't only him.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.120]   I mean, how could that must be anything written by Neil Gaiman that he, oh, he got it.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.120]   That's done.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.120]   You got to get that.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.520]   In fact, I get mad that he doesn't do all of his books, but he obviously doesn't have
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.520]   enough time.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:37.320]   There is a Neil Gaiman audio collection that would be a great one.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:40.360]   If you like Neil Gaiman, I just, I love Neil Gaiman.
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:41.720]   I listen to all of his books on Audible.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:42.720]   You know, it's funny.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.960]   I was talking about books with a friend earlier today and, uh, and she said, I just don't
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.560]   have time for reading.
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:52.440]   And I said, you know, I don't either, but Audible has given me time because there's always
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.440]   time I'm in the car.
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:54.440]   I'm at the gym.
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:57.840]   I'm walking the dog when I can listen to a book and I get in an hour or two of reading
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:07.120]   every day where I never would have before audible.com, uh, slash Mac break.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.200]   You get your first book free.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.720]   You'll be signing up for the, the gold account.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.760]   It's a book a month subscription, but the first months free, your first books free.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:14.760]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:16.840]   I just saw something on my one I have to get.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:20.520]   I didn't, this is Terry Pratchett, a new book from Terry Pratchett.
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:25.040]   He teams up with Steven Baxter is one of my favorite sci-fi authors.
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.040]   It's called the long earth.
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:29.040]   I don't know this.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.040]   I'm, I don't know.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.040]   Okay.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.040]   So I'm adding this to my wish list here.
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:35.800]   I, I, I do, I do think that there are the things I think that Apple has the wrong idea
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.800]   on.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.280]   I think that no one likes subscription services.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:43.680]   I would, I love my audible subscription and I would, if there was a way to even get Barnes
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:48.720]   and Noble or Amazon to just charge me for one book every single month and the credit
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.880]   stack up, whether I actually buy it or not, it really does urge you to say, look, you've
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:56.160]   got the, you've already bought three books you haven't used yet.
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.640]   Now you're going to go in and you're going to find a book that you want to read.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.760]   And of course, there's always a great book out there somewhere.
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:06.680]   So like this one by Megan McCain, America use sexy bitch.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.680]   A love letter to freedom.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:09.680]   Wow.
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.880]   I wonder how dad feels about that one.
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:17.080]   Probably stay over the best.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.080]   Wow.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:22.840]   Um, anyways, this is, this is just a great place for books of all kinds.
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:29.040]   Uh, business books, classics, fiction, history, mysteries, thrillers, sci-fi science and technology.
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:34.320]   Um, Adam Corolla's latest, not Taco Bell material.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.320]   Look at Adam as a kid.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:38.000]   Oh, you look just like Adam as an adult.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   And Adam Corolla reads it.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.880]   See, this is the problem.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:46.720]   I need like the 20 book a month subscription audible.com/macbreak.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:47.880]   Get your first book.
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:51.480]   I warn you, you will be hooked.
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:56.920]   So, um, God, I don't know what to say about this Microsoft event yesterday.
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.160]   I'm listening because we did the live coverage of it.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.360]   So I'm, and I'm in the car because I had it.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:04.800]   We went down to an event fordhead and I was interviewing the CTO ford.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:08.480]   I would have loved to have come for our live coverage, but I couldn't.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.040]   But Tom and I as did a great job.
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:14.920]   We had Tim Stevens have been gadget on and I'm listening and we pretty much know it's
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:16.240]   going to be a tablet.
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.240]   Steve bomber comes out.
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.160]   I'm going, what?
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.560]   It's a Windows eight tablet.
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:24.680]   They didn't announce a ship date except that it'll come out when Windows eight comes out.
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:28.360]   Uh, they, uh, didn't announce a price.
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:29.800]   They, they announced two.
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:30.960]   They didn't have a price.
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:31.960]   They hit it.
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:32.960]   It'll be comparable.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.200]   It'll be competitive is what they said.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:37.960]   Like competitive, they, right, competitive delta books and competitive to an ARM based
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:38.960]   tablet.
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:41.720]   They say competitive, not comparable by the way, which is a difference.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:42.720]   Yes.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:43.720]   Okay.
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:48.200]   I started because something could be a hundred bucks more and competitive.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.200]   Yes.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:51.520]   I think, but I think that's true.
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:56.200]   Just, just like there are a lot of, there are a lot of $349 Android 10 inch tablets.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:07:00.920]   I'm not really going to say that the fact that costs exactly $50 less than an iPad two
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:06.520]   means that they, that, that, that, that, that's, that's an insurmountable barrier for someone
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:07.520]   to reach.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:11.200]   So, so all of this within the ballpark, it would be a big problem if they're selling
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:16.480]   these things for $1,100, uh, compared to $500 to $750 for an iPad.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:21.720]   It's not a big deal if they're selling it for maybe 50 to $75 more than a comparable iPad.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:23.120]   I like her chat room.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.560]   They said, bless their hearts.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.360]   They're trying so hard.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:33.240]   So, surface.com, well, that's what I want to know because I can't decide is this crap
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.520]   or is this good.
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.360]   So it's got a kickstand.
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:37.360]   Okay.
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.920]   That's a little bit of a negative.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.520]   It's got a keyboard cover.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.000]   Now this is interesting.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.280]   It's a magnet cover just like the smart cover except that it has a keyboard built into it,
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.280]   except it's not a real keyboard.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:53.720]   It's obviously it's a chick like keyboard because it's only a few millimeters thick.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:54.720]   I can't decide.
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:56.160]   I guess I'll have to try it.
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.160]   And then you've got the problem.
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.160]   You've got two versions.
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.160]   You've got an Intel version and an ARM version.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.600]   So these are very different.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.680]   The ARM version has absolutely nothing that will run on it because it's brand new and
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.480]   you're starting from scratch.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:13.520]   And then the other versions, Windows, it's got a, you know, it has a heats.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.520]   It's a computer.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:17.480]   Yeah, but isn't that sort of a good thing?
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:24.760]   I guess it's I got to say that now we have to absolutely upfront acknowledge that there
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:28.960]   is a big important one third of that pie graph of information that Apple hasn't shared
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.280]   about these things yet.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:34.840]   So you Microsoft make any, I'm sorry, Microsoft, you really can't make any sort of a judgment
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:35.840]   on it yet.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:36.840]   Right.
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:40.560]   What I've seen though gets me very, very interested partly because they seem to have
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.680]   designed, if we're looking at the, at the ARM based tablet, they've developed a tablet
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:50.600]   that works the way that I use my iPad that I, I, I, I too, like sort of raise an eyebrow
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.920]   when they got to the very first part of the demonstration.
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:55.200]   Oh, look, it has a built in kickstand.
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.600]   And I'm thinking, oh, well, that's great.
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.720]   That's terrible because that means that you're emphatically saying that this is going to be
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:02.440]   a horizontally wide screen sort of thing.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:04.800]   But then as they continue the demonstration, they're making it very clear that they're
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:10.320]   trying to make something that is ultra book like, but more modern and more useful and
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:12.520]   more valid for, for the next five years.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:15.880]   It's a laptop with a chick like keyboard.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:18.040]   Okay, which is a, but that's okay.
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:20.600]   Well, the iPad is a laptop with a virtual keyboard.
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:21.600]   Right.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:25.720]   And if, and Logitech also makes keyboards that are like that, I don't think they're necessarily
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:28.960]   saying that this is the thing that you're going to be working on for seven to 10 hours
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:29.960]   a day.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:33.120]   The fact that, oh, no, I get the feeling they want this to be the next.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.760]   This is the next computing platform.
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:39.320]   Not necessarily the keyboard that they're going to be, you're going to be typing on
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:42.640]   seven or 10 hours a day, but it's a very, very lightweight keyboard that you will bring
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:43.640]   with you all the time.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:47.400]   And when you're using it, unlike with the iPad, it doesn't obscure half of the screen.
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:52.680]   And if you really do want to do a keyboarding that's more, a little bit more comfortable
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:57.320]   than the flat keyboard will allow, there's USB 2.0 plug in whenever keyboard you want,
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.920]   or there's Bluetooth, use whatever wireless keyboard you want.
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:06.120]   Haven't you noticed that the market for third party iPad mechanical keyboards is not exactly
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.120]   a rare thing?
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.000]   Oh, I've got one with lots of competition.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.040]   I think that, I think that Microsoft did take a look at how people are using iPads right
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.040]   now.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:19.520]   But I think that's the thing that I think is the thing that I think is the thing that
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:24.960]   works a little bit better, and I think that's the thing that you've got in your pocket,
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:29.640]   and this big $1,500 laptop that is 15 inches and too big to really carry around with you
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:30.640]   over your go.
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:34.320]   I bought one, a kickstand keyboard for my iPad.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.440]   So what am I saying?
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.440]   I don't know.
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.240]   I think it looks great.
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:39.240]   You do.
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.240]   You like it?
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:41.760]   I mean, the devil is in the details, right?
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:46.400]   I mean, we generally, those of us in the tech press have been pretty happy with the Metro
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.760]   stuff that Microsoft's been doing.
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:51.040]   I think there was a lot of wonder about like Windows 8 and how they were going to carry
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.040]   that off.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.040]   And there's still some confusion.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:58.760]   I think the whole Windows RT versus Pro thing in the two different tablets here is a little
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:03.960]   weird, but I, and it's fascinating that Microsoft is making a PC itself because this is a
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.840]   crazy, that's a real model.
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.160]   That's risky too.
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:11.520]   It is, but it's fascinating and it's like they wanted to build it themselves because
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:13.240]   they couldn't rely on the partners.
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:16.400]   And what they build looks really interesting.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.400]   I think I'm kind of torn.
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:22.720]   I'm not sure whether it's going to get traction as a, as a pure tablet or not because there's
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:26.120]   the whole app question and it's going to be in there against the iPad and it's going
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:27.800]   to be in there against Android tablets.
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:33.280]   But the pro model, although it's a little bit of a, a homunculus, you know, it's, it's
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.720]   it's just weird beast with all this different stuff inside it.
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:40.840]   The fact is it's also kind of like a better than ultra book potentially.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:45.360]   And, and that's really interesting that it's the super light tablet laptop.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.560]   I mean, that, that, that keyboard is not just a keyboard, but it's also a trackpad, which
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.240]   is crazy.
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:55.640]   And yeah, it, I think really one of the more interesting things, Microsoft has done some
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:58.840]   very clever, interesting things lately.
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:03.880]   And this, you know, it speaks, I think to the fact that I think Android had a real opportunity
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:06.120]   to take a huge chunk of the tablet market.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.120]   They blew it.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.120]   And it didn't do it.
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:09.920]   And now here's Microsoft to play too.
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:15.760]   So they showed, show this, because I want to show the, I want to show the, this is the
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.720]   pro version with a pro keyboard.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.040]   Yeah, the key, the big keyboard case.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:24.600]   So it has this keys on this travel, but they only travel a millimeter and a half.
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:28.080]   I mean, it's not like, but maybe people don't care about that so much.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:31.560]   And they, people, some of the people who are at the scene who actually typed in those keyboards
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:35.560]   that it was okay, or that that's actually very, actually very comfortable that they do
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.240]   miss the travel, but you can rest your, you can rest your fingers on the key caps.
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.680]   You can actually type on the thing.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:45.480]   And because this is a 69 aspect ratio, it's actually wider than a standard iPad.
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:49.200]   So you, one might presume that the keyboard is actually larger and closer to the size of
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.480]   a standard keyboard to begin with.
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.200]   It looks, it kind of looks actually about the same size as the Apple Bluetooth keyboard.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.240]   Yeah, I thought so too.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.680]   Yeah, I don't, you know, I'm kind of with you, Jason.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:03.440]   I want to say, and this is the same thing I've said about Windows 8, Bravo, Microsoft
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:06.080]   for taking a chance.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:08.040]   I'm just not clear what the chance is going to be.
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.040]   You know how it's going to play.
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:13.280]   I see, I think there's a really good chance here.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.720]   I think they're doing something really interesting.
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.320]   The fact, the matter is that maybe they had to.
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:20.560]   Well, they can't, they can't keep making.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:25.040]   They can't, they can't simply keep on implying to hardware manufacturers.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.480]   Hi, we thought it'd be a really cool idea if you start building machines like this.
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:29.480]   Right.
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.920]   And the things that the only things they're going to be making are the things that they
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:33.560]   know that they're selling in, in gobs and gobs and gobs.
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.120]   So this is the only way to really push things forward.
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:41.920]   But I just keep thinking about a MacBook Air, the 11 and share that I don't want.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:46.480]   And if Apple made a MacBook Air with a detachable keyboard like that, that could really work
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:50.360]   very, very well as a tablet when I want a tablet, when I want to be sitting there in
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:55.480]   my airline seat and just reading comic books or reading newspapers or watching a movie,
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:14:00.120]   and something that could do that sort of double duty and not just be my notebook computer,
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:04.040]   but also be the iPad that I have to carry with me whenever I feel as though I also need
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.680]   a desktop operating system.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:09.840]   So the fact that there are these two, there is a lot, there is a big risk for confusion
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:15.360]   in consumers as they try to figure out which one runs Windows and which one runs runs this
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:18.320]   new collection of Metro apps I've never heard of before.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.720]   But what do you think of it as in terms of competing to a MacBook Air, it becomes really,
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:23.720]   really cool.
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:27.000]   But also when you look at Android has had a couple of years now and they still have
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.920]   almost no tablet optimized apps.
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:36.720]   So if Microsoft's first win is that they instantly become the number two 10 inch and
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:43.080]   greater tablet on the market and put on at least Kindle fire grade numbers, that's enough
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.640]   to build on it because they're Microsoft, they're not, excuse, because they're modern
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:52.640]   Microsoft and not the, not 1998 Microsoft, they are likely to stick with this and build
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:53.920]   a as they go.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:57.720]   Microsoft almost never gets it right on the first try, but they usually get it right
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:01.800]   eventually and if they can stick around, I'm wondering what happens when the single most
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:08.000]   popular operating system on the planet has a tablet that is designed to work as intimately
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.560]   as possible with that desktop.
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:14.520]   I'm wondering whether this will steer more people towards this new Windows tablet than
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:16.240]   to the iPad.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:22.640]   I actually think that this has a potential to erode PC laptop sales from other vendors
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:26.520]   more than, you know, than Android tablet and iPad sales.
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.880]   I think the potential is there and we'll have to see what happens.
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:33.440]   But I do think there's a chance that what this is going to do is make PC users say,
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:37.440]   oh, well, if I want to run Windows and have it be portable, I'm going to get this thing
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:41.560]   and run it and it's interesting because then Microsoft is going to have to compete with
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:45.720]   Dell and Asus and, you know, lots of other companies that make ultra books.
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:50.960]   But by having these two products, you know, Microsoft is hedging their bets.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:56.880]   It's also interesting. This is Microsoft saying we think Apple's approach is a one we should
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:01.360]   try is a good one, which is a big step for them because traditionally Microsoft has been
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:06.360]   all about doing the OS and letting the hardware partners build the hardware and obviously
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:10.000]   Apple has become incredibly successful by controlling hardware and software.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.560]   And at several points in that presentation, Microsoft said this is what you can do when
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:18.440]   you connect hardware and software, which is what we've been hearing from Apple for years.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:24.560]   So it's interesting to see Microsoft playing Apple's game and by all accounts so far doing
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:26.120]   a pretty interesting job of it.
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:31.480]   So now do they kill the clones as Apple did?
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:34.600]   You know, I think there's a wacky scenario that's probably not going to happen.
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:38.280]   But if you imagine what would happen if Google took its ball and went home with Android and
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:42.040]   said all future work they're going to do on Android is going to be on their own proprietary
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.440]   version, their fork of it.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:46.840]   And you're going to use Motorola to build their devices.
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:51.040]   And then what if Microsoft kind of starts to crowd the PC makers out of the market and
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.040]   Apple being Apple?
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:55.840]   I'm not saying it's a realistic scenario, but I look at that and I think, you know, what
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:59.880]   if it turns out the right way to make these products is the way that Apple's been doing
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:03.960]   it all along, what would that mean for the dels and the like of the world?
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:07.400]   They would be that they would be really hurting because where are they going to get an operating
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.400]   system?
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.200]   Well, that's my point.
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:13.000]   I mean, people have said, oh, this is going to piss off the channel, but you know what?
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.480]   They don't have anywhere else to go.
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:17.560]   It's a calculated move on Microsoft's part.
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:22.080]   If you're Lenovo and Dell, you don't suddenly say, oh, we give up on Windows, you can't.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:24.200]   There's nowhere else to go.
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:29.080]   The other part of the challenge is that remember that Microsoft sold as sold more than half
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:32.280]   a billion installations of Windows 7 alone.
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:35.920]   And so they're not going to be able to make a half a billion of anything.
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:39.960]   So they're still going to need they can they can be the future forward company doing the
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:44.160]   hardware that is probably going to have to take a couple of years to find its audience.
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:49.440]   But once the customers come for this tablet, Samsung and Dell and HP and everyone else
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:52.000]   is going to be coming on board to build machines exactly like it.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.320]   Well, I'll tell you what they have done.
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:58.400]   They have absolutely eliminated the Windows RT tablet marketplace.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:03.120]   No one in their right mind is going to do a Windows RT, the ARM based version of this
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:06.920]   let Microsoft that I think that they've just killed the art.
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:11.480]   This is my thinking is that they've killed the RT tablet because you're not going to
[01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:14.480]   get a vendor competing against Microsoft on that tablet.
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:15.880]   There's not a proven market for it.
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:17.280]   There are no apps for it.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.360]   So I think a lot of people take a pass on it.
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.560]   They'll say, we'll make standard Windows PCs fine.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.880]   We'll continue to make those.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:30.440]   We're going to let Microsoft bear the brunt of moving the dial on the Windows RT tablet.
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:34.000]   Microsoft is now in a shrinking market because they're the only ones making it.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.120]   That means no developer is going to write for it.
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:37.120]   It's dead.
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:39.280]   I think this move kills the Windows RT tablet.
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:42.320]   I don't know because it is sort of Microsoft's iPad.
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:48.160]   And if they are cross compiling stuff that they're also writing for Metro on Windows 8,
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.160]   it'll pick it up.
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.160]   I mean, it might make it.
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.920]   There's not going to be any apps.
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:53.840]   They'll all come from Microsoft.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:54.840]   Well, what do you think?
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:56.760]   Why do you believe that it's not going to be any apps?
[01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.640]   Because there's not a market yet.
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:04.040]   And that's why Microsoft, at least with Windows 7 phone, has already salted the minds
[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:08.080]   to make sure that it's not the same development platform though.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.560]   You have to rewrite it.
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:14.440]   If you've written something for Metro on Windows phone, it is not the same as Metro on Windows
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:15.440]   8.
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:19.480]   I'm saying that they can just simply cut and paste your code into a new app form.
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:23.880]   I'm saying that Microsoft has proven the ability to simply say, we need to have these
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:24.880]   12 apps.
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:26.600]   We need to have these 30 apps.
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.600]   We need to have Netflix.
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:31.240]   They did mention that they've got Netflix on both of these tablets right now.
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:41.120]   And it's not as though a pad or slate-style computer user needs to have the full 800,000
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:42.280]   variety of apps out there.
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:45.360]   They're really looking for 30 or 40 that are important.
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:49.480]   And let's not forget that each one of these Windows RT tablets will have Microsoft Office
[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:50.480]   built in.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:54.720]   And once you get somebody in the store and you tell them that what are the most important
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.880]   apps that you use in your office and in your house?
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.600]   Well, I use Office a lot.
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:19:59.600]   Well, great.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:00.600]   That comes with free.
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.400]   We're open and closed exactly the same documents you have at home.
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:06.200]   As a matter of fact, we have our own cloud service that comes with free.
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.480]   So you can just simply keep everything in a folder on your home directory and then it'll
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:13.400]   just simply appear magically as soon as you connect by Wi-Fi.
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.160]   That's a big deal.
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:19.480]   The problem with that is the first off, Windows 7 phone has this problem now, which is it's
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:24.600]   got some key apps, but I used one for a couple of weeks and it was frustrating.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.520]   And I talked to people who test them out.
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:29.280]   And the app situation there is still not great.
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:32.680]   It's got some apps and you can use it.
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:34.120]   And it's a nice operating system.
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:39.760]   And I think where it falls down is that there hasn't been a number of apps released.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:43.920]   And then in terms of RT, getter live, I don't know.
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:49.760]   I think Office, did they show yesterday any inkling of Office on Windows RT that isn't
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:53.320]   what they've shown before, which is that it's actually the old Windows desktop version
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:54.320]   of Office.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.320]   It runs in desktop.
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.320]   It runs in desktop.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.320]   Yeah, it runs in desktop.
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.440]   It's not the same as a touch tablet version of Office.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.640]   It's not the same.
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:05.160]   Well, then that's something that they promised and that's something they're going to probably
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.840]   show off, but by the end of the year.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:10.200]   Yeah, no, I think they've said they're going to do it on iPad.
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:14.680]   I just don't think that it's necessary for Apple to come up with the same number of apps
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:21.040]   that Apple has for the iPad in order to be a credible and valuable and successful product.
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:25.800]   I think it really is in the low three digits in terms of the number of apps they need in
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:28.080]   order to keep most app users satisfied.
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:33.960]   When we started off this show, I talked about how, well, most people don't use Ethernet.
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:35.560]   Most people don't use an optical drive.
[01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.880]   Most people don't use VGA.
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:44.360]   Most people don't use, I think, 80% of the apps that are available on the iPad store.
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:48.840]   If this sort of thinking can be expanded to tablet app stores, I'm not insisting that's
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:50.520]   true, but I believe that's true.
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:57.480]   The problem of creating a credible tablet with a good sustaining app store is not as insurmountable
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:03.240]   as a six digit figure number of titles in the iOS app store would make one believe.
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.240]   I don't know.
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:05.240]   Tell that to Blackberry.
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:06.240]   Tell that to HP.
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:10.640]   Tell that to Android, in fact, which has hundreds of thousands of apps and still isn't getting
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.640]   any traction.
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:16.640]   I think you do need apps and I don't think Windows Microsoft Office is enough.
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:20.960]   All they have to do is be successful where Android failed.
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.680]   I don't think that it's been demonstrated at all.
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:29.000]   I'm saying that the fact how many people failed in tablets before Apple decided to create
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   the iPad.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.360]   If they listened to the app, well, people don't buy tablets.
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:33.480]   People don't like tablets.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:37.800]   The fact that Google has failed to build a marketplace for Android tablets only means
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:38.800]   that they did it poorly.
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:41.200]   If they do it well in Microsoft.
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:44.320]   Well, it's certainly more elegant than Android on a tablet.
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:45.600]   I agree with you on that.
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:46.600]   It's a much more elegant interface.
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:51.440]   But if you can't run any software, if there's no apps, the all the elegant interface in
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.960]   the world doesn't do anything for you.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:56.280]   This is the number one reason that Microsoft announced this without a price and without
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:57.280]   a shift date.
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:58.280]   It's three months away.
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:59.280]   It's coming.
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:03.400]   They want to get out there and say we have a story for developers too so that Google
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:07.080]   doesn't sweet talk them at their developer conference.
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:10.480]   Microsoft knows how important it is to get the developers on board.
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.360]   Put yourself in the mindset of a developer.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:16.640]   You're making a choice now, but where to spend resources?
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.880]   You've got a very credible place with the iPad.
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:20.560]   I mean, like, obvious.
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:24.000]   You've got a credible place with Windows.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.320]   Are you going to develop a Windows RT app?
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:30.840]   Are you going to spend money and developers on developing a Windows RT app when there's
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:33.240]   no proven market for it at all?
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:38.600]   Well, if there's people with money with these tablets, that's money to be chased after.
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.960]   And what do you want to do?
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:48.480]   Do you want to try to be the greatest social network powered photo app for the iPad?
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:49.480]   Oh, wait.
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:52.120]   No, you've already been clobbered by that with three different incredibly competitive
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.120]   apps.
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:57.960]   Or do you want to create something in fresh ground where nobody has a better reputation
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:04.480]   or nobody really has the status of this is the greatest RSS feed based newspaper magazine
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.480]   reader ever.
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:06.720]   This is the best comic book reader.
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:09.920]   This is the best Google Docs app out there.
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:12.880]   This is the best file sharing app out there.
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:18.000]   I don't think there's going to be a land rush to Windows RT, but I think there are plenty
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.960]   of people out there who are going to see the opportunity there.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:22.960]   We'll see.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:26.360]   And I guess it also comes down to, and we'll talk about it on Windows Weekly on Thursday
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:32.120]   with Paul Thrott and Mary Jo Foley, it comes down to how easy it is to cross develop.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:36.560]   So if you can write a Windows Metro app, and I presume, although again, this is a big
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:42.560]   presumption, there are people who are going to do Metro apps for Windows, Windows 8, that
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:46.440]   you, if it's an easy enough thing to cross compile it for Windows RT, that you might
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:47.440]   do that.
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:48.440]   Yeah.
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:52.240]   And let's not forget that we're still, we're not talking about the Windows Pro version,
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:54.880]   which will run the entire version of Windows desktop.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:55.880]   That's more credible to me.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:00.640]   I mean, I think that has a, it's a, it's a, it's a form factor of laptop that's unique,
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.040]   interesting, unproven.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:07.040]   So that, yeah, I agree.
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.480]   I'm suddenly relevant.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.840]   When, you know, exactly.
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:16.480]   It's a, it's a, and I commend them for making it a three horse race.
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:18.640]   You know, and everybody pointed this app.
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:20.920]   pundits are going to love it because we want competition.
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:22.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:26.480]   We want something to talk about, but also I think user confusion is great.
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:27.480]   User confusion is good.
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:30.440]   And I think a choice of platforms is very good for users.
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:35.080]   Um, and we just don't know enough right now to know whether this is Mac break weekly.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:38.960]   Apple, I think, uh, does better with some competition.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:39.960]   You bet.
[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:43.840]   And it's like, is Apple's been coasting in some ways because there's been, and the iPad,
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:48.280]   I mean, the iPad is not, they have progressed with the iPad, but the iPad has had no real
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:49.280]   competition.
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:52.320]   Uh, so I think it would be good if Apple got poked a little bit.
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:53.920]   I'm just like, Hey, why don't you do this?
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:57.120]   Why, you know, if that happens, that would be good for Apple.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:59.080]   And I think good for users of Apple's products too.
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.080]   Yep.
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.080]   I agree a hundred percent.
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:04.840]   I think that iPad is dominant because Apple's the only tablet manufacturer that's really
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:06.440]   got its sack together.
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:10.320]   Once they have a company that has a good plan and a compelling product, then we'll suddenly
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:14.680]   see what, uh, what, what, what are consumers naturally going to vote for?
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:16.200]   What do they really, really want?
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:20.280]   Uh, right now, I just can't recommend any accountant, other tablet to anybody.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:24.040]   It's, it's, it's almost a, it would be, it would be, I would never be invited any family
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:28.080]   function ever again if I tried to steer somebody towards a motor row zoom.
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:31.240]   But if there's a good, if there's a good alternative out there, that's good for everybody.
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:35.040]   And Microsoft's a safer thing than saying buying a blackberry playbook or a zoom.
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.040]   Oh, good God.
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:37.040]   Yes.
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:40.600]   So, you know, they can't get mad at you because you recommended a Windows product.
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:44.040]   Well, let's say they've been saying that for the past 40, 40, 50 years.
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:46.920]   You never get, you never get fired for recommending IBM equipment now.
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:47.920]   And Microsoft equipment.
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:48.920]   Yeah.
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:53.520]   Uh, it, it looks like I'm looking at a post, uh, that Paul Thorett posted, uh, a link
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:58.680]   to, uh, on his blog, Windows, super site to what you, how to develop for Windows on arm.
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:02.400]   You do it on Windows, uh, not on a tablet, obviously.
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:06.360]   And they, they say here developing for Windows on arm is the same as developing a Metro app
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:08.440]   for x86 PCs.
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:11.760]   The same Metro style app will run on either hardware, obviously you have to cross compile
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.760]   for a different processor.
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:18.360]   So it sounds like that they may be able to leverage if, you know, you get a lot of people
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.240]   writing Metro apps for Windows eight.
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:21.680]   That's another question mark.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:22.680]   Yeah.
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:25.960]   If you do get people writing when Metro apps for Windows eight, then presumably you could
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:27.800]   leverage that onto the tablet.
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:31.000]   And that gives them at least a little bit of a leg up.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.440]   It's very interesting.
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:37.000]   I just, it's, I don't know what to think.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000]   We're going to take a break.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.360]   Uh, there's lots more news, but I don't think we have time for it.
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.880]   So we're going to get to your picks.
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:47.120]   Uh, podcasts will be separate and iOS six.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.120]   Yay.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.680]   I think that's a good thing for us and for all podcasters.
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:57.400]   Um, that Apple one computer sold for 300 and some thousand dollars, the working apple one,
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:58.400]   the Steve Jobs Atari memo.
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.240]   People do want to expand ability.
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:04.840]   See, see, they want to cassette interface, bring it back.
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:09.840]   27,000 dollars for the, uh, Steve Jobs Atari memo with a handwritten note and the Buddhist
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:12.280]   saying on it.
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:19.960]   Um, I think that's probably all of the really important stories, public transit in iOS six
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:22.080]   actually really good post on coconetics.
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:24.520]   And this guy actually was in our studio a couple of weeks ago.
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:28.800]   See, cause he was in town for WWDCs from Austria and when she talks about the reason
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:34.280]   why you won't see public transit directions in iOS six, basically Google got screwed by
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:38.200]   doing it in maps by the Austrian transit, uh, companies.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:43.080]   There's two of them that are kind of sort of privately owned and both of them decided
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:48.200]   to, to break the Google API saying we've got our own apps.
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:51.360]   So we're not going to give you public transit in the Google maps.
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:56.280]   And, uh, and so, uh, in this blog post, um, he's saying, and I think he's probably right,
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:59.640]   that it's just Apple's not going to do it because you can't guarantee the data will be
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:00.640]   there.
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:03.760]   And there's some good reason to think that it won't be there.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:10.480]   So, uh, we'll coconetics.com, uh, slash blog, if you want to read that, think a good article.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:15.440]   But our next segment will be our picks of the week.
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:19.840]   If you guys want to do a OS tip or iOS tip or if you want to do a retina display tip,
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:22.360]   I'll be all ears.
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:24.360]   But first a word from our friends at Ford.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:27.080]   I actually was down at the computer museum.
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:29.360]   It's in Mountain View last night.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:35.760]   Ford has opened a Silicon Valley office because they're reaching out to app developers.
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:36.760]   It was really great.
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:43.320]   I talked to Prasad who's running the Silicon Valley office and I talked to their CTO Paul
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:49.720]   Macarena's and, uh, it's really interesting to see a company that's more than a hundred
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:51.480]   years old.
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:54.200]   Think about moving at the speed of Silicon Valley.
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:55.200]   You're a car company.
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:56.760]   You can't move at that speed.
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:02.800]   So what they've done is they've created an API for Ford sync that allows developers
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:07.320]   to write apps on top of it because they realized apps and the smartphone are going to move
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:08.920]   faster than the car.
[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:10.320]   They said it's very simple.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.640]   The car is a platform.
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:16.720]   We build in the tools, the sensors, the information on the platform and then we give you an API
[01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:20.760]   to the platform and say, here you continue to update it.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:24.400]   It's just a brilliant way thinking of a car as platform and they're doing it.
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:26.240]   I mean, they're eating their own dog food.
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:30.160]   Uh, with an example of my Ford mobile app.
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:34.000]   So I was taking, I was actually, uh, they were doing test drives of the 2012 Ford Focus
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000]   Electric.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000]   So sweet.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.000]   Oh my gosh.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.480]   And silent, you know, and beautiful, beautiful vehicle.
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:46.480]   And then we took a look at the app, the my Ford mobile app, which lets you control all
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:47.800]   sorts of features in the car.
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:49.160]   You can, for instance, be in the living room.
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:52.080]   The cars in the garage plugged in and you could say, Hey, only charge during off peak
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:53.080]   hours.
[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.080]   I want to save money.
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.200]   The app saves you money.
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:00.000]   You can plan the most eco-friendly route with the app.
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:06.920]   The app has maps for where the nearest charge points are, BlackBerry, Android and iOS, of
[01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:08.040]   course.
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:12.840]   You may even have a website where you can, uh, if you're a, as Tom Merritt says, a stats
[01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:17.840]   nerd, you can go on the website and see who saved the most CO2 this year at this month.
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:18.840]   They have forums.
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:24.800]   They're really, this is a really interesting approach to making the car, you know, up-to-date
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.600]   consumer electronics.
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:28.080]   I just love it.
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:31.840]   I think you need to go to a Ford dealer and test drive the 2012 Ford Focus next year.
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:35.160]   Of course, the plug-in hybrid fusion energy will be out.
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:36.920]   That will also have a My Ford mobile app.
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:39.480]   All their electric vehicles will.
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:42.880]   And the app is going to be updated regularly as is the vehicle.
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:45.160]   Ford did something I've never heard a company do ever before.
[01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:48.320]   They updated the software and My Ford Touch this year.
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.960]   They sent out 300,000 USB keys.
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:55.160]   They said never before has a car company updated itself with a USB key.
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:58.520]   They said, you know, we could make you go to the dealer, but wait, wait, just mail you
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:31:59.760]   the USB key.
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:02.000]   Just plug it into the USB port.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000]   Very slick.
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.280]   I just love this very forward-looking and I can't wait to see what new products come
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:10.280]   from their new Silicon Valley offices.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:15.880]   Ford Motor Company proving you don't have to be a brand new company to be a modern company.
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:19.640]   110 years old and going strong.
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:25.080]   Ford.com/technology if you want to learn a little bit more.
[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:29.280]   Either you guys got a retina tip for me.
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:30.280]   I have to say-
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:32.680]   Don't stare directly at the screen.
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:33.960]   I'm hooked.
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:39.520]   I did the with the chat room because now so I'm using an app called Textual.
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:43.840]   There are a number of apps for IRC, but I can make the text bigger and it's and because
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:46.960]   they were smart enough to use the WebKit for the text.
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:49.920]   It's gorgeous at every size.
[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:51.640]   You can even read it this small.
[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:54.920]   I just love it.
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:33:00.520]   So the tip is to use the retinus just just the native best for retina.
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:04.600]   But then I have to say I'm very impressed that when you plug in an HDMI port I've never
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:06.760]   seen a computer smarter than this.
[01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:13.600]   We hook up computers all the time using an HDMI adapter to the Thunderbolt and so forth.
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:14.600]   It worked right away.
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:15.600]   We've never had that happen.
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:20.360]   I just plugged it in HDMI and it picked the right resolution for both it and my display.
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:23.040]   I mean just fairing my ears too.
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:30.480]   I plugged it into my HD screen via VGA and not only does it simply auto detect what the
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:34.480]   optimum resolution is for that display, but also you have the option of saying well it
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:39.320]   also supports these other four resolutions and not giving you good, better, big text best
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:41.960]   is saying here are the four resolutions you can do with the screen.
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:42.960]   Just pick one.
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:43.960]   Good.
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:44.960]   Good.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:45.960]   Well done.
[01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:46.960]   Good.
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:47.960]   Well done.
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:49.680]   Andy and I co your pick of the week.
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:53.320]   My pick of the week is this is a product that will hopefully become unnecessary as we run
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:57.680]   screaming down the primrose path of thinner devices and SSDs.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:01.120]   It's called the heat shift thermapad.
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:02.120]   Thermapak.
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:08.040]   And what it is is it's a heat dissipating pad to slide underneath your notebook.
[01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:13.040]   So that will does it protects the notebook and it protects in the summertime your bare
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:17.920]   knees and your bear shins from being having the skin cooked off of it.
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:21.040]   My 15 inch last year MacBook Pro.
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:25.520]   I have to before I before I found this I'd have to have like a little bit of a towel
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:30.360]   or a little something underneath just like the back like the back corner of this device
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:35.640]   because on my old MacBook this corner would get super super hot and that's right underneath
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:40.120]   like the heel of my right foot like when I have my legs crossed and like after about
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:42.680]   30 minutes like.
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:47.360]   So this is actually there are there are a bunch of like a cooling pads that either just
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:52.640]   elevate the base of the device or they actually have a mechanical fan that does cooling.
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:57.280]   But this is that this is sort of I don't know if you can hear it but sort of a crunchy gel
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:02.960]   inside and as it as it what it does is the gel absorbs heat and converts into actually
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.080]   gooey gel.
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:08.520]   So for at least three or four hours it will it'll convert the heat that's being generated
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:12.000]   from the from the laptop into something less destructive.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.160]   And I also I also travel with these things because if I'm booked into a hotel with a
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:20.400]   big king size bed and I sleep in the queen size portion of the bed and then leave like
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.880]   the rest of it just as like working space for you know I'll be I'll be I'll be writing
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:28.720]   like watching TV like in bed and then when I'm done just put it on the bed next to me
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:33.280]   and oftentimes I'm woken up not by the iPhone but by the screaming of these fans because
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:39.840]   it's sunk deep into that like Hilton Hilton eight foot that feather feather comforter.
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:44.560]   And so this will hopefully help out heat with heat dissipation when you're being so stupid
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:48.280]   as to block ventilation slots by putting it on top of the comforter.
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:52.880]   Anyway they make different sizes for different machines about usually between about 15 to
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:57.600]   20 bucks and I like this with they they sent the company sent me this one to try out I
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:01.320]   liked it enough to actually bought a couple more so there's every room in the house has
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:05.320]   a comfortable chair and a power outlet has one of these somewhere nearby.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:10.040]   Andy how many people live with you if what do you just always you wander from chair to
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:13.080]   chair there's always a place for you to light.
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:17.480]   And you live alone you can sit wherever every chair is your chair.
[01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:18.760]   That's the beauty of that.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:24.360]   I have equipped every chair in my home and because Buster is largely happy to remain wherever
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:26.040]   he is put he stays off the furniture.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:32.520]   I have designed the ultimate lifestyle until I get 73 and 74 and become ill and there's
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:36.000]   no one to care for me and I die alone afraid and you can move in with me but that's but
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.440]   that's at least four years it'll be like the odd couple and I call what are you doing
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:45.040]   you left a dish in the sink.
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:49.200]   That's a that's a very important prototype of a Microsoft habit don't put your beer on
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:50.200]   it.
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:55.080]   No two grown men sharing their connection without driving each other crazy.
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:58.360]   It'll be like Big Bang Theory with old farts.
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:00.640]   It'll be great.
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:04.960]   So who gets to be Sheldon Jason you had a pick for us something you really like.
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:08.600]   I mean as head of their chief of Mac world you probably see it all.
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:12.000]   I'm going to show you an ILS app let's see if I can do this.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000]   There's a horrible reflection it's called robot lab do you see that.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.800]   Oh yeah.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:21.800]   You don't see a cardboard box and you're not going to be able to say a lot.
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:26.440]   You have cardboard box and you drag on like the legs or the robots and they and then the
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:30.040]   arms and then the head and then the my kids love it.
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:33.360]   It's Tokoboka robot lab it's two bucks on the app store.
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.120]   Do adults love it too?
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:39.800]   Yeah well it's like a maybe not complex enough for adults.
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:41.120]   It's very gentle.
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:42.760]   It's not really a game.
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:45.400]   It's more like a software toy.
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:48.400]   You build these robots out of parts and that's fun.
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:53.920]   My kids love just you know same to different parts and then and then you play and the game
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:58.800]   you play is super rudimentary you're flying around and picking up stars and getting to
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:02.800]   the end of the game and then and you're like testing out your robot to see how it does.
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:07.360]   And I think there's some different attributes depending on what kind of robot parts you
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:10.640]   choose but it's you know it's not like a challenging game.
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.840]   It's more that the kids just have huge fun.
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:17.920]   The robot parts are all these very pretty graphics and and then they love the fact that
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:21.080]   when you're done assembling it you get to do something with it which is just fly it around
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:22.160]   for a test flight.
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:26.240]   And you know my my son is seven and my daughter is 10 and they both had a good time playing
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:29.800]   and my son really thought it was awesome that he could build different robots with crazy
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:30.800]   mismatched parts.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:36.200]   And it's just it's cute and gentle and and fun for for younger kids.
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:40.360]   So two bucks Tokoboka is the company and it's the robot lab.
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:42.280]   Tokoboka Tokoboka.
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:43.280]   Tokoboka.
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:44.280]   Yeah.
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:45.280]   Tokoboka.
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:46.280]   Thank you.
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:53.480]   I guess I really should pick Diablo 3 because everybody on it it's what's nice is and I
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:54.640]   love Blizzard for this.
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:59.360]   They did it with World of Warcraft when they release a big hit game they release it on
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:03.440]   both Mac and Windows and I think that they should be applauded for this.
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:07.600]   And if you haven't played Diablo 3 it's about 50 or 60 bucks you can buy it and download
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:10.280]   it from Blizzard directly.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:14.360]   What's one of the really nice things about it is I have it on all my Macs because you
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:17.280]   download it and put it on every Mac and you just log into your account.
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:20.000]   Now that's a negative too because people say well you can't play if you're not online
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.280]   that's true you have to be online to play even though it's not necessarily an online
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:25.280]   game.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:30.800]   You like the fact that my player Grasshopper follows me everywhere I go on any Mac I play
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:36.560]   and it plays beautifully on the MacBook Pro with Retina as they set at the announcement.
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:42.120]   So if you if you like the kind of it's a top down click click click game if you like
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:46.520]   it that kind of game this is a really fun one to play.
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:49.200]   You're totally right about Blizzard.
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:54.840]   This isn't a recent thing Blizzard has been doing Mac Windows simultaneous for but even
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:59.160]   when the Mac wasn't doing that great with Blizzard was was there with Warcraft in the
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:00.160]   early days.
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.160]   Yeah.
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:06.680]   So they've always been big supporters of the Mac and you know and they deserve a lot
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:07.680]   of applause for that.
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:12.640]   I'm grateful to them really and it also shows that the developers say oh you can't do a
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:16.360]   great game on the Macintosh or just wrong.
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:20.800]   I mean you totally can't this is a really fun game and I'm getting killed right now so
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:26.960]   just we'll just end the show now because frankly this spiders about to end me.
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:31.160]   Thank you Jason Snow editor in Chief Macworld always great to have you on your authoritative
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:34.920]   voice is it's helped calm me down consider.
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:39.960]   I'm glad I could talk you down from the retina ledge sorry couldn't be in petaluma today
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:44.520]   so that's okay way down here in San Francisco are you are so you're at Macworld.
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:48.960]   World headquarters that's great anything coming up you want to talk about I'm sure you'll
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:54.760]   have retina coverage lots of stuff on the site now and I'll put in a plug you should
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:58.240]   check out our new tech site that we're launching this fall it's a there's a beta blog up now
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:04.080]   it's tech high that tech hive T E C H H I V E dot com I hope to get some any and not
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:05.560]   go stuff up there pretty soon.
[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:06.640]   Oh cool.
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:11.240]   So this is going to be like for extreme tech people that want to know a lot of tech stuff
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:12.720]   if you're really techy.
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:16.960]   I know I think it's going to be a general tech site so it's it's more like how we use
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:21.000]   tech in our in our real lives to make our lives better but not just not just Apple anymore.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.360]   No this is so this is going to be the editors of Macworld and PC world working together
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:26.880]   to kind of bridge that gap.
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:32.080]   Oh I like that I like that yeah already I'm I'm interested and this is the beta site in
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:33.080]   the articles.
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:37.040]   It's just a blog for now but full site launching in a few months.
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:41.240]   Good on you handsome devil up in the corner of the I believe that's Jason snacks.
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:46.840]   Now is this your are you is this are you're the you're the editorial director of this thing.
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:51.120]   Yeah so I'm in I'm in charge actually it's a Mac break weekly so I shouldn't say this
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:56.120]   but I'm in charge of Macworld PC world and tech hive now so I'm in charge of the whole.
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:59.880]   I didn't know that and one of the yeah it's true and one of the things we're doing is
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:05.840]   this is this new tech is tech hive site so we can bring that the goodness of the experts
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:08.680]   at Macworld and PC world together and do some new stuff that's a little less.
[01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:11.080]   Yeah there's a classic picture of me at like 19.
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:14.000]   You look just like Steve Jobs I thought it was Steve Jobs at first.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.360]   Yeah it's not it's just bad haircut from that era.
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:20.920]   But is that shot in black and white or is that just an effect.
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:25.000]   It was shot in black and white that's no Instagram that was actually that was in my
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.240]   black and white film photography era.
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:29.960]   1989 high school high school photography.
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:30.960]   That's the Apple 2 there.
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:31.960]   Yeah yeah.
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:33.960]   He developed it himself.
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:36.360]   Here in college and look at they're all lighter than air.
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:39.760]   I did not know you were responsible for PC world too so we should have you on our Windows
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:40.760]   weekly show.
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:43.520]   Yeah well that would be a pretty funny.
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:46.000]   I might be found out as a fraud.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.480]   Wow thank you it's so great to have you on Jason.
