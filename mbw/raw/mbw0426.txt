[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   It's time for Mac break weekly the show where we cover the latest Macintosh news and we've got a great big panel here joining us all the way from Pittsburgh PA Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   It's a panel of panels. It's a panel of panels. It is.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   We'll introduce our fourth member in just a second but also next to you and you can just turn to your left and see him.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   It's Renee Richie.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   There we go.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Oh it's a pretty bunch of moments.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   If I'm more.com don't kiss him. Don't kiss him.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Hi Renee.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Oh.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   If you reach a handout Alex and it appears in Renee's shot then I'll be impressed.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And all the way over on the other side for Andy and Akko is just off and left field there. I apologize Andy.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   That's okay. I'm right next to the 5k display which is the focus of everybody's attention.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   It is actually.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   It's like sitting next to Paul Lind and Hollywood Square. You know you're not the star but Peter the camera is going to be on you.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   This is we've set the icons to a giant size.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   We were like looking at hidden Easter eggs and the icons. So this is it. This is the 5k Retina plus I guess you that.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I mean well it is Retina right.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Almost 200 pixels per inch but not you know not like 500 pixels per inch.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   But 14 or something.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Yeah 14 megapixels.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And give you to put this into perspective Jason Stell was here yesterday and did something that I think kind of demonstrates it.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Hide our hide the.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Why do that I don't know.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I want to hide the doc.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I'm using this weird Apple magic mouse which I find far from magic.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   All right now I'll open this here.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Look how tiny the doc is.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   It's like they're so far away.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Well we're running it a high DPI mode.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   But let me show let me show this image that Jason Snell created for us.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   This is a view. I mean this is gorgeous and of course at home you're probably not going to be wowed by it because even if you're watching our HD video it's only 720p.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   But you here in the studio audience I think are falling into that mountain landscape and low.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   What is that in the lower left hand corner postage stamp size.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   It's a very original Macintosh screen from 1984 compared to our nice.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   In fact we could get all three of you guys into here easily.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   All the monitors could be in there.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   It really is dramatic.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Renee you said you have one for review.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Yeah I actually bought one.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   I could not contain myself and I looked at it at the event and it was just so so very pretty Leo.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   It's stunning.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   It's it's ridiculous.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I've been using it arrived last Friday.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I've been using it since then and it looks like an iPhone display like an iPad display.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   It looks like living paper or living I don't know magazines.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   It's what it's immersive isn't it.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Yeah because they laminate the panels now there's not even there used to be like a window in between you and the pixels so you would look like you were looking through the glass and now it's just in the glass.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Right.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   I want to live in there.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Yeah that's a good point.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   As much as the resolution makes a difference because you you know it's in fact even when I'm on on the side like this it looks great.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Yeah because it eliminates the gap so there's less glare there's less reflection inside the panel itself.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   It is they're using high DPI mode right.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   You can put it so the retina mode is exactly for at two X so twice the horizontal twice the vertical pixels you can put it in native mode which means that you get every single one of those pixels if you want to.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   But it's just they're doing a lot of trickery to get this done because the current Thunderbolt 2 with DisplayPort 1.2 does not support this.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Right.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   So they're using their own TCON controller their own timing controller to get all this to work and it's so far it's flawless for me the anime.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I got the upgraded GPU because I didn't want to take any risk of a retina tax and it the animations are smooth.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   It's it's I haven't seen a hint of shearing a hint of slowdown.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   It's just that's kind of what what happens on my 5k display let's let's say go to the Apple website here and it's when you start scrolling that well that's not a good place because we can't scroll here.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Some of the 4k monitors they they do I forget what is called that technology that I'm not a yeah so each half is rendered separately and combined together and sometimes they can't keep up with themselves.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   This has no I mean this is now I like you did not want to risk a lower slower speed so we did also max this one out.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   That's the top of the line I7 the enhanced GPU and all that stuff.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Let's go to the verge I always use the verge as my scrolling test.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Even if you do like mission control or something like that is it's so much more responsive than I thought it would be.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Yeah this is absolutely no lag.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   If you play a game you're not going to be playing at this native resolution which what is the what is the native.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   It's a 2880 this way right and then it's yeah 1550.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   I was to 20 years it's some it's a number too big for my poor brain to calculate legal.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   There's just so many pixels.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Let me just add a curios I just I wonder what will happen if I do this.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   A lot of people asked about the refresh rate and I've had no problem with the refresh rate.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   It's not 60.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I believe it is 60 but they're technically combining two different pipes together so you never know what the end result will be.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   But I've seen no slowdown I've seen no shadowing I've seen nothing.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   No gaming would be where you care about that.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Let's let's so right now just I think everybody understands this took me a while to grock it.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   We're running it at the same resolution in effect that a normal Macintosh would be 20 what is that 26 16 by 14.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   40 but using four pixels for every point right now.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Yeah, that's what Apple calls it points and so yeah, that's why the text looks so amazing.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   But let's go to native one to one.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   No scaling at all on this thing.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And well, you know, it's not stuff is a little smaller but not horrible.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   I can still the menus are more legible than I thought that they must be doing something else with these.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Well, you're getting one to one pixel to point there.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   So there's just so many more pixels on the right.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Right.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Yeah, you're getting more stuff on the screen instead of higher resolution.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Right.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Is there any trade off whatsoever in the experience?
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   That's out of the money that's not in your desk.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   You know, twenty five or something.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Well, that's a good point because you Renee and I bought like ours was more like four thousand dollars.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Yeah, plus taxes plus play.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   So twenty five hundred bucks is the is the I five base model.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   You know, it's funny.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Nobody's reviewing.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Apple's not even sending those out for review.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   They're sending out.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I think it's been a war ended on Mashable.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I think it's a good baseline.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   And what did she say?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Did she notice anything?
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   I mean, again, is all about the display.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   If that's if you've been waiting for retina on desktop, then this is the machine you've been waiting for.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Everything else is sort of secondary.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   I guess the real question and this is when we talked about last week that Marco Arment.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   I'm going to go back to best for display, which is a scaled resolution.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Is this better than the Mac Pro?
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Should I should you trade in your Mac Pro for this?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Again, if you're doing massive amounts of open CL, if you're doing a lot of parallel computing,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   if you're doing anything that really can use those four, six or eight or more cores,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   then you want the Mac Pro.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   But if you want five K, the Mac Pro, the current Mac Pro will never be able to drive an Apple
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   five K display that you want the iMac.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   It never makes any sense to buy the cheapest BMW.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   If that's your budget by the best Toyota.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   That's just basic consumer comment sense, I think.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   You're future proofing it.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   I mean, you want to.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   There's always going to be trade-offs in the bottom of the line.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   We're asked when you buy the best that someone makes, even if it doesn't do quite as much as the other one does.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   So long as your needs are within that gap, it's like you would much rather have something
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   that is the finest thing this company can do.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And you may make decisions about, like, for instance, whether you're going to get the largest SSD
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   that might be available or the most RAM.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   But a lot of these are not super upgradable.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   So it's the other thing to think about it.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   I know with the Mac Mini, you definitely want to get 16 gigs when you get it.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   You don't want to get eight.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Absolutely.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   You're going to do something with it later.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   This one is upgradable.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   The iMac is the only one that's still easily.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   The RAM upgradable is the only one you're going to do.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   The point being, if you've got 2,500 bucks or even 3,000 bucks to spend on an iMac, maybe you'd
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   be better off buying a conventional iMac but putting in all the memory you can afford, putting
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   in all the storage you can afford, giving it a can't be upgraded.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.800]   And whatever accessories you think you're going to need with it, rather than having the bare
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   bones 5K iMac.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.800]   Wow.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.520]   This is just gorgeous.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.600]   He said because he doesn't own one and probably will never own one for another year or two
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.600]   and is patently jealous.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:09.400]   Well, I've seen some people say why not wait a year and it'll be even better, right?
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.360]   I always believe that any time that any company Apple included does something that's absolutely
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.360]   brand new, whether it's a new case design, whether it's a new technology, it's never
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:25.480]   a good idea to jump on board to be in the first group of owners unless you really have
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:29.320]   a compelling need to have it right now because the second generation is always going to be
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:35.040]   better and usually not by just a, oh, well, we decided to change the grade of the interconnectors
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.040]   between two components.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.720]   No, they figure out a better way to put it together.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.160]   They figure out a better way to get more performance out of it.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.000]   And they found some weak points that would not have been discovered if they had not already
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.160]   put about a half million of them in the hands of other people.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:52.080]   We should get, I want to get some red footage, some 5k red footage jealous.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.400]   I think you can't really play it back.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.720]   It's part of the or even the 4k.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.200]   I mean, you can do the 4k and you have room left over for the pallets on the slide, which
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.200]   is really cool.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.200]   Wow.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:08.600]   Do you think that that was part of the decision to go to 5k instead of 4k that that we can
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.720]   have live editing of 4k and still have room alongside it to make it a floating window and
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.680]   put other things on the sides of it?
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.040]   I think it's actually a good argument for it.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.000]   I think that the viewability of 5k is I don't know how often people are going to use it,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.560]   but it's going to be a huge deal for Final Cut users because they're you are able to
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.520]   actually work and not just Final Cut, but anybody working with 4k footage any reason
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.680]   will be able to add interface around that 4k experience.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.400]   So and definitely seems like Apple is going to continue to push that far.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.480]   Of course, the big question is now that they figured out how to make this 5k thing,
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.480]   but we'll see it on monitors that stand alone for the Mac Pro.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:49.360]   They can't because the Mac Pro doesn't have the bandwidth to do it.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.680]   So currently my understanding is that this is like again, this is fusing to display port
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:57.200]   1.2s together and to do it over one cable, they'll need Thunderbolt 3, which has I forget
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.320]   the newer version of display port.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.760]   And that comes in Skylake and they haven't even shipped Broadwell yet.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.800]   So we're waiting till next year, I think at the earliest.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.280]   Tom, let me tell you keep saying that Broadwell is the broadwell delays have not affected
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.840]   Skylake delays, but we'll have to see.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.880]   Tom Lowe over at TimeScapes, which is a beautiful 4k movie, gave me a download.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.440]   Let's see if I can get it on here.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.960]   It's on my other machine, but it'd be nice to put that.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.520]   It's only 4k.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:30.920]   So one of the problems you have with is you spoils you, right?
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.360]   You feel that way, Renee, now that you're a little bit spoiled?
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.920]   Yeah, I'm looking at the previous generation Thunderbolt display right now because this
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.440]   is on a Mac Pro.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.600]   So this is what it's driving and you can see it.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.800]   It's almost like when you go back from a Mac Pro to a MacBook Air and you can see the
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.800]   pixels again.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.080]   And I'm not going to say it's like sandpaper on your retina because it's not exactly that.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.080]   But it looks fuzzier.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.560]   It doesn't look as it's almost like you've seen the world and then someone closes a window
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.560]   on you.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:00.360]   All right, here's a challenge for the Mac Brainiacs.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.360]   How can I get a link on this machine over to that machine?
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.840]   Can I use air dropper?
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:11.520]   Or maybe a download on this machine and air drop it over there.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.520]   That's a good idea though.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.720]   Do you have to log into the same account, Leo?
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.760]   Because then you can just use iCloud, uh, iCloud, um, bookmarks.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.320]   I cloud, uh, I cloud, uh, I cloud.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.440]   Well, see, this isn't really logged into anything.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.040]   I don't want to spend a lot of time putting that in there.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.720]   Before or before you buy review, I'll get that downloaded on there.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.520]   So Renee, did you get one?
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.000]   No, Andy, you haven't played with it yet.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.800]   So you're not your eyes are not yet spoiled.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.800]   Uh, I did.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:40.800]   I did go.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.800]   I did go the Apple store to check one out.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.600]   Uh, so I have, I have laid eyes on it.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.240]   I don't have one in the office yet.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.240]   No.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.920]   And Alex, did you buy 50 for Pixelcore?
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.920]   Just two.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.920]   Oh, just two.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.560]   Yeah, we've got, uh, we, well, here's the worst part is that we got, well, it's a long
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.080]   story, but yeah, we have to come in anyway.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.080]   Have they come?
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.080]   Not yet.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.080]   Not yet.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.000]   We're, we're actually in a process of figuring out how to manage.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.880]   We had gotten two of the other ones, of course, right before they came out.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.880]   Oh, no.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.880]   Sort that out.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.520]   Yeah, she didn't mean.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.680]   And a whole bunch of Mac minis, of course, you know, it's not, you know, I finally gave
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.680]   up.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.280]   I just stretched it out as long as I could and then finally gave up and bought like eight
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.280]   of them.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.800]   And of course now I've got eight of the last generation.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.720]   You did get a new four core Mac mini.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.720]   So it's not.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.720]   It's not terrible.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.720]   Yeah, no.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:32.280]   And so I, and, um, we got a couple of Mac pros for project recently.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.960]   So I'm hoping that that doesn't, if that, if that updates as well, then I will.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.960]   I've completely missed the.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.960]   Oh, Alex has it occurred to you.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.320]   Have you seen has it occurred to you to buy four of these things and then towel them together
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.320]   to make a 20 K display.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.000]   Oh, I just did.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.840]   I think it just did.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.840]   Awesome.
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.840]   Yes.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.840]   Yes.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.840]   We should.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.240]   The problem is you with patching those together is the bezel.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.960]   It's just getting completely rid of that bezel.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.160]   And even a very small one, you notice.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.640]   I know it's too bad about the bezel actually.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.920]   I bet if you crowd the gap with money, that would work.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:12.480]   Well, when you could buy, you could build very specialized LCDs that just go down between
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.080]   the two vessels and you could, and then map it together and use a special, very expensive
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.320]   mapping software that would allow you to.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.360]   It's actually a pretty interesting process when you, um, as an aside with those LEDs,
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.520]   that LED walls, we just saw a bunch of them at Dreamforce and, you know, there's a whole
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.960]   bunch of one by one blocks.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.360]   And then they have to have a computer that figures out how many blocks by how many blocks.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.360]   Oh, interesting.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.440]   And they make these just massive screens and when, and when they first turn them on, they're
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.800]   all different, you know, so they're all, you know, all of them are different brightnesses
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.800]   and everything else.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.900]   And then they have, they have to go through there and, and, you know, sink all the little
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.120]   blocks up together to make them all look like one big screen.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.720]   Anyway, it's not a Mac break, but it's very interesting.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.280]   Anyway, I find it interesting.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.240]   Renee, our recommendation is wait by.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.880]   So it's one of those things where a lot of people have been waiting for retina on the desktop.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.400]   And if you're one of those people, it's like buying a Ferrari.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.200]   You've been, you've been saving your pennies and you've been expecting it for so long.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.520]   You're going to go out and do it.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:12.520]   If you are not a photographer, not a videographer, not someone who really depends on high density
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.480]   panel, then you can wait for the second generation.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.160]   You can get a, you know, a non-written IMAX and you'll be absolutely fine.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.520]   Right now it's a want to have not a need to have.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.040]   I want to have it.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.040]   I do.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.440]   I want to have it.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.440]   I want to have it.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.840]   I'm actually curious if Alex has taken a look at the new Mac, Mac Minis yet.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.240]   We're getting a couple of them.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.480]   So we're going to, I will, I will have more opinions about them.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.800]   I think that the only thing I saw in the stats was that they still are not doing, having
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.040]   a truly dedicated graphics processor.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.400]   So for a lot of the uses that we have, we're not sure if it's going to work.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.600]   So we're going to test it.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:50.960]   So, you know, we really need a real GPU in there, not some kind of souped up Intel.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.080]   And from what we looked at, we think the only way we can get those is still with the
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.800]   integrated, integrated Intel stuff.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.760]   And so what we find is when that happens, you're, you end up with, there's a lot of pressure
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.680]   being put on the, on the CPU.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.480]   And we're seeing frame rate issues specifically with video conferencing.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.000]   So, so that's what we were hoping to use it for.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.520]   But I think we may end up still using MacBook Pros and, and, and Mac Pros for a lot of that
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.520]   stuff.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.560]   It's just, you, you wouldn't need that much of a high end thing for video conferencing.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.720]   You know, it's, it's really for standard video conferencing.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.920]   I don't think it's a big deal at all.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.800]   What you're trying to get 720p 30 frames a second.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.800]   Really similar.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:33.200]   It, it turns out that it's harder than it would should, feels like it should be.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.480]   But we just noticed that we're still having frame rate issues.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.480]   So,
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.040]   Stephen, our chat room says, are you disappointed by the soldered on RAM?
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.040]   Well, not,
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.680]   Oh, we just max it out, right?
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.920]   We buy the max every single time we would never buy an eight meg computer.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.760]   Understand that Alex is not what we call an upgradeer.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.000]   He just wants it to work.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.760]   He doesn't want to have to make it work.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.720]   Well, cause a lot of times, I mean, you know, we do buy everything.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:03.440]   Almost everything is bought at, at almost the highest level.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.400]   Usually we, we skimp a couple of little places where we think we can get away with it.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.200]   Or where there's a big price jump.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.440]   But, but a lot of times we're buying everything almost at its max all the time.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.880]   And, but then we keep them forever.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.800]   I mean, we have computers that, you know, are five years old, six years old, that are
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.360]   still, you know, in production because they have enough to keep going.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.880]   Now they might be managing, you know, a file server or something, but we don't really,
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.480]   you know, get rid of them very often.
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.000]   We typically just run them into the ground.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.280]   And you don't break out the spudgers and open them up and put in more RAM.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.200]   No, no, we don't.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:36.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:41.200]   Cause as soon as we start digging into the computer, we have confidence issues in the
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:46.040]   long term viability because we're doing, well, I mean, a lot of times for us, it's, you
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.080]   know, if your computer isn't working for most people, it's just like, well, we'll
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.560]   take it to the shop or it'll be inconvenient.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.520]   We do live events.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.440]   So if the computer isn't working, it's a, it's a big deal.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.880]   So, you know, most of our machines, if they, if anything goes wrong with them, they go
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:02.600]   back to the shop or whatever, because we were afraid to put them into, into, into
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.880]   action after, after they've been tooled with it all.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.760]   Well, let's take a break.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.880]   We have a lot of Mac news.
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.640]   I just, I thought it'd be fun to kind of take a little, take a little look at this sucker.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.400]   And that's gorgeous.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:14.720]   Play with it.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:18.800]   And unfortunately you got to go to the Apple store and play with it to see it.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.600]   But be warned, it may set a standard that you now feel that I'm trying to actually
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.880]   stay out of the Apple store because I don't even want to walk by.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.640]   I think so.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.840]   I have to go like this until, until I actually have one, I just have to kind of walk by.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.200]   Walk by.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.080]   I rub off on you.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.520]   Oh, it's, it's a tangently.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:37.000]   Oh, but I, I've been reviewing the Mac, sorry, the iPad Air 2 and I ran the GFX
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   bench test, the Manhattan test, which tests open C, open EL, sorry, open GL ES 3 on it.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.440]   And on the previous generation, the A7 machines, I was getting nine frames per
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.760]   second and a lot of choppiness.
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:52.640]   I was getting 23.9 frames per second, totally smooth video on the new iPad.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.680]   It's just amazing what those chips are doing now.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:59.320]   Those everybody's saying all the benchmarks we're starting to see now are really a lot faster.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.640]   Triple course, CPU amazing GPU.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.880]   And yeah, and more RAM double the RAM to give the Rams.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.480]   Who gives you?
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:10.120]   I would almost, I would almost call it a suspiciously powerful upgrade as though they are.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.360]   I'm serious as though they know something that they're going to be doing in a few months.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:18.760]   It's going to require something that's not just a lot little faster, but it is just an
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.640]   entire generation faster.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:25.200]   I think that I think that this is Apple's indication that, yeah, you're going to give
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.120]   you side by side multitasking sometime before the life cycle of this device is over.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:30.640]   Hmm.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.200]   Interesting.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.200]   iOS is really low overhead, which is how they've gotten away with one gigabyte of
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.040]   RAM so long.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.360]   So if they're doubling the RAM there, there's going to be something that needs it.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.880]   That's more than just your basic.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.960]   And didn't we see code that imply that they would have something, some sort of multitasking
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.880]   feature that they just didn't deliver it in the eight?
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.000]   Yeah, Steve's taught Smith tweeted it.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.280]   He found it in the, uh, in the firmware bundle.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.920]   It had, I think, one third, one half and two third size.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.160]   Oh, that's how we know.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:53.600]   Okay.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.320]   Okay.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.000]   Well, let's take a break.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.400]   When we come back, Apple's 2014 annual report, I'd like you guys to give me the deep dive
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.400]   and the low down and the 30,000 foot version.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.680]   Can you work on that?
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.840]   Uh, big drop in music sales for iTunes confirmed now by Apple.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:15.240]   And, uh, Tim Cook explains why the classic is dead.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.760]   Pretty good reason as it turns out.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.440]   But first a word from our friends at Squarespace.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:34.800]   Oh, that is the place to make your next website, both the best hosting and the best content management system combined together, tightly integrated, give them, gives them capabilities that no other, uh, web host can offer you.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.480]   First of all, starts Squarespace starts with these incredible templates.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.800]   Squarespace seven templates just came out there.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.000]   All mobile responsive.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.160]   Nice thing about having them do the software and the hosting is they can spend and it's their business.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.920]   So they do all the time keeping up with web standards and let's face it fashions.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:57.040]   And so that your site, you don't want your site to look like it came from 1972.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.440]   Your site will always look modern and up today.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.920]   If you're a photographer, the full bleed templates on Squarespace are stunning.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.000]   Uh, just gorgeous.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.040]   Actually for anybody, that's kind of the new thing now is get lots of beautiful images.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.720]   Pick one of the 25 templates.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.040]   Actually, you can do this for free right now.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.040]   Go to squarespace.com, click the get started button.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.160]   Uh, you'll be able to play with all 25 templates.

[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.840]   content in from your existing site.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.920]   They have API support for most of the major blog platforms.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.080]   So you'll see them, you know, within a minutes, exactly what your site would look
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.840]   like on Squarespace, how responsive it would be.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.600]   Ask your colleagues, your clients to try it out.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.920]   They've got lots of great tools to their iPad apps.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.240]   For instance, the portfolio app for photographers pulls the images from your
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.760]   Squarespace site, which is already a portfolio, but it ranges it so it's perfect
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.160]   for displaying the clients and saying, you know, the bride and the groom, I
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.080]   guess the groom counts too.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.120]   But what here are the pictures from the wedding, you know, pick the ones you like,
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:58.720]   that kind of thing.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.120]   Their metric app lets you keep track of site stats like page views, unique
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.320]   visitors, social media followers.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.240]   They have a logo designer on their website.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.960]   If you're, you know, a small company and you, I mean, it just gets better and
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.280]   better.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.960]   And this is the amazing thing.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.400]   I tell you about all this stuff, e-commerce and every template.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.160]   So you can have a school fund drive, even at the lowest level nonprofits.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.200]   Take donations, cash, wedding registries.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.600]   The big time e-commerce has lots of great features, package, calculation,
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.520]   shipping tools, merchant accounts, all the stuff you need.

[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:36.600]   month.

[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:30.760]   Leo LePorte sitting here with our good buddies, the lovely and talented Andy
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:36.160]   Enochko from the Chicago Suntimes with his R2D2, his cube.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.280]   You're starting to pile stuff on the cube.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.520]   Is that going to be a tower?
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.680]   Oh, yeah, well, actually, it's every time that I have a need for like an old
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.680]   computer to like reference or photograph, I'll work in it here on this thing
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.760]   when I showed off it, then I just get out of the way here.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.240]   It's a pile.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:55.760]   And I'm getting sort of a jenga effect that I think is I'm starting to like.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.600]   We'll see how long it goes before.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:02.080]   If I come back one week and you see there's nothing piled on there, you'll
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:02.800]   know what happened.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.320]   I want you to drill a hole through the middle of it all and put the lamp
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:05.840]   through in there.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:11.160]   Just you'll know that I'm in the market for a Tierra Sadie Model 100 for an
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.160]   e-mate for a think pad and for a Newton message pad to only 100.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:15.640]   Right.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.160]   Right.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:16.640]   Right.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.080]   Also here in a Richie from iMore.com.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.920]   Great to have you and some great articles this week in iMore, which I will be
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.120]   referring to soon.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:30.720]   And from Pittsburgh PA in the Pixel Core, it's Mr. Alex.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.920]   You can see I've really gone with the less is more kind of.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.920]   Hi.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.640]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.960]   It's, you know, I just moved in.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.840]   I'm still working on it.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:43.320]   It's going to be nice pictures of Pittsburgh soon.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.920]   So drywall heavy.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:49.040]   Um, if you say, you know, yeah, I'm working on it.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.640]   You know, I got the bandwidth worked out.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.840]   So that's the first part.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.440]   And then I kind of got the camera thing worked out and a little bit of lightning.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:00.440]   You know what actually would help a lot there is maybe four or five, five
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.560]   camera iMacs.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.240]   Oh, I could just roll.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.800]   You wouldn't even see the scene right through here.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.160]   I just put one on each side.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.720]   Anything you want.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.560]   Oh, if you, if you got a lot of space, I want to encourage you to like do like
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:18.040]   the Murph Griffin Show set like 1976, you have a permanent set like shag
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.320]   carpeting in the back wall.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.480]   Oh, that would be nice.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:24.920]   And just the words Alex, Alex, Alex, Alex and light bulbs behind you.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.520]   And that's somewhere you'd want to live.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.520]   You really look awesome.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.440]   Yeah, I got to work on that.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.680]   I'm shag is I'm really caught in the shag carpet.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.200]   And they're good on the walls.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.560]   Nice.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:42.920]   So the chat room is telling me that Jaws is at recode right now, Greg
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:49.000]   Jaws, we act and says that the problem with 8.0.1 was not the code.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.560]   But the way it was distributed.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.160]   Tell me about that.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.120]   Yeah, we talked about that.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.840]   I think right after it happened, it was the Delta update for the iPhone
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.280]   six and six plus that caused the problem.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:05.080]   The actual binary itself was fine, but when the Delta file went out, that's
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:05.560]   what caused.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:05.880]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.560]   So if you had downloaded the full version and installed it, no problem.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.320]   It was just something in the process that generated the bit differential
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.480]   file that went wonky.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.400]   And that would explain that actually is good to know.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.040]   It explains how this could happen without anybody snowing.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:20.880]   It was going to happen.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.280]   Yeah, because they were all testing the full.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.160]   Internally, they run.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.920]   They they have a whole different way of installing iOS internally.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.040]   And then people who are testing the full binary, it's different.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.520]   And it should never have happened.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.760]   Absolutely should never have happened.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.280]   Next time they'll test it all.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.440]   They'll test the Delta stuff.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.760]   I've always said it's difficult.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.400]   It's really difficult to
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:47.480]   to test all the possible combinations out there.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.120]   And Delta made it even more complicated.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.440]   And it sounds like they know what's happened.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.400]   They've taken steps to make sure that won't happen again.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.440]   Today, Apple filed.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.560]   It's, you know, we had the quarterly results last week, the fourth quarter.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:03.280]   And but now the official fiscal year 2014 10 K is out.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.600]   That's their annual report.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:08.520]   It's some interesting details.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.800]   A lot more employees, 12,300 new employees
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:18.600]   to bring the total in 92,600 full time employees at Apple.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.880]   They'll cross a hundred thousand, probably this year, right?
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.720]   Although that includes retail, which is also significant.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.120]   Retail retail grew 3,400 of that total.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.440]   In fact, retail.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:37.280]   They didn't break out the retail at the at the quarterly call,
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.720]   but they did break it out in there for the annual report.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.440]   The store count increased 21.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:52.080]   Average revenue per store up slightly to 50.6 million dollars per store.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.880]   Nice neighborhood. Nice name.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.200]   Well, that means you had 21 storage.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.880]   You're adding a billion dollars or what is it?
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.960]   I don't know. I can't do the math.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.200]   A hundred million dollars.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.240]   No, a billion dollars.
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.120]   She's Louise to the revenue.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.440]   Apple's R&D is up.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.240]   And that's good because a lot of analysts said, oh, you know,
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:18.560]   Apple's not spending a typical percentage of its revenue or income
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.600]   or profit on R&D.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:25.760]   4.5 billion last year, 6 billion this year.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.720]   So that's it.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:27.680]   That should be encouraging.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.840]   It's the highest level relative to revenue since 2007.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.760]   And of course, you know what happened to 2007.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.000]   That was the year the iPhone.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.240]   So that's good, right?
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.200]   I mean, we want to see them investing in R&D and new stuff,
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.920]   not resting on their laurels.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:42.760]   I mean, focus.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.960]   I forget the graph that came out of me was horse didya who posted it,
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:46.960]   where it showed, you know,
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.000]   Kia and Microsoft and a lot of other companies are indeed budgets
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.560]   compared to Apple and Apple was still, you know, it wasn't that they weren't doing R&D
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.880]   is that they were focusing on.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.480]   They said no to a lot of products much earlier on the cycle than their competitors
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.640]   did, which saved them a lot of money.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.120]   That was it was a Simco that was the one who brought that up and said,
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.000]   this is worrisome.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.520]   Well, or us, you need not worry.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.960]   Real estate holdings increased.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:14.160]   They now lease 19.7 million square feet of building space
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.040]   and they're building a spaceship.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:22.320]   So most of that building space in the US, they're expanding their office space
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.040]   and customer support call center, which is in Austin, Texas.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:29.800]   And of course, the new campus, which will have 3.6 million square feet.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:39.480]   Capital expenditures will be going up to $13 billion in 2015, 11 and 2014 billion
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:44.040]   with a B, 600 million of that up towards retail.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.320]   Anything else?
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.080]   I too. Oh, well, then this is the bad news.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:54.640]   We had suspected that there was a drop in iTunes revenue.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:59.280]   Actually, the iTunes store itself, and this is not just music.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:05.280]   Remember, this is apps generated a total of $10.2 billion in net sales up from 9.3 last year.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:10.160]   But they did acknowledge that that was mostly from app sales and digital sales
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.720]   in decline, in fact, partly offset the growth in app sales.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:20.040]   Third party estimates of as much as 13% decline this year alone
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:24.040]   in iTunes music sales.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.920]   In iTunes, we should point out as the biggest retailer, Music.
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:33.240]   Right? So if iTunes is losing of single sales, yeah, not of streaming or...
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.160]   Right. Well, and that's what it's happening, right?
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.440]   Spotify, RDO, Beats, they're taking...
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.960]   And now the Beats acquisition makes a little more sense,
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.560]   because Apple has these metrics.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.080]   They know what's happening.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.800]   And they say, you know, crud or a word like that.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.440]   I think it's becoming clearer and clearer that they didn't buy in them for the headphones.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.040]   You know?
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.440]   No, they did not.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.160]   Although, what are they going to do with Beats?
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:01.000]   So some say they'll drop the Beats label in the name
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.040]   and incorporate it into iTunes, and that would be very appily.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.440]   But, Kali, if you buy Beats, don't you...
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.120]   Isn't it the name that's...?
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.320]   The headphones, the name is important.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.440]   I don't know if the name is important.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.400]   Streaming, streaming music.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.600]   Yeah, the streaming...
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.040]   I don't think they ever really took off.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.600]   So they have all the agreements in place,
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.400]   and I'm assuming that they can change the name and keep those agreements.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.360]   I think that's what Apple really...
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.560]   They want the agreements.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.000]   ...with not getting the agreements that they wanted.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.600]   So if they have those agreements in place,
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.640]   and they're able to move it,
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.440]   while Beats might not have been successful,
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.720]   obviously Apple has a lot of...
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:34.760]   wherewithal as far as pushing them forward is from that perspective.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.200]   So I think there's a lot of opportunity there for them.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.640]   I actually don't know if they mentioned Beats in there.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.880]   It's a creed of Leo.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.440]   It's a creed of...
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.240]   10K.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.200]   A creed of the idea.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.520]   Is that a person from Crete?
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:50.200]   No, I think Tim Hook said that their deal was a creed of actually made money
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.360]   when they bought the deal, when they bought Beats.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.840]   In July 2014, the big company acquired Beats Music.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:55.880]   I'm reading from the 10K,
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.800]   which offers a subscription music service,
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.240]   and that's all they say.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.440]   Let me see if they mention it again.
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.880]   Beats headphones, speakers, and audio software.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.440]   Ehhhhh...
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:12.360]   Company issued 5.1...
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:13.240]   Oh, this is interesting.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.920]   In connection with its acquisitions of Beats,
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.360]   the company issued 5.1 million shares of common stock
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.520]   to certain former equity holders of Beats.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.640]   So I thought it was a cash deal,
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.480]   but apparently there was some stock involved.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.360]   Company completed Beats and...
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:32.520]   Goodwill and other int...
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.760]   Under Goodwill and other intangible assets.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:36.680]   Beats Music.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.760]   There you go.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:46.920]   So one of the things that's coming down the pike that's may not make
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.520]   Beats as attractive as it was,
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:53.400]   first of all, Apple and others, Spotify, I think is doing this,
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.720]   and with the family plans,
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:59.880]   $5 a month now is going to be the new benchmark,
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.840]   right, for family plans.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.200]   That's what Spotify is going to charge.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.800]   Not 10.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.120]   So that cuts in half the revenue.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:11.080]   The other thing that's coming down the pike is there are two companies now
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:15.320]   that are promising to offer audio file quality streaming.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.560]   I don't know how important that'll be.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.960]   There's a big one internationally, it's DZR.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.720]   We don't have that in the States.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:22.760]   Do you have that in Canada?
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.080]   No, but they just bought somebody I'm...
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.680]   This is bought Stitcher.
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:27.560]   That's right.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.760]   Which is a podcast streaming outfit.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.440]   In fact, we're very big on Stitcher.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:36.520]   So I think that's probably good for us because it means
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.960]   if DZR does take off that you'll be listening to music,
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:44.680]   but you'll also be listening to text, to audio, speech.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:45.720]   What are we?
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:46.280]   We're speech.
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.880]   What is it we do?
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.960]   Podcasts in your stream.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:55.160]   DZR Elite is the one, and it's $15 a month.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.400]   Eventually it'll be $20.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.600]   But it's...
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:05.640]   Now, so it's streaming FLAC, 1644, CD quality FLAC.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:09.960]   And then there's another one that just announced
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:14.680]   with a name I'd never heard of that's going to do also,
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.760]   CD quality streaming.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.520]   The problem with CD quality streaming is those files
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:23.800]   are at least four times bigger than the MP3s or AAC files you've been getting,
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.120]   which means it will take four times longer to buffer.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.280]   So don't expect the music to start playing right away.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:37.320]   It's a, I think, a tricky business to want to be in right now.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.920]   The music was only people getting into it right now.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.560]   It was a lot better when they were really only just, you know,
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.160]   beta max and VHS.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.000]   Now that you've conceivedly this time next year,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   there could be four major players in the space,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.520]   and you really have to choose,
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.520]   and it's going to be, they're going to become more competitive
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.960]   about which catalogs that they get,
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.640]   and they're going to try to leverage one against the other.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.680]   It could be a big mess for users and about a year from now.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.920]   Well, it's a terrible thing for, as we said before, for musicians, right?
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.800]   Because, absolutely.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:07.080]   Well, I think it's a terrible thing.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:11.960]   In, as we look at the current number of people using it,
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.800]   I mean, if it really becomes totally ubiquitous,
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.880]   it's unclear as to whether it would be as terrible for the users,
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.840]   and there'd be a lot more money,
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.000]   there'd be the pot would be a lot bigger for them to share.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.080]   But I think that either way,
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.600]   I mean, I think that most people are,
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.000]   most of the artists that have really looked at the future
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.360]   are focusing on all the other things to make money from,
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.560]   live performances and so on and so forth.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.120]   So.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.800]   Here's another thing you can't get in Canada,
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.920]   it's called Tidal, and it's, sorry.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.160]   So many things, there's so many things.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.760]   Can you get Teslas though?
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.800]   You can get Teslas, right?
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.840]   Yeah, they just started.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.360]   So that's good.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:51.640]   Tidal launched in the US and UK, it is a CD loss list,
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:53.800]   it's also FLAC or ALAC, Apple loss list.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:57.480]   It's 44 kilohertz, 16-bit.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.640]   It's 20 bucks a month as well.
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.480]   So there's a couple of benchmarks,
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.920]   there's the family plans,
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:06.840]   which for Beats was $3 a month when AT&T was offering,
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.040]   which they aren't anymore,
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.560]   $5 for the family plan for Spotify,
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:16.200]   and then $20 if you want to lossless.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.560]   I think if you're, if you're,
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.480]   if you're an audio,
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.360]   if you care enough about audio to be a CD buyer,
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.280]   then this makes sense, it's two CDs or less.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.240]   It is, I think the big question is,
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.000]   how many people are out there that are interested in that?
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:29.880]   It's disgusting.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.400]   I think that, because you have to really look at,
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.840]   it may sound like a really good thing,
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.840]   but you got to make sure that your headphones are good enough,
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.080]   or your speakers are good enough to really be able to tell the difference,
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.800]   and I think that 99% at this point,
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.440]   there was a lot of us that were audio files back in the day,
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.400]   but I think at this point, 99.9% of the people that are
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.920]   consuming this would have a hard time hearing the difference.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:55.000]   Tim Cooktells recode why the iPod classic was killed,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.400]   and he says, what were the words he said?
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.680]   It was something like I'm not--
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.600]   Can't get the parts anywhere on the planet anymore.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.360]   Yeah, but he said, I'm not a hatchet man.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.360]   I don't go around saying, what can we kill today?
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.520]   He just couldn't get the parts.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.480]   A little miracle drive that--
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.600]   Is that that little drive?
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.160]   That was a spinning, that was like the IBM drive, right?
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.280]   The little spinning--
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.160]   Yeah, one--
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.600]   Toshiba bought it or made it.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.600]   Yeah, 160 gigs, right?
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.960]   It's a great little--
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.360]   It was a great-- I still have one running.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.960]   I bought one last year for my car,
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.880]   because I knew that eventually they'd kill it.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:33.400]   And I got one of those little skins for it,
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.680]   and it looks really cool,
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.760]   and it just depends on the cloud compartment.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.280]   Yeah, my wife has it hooked up to some kind of playback thing
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.640]   that she listens to, so that's--
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.440]   I didn't realize--
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.160]   Oh, wait a minute, no, this is the 13th--
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.840]   It says, short of its 13th birthday,
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.520]   it's the 13th anniversary of the iPod itself,
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.360]   not the classic, the original iPod.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.720]   Oh, the classic is probably the closest
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:55.640]   to the traditional iPod that they have left.
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.440]   Yeah, I still miss the mechanical wheel.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.680]   I wish I had lost mine with mechanical wheel.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.240]   I have one now.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.320]   Next time you come here, I'll give you my original
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.720]   thousand songs in your pocket,
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:09.240]   but it takes firewire to charge it.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:09.800]   I know.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.600]   Yep.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.600]   There's something about feeling that--
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.560]   Oh, you got one?
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:14.520]   You got one now.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.720]   Yeah, and the other one.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.200]   There you go.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.560]   See?
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.400]   Mr. Fainty Pants 5K Display Owner,
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.840]   you don't have this little marble, do you?
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:25.080]   Matter of fact, I'm going to put it on the Jenga pile right now.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.680]   Jenga.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.160]   Oh, and now that's a challenge.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:29.800]   Don't let it drop.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.520]   There you go.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.760]   Take a computer from the bottom and you put it on top.
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.960]   Because if that falls down, I got another one right here.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:36.440]   What?
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.520]   What the hell are you doing?
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:39.800]   What's you up to?
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.720]   I'm going through old boxes.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.280]   I'm trying to finally close down storage units
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.400]   that I've had for a couple of years to just get rid of things
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.440]   and realize that, well, perhaps if I actually spent a couple of days
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.480]   going through this, I wouldn't be spending $43 a month to just keep--
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.600]   I use one of my storage units,
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.720]   kind of like the MAC trash can where I can throw something away,
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.800]   but still pull it out later on.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.280]   I think it's time for me to empty trash and reclaim that $40.
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.080]   Time is in a gazelle.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:09.240]   And he's a millionaire now.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.120]   Yeah, he's a gazelle.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:10.760]   I'm rich.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.160]   I'm a millionaire in really, really old, timey phones.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:15.960]   What the hell?
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:16.920]   Oh my--
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.840]   What do you just have that all to hand?
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.200]   What do you got to box there, stuff?
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:26.680]   I literally do have a laundry hamper that I take to the storage unit
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:31.560]   of things that are worth cool enough that I really want to not throw them away.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.480]   And the things I do want to throw away will stay there.
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.680]   And at some point, I will call some nice men with a truck to say,
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.160]   "Yeah, unit number 117.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.320]   You're the keys. You take whatever you want.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.920]   Throughout the rest, here's a small check."
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.600]   You don't want to leave it for your kids, Andy.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.160]   I'm just saying.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:49.320]   I don't want-- if I ever have kids, I don't want them to--
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:56.920]   I don't ever want them to say, "I'm going to fight much harder over who has to clean out
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:01.160]   dead storage units than we did after who has to take care of dad when he becomes
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:02.360]   to be in a care room zone."
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.160]   Right.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:07.240]   You don't want your offspring cursing your name upon your death.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.400]   You find out who your friends are.
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.840]   I spent 10 years helping friends and family members move.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.560]   And then when I had to move, it was like, "Oh, good luck.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.920]   Let me buy a pizza for that."
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.200]   Have fun, Andy.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.160]   Pizza doesn't make it after 30, Andy.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:26.680]   I got to tell you, you got to pay in dollars.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:30.040]   It's like points programs on an airline.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.040]   You have to spend them earlier else to lose them.
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:32.600]   I didn't know that.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.720]   I didn't read the fine print when I helped them.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.840]   And I helped them carry a marble coffee table up a flight of stairs.
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.040]   Oh, we got one of them.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:44.760]   Hey, I've been seeing stories and maybe somebody can confirm this,
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.440]   that there actually is an NFC chip in the new iPads in the air.
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.560]   There are two.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:50.840]   Yes and no.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.720]   I mean, there is an NFC chip, but as far as we understand it,
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:57.400]   it's only used for the secure element for the credit card transactions.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:01.240]   And there's no NFC antenna, which means that that NFC is not going anywhere anytime soon.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:05.480]   So with some sort of unit that included the NFC and the secure element that they put in the
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.920]   iPhone, but if you didn't have the radio, what good is it?
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:09.400]   Right?
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:09.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.120]   I think that radio is part of the chipset for a long time.
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:12.840]   They just never used to.
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:13.240]   I see.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:13.960]   All right.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.000]   That's pretty bulky.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   You have to admit tapping an iPad would be really much, much bulkier than
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   but it would give you an opportunity to show off your brand new gold iPad air too.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:32.520]   I got a crowd actually today when I used the, I used, I went to Walgreens and Walgreens,
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.720]   by the way, I went to Walgreens.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.520]   Not CVS.
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.480]   Not CVS.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:35.960]   They're right.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:36.920]   You drove past.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:37.240]   Right.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:43.640]   I go past the CVS, a block and a half to blocks to Walgreens because I could use my Apple Pay.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:47.960]   And, and that was actually the first time I think that they'd seen it used.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.480]   And so it was like a little crowd.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.440]   The crowd.
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.080]   They were like, okay.
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.840]   I'll have to fill on the crowd.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:53.400]   Happed it.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.680]   As he pulled out his iPhone.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:55.560]   Yes.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.000]   And then it asked me for my pin.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:57.800]   Look, okay.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.680]   Oh, you had to have a pin?
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:59.560]   You didn't have the.
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:02.920]   And so if you connect it, it turns out that if you connect and I have to figure out,
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:07.640]   I mean, if you connect your, an ATM card, you tap it on there, then it asks you for it.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.320]   Oh, it's not nearly as impressive.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:10.200]   Well, you can hit credit.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.200]   You just hit credit and then it goes away.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:12.760]   It's quick.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.560]   It's quick.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.400]   And I, and if I hooked it to a regular credit card, I'm sure there's some way I could define it as well.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:17.880]   And.
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.280]   Yeah, you can.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.160]   You're going to have your defaults.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.400]   I set up my Apple wallet, but I still haven't used it.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.160]   No, it was great.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:27.080]   It was, it was, uh, like you expect it to be more complicated and then you click on it,
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.040]   you're like, oh, okay.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:28.600]   That's good.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:29.080]   Mr.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:30.520]   Not just that, but all.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:31.720]   Not just that, but all NFC.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.960]   I wrote a second piece about NFC yesterday.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:38.200]   I just went to a Panera to do it just because there's, you know, free refills and I was going to table
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.280]   and I've wrapped up my business at around five 30.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.560]   I was like, okay, it's time for dinner.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:46.280]   I should probably go home and heat up a can of, well, actually wouldn't it be fun to pay with NFC again?
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.480]   I think I'll have dinner here again.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.920]   So it does sell sell stuff.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.840]   So, so got, got an extra $5.50 out of me for a bowl of French onion soup.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:55.640]   Very tasty.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.280]   A bowl of French onion soup there, Panera.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.240]   It's like in our purchase.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:43:59.960]   It's just so easy.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:00.440]   You're like one.
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:00.760]   Right.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.840]   It's just it's almost like it's like one flick.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:03.400]   It is.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:08.120]   And I think that one of the things to remember is that is that not only is it easy, I mean,
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.600]   that that's kind of a, but it also shortens lines.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:13.960]   I mean, so if you think of more and more people using it in places like San Francisco,
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:17.880]   where you're really probably going to see a big impact on it is, you know, when you see those long
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:23.400]   lines in CVS or Rite Aid that aren't using it, you can remember that your line probably might
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:28.040]   eventually become shorter in places like Walgreens because people can just sit there and tap it
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:28.920]   quickly rather than possible.
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.960]   More would be great.
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.000]   It's also more accessible.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.400]   Steve Aquino did a great article about how it's so hard for someone with visual impairments or
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:39.320]   physical impairments to use a credit card to swipe it to enter a pin number.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.720]   Both Apple Pay, they just tap it and use the touch ID.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.080]   And now that's been taken away from them.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.240]   They can no longer, they had a brief couple days.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.440]   They could use those stores.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.320]   And now it's gone.
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:51.400]   Well, that's an interesting, that's a real, I mean, you could maybe sue under the NDA and
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.560]   say, look, you've reduced accessibility here.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:58.920]   Well, and what Walgreens should really think about is just to push the prep thing is they
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.000]   should build Apple Pay lines.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.800]   Oh, look how Ample sees that Apple Pay lines.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:06.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:07.800]   It's because it's like TSA-free.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.560]   It's not just that there's less people, but it's that it's so much faster.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.000]   It keeps the line through.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.760]   Yeah, not just that, but I think that Apple and Google should team together to co-promote
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:22.040]   NFC payments because they've got a window of several months before currency becomes
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.520]   an actual real thing to demonstrate to everybody.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:25.960]   Here's how easy our system works.
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:27.960]   And here's how much you can trust us with your information.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.520]   And here's the limits of liability.
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:34.400]   And so that have all those three points, how easy is this to use, how reliable is it, and
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.600]   how safe and secure is the information.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:40.120]   When that's everyone, everybody's mind when they think of paying for something with the
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.120]   phone.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:45.800]   And so the first time someone asks, oh, so there's no way that like this consortium of
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.640]   retailers can get access to information.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.520]   It's on my phone.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.520]   It's possible.
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:52.440]   It's in the, you agree to that.
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.040]   I agree to what?
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:55.040]   You agree to all of that?
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:58.480]   I agree to all of this sharing information with retailers and tracking your GPS.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.480]   It was fine.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:00.560]   It's going to work fine.
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.800]   Your health information, your social security number, your bank number.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.280]   Is it not just for, last four digits, somebody said this.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:10.280]   So currency, we did, Nick Arnott, our security editor did a great article on this.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:13.560]   But if you look in the agreement, they've got provisions for your health information.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.240]   They want your serial number, your bank information.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.120]   They want a lot of your personal data.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.280]   And you go to their website, it's appalling because it says you are secured with a four
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:24.360]   digit pin code and a QR code.
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:27.280]   And we don't store our information on a device where it's insecure.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.880]   We store it on our cloud where it's absolutely secure.
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:30.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:31.880]   Or anybody can get at it.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.920]   And he's spent about two minutes looking at, well, maybe not.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.520]   He did it live on Twitter, which was amazing.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.320]   He's spent about 30 minutes looking at it.
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:43.680]   And the amount of unprotected information coming off that app, the currency app, was
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.680]   absolutely appalling.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:48.280]   So let me give you the background on this story because I think some people are going,
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:49.440]   what's going on here?
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:53.560]   Of course, Apple, I think you all know Apple announced Apple Pay and released it a week
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:57.240]   ago with the 8.1 update.
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:02.840]   And you can use it and your iPhone 6, 6 Plus, actually 5S, right?
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:10.320]   No, because you have to have an all C, 6 and 6 Plus to pay at tap and pay terminals in
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.080]   many stores.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:19.520]   CVS and Rite Aid are two drug stores in the United States that had this tap and pay worked
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:23.120]   with Apple Pay, even though to advertise it just worked because it's a standard.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.840]   As well as Google Wallet.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:31.240]   And like sometime last week, turned it off entirely.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:37.120]   They said, well, we're not going to do it anymore because we're contractually obligated
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:43.920]   to support current C, which is a part of something called MCX.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:50.520]   Turns out this MCX was created by Walmart and has a couple of dozen companies, big ones,
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:54.520]   two names you would know as signatories.
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:48:00.240]   And the idea of this is that Walmart and these other companies did not want to give a piece
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.920]   of the action of the credit card companies.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.240]   That was what it was really about originally.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.920]   We don't want to give MasterCard and Visa a few percent.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.920]   So it doesn't take credit cards.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:14.320]   It takes debit cards or prepaid cards from the store.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.680]   It doesn't work very well.
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.160]   You can download it now on iOS in order to use it when it's not even out yet.
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.200]   It won't be out till next year.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:26.720]   When it's out at Rite Aid and CVS and these other stores, you'll have to have the app
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.960]   on your, is it one app currency?
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:29.960]   It is.
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:30.960]   It's not per store.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.600]   One app for iOS, one app for Android.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:33.600]   And exactly.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.600]   Let me go.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.840]   Let me finish the description.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.720]   So you'll launch currency on your phone.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.800]   The terminal will not, there's no tapping.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:48.120]   The terminal will show a QR code, which you then have to scan with your phone.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:52.160]   And then do you enter a PIN at that point?
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.200]   Did Nick explain how that, I don't know what this is.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.480]   It's invitation only right now.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.840]   So it's hard to tell exactly how it's going to work.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:02.320]   But somehow, probably what will happen is the phone has to be online.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:08.200]   It will then signal via the internet to the currency servers.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.040]   Okay, here's a transaction.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.480]   This is the transaction idea I got from the terminal.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.480]   I approve it and it'll go through.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:18.760]   But as you point out in that process, no credit cards were used.
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.240]   But all of your information was handed over.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.520]   It's pretty much a loyalty card system, right?
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.520]   That's, I mean.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.160]   And they're pulling your device ID.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:31.080]   They're inserting a unique identifier that persists over multiple install installs.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.360]   They're trying to get your MAC address.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:36.600]   I mean, it's just, it's not, it's the C stands for creepy as far as I can tell.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:41.840]   It's a non-starter, I think for anybody who's paying attention.
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:45.360]   And I think that Apple can, Apple has a real opportunity to make sure that people are paying
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.360]   attention.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.240]   I think that both Apple and Google, exactly what Andy was underlined, have the opportunity
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.720]   to really talk about who are you going.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.640]   And I think Apple has a better case probably than Google in a lot of ways that, you know,
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.480]   we're not, we're not in the business of selling your information.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.800]   Like we're in the business of selling you hardware.
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:03.120]   We're here to make a service that, you know, obviously makes it as easy as possible for
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.120]   you to do what you want to do.
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.120]   Alex, I don't think that's true.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:10.760]   Walmart says that they have the consumer's interests, best interests in mind.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:11.760]   Of course.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.760]   That's what they say.
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.760]   It says it right here.
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:17.680]   I think there's a, the one thing that, the one thing that Apple, I think does, you know,
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.680]   have to think about.
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:22.680]   And I think there's an opportunity there is to have their partners eventually be able
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:28.560]   to say if, if I'm a consumer and I want to, if I choose to add a, you know, a loyalty
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:33.680]   program on top of my Apple Pay for Starbucks or for whatever so that I get my free, whatever
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:38.600]   every 10, whatever, if I choose to add that piece by piece, I think that that could make
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.320]   a lot of sense and that could dull a lot of the arguments on these, on these cases.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.480]   I mean, their argument is they don't want to go up control.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.240]   They want to, you know, they definitely don't want Apple to have control of that, of that
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.560]   process.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:50.160]   So I think that that's not going to help them.
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:55.680]   But I think that there are opportunities for retailers to, there are valid opportunities
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.640]   that you can't do right now with Apple Pay that they're talking about, which is being
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:03.520]   able to extend, you know, loyalty benefits and, you know, that a lot of companies, you
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.640]   know, and a lot of people like to take advantage of.
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:09.080]   And so I think that's not in Apple Pay, but it definitely could be added.
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.760]   Here's what Walmart's statement is.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:14.960]   They sent a statement to Business Insider.
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:19.600]   There are certainly a lot of compelling technologies being developed, which is great for the mobile
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.960]   commerce industry as a whole.
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:28.200]   Ultimately, what matters is that consumers have a payment option that is widely accepted,
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:32.720]   secure, and developed with their best interests in mind.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:37.360]   MCX, that's the merchant's exchange that Walmart created using currency.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:43.440]   MCX member merchants already collectively serve a majority of Americans every day.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:48.560]   MCX's members believe merchants are in the best position to provide a mobile solution
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:55.360]   because of their deep insights into their customers' shopping and buying experiences.
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:58.720]   Yeah, we know more about you than Apple does.
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.600]   So use our system.
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:02.360]   Their words are not matching their actions.
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:05.440]   And to your earlier point, Leo, they didn't just disable Apple Pay Google Wallet.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.440]   They turned off NFC.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:10.800]   It's like going to Starbucks and them not wanting you to buy Starbucks, Starbucks cards
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:11.800]   online.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:16.440]   So turning off Wi-Fi is just it's an entire technology they've banned.
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:20.760]   And maybe this was a more revealing statement from former Walmart CEO, Lee Scott, when he
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:25.360]   was asked by an analyst why MCX could succeed.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:29.280]   The former Walmart CEO said, "I don't know that it will and I don't care as long as
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:31.280]   Visa suffers."
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:36.560]   So, okay, I could tell you right now, it's not going to succeed.
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.120]   I think nobody wants this.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:41.880]   Well, yeah, for any of these, if they really think that they have a superior product that
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:46.520]   their consumers would prefer, just let them both play and let them know.
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:49.880]   But the bottom line is that people aren't going to want to give them that information.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:50.880]   A lot of them aren't.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:57.360]   Definitely, iPhone users are probably going to be more likely to be disinterested in that
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.360]   process.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:03.720]   But, Gary, if you go to the MCX site, MCX.com, the retailers, the companies that are involved
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:09.720]   in this, I mean, Shell, it's Walmart, it's Best Buy, it's Kmart, I'm sorry, it's what
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:18.160]   is, yeah, Kmart, Kohl's, Lowe's, Sears, it is some of the biggest retailers.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.160]   Shell.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:27.720]   The rumor is as they signed on, the rumor that I've heard is that there's a three year exclusivity.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:30.680]   And some of them may have signed on within the last year.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:32.640]   So the ones that have, and there's some kind of-
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.840]   Where are they, sorry.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.040]   It hasn't even launched yet.
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:39.720]   In the first year, there seems to be some kind of, there's a rumor that there's a clause
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.840]   that lets them get out of it in the first year.
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:44.680]   So for the ones that just signed in, they may choose to peel out.
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:49.480]   For the ones that signed in, you know, a ways back, they may be having theirs come up in
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.480]   the next year or two and so.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.040]   Do you think consumers are savvy?
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:56.680]   I mean, look, everybody on this panel and everybody probably watches this show, it listens
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.800]   to it is savvy enough to know the difference.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:02.120]   But do you think the average Joe going into CVS?
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:05.000]   I think the average Joe going to CVS isn't going to use this anyway.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.480]   I mean, they're just cash-
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.960]   You're going to buy ATM card.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:08.960]   Those aren't going away.
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:10.960]   They're people that are Leo's.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:15.840]   The target is on the list there for currency, but they're actually using Apple Pay on the
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.840]   online app.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:19.860]   So where they're not prohibited by doing it for their contract, they are deploying Apple
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:20.860]   Pay.
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:21.860]   Yeah.
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:26.820]   This is probably a case of these guys misjudging the market.
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:30.140]   It has been, you know, it's been a couple of years.
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:31.740]   Nobody knew Apple Pay was going to have.
[00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:33.500]   What a dumb deal to sign that also.
[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:38.020]   But also, yeah, I mean, as I wrote in a column this morning, it's like they've forgotten
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:42.720]   that almost every time an industry has just tried to burn down and remake a consumer
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:47.300]   experience in a shape that was most convenient for retailers, it's always failed.
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:52.280]   I had to think about Sony's first cut at selling digital music where they built this
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:57.540]   horrendous format and this horrendous app that if you bought a Sony digital music player
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:00.720]   and you installed the software to make it work, the first thing it would do is scan your
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:05.940]   entire hard drive and look for music files, convert them all into a locked up DRM format.
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:10.100]   Even stuff you'd recorded yourself, even stuff you'd ripped yourself, it would not let you
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:14.300]   have a copy working on your computer and on the mobile device until you signed it in,
[00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:15.300]   signed it out.
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:16.460]   You couldn't share it with anybody.
[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:19.220]   If the app screwed up, that was your fault.
[00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:20.900]   You couldn't get access to anything.
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.500]   And Sony figured that, well, what are you going to do?
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:25.020]   You're going to have to buy another copy of this if you want a copy of this for your
[00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:28.980]   car and people responded by saying, actually, we could just steal music using these tools
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:30.700]   that are very easy to use.
[00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:33.340]   And there are so many other cases exactly like that.
[00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:36.900]   Every time they say, this is an opportunity for us to build a new payment system so that
[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:41.140]   it's completely in our favor and the customer is never doing anything that is inconvenient
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:43.300]   for us, the retailer, they will be right in our hands.
[00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:46.940]   We will get as much information about the consumer experience as possible and always
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:51.060]   be make sure as soon every moment that phone is in their pockets and turned on, it's an
[00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:54.140]   opportunity for us to sell, sell, sell, sell, sell.
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:58.860]   And what happens is that you create a retail experience that is bad, bad, bad, bad, bad,
[00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:00.060]   and people don't use it.
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:03.860]   So that's why this is such a great opportunity for Google and Apple to say all you do is you
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:05.940]   tap the phone and it works.
[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:11.540]   And you will not, you will not, after, if your car breaks down and you use this system
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:17.420]   to pay for a tow, you will not get an offer to buy new shoes and a hotel room, someplace
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:19.780]   else, it will not be sharing your information with other people.
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:24.380]   And you will not be telling, hey, I know, so you've got, you know, 13 other people who
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:26.180]   have eaten in Applebee's in the past three weeks.
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:29.020]   So I'm going to add something to your calendar to tell you that maybe you should meet at
[00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:30.020]   Applebee's next time.
[00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:31.020]   We'll give you 10% do horrible.
[00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:37.140]   I think the people who have NFC and under, if set wall, it's up are pretty sophisticated.
[00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:38.140]   They're not your average.
[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:42.540]   But I'm saying that real, but one of the things is that we, generations are getting older
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:47.580]   and the people who are most, most app to be attracted to the system and be most savvy
[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:51.380]   about it are the people who are now getting real jobs with the six figure incomes.
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:55.220]   And the people who don't, who would never, like as Alex says, would not be inclined to
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:57.700]   use a phone to pay for anything to begin with.
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:02.500]   They don't matter in terms of this transaction, but all the people that are realizing that
[00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:05.300]   it's much easier to, and that's more secure to pay for something with a phone are going
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:08.100]   to gravitate towards the ones that are the easiest to use.
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:09.100]   Yeah.
[00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:11.660]   And I think that I think that a lot of, with a lot of these folks, you have to look at
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:12.660]   a commoditized market.
[00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:17.860]   I mean, you know, drugstore, I don't really, I used to up until recently, very recently,
[00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:19.620]   I used to just search for drugstore.
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:23.020]   Now I search for Walgreens just because it makes me angry that they won't let me do.
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:25.340]   There is going to be a little bit of a backlash, yeah.
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:29.180]   But the thing is that I don't, the bottom line is, is that my shaving cream is at all
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:31.620]   of those locations at roughly the same price.
[00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:34.260]   So if I'm going to, if I'm going to start to choose, and you look at like, for instance,
[00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:38.020]   ARCO is a good example of a gas station that I won't go to, not because they have better
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:42.780]   worse or better gas, but because the purchasing process is so painful at an ARCO station,
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:43.780]   I won't go.
[00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:45.180]   And this has nothing to do with NFC.
[00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:49.420]   But if, you know, Chevron, which I think Chevron is one of the ones that's supporting
[00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:54.180]   Apple Pay, I believe, but you know, I'm going to start aiming at those ones because, you
[00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:55.580]   know, I would not go to Shell.
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:56.580]   I would go to Chevron.
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:58:00.180]   I mean, as long as it's relatively convenient to go to either.
[00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:02.180]   So the one thing I'm going to throw in front of a gas.
[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:05.180]   That's either.
[00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:08.820]   I can't tell you how many places where there's a Walgreens right across the street from a
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:12.460]   Sea of the S where there's a Burger King right across the street from McDonald's and gas
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:14.100]   stations tend to congregate in each other.
[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:15.700]   I'm not waving the red flying revolution.
[00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:17.940]   It's like, I'm striking a blow for consumer freedom.
[00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:22.100]   It's like, oh, if I actually drive another 20 yards down the road, I can have a much more
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:23.100]   easy much experience.
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:24.580]   I'm going to be much more comfortable with.
[00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:26.180]   I mean, as we'll drive another 20 yards.
[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:30.300]   I do that today because all of our in Canada, all our credit cards and interact bank cards
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:32.060]   have NFC already.
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:34.580]   I pay for I go to the places that I know take NFC.
[00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:38.740]   That's what horrified me about them turning off NFC because I don't need Apple pay.
[00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:41.540]   I could go to any of those locations and pay with my credit card today.
[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:43.060]   And now I can no longer do that.
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:45.700]   They've taken functionality and ease of payment away from me.
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:48.940]   They've made the buying process worse for me as a consumer.
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:51.300]   And their contract says that they can't use other mobile apps.
[00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:54.660]   My credit card is not another mobile app and they've turned that off as well.
[00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:58.420]   And that I think is really you can't even swipe and sign.
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:01.620]   Well, I can swipe and sign, but my credit card is set up to do NFC transactions.
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:03.620]   And now I have to go and swipe and sign like a monster.
[00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:06.260]   Like an American for crying out loud.
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:09.940]   But I mean, they are taking away a secure process for me that is easier, more efficient,
[00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:14.780]   that is better in almost every single way, just to stop one small app transaction that
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:17.220]   they agreed to, which I think makes it more egregious.
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:24.580]   Well, get ready because Apple pay is looks like may go to China as well.
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:27.060]   Tim Cook went to China, the CEO of Apple.
[00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:31.580]   We thought it was originally because the great firewall of China was intercepting iCloud
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:36.380]   logins and apparently storing those credentials for later use.
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:40.380]   But and then surprisingly, Tim Cook showed up at China the next day meeting with Vice
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:42.380]   Premier Ma Kai.
[00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:48.380]   But they had not only talked about telecommunications, it seems like they talked a lot about Apple's
[00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:50.140]   future in China.
[00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:54.700]   Remember, we, Andy, you were here when we were watching the iPad event and Tim Cook spent
[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:59.300]   at least five minutes in front of a giant China flag.
[00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:02.340]   There's clearly an important business partner for China.
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:08.300]   Apparently, they're in talks with Alibaba, which is the big, you know, the Amazon of
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.660]   China.
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:13.660]   They have a payment system called Ali Pay in China.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:18.060]   And they're apparently in talks with Apple to bring Apple Pay to China through Ali Pay.
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:21.380]   There's Jack Ma, the CEO of Alibaba.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:25.820]   He says, and this was at, I think, the recode mobile conference.
[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:29.260]   He's very interested in a possible Apple partnership.
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:32.460]   He's no fool, smart guy.
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:36.620]   So Apple, you know, momentum, the big mo is in Apple's favor.
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.980]   Well, you sign up a million people in 72 hours.
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:41.460]   Well, they got that's what they said, right?
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.380]   A million credit cards for three days.
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:47.180]   And even without Walmart and Target, they have 60% I think of retailers covered just
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:50.780]   using existing NFC implementations because it's a standard.
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:51.780]   Awesome.
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:52.780]   Yeah.
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:56.700]   And I think that especially, you know, for the large retailers like Walmart, they can
[01:00:56.700 --> 01:01:00.100]   make a lot of decisions and they can push to their own user base.
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:05.420]   But if you're a smaller retailer, if you're a, you know, hotel, if you're, you know, other
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:08.740]   things, there's a lot of advantage for you to pick the one, you know, obviously, you
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:12.340]   know, currency is really aimed at the big retailers, but there's a lot of smaller businesses
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:16.420]   that would be better would really benefit from saying, hey, you know, have the little
[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:18.860]   sign outside that says we take Apple Pay.
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:22.620]   You know, I think it's going to be advantageous to a lot of small retailers as well.
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:26.340]   I just, parenthetically, I did download was able to download timescapes.
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:27.340]   This is not a 4K.
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:34.340]   This is 1660, which is kind of a weird format, but it was designed for the Macbook retina.
[01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:37.180]   And dang, that looks good.
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:39.460]   It's very immersive on the 5K display.
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.380]   I can only imagine what the 4K would look like.
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:44.180]   It's just the retina MacBook Pro isn't pixel double.
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:46.020]   Like they, they couldn't get to pixel double on it.
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.780]   So it's pixel double internally and then scaled down to fit the display.
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:50.100]   Oh, interesting.
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:51.260]   This one is actually pixel double.
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:55.820]   So that we should emphasize that high DPI, that whole thing, the way it works is it will
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:59.540]   make on text, you know, it'll use 4 pixels per point.
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:03.020]   But whenever you're in a photo or a movie that actually has that kind of resolution,
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:05.140]   it'll display natively one to one.
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.140]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:08.420]   I don't know what this is doing because it's filling the screen.
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.580]   So I don't know what quick time is doing with this must be scaling it.
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:12.580]   Yeah.
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:13.580]   Look at all those blown pixels.
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:14.580]   That's disappointing.
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:15.580]   What?
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:16.580]   Are you joking?
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:17.580]   I'm trying to make you feel bad about that.
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:18.580]   Oh, that's stars, man.
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:19.580]   That's stars.
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.580]   It's full of stars.
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:22.580]   Sorry.
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:24.380]   I'm watching this on a crappy display.
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:25.380]   I know.
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:26.860]   But it's better for you.
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.580]   I'm telling you, you don't- Like an American.
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:29.580]   Like an American.
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.540]   You don't want to know how good this is.
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:32.940]   You don't want to.
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:35.060]   Not because it's easy, but because it's hard.
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:41.540]   For Tim Cook revelations, they asked about, I guess Tim was at Wall Street Journal's D
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:42.540]   conference.
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:45.060]   It's very confusing now.
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:47.820]   The D is now not the D conference.
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:49.940]   It's reco- Anyway, they both-
[01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:52.060]   Well, then no state journal don't live in the same house anymore.
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.060]   There are more.
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:54.060]   Walt has moved out.
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:57.380]   He's spread his wings and flown.
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:03:03.060]   Tim asked about the Apple Watch, said, "Well, it's hard to say how much battery life it's
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:07.740]   going to get because everybody uses it differently."
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.300]   He's still hedging his bets a little bit.
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:13.300]   He implied that you would- He said, "We expect people will charge it nightly."
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:17.020]   I don't know what that really means.
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.740]   Isn't really an answer to the question.
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:20.820]   That mean twice a day?
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:23.300]   I mean, yeah, we'll do it at night.
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:28.060]   That is at least the bare minimum of what you can expect from a wearable.
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:33.780]   As long as the manufacturer is not expecting you to carry a charger or find an outlet sometime
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:38.020]   around 10 PM, and so long as they're also cognizant of the fact that a lot of people
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:42.460]   get dressed and leave for work at 6.30 in the morning and maybe have dinner after work
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:47.980]   and don't come back until 10.30 or 11, that's okay.
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:51.460]   This has not been off my wrist since I first put it on about a month ago.
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:54.340]   You're just in the habit of you take it off, you put it on the nightstand.
[01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:57.900]   It's just that the nightstand is also a wireless charger, and when you pick it up, it's charged
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:58.900]   up again.
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:03:59.900]   I don't mind that.
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:00.900]   It's not a pain point.
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:03.860]   You know, people watch people go, "Here we go, two weeks," or whatever.
[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:19.780]   But you wear- J
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:20.780]   You charge it every night.
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:21.780]   You're sleeping.
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:22.780]   Come on, just charge it while you sleep.
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:23.780]   Charge it when you sleep.
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:27.020]   The whole video is like, "Doto are making some beautiful charging stands ready for the
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:28.020]   Apple Watch."
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:29.020]   Really?
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:30.020]   Are you offering them already?
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:31.020]   Yeah.
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:32.020]   Is it wireless charging?
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:33.020]   No, or is it a POCA pin?
[01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:34.020]   Yes.
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:35.020]   It does have wireless charging.
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:36.900]   Yeah, it's a MagSafe wireless combination, so it magnetically attaches and then it charges
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:37.900]   in the document.
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:44.180]   Yeah, you kind of, even with Qi charging, you kind of want it to into place because positioning
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:45.180]   is so important.
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:46.180]   I disagree.
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:52.180]   I think what makes the Moto 360's charging stand work is that it is as close to the experience
[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:55.620]   of simply taking off my watch and putting it on the nightstand as possible.
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:59.820]   I don't have to reach over to the nightstand, get out of cable, make sure that MagSafe connects
[01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:03.140]   to it, then take it with this cable and put it right back on the thing to make sure the
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:06.900]   cable, kind of the charger doesn't pull the watch off the nightstand.
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:11.660]   It is just the simple little plastic little cup that just holds the thing.
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:14.020]   And so I don't know- It also turns it into a little-
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:15.020]   Right.
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:18.220]   What's incentive is that it turns it into a great bedside clock.
[01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.100]   So you have even more reason to charge it every single night because you want your clock
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:22.100]   there while you sleep.
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:26.100]   So, I mean, I think that a charging stand is going to be, if even it has to be third party,
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:32.220]   it's going to be highly desirable because you have this thing flat staring up at the ceiling
[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:33.300]   attached to a cable.
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:37.420]   It's not as, if this is truly a beautiful watch, a beautiful thing, you want, you know, maybe
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:42.340]   in the, when you wake up at, you know, 231 in the morning because you fell asleep while
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:45.820]   watching Letterman, you want to, you know, find out what time it is before you feel that.
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:47.620]   Oh my God, I got to go back to work now.
[01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.220]   Hate it when that happens.
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:50.220]   It's a disadvantage.
[01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:53.180]   I have not heard anything specifically about the role of the magnet.
[01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:57.060]   Is the magnet just to line it up or is the presence of the magnet signify that it is
[01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:58.140]   time to go charging?
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:03.700]   Could they do, could they do a molded in holder that just simply byverts the fact you've
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:08.180]   dropped it into this, lines up the right wireless charging connectors to make it work?
[01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:09.180]   Sure, they can do that.
[01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:10.180]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:13.780]   As far as I remember them saying, it was just for alignment purposes, the magnet.
[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:14.780]   Yeah, that's my understanding.
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:16.580]   I think we'll have to wait until it's torn down to.
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:17.580]   Yeah.
[01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:22.220]   So I'm sure that there will be a Moto 360 style thing that you just drop your watch into.
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:23.220]   That would be ideal.
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:26.980]   There's only so many people who are going to pick this largely because of how beautiful
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:30.300]   the styling is that they're not going to, they're not going to be willing to accept,
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:34.340]   hey, look, I just clicked a wire to the back of this and threw it on my nightstand.
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:38.980]   They're going to want just just like at the turn of this, just like for antique stories,
[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:43.700]   you can find like pocket watch stands from like the 1800s and 1900s where it turns into
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:47.780]   a beautiful desk clock or mantle clock when you're not like carrying it around.
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:53.260]   So I think if you know how to sculpt a really nice cherub or something or from a 3D printer,
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:07:00.260]   I think that you're going to want to start working on your 3D printed Apple watch nightstand
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:02.540]   for it.
[01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:04.420]   All right.
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:12.180]   I'm mad. AT&T. Thank you very much has decided to thwart the very elegant and beautiful plan
[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:17.700]   Apple had when you buy an iPad that has LTE built into it.
[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:22.340]   The SIM is not if that's in the comes with it is not dedicated to any carrier and you
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:27.140]   can on the screen sign up with AT&T T mobile or Sprint.
[01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:32.140]   Verizon's not participating and use their service and the way Apple I think intended it and
[01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:36.220]   the way it works at T mobile and so far at Sprint is next month.
[01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:39.340]   You can change carrier in the month after that AT&T.
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:44.020]   In fact, they actually announced it on the screen, which is good, I guess, locks it to
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:46.980]   AT&T the minute you sign up for AT&T service.
[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.500]   Now of course you could get a new SIM from Apple.
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:52.020]   How much is a new SIM cost?
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:53.020]   Apple usually just gives them T.
[01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:54.020]   Yeah, it shouldn't cost anything.
[01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:57.620]   Because they keep on talking about everything I've read says if you purchase a new one,
[01:07:57.620 --> 01:08:00.660]   I'm like, how much I didn't know that they were selling them.
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:01.660]   Yeah.
[01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:05.260]   I figured this out too because I'm interested to see how they managed to isolate the carrier
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:07.780]   lock to the SIM and not the device.
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:12.100]   The very fact that there is a dialogue box that pops up that says we're now going to
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:15.420]   lock this tells me Apple planned for this, right?
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:19.220]   It also, it's almost like battery shaming.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:24.620]   If there's no bigger way to make AT&T look like a bunch of jerks, then oh, AT&T, well
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:28.860]   you do realize that unlike with Sprint and T mobile, you will not be able to change back.
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:32.220]   For arbitrary reasons, I have nothing to do with anything that Apple has put into the
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:34.140]   limitations of this product.
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:40.100]   John Ledger, the CEO of T-Mobile had a lot of fun with this, of course, because T-Mobile
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:43.060]   does not lock it down.
[01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:45.940]   And I think he went on a 20 tweet spree.
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:46.940]   Amazing.
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:50.700]   But it's just marketing.
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:51.900]   You're going to have to get a new SIM.
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:53.580]   At least you can put a new SIM in there.
[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:55.020]   It's not a big deal.
[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:58.620]   Next time you're at an Apple Store, get three or four.
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:08:59.620]   It's just annoying.
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:00.620]   It's one more annoyance in a life.
[01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:01.620]   It's AT&T.
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.620]   No one left.
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:04.780]   It's like, guys, you don't, you know, what's clear?
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:06.380]   They don't care what we think.
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:07.380]   It doesn't matter.
[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:08.380]   Right.
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:11.940]   And I think this also relates back to the whole Apple Pay thing is just that, you know, it's
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:17.340]   just these are, they're thinking about what they're, what they want and not what the consumer
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:18.340]   wants at all.
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:20.780]   It's a very clear message that yes, you don't matter.
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:22.060]   As a customer, you matters.
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:25.660]   You're secondary to profit.
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:26.660]   And that's sad.
[01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:30.740]   Some people in the chat room are saying $5, but it might vary depending on whether they
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:32.300]   want to be nice to you at an individual store.
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:34.300]   The genius has been much to you.
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:37.820]   So that means if you're traveling, you go overseas, you now can't because you're locked
[01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:38.820]   to AT&T.
[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:39.820]   Right.
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:42.220]   So before you go overseas, well, it's right as of now.
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:43.220]   It's only in the UK.
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.220]   It's EE.
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:48.140]   But I presume other carriers will line up.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:53.020]   But yeah, if you go to London with your iPad, you have to get another sim before you go.
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:54.460]   They shouldn't fear you leaving them.
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:58.860]   They should want you to look at it as an opportunity to bring you to them because they're so awesome.
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:07.140]   Keep them by being customer centric, not by locking them, not with a chastity belt.
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:11.020]   And I have to admit that I, you know, my new iPhone, I finally got it.
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:12.020]   I was way behind you guys.
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:13.020]   Good.
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:14.020]   I got the iPhone.
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.020]   I liked the big one.
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:16.020]   It took me a little while to like it.
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:18.020]   It was kind of a hated for the first week.
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.380]   You were supposed to see what you wanted?
[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:24.940]   No, I just, I've been looking at other people's six and I got the six plus and I, and I have
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:27.260]   to admit that I spent the first week and a half going, this was the dumbest thing I've
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:28.260]   ever done.
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:29.260]   This is way too big.
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:30.260]   I can't believe this.
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:31.740]   And then now I keep on going.
[01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:34.700]   But I now picked up somebody else's six and I was like, oh, this is really small.
[01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:35.700]   I don't really know what to do with it.
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:36.700]   I pick up the five S.
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:37.700]   I like it's unbelievable.
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:38.700]   Yeah.
[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:39.700]   Yeah.
[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:42.740]   So yeah, so the regular one, yeah, the five S is like, yeah, I don't even know.
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:45.380]   It's not even, I'm like, oh, am I supposed to look at this so small?
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:47.060]   I need any bifocals.
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:52.940]   But the, but what I've noticed is, so I got T mobile specifically because of Wi-Fi calling
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:55.820]   and I just wanted it unlocked.
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:11:01.220]   And the problem is, of course, T-Mobile's coverage, at least where I am, a lot of the
[01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:03.820]   time doesn't seem to be as good and where it is good.
[01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:06.060]   It's great because no, not a lot of people.
[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:07.060]   No one else.
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:08.060]   Yeah.
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:11.660]   But the good match, what I have found is to be a good match is the, is you get a Verizon
[01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:17.900]   Wi-Fi with the XLTE and then you have your phone, your T-Mobile phone.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:19.340]   The T-Mobile generally works pretty well.
[01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:23.180]   But if you need any kind of match up, those work really well together just in case you're
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:24.180]   wondering.
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.420]   So Verizon's not participating, but in some ways you can have them participate just by
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:27.420]   having them.
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:31.980]   I think the FCC mandate that could not lock their SIM slot on the Verizon iPhone.
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:34.260]   So that's what I, that's what I have for my iPhone 6.
[01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:36.060]   And yes, I used it in England.
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:37.060]   It was great.
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:42.540]   I put in a T-Mobile SIM because they have free international 2G and used it great.
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:45.700]   It's, I mean 2G is not great, but it worked.
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:50.580]   Sorry, Renee, I didn't mean to bonk you.
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:51.580]   Let's take a break.
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:52.580]   Anything else?
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:54.060]   I didn't, we're going to go to the picks of the week.
[01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:58.060]   So any other stories you, we should have covered that we didn't leave anything out.
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:02.580]   I'd like to give you guys a chance to bring up any hot button topics.
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:08.100]   Nope, filled with white hot jealousy about your 5K displays, but I'm dealing.
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:10.140]   This time scapes looks so good on this.
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:13.780]   I want to get the 4K version now.
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:18.060]   You can plug a 4K display into the 5K I'm actually on and you can have 9K.
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:19.060]   Can you?
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:20.060]   Yep.
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.060]   Over the Thunderbolt.
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:22.060]   Yep.
[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:24.100]   Well, I have the 4K display.
[01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:29.380]   So I'm kind of, I'm getting closer and closer just trading in the Mac Pro.
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:31.740]   What could I get for a base model Mac Pro?
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:32.740]   I have to.
[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:34.820]   Don Syracuse has a standing offer of $5 to you.
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:36.460]   I want to anyone else.
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:37.980]   Thanks, John.
[01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:42.140]   Great deal.
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:45.580]   I use all the carriers and T-Mobile and Petaluma is great.
[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:46.580]   It is because nobody is good.
[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:47.580]   It's not as good as this bird.
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:48.580]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:51.420]   So where it is good, where you have good, when you have good coverage with T-Mobile, it's
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:52.420]   incredible.
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:53.420]   It's incredible.
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:54.420]   It's super fast.
[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:55.420]   It's like 25 megs up and down.
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:56.420]   It's great.
[01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:57.420]   It's just not great everywhere.
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:02.260]   International Note 4, so it can't get LTE here in the States.
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:05.660]   But HSPA Plus, which is the best it could do at T-Mobile, is still 20 megabits.
[01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:07.220]   So I'll happy.
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:09.620]   I don't care.
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:10.780]   How fast do you need to go?
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:13.300]   Our show today brought to you by personal capital.
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:15.460]   What a great idea.
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:17.580]   I know you're young.
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:20.620]   You're never going to have to retire.
[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:24.220]   Death is a distant, distant foe.
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:25.220]   Except it's not.
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:26.660]   Take it from an old man.
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:28.580]   Take it here faster than you think.
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:30.940]   Plan for your future, kids.
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:33.220]   Start thinking about your retirement.
[01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:38.620]   And the best way to do it is to do it with full knowledge of what you're up to with personal
[01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:40.420]   capital.
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:44.100]   Personal capital was created because there are a couple of things that are getting in
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:46.860]   the way of you really doing your retirement.
[01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:52.900]   One is, it's just hard to keep track of investments, checking accounts, savings, assets.
[01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:57.980]   So personal capital, first thing it does is it collates that onto a single dashboard
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:04.780]   on your computer, on your iPad, on your phone that you could just see how everything's doing.
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:09.100]   And they even have a Google Android Wear app so you can see it on your watch, which is
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:10.700]   pretty wild.
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:15.940]   Then the next thing is they will tell you how if you're making any errors, if you've
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:20.700]   not balanced your 401K right for your age, if you're overpaying in fees, how to reduce
[01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:22.700]   those fees, get tailored advice.
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:26.140]   They've got calculators, all the stuff you need and it's free.
[01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:29.340]   And so you can be frugal and still use personal capital.
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:31.540]   I want you to visit personal capital.com/macbreak.
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:37.100]   It'll just take you a few minutes to sign up, but the benefits will last a lifetime.
[01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:42.340]   I've been very happy with just knowing is, you know, awareness, mindfulness about what
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:45.500]   you're doing is a huge step forward.
[01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.140]   The investment checkup, really useful.
[01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:48.140]   I love it.

[01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:01.860]   My pick is the 5K iMac.
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:02.860]   Yours.
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:05.980]   Man, I am so--
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:07.620]   I'm kind of sad.
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:10.620]   I bought the Mac Pro now.
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:15.300]   And you know, it's been a long because I got a Mac Pro and a 30K display and that little
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:22.580]   big disk, the terabyte SSD, probably close to-- I don't even want to think about it.
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:24.820]   You did it for the listeners, Leo, the viewers.
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:28.860]   Yeah, but now I want to buy the 5K for the viewers.
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:29.980]   The viewers deserve it, Leo.
[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:31.420]   The viewers deserve it.
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:32.980]   That's right.
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:39.740]   Andy and Aco, your pick of the week, sir.
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:41.780]   Mine is a pretty obvious pick from last week.
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:43.220]   It's Pixelmator for iPad.
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:44.220]   Oh, yeah?
[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:49.220]   We're talking earlier about why-- Gee, I wonder why there's such a huge processing bump and
[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:55.140]   app bump in Pixelmator-- excuse me, in the new iPads now.
[01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:59.900]   And I think that it's really to enable this new high-quality set of apps.
[01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:03.860]   It really is-- the temptation is to call it Photoshop for the iPad.
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.700]   It isn't because--
[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:07.860]   Does it do layers?
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:08.860]   It does layers.
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:10.420]   It actually imports Photoshop.
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:12.580]   It doesn't do things like 16-bit editing.
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:15.140]   But I can do some really pretty sophisticated things.
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:18.860]   If I decide that this image is a little bit too busy with this picture in it, it has effects
[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:21.580]   where you can just-- Look at that.
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:26.820]   Do editing like I can just select this and then wait-- well, then the progress bar.
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:30.020]   This will take about 10 seconds, but eventually--
[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:32.220]   It's going to actually--
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.220]   One, it's going to--
[01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:34.220]   One, it's going to--
[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:36.220]   And the picture is gone.
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:40.340]   And it do like really-- and also really cool this image editing effects.
[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:42.020]   But that's just for editing photos.
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:50.260]   You can also do stuff for-- you can also do lots of cool stuff for just creating art
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:58.380]   and preparing stuff for-- I'm going to replace that picture with this photo that I took because
[01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:02.380]   I should have an image in the Chicago Art Institute.
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:04.420]   And there we go there.
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:08.540]   So I mean, you really can do a lot of really cool stuff with it.
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:13.340]   It really goes beyond all other image editing apps that I've ever seen for the iPad, which
[01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:16.220]   tend to be, hey, look how good we are at doing brushes.
[01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:20.940]   Hey, look how good we are at pushing sliders around to change photos.
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:23.620]   This can be a really good art program for drawing freehand art.
[01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:28.780]   This can be really good for annotating and fixing photos and adding caption text and arrows
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:32.780]   and diagrams because you're going to be putting this into a presentation on the iPad later
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:33.780]   on.
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:38.260]   It's good for basic-- it's not even basic photo editing, but for finished photo editing.
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:41.020]   And it's also got a lot of nice support for future stuff.
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:43.020]   It has built-in support for Bluetooth styluses.
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:49.460]   I'm sorry I'm not giving you a more complete demo because I haven't used it enough that
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:56.460]   I can easily-- look, and now Bo's ecchi's got a cloud around here.
[01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:59.020]   So this is your picture.
[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:00.980]   This isn't some canned demo in the Pixelmator.
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:03.380]   No, there's a picture I took a while back.
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:04.820]   That's amazing.
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:05.820]   Well, that's not amazing.
[01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:12.060]   But apparently the graffiti motif is like the Chicago art institute has been pictured by
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:13.060]   Banksy.
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:14.060]   Look, I'm Banksy.
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:18.060]   This picture is now worth-- I hate $5 million.
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:21.020]   So I'm not giving a great upside down demonstration right now.
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:26.140]   But it's-- for five stinking bucks, you have one app that will be your really great photo
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:27.140]   editor.
[01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:29.300]   It will be your great image processor.
[01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:35.140]   I mean, I was giving a presentation at a Comic Con a couple months ago, and I needed to
[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:39.220]   prepare a title slide, but I did not have certain information until I actually arrived
[01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:40.220]   there.
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:42.700]   And so I had to do the sort of half-- half-hearted.
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:46.380]   I took a screenshot of an image I wanted to use and then put it into keynote just so I can
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:50.140]   add some text to it so I could-- the data that I wanted put onto it because I didn't
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:55.100]   want to bring my laptop with me just so I can add text to a slide and make it look good.
[01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:59.220]   This would have been the perfect solution because it really is the answer to almost every
[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:03.660]   image problem or every image opportunity that you have on the iPad.
[01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:07.780]   The only bad thing I can say about it, apart from it, the fact that it doesn't do 16-bit
[01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:12.220]   image editing, which would have been really killer because that's where a lot of the potential
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:16.140]   of enhancing a photo really is, the fact that it's got more head-per-minute.
[01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:19.260]   I'm actually going to complain a little bit that it costs $5.
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:25.420]   I'm all for pricing, allowing more people to get access to an app, but this is way,
[01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:29.180]   way too little money for an app of this sort of power.
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:35.100]   I really would have liked if it had been 10 bucks or even 20 bucks because I'm sort of
[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:41.220]   fearing that we're teaching people that they should not expect to pay any decent amount
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:44.580]   of money for actual apps anymore.
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:49.740]   I think that when a beautiful app like this costs $5, it becomes that much more difficult
[01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:54.060]   for another developer to charge what their app is worth.
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:58.660]   It's not enough that I would seriously complain about it, but if I'm looking for something
[01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:03.060]   to say about it, I would say that I would happily pay an extra $5 or $10 for it.
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:09.460]   But otherwise, man, you often hear me talk about apps that I love not only for what they
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:14.340]   are, but for the fact that you've got a lot of storage space on this iPad, you may as
[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:18.780]   well fill it with apps so that at the time when you are in need of a solution, that solution
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:22.620]   is already there, that you don't have to remember, "Oh, it wasn't an anti-annocco,
[01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:24.620]   recommend this really great image editing app."
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:27.940]   Okay, well, that'd be great, but now I don't have access to Wi-Fi and it's 100 megabyte
[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:31.180]   download and I can't do it over LTE and it would cost me more.
[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:33.220]   So I'm basically kind of screwed right now.
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:35.180]   Five bucks, go get it right now, put it in there.
[01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:37.460]   You start playing with it right away and you'll have a good time with it.
[01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:40.020]   And then at some point in the future, it will probably save your life.
[01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:44.700]   Obviously, more fun if you have a stylist handy or that they can play with it.
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:45.700]   Which one is that?
[01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:47.060]   That's a nice one.
[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:48.700]   That is from...
[01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:49.700]   Crayola.
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:50.700]   No, no.
[01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:51.700]   It's the same company that does this.
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:52.700]   Crayon company.
[01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:53.700]   It looks like it's nice.
[01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:54.700]   Crayon.
[01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:59.380]   It's the same company that does the glyph iPhone stand.
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:00.380]   It was...
[01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:02.380]   And they call it the rocket.
[01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:03.380]   Is it the cosmonauts?
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:04.380]   Studio Neating.
[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:07.860]   It's called the cosmonauts from studioneating.
[01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:14.940]   I like it because I didn't really start sketching and drawing again on a regular basis until
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:17.980]   paper and other really good drawing apps happened for this.
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:20.660]   And now when I travel, I've got this with me and if I'm in a museum where I can't take
[01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:23.180]   a picture, I will sit down and draw with it.
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:26.180]   And this is a great app to have for that sort of thing.
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:28.620]   So we'll make this a double recommendation.
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:30.980]   I like this because it's not an interactive stylist.
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:32.540]   So you don't have to Bluetooth parent.
[01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:33.860]   You don't have to put batteries in it.
[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:35.260]   But it's very comfortable to hold on to.
[01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:37.060]   It's very skivishy at the tip.
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:38.820]   It's better than just using your fingers.
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:39.820]   Skivishy.
[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:40.820]   Skivishy.
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:41.820]   Skivishy.
[01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:42.820]   Skivishy.
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:43.820]   Skivishy.
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:44.820]   Skivishy.
[01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:45.820]   Skivishy.
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:48.780]   Are you doing that on the new iPad, right?
[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:51.940]   Is it worth doing if you don't have the new iPad?
[01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:54.060]   It really shines on the new iPad.
[01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:59.700]   I have used it, believe it or not, on an iPad 3 and it is usable.
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:00.700]   Oh, really?
[01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:02.300]   You can definitely edit stuff.
[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:03.300]   It's the difference.
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:04.300]   You can see the difference.
[01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:08.900]   Yeah, and also, I mean, you saw how long it took to remove that picture from the background.
[01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:12.540]   That would have been a, you had enough time to take out your iPhone and check your mail.
[01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:17.380]   It's not not prohibitive, but this is definitely something that benefits from the new iPad
[01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:18.380]   and new processor.
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:22.460]   On the last year's iPad Air, perfectly usable, you definitely see the difference between
[01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:27.740]   that and the iPad 2, iPad Air 2, but still perfectly usable last year.
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:33.380]   If you've got an iPad 3 or an iPad 2, five bucks, how can you go wrong?
[01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:36.580]   But there are probably older apps that don't do quite as much that might be a little bit
[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:37.580]   more responsive.
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:40.380]   Paper works great even on the iPad 3.
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:45.980]   But this, if you got the good hardware, use the good, sorry, not to say that paper isn't
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:48.300]   good, but it doesn't make the same sort of demands that.
[01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:49.300]   It does.
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:50.300]   It does.
[01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:55.260]   Is the, is Pixelmator, does it, well, like using the Wacom, the bamboo pen, does it,
[01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:56.260]   is it pressure sensitive?
[01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:57.260]   Do you know?
[01:22:57.260 --> 01:22:59.460]   If it does support Bluetooth styluses.
[01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:02.940]   So if you have a pressure sensitive Bluetooth stylus, it will work with that.
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:06.700]   I have not tested it with a wide range of these devices, but it does say specifically
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:09.940]   that yes, this works perfectly fine with pressure sensitive styluses.
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:13.780]   It will not be, I will promise you, it will not be as good an experience as on like a
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:17.740]   Microsoft Surface tablet that has a built in digitizer for pen.
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:21.300]   That's one thing that if we make out a list of everything that we would expect to see
[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:27.060]   in an iPad, iPad Air Pro say, boy, I really hope they put in a Surface pen digitizer on
[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:31.860]   this because what a, they're leaving money off the table by not making this the best
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:36.060]   tool for doing handmade digital art that's on the market today.
[01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:38.220]   And that does not have that distinction right now.
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:40.660]   And I wish it did.
[01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:41.660]   Very good.
[01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:42.660]   Pixelmator.
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:44.820]   It's, and the cosmonaut.
[01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:45.820]   It's squishy.
[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:48.180]   Squishy, squishy, fishy pen.
[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:51.180]   Alex Lindsey, your pick.
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:55.900]   So I make a lot of labels in case you're just, just you're wondering, I'm really, I've been
[01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:57.780]   making labels since I was like 10 with them.
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:58.780]   The rotary things.
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:23:59.780]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:03.340]   If you know what I mean, you remember the rotary, the rotary thing that you had that
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:06.020]   you would like turn it and then the time oh labeler.
[01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:07.020]   Yeah.
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:11.620]   So I started back then, you know, you know, with Dymo labor doing it for my grandfather.
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:16.940]   And I finally found, maybe not the Holy Grail, but finally what I've been waiting for.
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:21.380]   We, because we have lots of labelers downstairs, as you probably have seen, I have every house
[01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:25.300]   I go to, I'm always labeling things to make sure I know what's going on.
[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:28.740]   So I got this, I just got this Epson.
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:32.940]   This is the L W 600 P.
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:36.620]   And, and what this does that I, that I like a hard drive.
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:37.620]   Like a labeler.
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:38.620]   Yeah.
[01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:41.580]   And what's cool about this, if you look at it, it doesn't have any keys.
[01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:42.580]   On it.
[01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:43.580]   Mm.
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:44.580]   How would that work?
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:47.140]   If it doesn't have any keys on it now, it does take batteries, by the way, if you pop
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:49.740]   this little bottom out, it's battery operated.
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:52.180]   So you can take it on the road, but it doesn't take any batteries.
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:54.900]   Now you can, of course, plug it into your computer.
[01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:58.820]   There's a driver, a little, a little app that lets you print stuff out and you can, you
[01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:00.300]   know, insert your QR code.
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:05.660]   But more importantly, more importantly, you have this.
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:09.140]   Oh, you can do with your phone.
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:15.300]   So, so what happens here is actually you can, in this, with this, with this, it's Bluetooth
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:16.300]   enabled.
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:23.020]   So you basically just pair up your, your iPhone or iPad or whatever to the, to the
[01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:24.020]   labeler.
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:26.980]   And then you've got this great, you know, I can say I want an original label and I just
[01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:27.980]   started working on one.
[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:28.980]   So then I can type it in there.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:32.860]   I can say, you know, what text, now the reason that one's so small like that is because I,
[01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:34.940]   I was printing.
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:41.100]   These are cable, cable labels so that I can, you know, mark labels are kind of like, you
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:43.100]   know, they're the, you know, they're, they're, they're two humans.
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:46.500]   What P is the dogs, you know, so, you know, I just pee on everything.
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:53.780]   So anyway, so, so anyway, so, so anyway, so, so this is my way of peeing on my cables,
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:57.420]   which is that I'm going to wrap, I wrap my cables with my name on them.
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:26:01.500]   This is how I pee on my phone, you know, it's just, you know, just print these out.
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:04.620]   But the, but the big thing is it's always been this clunky thing that you can't figure
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:08.180]   out, you know, and it's got all these keys and, and, you know, everything else.
[01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:11.180]   So anyway, so the fact that I can now do it with my iPhone and I can just very quickly
[01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:13.820]   pop things in that I want to, that I want to label and I got this little box.
[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:15.580]   You put images on.
[01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:16.580]   You can.
[01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:17.580]   You can put, they're very simple images.
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:19.420]   The resolution is very, is pretty rudimentary.
[01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:25.420]   So it's still like, like Mac, you know, 32 by 32 kind of, you know, it's, it's not, I
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:28.900]   mean, not quite that low, but it's still pretty low resolution, but you can put little images
[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:29.900]   on it.
[01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:30.900]   You can put QR codes on it.
[01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:33.900]   Serial number, you know, serial numbers, bar codes.
[01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:36.220]   The big for a lot of this stuff's all built in.
[01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:37.220]   Yeah.
[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:41.740]   And so it's just so much easier after all these years of going from the, from all the different
[01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:46.540]   things that I still miss the old, little circular dial, I will admit, but this is so
[01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:48.020]   fast.
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:50.780]   And of course, because it's like, absent, you know, you, you know, these cartridges are
[01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:52.540]   easy to get and there's lots of different people that make them.
[01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:57.100]   It's just that this has been the easiest one to actually use rather than, you know, than
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:01.060]   dealing with all just, it's quantumly forward as far as speed goes.
[01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:05.540]   I'm partially, I spent a lot more time typing on my iPhone than I type on a label maker.
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:09.660]   So so anyways, just, so I'm, I'm, I'm pretty happy with it.
[01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:11.940]   Once again, it's the LW 600P.
[01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:12.940]   Repson.
[01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:14.500]   107 bucks on Amazon.
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:17.020]   And that's where I bought it.
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:19.860]   And I, I'm so close to clicking that.
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:21.540]   It is so it looks pretty cool.
[01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:25.340]   I wanted to make sure that, you know, I just got it recently and I, and I, before I, I
[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:27.820]   had it sitting around, I wanted to make sure I played with it for a while.
[01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:29.220]   There's like, it's a little wonky.
[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:31.860]   It's like, for these little label ones, you have to kind of think around the box to get
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:33.340]   it to print on the top a little bit.
[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:34.340]   It doesn't do that automatically.
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:36.140]   It doesn't have a cable wrap.
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:37.620]   Yeah, this is the cable wrap.
[01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:41.380]   So this is, so you, yeah, you can put that on a cable now.
[01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:44.940]   And just, you know, just, but, you know, it's, that's kind of cool.
[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:47.740]   I like, I'd like to, I would love to label my cables.
[01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:52.460]   I like, well, and, and the thing is, is that for big shows, we'll actually label them,
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:55.820]   you know, like this is, or, or for kits that you're using all the time, we'll label like
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:57.020]   this cable is going to this.
[01:27:57.020 --> 01:28:00.780]   The big thing is just labeling all of your power supplies because, you know, by a lot
[01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:03.420]   of power supplies, and there should be no idea what they go to.
[01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:04.420]   Yes.
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:08.260]   If you're, you know, if it's coming from a Lily put or AJA, AJA is really good about
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:09.260]   it.
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:12.100]   But there's other people that just send these generic wall words and you can't remember
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:13.100]   what they are.
[01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:16.780]   So one of the first things that we do is label, of course, the, the power to make sure we
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:19.220]   know what, where that actually belongs.
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:23.700]   So, but you, once you start labeling things, it does become an addiction.
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:27.660]   I have admitted that I have a problem, but I'm not willing to give it up yet.
[01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:32.140]   I have a box of silver pens that I keep on hand specifically so that I can label every
[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:37.660]   wall ward because it's like, my life changed for the better years ago when I realized that
[01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:40.580]   okay, if it's more wattage, that's okay.
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:43.020]   If it's more voltage, that's not okay.
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:44.020]   Right.
[01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:45.020]   Yeah.
[01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:48.780]   But they, when these things are like just molded in shallow plastic with no paint on them.
[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:52.460]   And you're like crawling behind the TV hutch to find out which is the, which is the one
[01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:57.380]   for the Roku and which is like the 17 volt one that needs to go to something else.
[01:28:57.380 --> 01:28:58.380]   That's a bad label.
[01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:01.860]   I mean, it just, it's just, it's like, it's, you know, it's, it completely changes your
[01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:05.340]   life when you never think of something that a responsible grown up would do.
[01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:08.460]   Someone who can connect consequences with actions.
[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:10.660]   I could pretend to be one of those people.
[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:13.100]   It's crazy, crazy.
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:15.420]   Mr. Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:18.900]   I want to just second out, I'll, sorry, Andy's iPad.
[01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:20.100]   You like Pixelmader.
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:21.980]   Well, yeah, absolutely.
[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:24.820]   And Ipad Air 2 by itself is just phenomenal.
[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:27.260]   The display looks like the iMac display.
[01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:30.620]   You couldn't think that it would be better than an iPad Air, but it really is because
[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:31.620]   it's laminated.
[01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:33.540]   Now it's got a new anti-glare coating that really works.
[01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:35.380]   It's got a new gold option.
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:37.340]   So you can completely bling it out.
[01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:38.340]   So then what?
[01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:40.860]   If you have an iPad Air, should you get one?
[01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:45.860]   No, I mean, if you, if you really want gold, if you really, if you didn't get 64, 128 gigabytes
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:50.180]   and you're really upset about that, they're 100 bucks cheaper than they were last year.
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:53.220]   Or if you were into high end graphics and high end graphics is really important.
[01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:57.020]   Do the AAX chipset is really good, but it's like the iMac.
[01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:59.700]   You're shopping for a Ferrari if you already have the iPad Air 1.
[01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:04.780]   On the other hand, if you have a 3 or a 2, would you roll with while on-grid?
[01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:07.460]   To clarify, you're almost always going to get a no answer from me if you're asking me
[01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:10.580]   if I have something that's one year old to upgrade it right now.
[01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:15.660]   Unless the thing is, has an unexploded airbag that's going to go off because of manufacturing
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:16.660]   de-effect.
[01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:17.900]   Hold on to release another year.
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:18.900]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:20.460]   You can hold them for a couple of years.
[01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:24.420]   My picks of the week, one is BB Edit 11 from bare-bones software.
[01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:25.420]   I love BB Edit.
[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:26.820]   I write in it every day.
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:30.100]   Almost every article I do on iMOR is written in BB Edit.
[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:32.900]   This is the version that is no longer on the Mac App Store.
[01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:35.820]   They're doing a lot of a bit of gymnastics to help people who bought the Mac App Store
[01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:37.500]   version crossover.
[01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:44.460]   But it's just, it is the, I believe it started 100 years ago or the, or it's 1812 or something.
[01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:46.860]   And Rich has just been updating it every year since then.
[01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:48.900]   It's gotten you texts and text highlighting.
[01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:50.220]   It's gotten you text extraction.
[01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:52.900]   It's got a bevy of really good features.
[01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:57.780]   I am not too proud to admit that I use maybe 1% of them, but I just love that I can write
[01:30:57.780 --> 01:31:00.260]   in plain text and it just, I can convert it to market.
[01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:05.980]   I can just do anything that I, and I wrote like the, my review for iOS 8 was 21,000 words
[01:31:05.980 --> 01:31:07.660]   and Google Docs just couldn't handle it.
[01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:09.220]   It just, it just kept freezing.
[01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:10.660]   BB Edit handled it like a champ.
[01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:12.700]   It had no problem whatsoever.
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.220]   And it's never once lost my work.
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:17.780]   If anything goes wrong, it comes right back, right where I left off.
[01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:22.020]   And that to me is just invaluable to be able to do it quickly, not lose time and to be
[01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:25.660]   safe in what I'm doing makes it, you know, absolutely worth the price.
[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:30.220]   And speaking of paying for good software, I would buy it twice if I could because use
[01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:31.220]   it all day every day.
[01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:32.220]   Yeah.
[01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:33.220]   Yeah.
[01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:34.220]   Yeah.
[01:31:34.220 --> 01:31:35.220]   Yeah.
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:36.220]   BB Edit is only slightly younger than ASCII.
[01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:37.220]   That's a bunch of other stuff as far as you can go.
[01:31:37.220 --> 01:31:40.820]   And it kind of pointed out that there aren't, that rich, this is how he makes a living.
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:42.900]   He never offers a free upgrade.
[01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:44.940]   So if you bought 10, the upgrade is 30 bucks.
[01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:47.740]   If you have never purchased before, it's 50 bucks.
[01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:50.820]   If you have a Mac App Store versions, 30 bucks as well.
[01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:51.820]   Yeah.
[01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:52.820]   Yeah.
[01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:57.140]   But also it's one of the most consistently worked on and updated and maintained apps.
[01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:58.940]   I think you can possibly find worth it.
[01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:04.260]   I rarely a month goes by when I don't get some sort of indication that a dot upgrade
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:09.980]   is coming and never to fix a catastrophic problem but to fix something that is amazingly
[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:15.060]   subtle that only someone who relies on BB Edit to work on 20 hours a day, seven days
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:20.220]   a week for months, whatever, ever uncover and yet it's important enough that bare bones
[01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:22.220]   felt the need to fix it.
[01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:26.380]   It's just, it's, if you're just like Renee and me, you just want a text editor that
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:28.300]   writes text, it's great.
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:32.900]   If you're writing code, it's great because it'll do highlight marking for all your context.
[01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:37.780]   You can change color schemes now for how things work.
[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:42.580]   And just I, Rich, who's a very good friend of mine gave me a demonstration of it personally
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:47.860]   last week when in the context of a PR thing as opposed to a context of a just hanging
[01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:48.860]   up thing.
[01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:55.780]   And boy, that you see, when you see a, a, a, how a blade can be used by a chef who's
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:33:00.780]   also a master knife Smith, you appreciate for what this knife can do because he was doing
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:01.780]   things.
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:07.060]   And now here's like 20 years worth of with BB Edit, the feature requests.
[01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:10.860]   And how do I take it to just all the requests for over 20 years that were just mentioned
[01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:11.860]   touch ID?
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:14.620]   Well, I just do this search and now because of this new feature, we put it now.
[01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:15.620]   It's a simple list like that.
[01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:18.100]   But I don't want to just select this one column of it.
[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:19.340]   So now I've simply started typing.
[01:33:19.340 --> 01:33:22.780]   It's like, okay, you just did what would have taken me about three days of manual labor
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:24.500]   and about 14 keystrokes.
[01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:29.460]   And even if you never touch that power yourself, it is so wonderful to know that that power
[01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:34.580]   is lurking in this app that all you do use for is to write 2000 word columns because one
[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:39.060]   time a year you will, gee, I've really got to need to do this transmogrification on this
[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:40.060]   file.
[01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:41.260]   What a pain in the butt is going to be.
[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:45.460]   And then you realize, oh, wait a minute, doesn't BB edit have amazing features for doing anything
[01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:49.540]   you can do with text and we'll take you mate as a newbie, it'll take you two hours to learn
[01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:52.460]   the one simple search and replace string that will do it for you.
[01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:56.820]   But that two hours will pay off in 10 minutes worth of effort to do something that would
[01:33:56.820 --> 01:33:58.300]   take you three days.
[01:33:58.300 --> 01:33:59.300]   Highest recommendation.
[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:02.860]   There's, I keep, I keep threatening myself that I should really go and create a hall of
[01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:07.820]   fame of stuff that every time that I set up a brand new Mac that I personally own, there
[01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:12.780]   are always six apps that even before I think to, I'm going to need them, just come to mind
[01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:17.980]   that I got to download Chrome, I got to download this, that the other and BB edit for 10 years
[01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:20.860]   has always been one of those things cannot recommend it highly enough.
[01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:22.940]   And we love rich and we just want to support him too.
[01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:24.140]   He is a good one and he is.
[01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:25.500]   He's one of the good.
[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:30.460]   You know, you know that if if the one time that I would, he's the one person that if
[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:35.020]   he ever decided to say that, you know what, I'm totally done with developing for the Mac.
[01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:36.020]   I've had it.
[01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:37.380]   This is not a good system anymore.
[01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:39.260]   I can't do the things I want to do.
[01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:42.900]   That's the point which I would say maybe I should stop using the Mac because not only
[01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:46.340]   does he know everything there is to know, not only has he been be there since the, been
[01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:51.540]   here since the first time Apple was doomed, but also people were talking about his a
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:56.660]   singleton talk in which he give his his presentation was all about his decision to pull out of
[01:34:56.660 --> 01:34:57.660]   the Mac App Store.
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:35:01.580]   And it wasn't him ripping off his hat and throwing it to the ground and yelling about
[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:03.060]   how, oh, this is all BS.
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:04.940]   This is it's calm rational.
[01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:07.540]   Here are the reasons why we made this decision for ourselves.
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:08.980]   You can make this is all this is for yourself.
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:10.820]   But here's why we went through this again.
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:12.380]   He is finest kind.
[01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:13.380]   Absolutely.
[01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:14.380]   I got you all.
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:15.380]   Those pics suck.
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:16.380]   I had one more.
[01:35:16.380 --> 01:35:17.380]   I just wanted to.
[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:18.380]   Okay.
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:19.380]   One more from it.
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:23.260]   Why is it every time at the very end of the show Renee's Skype goes away.
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:24.260]   I turned off everything else.
[01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:25.260]   It's horrible.
[01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:26.260]   It's so weird.
[01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:27.260]   It was great.
[01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:28.260]   It was really weird.
[01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:29.260]   Can you still hear me?
[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:30.260]   Yeah.
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:34.020]   So I just wanted to Vicki Murley who was on the original Safari team, the original iPhone
[01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:37.300]   team and was Apple's web technologies evangelist for many years.
[01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:41.700]   She put out her second book, which is CSS animation and it's it's terrific.
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:45.100]   A lot of the CSS stuff is based on Apple's technology, like all the animation stuff,
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:46.380]   the transition stuff.
[01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:50.620]   And if you've always been curious about how to do CSS animation, her book is a great starting
[01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:51.620]   point.
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:53.020]   It's available for iPad and for iMac.
[01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:56.780]   It's a CSS animation book.com and it's it's really good.
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:58.940]   By the way, we thanks to Jeff Niehl's.
[01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:04.620]   We got the 2560 resolution version of time scape.
[01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:08.900]   So it's still I mean, I mean, it looked great either way.
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:12.400]   And it's still not the full resolution of this display.
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:13.500]   That's the amazing thing.
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.160]   It's really amazing.
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:21.580]   My app, I'm telling you, you guys, okay, you got good pics, but you don't have Taco Bell.
[01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:26.700]   Taco Bell today shipped an app that you can order from Taco Bell directly from your iPhone
[01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:27.700]   actually.
[01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:29.140]   They have an Android version as well.
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:31.940]   It looks up your local Taco Bell.
[01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:33.340]   What are you laughing at?
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:38.580]   I'm just thinking the most appropriate app possible for it for device people usually use
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:39.580]   on the toilet.
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:40.580]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:41.580]   There you go.
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:44.660]   And I'll mute my microphone because I can have my bell in the future.
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:47.700]   Your most ordered items will appear here.
[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:49.020]   Engine starters.
[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:50.020]   I have got breakfast.
[01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:51.020]   I've got a couple.
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:55.500]   They deliver or you have to go pick it up.
[01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:58.660]   Oh gosh, I would be nice if they would just show up at your door.
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:01.300]   But no, you have to go get it.
[01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:03.540]   Unfortunately, I know, but it's just down the street.
[01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:05.900]   So that's the good news.
[01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:06.900]   Welcome amigo.
[01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:08.540]   It is not an iPad app.
[01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:09.740]   I don't mean to insult your life.
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:12.940]   So you'll be sitting in your favorite place with your iPad and then you can order something
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:14.740]   to get you back there as fast as possible.
[01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:17.980]   It's basically about throughput, maximizing throughput.
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:20.380]   All right.
[01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:21.580]   I just couldn't resist.
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:26.180]   Ladies and gentlemen, we are now at the end of our program for the day.
[01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:31.180]   And I do thank you so much, Mr. Alex Lindsey for joining us all the way from Pittsburgh
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:36.300]   and your specially designed drywall room.
[01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:38.660]   I'll be somewhere else next week, but I do have a good connection.
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:39.660]   You travel.
[01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:41.500]   I'm going to be in DC or Frederick, Maryland.
[01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:43.100]   I'm not sure what one of the other.
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:44.100]   That's cool.
[01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:45.420]   That's cool.
[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:46.420]   We appreciate it.
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:48.180]   Picsacord.com at Alex Lindsey.
[01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:50.340]   He's always got good stuff going on at him on the Twitter.
[01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:53.300]   And that's the best place to find out what's going on.
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.860]   On the site.
[01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:57.780]   And we have the next Final Cut user group is November 11th.
[01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:00.580]   People have been asking us.
[01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:03.220]   So I'll have the link next week.
[01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:05.220]   But go ahead and put it on your schedule.
[01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:06.220]   November 11th.
[01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:07.220]   We have some fun.
[01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:08.220]   It'll be in the afternoon.
[01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:11.380]   We've kind of moved it earlier so that our folks in the UK can watch live.
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:12.380]   11/11.
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:13.380]   Yes.
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:14.380]   Renee Ritchie.
[01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:17.340]   He's from Montreal and imore.com.
[01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:18.820]   A really good site lately.
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:21.900]   You've been just not as I said it last week, but you're not going to have the park with
[01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:22.900]   great stuff.
[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:25.620]   And of course the podcast, let's not forget.
[01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:28.780]   You'll find it all at imore.com.
[01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:30.100]   The Pixelated Renee Ritchie.
[01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:33.940]   This is not I wouldn't say this is a 5K version of Renee Ritchie.
[01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:35.580]   This might be a five bit version.
[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:38.100]   Original Mac version.
[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:39.740]   Thank you Renee.
[01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:42.740]   And Annie and Ico at the Chicago Sun Times joins us every week too.

[01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:51.140]   We do this show.
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:52.140]   We're changing.
[01:38:52.140 --> 01:39:00.580]   We're setting the clocks back an hour on Sunday in this area of the world.
[01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:07.140]   So that means we will be an hour later for you if you are in some other area of the world.
[01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:08.140]   Or Arizona.
[01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:09.140]   Or not.
[01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:10.140]   Or Arizona.
[01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:11.140]   Or Arizona.
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:12.740]   I'll leave it to you to do the calculations.
[01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:13.740]   So it's 11.
[01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:15.300]   It will stay at 11 a.m.
[01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:16.300]   Pacific.
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:17.300]   It will stay at 2 p.m.
[01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:18.300]   Eastern time.
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:21.580]   But it will be 1900 UTC starting next week.
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:24.500]   Not 1800, but 1900 UTC starting next week.
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:25.900]   Make a note of that.
[01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:28.740]   Do the local calculations.
[01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:29.740]   Watch live if you can.
[01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:33.340]   And if you can't figure it out, don't worry because on demand version is always available
[01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:34.580]   after the fact.
