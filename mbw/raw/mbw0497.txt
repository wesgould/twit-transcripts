[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.440]   That's okay, cuz you can get at me if you have a piece of cheese
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:51.440]   The cheese wielder himself from Montreal Renee Richie of iMour.com back from your mobile nation's rally
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.040]   Yeah, we were all in Atlanta. Now I'm back just in time for a big block of cheese day on Mac Break. Yay
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.960]   Is it a coincidence that big block of cheese day is also international women's day?
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.160]   No, that's awesome
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.480]   The women's day forget the cheese get the cheese. I don't think big block of cheese is an official holiday
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.800]   No, I think it's an ever-insurcanism
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.640]   Sergan holiday
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.280]   It's a good holiday, so when I would celebrate if it's a good like Welsh like red dragon like mustard cheese
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.560]   Mmm, I will leave I will at least say that equal precedence just long enough for the cheese to get in and then back to the women
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.520]   And also with is from parts unknown, but it looks like his home studio mr. Alex Lindsey
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.320]   It's actually my office. I just put egg crates up everywhere. You know, it's you never know
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.800]   You used to have that when you had the course offices ever Cisco you always had it
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.320]   Soundproofing in your office. I do not like echo
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.000]   I just don't like echo so I just like you know
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.160]   I make everything 18% gray and then I cover it all up with because yeah
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.000]   Even just the feeling of 18% gray behind the the diffusion makes me feel better so nice
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.440]   We had Russell Preston Brown on triangulation yesterday Russell Brennan so much fun adobe's kind of evangelist
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.800]   He I remember he I took a course from Burton Monroy on Photoshop
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.040]   2.5
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.560]   in South
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.600]   South San Francisco at the right by the airport and
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.800]   Russell Brown entered the room with a big wig. Yeah, he seems to like the costumes
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.600]   He was great
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   he told the story
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.560]   You know where he went to work for Adobe in 1985 when it was remember Adobe type manager and postscript and
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.240]   He told the story of how they got a call in 1988 from a guy named Tom. No, actually was from his brother John. No
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.840]   Who was working at ILM at the time? I said my brother Thomas has written this really neat thing
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.000]   They the no brothers had gone to super Mac remember them
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   with
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.600]   Something they called photo hut and we're turned down
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.040]   Then they went to all this remember them create as a page maker and we're turned down
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.520]   Russell Brown says thank God. We didn't say no
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.160]   photo of course it became Photoshop and
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.460]   Made the made the fortune of many
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.120]   People including the no brothers and Adobe
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.880]   It's great story
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.440]   It was really just processing for at the beginning. Yeah, processed images Thomas Brown was a graduate student
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.600]   He'd written remember in the early days of the Mac was it was black and white on the first color Macintosh
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.640]   He had written a routine to take you know
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:41.240]   Jaggedy black and white images and anti alias them using the color, you know a gray pixel
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:48.200]   And he was so he was basically making taking you know jaggy monochrome images and smoothing them out making pretty
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.640]   Gray scale images and that was the beginning of Photoshop
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.320]   Yeah, and the from what I understand the plug-in architecture was really so that John could write stuff
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.120]   What the he knew that he wanted to use at ILM and he wouldn't be working on the core code
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.760]   you know Tom could keep on working on the core code and and
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.480]   And John could you know update things and create so most of the original plugins for quite some time are all
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.800]   What John wrote, you know like to fix problems?
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.520]   And so there'd be all kinds of really interesting plugins that are in there that were to solve some specific problem that he had for some
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.160]   Maybe that's what you want. You want people who are scratching their own itch, right? Yep. Absolutely Steve Wozniak
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.280]   I was gonna bring up the apple encryption case. I mean, how can we go a week without talking about it?
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.760]   Let's let was on Conan O'Brien
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.680]   Do the talking FBI's battle with Apple?
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.120]   What's your take? I?
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:46.280]   Side with Apple on this one first of all I've always been very related close to human rights
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.280]   I'm one of the founders of the EFF
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:55.960]   First time in living history on network television that the EFF has received an ovation
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.960]   You really have to wonder did the audience even know what the
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.040]   Okay, okay human rights
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:08.560]   Give it up once countries can come in and tell tell manufacturers you have to make your products
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.520]   secure computer security
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.920]   Government wants a back door so that they can say look if we really need to we can get in there and see what was on this phone in
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:24.600]   Case there was any kind of nefarious activity and you say one case they picked the lamest case you ever could the two phones
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.400]   Owned by the people that aren't even convicted terrorists didn't have one link to a terrorist organization
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.200]   Rise and turned over all the phone records all the SMS messages
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.600]   So they want to take this other phone that they didn't the two didn't destroy that was a work phone
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.640]   It's so so lame and worthless to expect something's on it, right and get Apple to expose it
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.720]   But boy, I wrote a couple times in my life
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:51.760]   I wrote something could be a virus that could have spread itself on Macintosh computers forever and each time I threw away every bit of code
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:57.280]   I'd written I was so scared inside you do not want to let something like that out and if you want you create it
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.360]   There's a good chance hackers will get into it and then what if what if China says?
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:07.200]   Apple you've got to give us a back door so we can get into any phone even your government officials iPhones and inspect them any time
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.480]   That's wrong. Yeah security is an important thing now
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:15.360]   Look how many people get hurt millions of people's accounts get exposed every day. Okay. All right, all right
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.480]   Look at that. He won over Conan and everything he's good
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.760]   I guess that's all we need to say
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:33.680]   From the horse's mouth so to speak in New York Times points out that it was an FBI error that they screwed up
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.600]   That really we were watching last week at this time. We were watching the congressional testimony that really pissed off
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:46.040]   There are lysa and the Congress members of Congress that the FBI screwed it up and now is going Apple saying hey
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.400]   Could you help the series? Oopsies?
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:55.240]   Yeah, just as important of course has gone back to the judge in Brooklyn. We mentioned who who turned the
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.760]   FBI's request down
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:03.160]   He didn't just turn it down though. He knocked it back at them as though they'd insulted his mother on the way to the basket
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.160]   Yeah, they want to go back. Yeah
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.480]   Craig Federighi writing in the Washington Post a guest editorial
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:15.420]   FBI wants to roll back safeguards that keep us safe a step ahead of criminals. I
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.000]   Think we found the talking point, right?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.440]   Well, I mean it's interesting and I think I forget I think there's Daniel Dilger on Apple insider who's pointing out that a lot many of these same
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:31.000]   Organizations were praising Apple not too long ago for making activation lock which they said turned you know reduced a violent crime because people can no longer
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.280]   Just deal iPhones hack them open and sell them to somebody else
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.340]   And now the story seems to rapidly be changing and now it's apples evil and stopping the government from
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:46.120]   Yes, the whole narrative is bizarrely spun around by what I think is mostly the political arm of law enforcement
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.120]   Not not necessarily the day-to-day arm
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.080]   It's sort of like when people make complaints about the media
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:56.480]   Making the making the position that there is one voice for the media
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.120]   There is not one voice for the FBI even let alone all of law enforcement
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.120]   So you'll see it's possible for
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.000]   It's possible for what the FBI is doing right here to have been a legitimate screw-up
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.440]   And now they're trying to recover data that they could have gotten but didn't while at the same time another faction FBI saying
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:19.480]   Well, this is a good I this is a good opportunity for us to try to get some political leverage to get some laws passed that
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.480]   We've always been wanting for for quite some time
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:29.360]   I'm glad that was spoke up about this because not necessarily because he is the world's leading authority on security and privacy
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:35.680]   But he is he really is one of the few people who are in sort of an elder statesman role in
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.140]   Technology where you ask but why what why does what what a 30?
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.940]   Does he have to speak by everything about anything and the answer comes back?
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.940]   He invented the personal computer
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:50.280]   He was on dancing with the stars, but he's also the face
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:56.400]   He's also a person that people recognize as somebody who has been around the track who even if he's not
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.000]   Creating products right now. He's investing and he's talking to people
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.360]   He's working with the next generation of engineers
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:09.160]   So if he's saying something like this there are a lot of people who were on the fence or didn't have an opinion that are at least kind of remember that
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:15.200]   Well, Steve Wozniak, Elder Statesman in this position. So how what side do I want to be on? Yeah, he really has standing
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.800]   Well, and I think that we're seeing more people with standing that are
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.840]   starting to lean against the
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:29.360]   The the rulings here. So I think that's the interesting thing is you everyone from you know either, you know former heads of the NSA
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.120]   You have I mean when you start having this
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.720]   Confluence of a lot of technology leaders as well as people within the intelligence community
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:43.080]   It seemed and human rights committees and so on so forth that it really seems like this the tide is slowly
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.920]   You know ebbing away from from the FBI. Yeah
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.440]   Meanwhile
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.680]   John Miller who's the chief of the New York Police Department's counter terrorism group
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:12:00.440]   Was back on the radio interview was baffled by apples reluctance to help the FBI
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.760]   He said Apple is helping to help in it to help choosing to help murderers
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:12.360]   Murderers I still don't know what made Apple change your minds and decide to actually design a system that made them not able to aid the police
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:19.520]   You're actually providing aid to the kidnappers robbers and murderers who've actually been recorded on the telephones in Rikers Island
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.040]   By the way, that's another issue, but we won't get into that
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.840]   They're telling their compatriots in the outside. Oh, man
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.480]   You gotta get I always say it is a gift from God and that's a quote because the cops can't crack it
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:39.320]   Cyrus Vance Jr. They had in da said he has 175 iPhones that we don't have any warrants to search
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:44.880]   But we and and we can't get in them. Oh sure be nice if Apple just help us out here. I
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.800]   Think it is one of the areas
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.280]   I think that one of the one of the real issues here is that
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:56.120]   With the FBI making this mistake and again, it may it really feels like it's either they did it on purpose
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:02.880]   Or they were completely incompetent because the they have 12 phones that they they're having issues with you have other law enforcement in New York
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.720]   That have 170 phones. I mean if I had that kind of issue
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.160]   I would know everything about exactly what the protocol is to get the data off
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.960]   I mean, you know, it seems like you know, it just it just seems like a you know either
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:21.440]   You don't trust them because they're not being genuine or you don't trust them because they have all of these issues and they're not
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.840]   Doing it correctly, you know, like you don't want to trust them with the the privacy either
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.160]   So I think that you know the number of these and the fact that that you would think that they'd be
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.560]   Experts by now and if they can't become experts by now then there's something wrong on some level
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.480]   And I think that you know one of the things that we look at, you know
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.360]   Them talking about this I mean if we look at another idiotic law this right to be forgotten
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:49.600]   You know Google now has you know has almost 450,000 requests, you know for right to be forgotten
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.400]   And I think that they've already or they they've removed four hundred and forty one thousand
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.300]   URL results with three hundred and forty eight thousand and change
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.080]   Request I mean, this is what apples
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.200]   You know trying to avoid yeah, yeah
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.880]   Well
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:13.320]   But they have they have to remove them. They've just made them invisible to people within search searchers within the same country
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.320]   We're right request was filed
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:20.080]   They've actually made a little bit more granular just a couple of weeks ago to make sure that it's not it's that
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.880]   People who have people who are not affected by that law can see it and also people inside the UK
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:30.120]   Can find these results as easily as someone who's outside the UK can watch BBC content
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.520]   You just you just buy out you just buy a VPN program and say hi. Oh, I'm not
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:40.200]   Pip-pip-pip. I am not from the UK, you know Charlie old T chrome fellow
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.680]   It's I still I still think that I
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:49.120]   Find it a lot easier to imagine that the person who the people who?
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:55.400]   Who made the mistakes that made that data and act inaccessible were making a stupid grave error?
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:02.040]   Or they were not following protocol or they weren't being talked to by the right person as opposed to
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:06.520]   The FBI wanting to try to force force a court of short on that way
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.480]   I'd have to see a lot more strong evidence before I would even really consider that
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.280]   I would say I would say 85% chance that you're right. I'm just saying it's one of the other
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:22.280]   And both of them do not give us should give us pause to give the FBI any more
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:27.480]   Access than they already have if they can't handle what they what they have sitting in front of them. All right
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:33.600]   Here's another quote and this one comes from Adi Shamir. He's the S in RSA
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:39.080]   Found really creator inventor one of the inventors a public key crypto
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.560]   He says even though Apple has helped in countless cases. They decided not to comply this time
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.640]   My advice is that they comply this time and wait for a better test case
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.040]   To fight where the case is not so clearly in favor of the FBI
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:16:00.240]   So there's a guy with some standing invented public key crypto. He says the Apple should help
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:06.080]   See it's not as it really isn't all that clear. I think I had a great conversation
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.960]   On the plane back and that just I don't want to turn on anything anymore
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.680]   Oh, did you read that story about the journalist the Washington Post journalist who?
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:20.320]   He's sitting he's writing stories. He's filing his emailing using the internet on the plane and the guy behind him as they're getting off
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.960]   Says hey, that was a great story. I really enjoyed it
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.920]   But you might want to watch out next time you're using the internet on the plane
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.800]   I saw that he was using whether they dial up the equivalent of dial up or something to connect with
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:34.600]   You know, we had a great conversation on Sunday on Twitter
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.400]   I
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.400]   Boiled it down to this
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:46.480]   Right now there's only one place that the law has kind of carved out to say this is private and no one has access to it
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.480]   And that's your brain
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.640]   That's the fifth amendment. You can't be compelled to testify against yourself. You could we can take your fingerprint
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.400]   We could take your hair in for DNA. We could take your blood
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:00.960]   We could take anything but you can't take somebody's the kind of somebody's brains that's provided private and the law has carved that out
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.040]   That's not in the Constitution your brain is private
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.160]   The over time we've we've just we've just kind of all agreed. Okay
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:15.520]   You know, of course no means exists right now, but presumably in the in the future means might exist to read your mind
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:21.360]   And one hopes that the law wouldn't then be changed, but let's so there'll be a test case
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.360]   They'll be you know what the same
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.360]   100 years from now the same conversation is gonna be had oh
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:33.000]   You know Apple Apple mind meld lets you is has a way of reading
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:37.040]   Your brain, but they don't want to give it to the police police said well, they but everything's in there
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.960]   We would know if you were guilty. We could even know ahead of time if you were gonna
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:48.840]   We want that information now how now how do you feel and what's happened is this phone has become an extension of your brain
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:54.440]   You end up dumping. I know I do I don't remember anybody's phone number anymore. I don't remember my calendar appointments or anything
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.440]   It's all dumped into the phone
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:01.400]   You but the law doesn't necessarily extend to the protection that it provides your brain to the phone
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:07.640]   That's what the debate is about and in fundamental terms. That's what the debate is about and I think that that's a really interesting debate
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.320]   I don't think it's so weird to me because if you have a really secure lock on your door
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.360]   Please can still break it down
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:19.200]   But it's harder when they say like you can't have that lock or we want to have a copy of your key and just cannot keep it at the station
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.000]   Or keep it with the vendor
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.680]   There's there are ways to get me
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:27.440]   We've seen jail breaks for iOS 9 there are exploits out there that can be used to get into these devices
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.400]   But they're not choosing to do that they want to have Apple do it to me. That's a very subtle but very important difference
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:37.560]   Well, and again, I think that this this is a much bigger case than than even what's on the phone
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:42.200]   I think that you know this precedent opens up the door for them to force
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:47.760]   companies to write code that allows them to eavesdrop on us and I think that that is
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:55.960]   Kind of a terrifying and there's not many of these that I mean I usually kind of assume I definitely went through a tin tin foil hat
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:03.760]   Mode 20 years ago when I really understood what was going on and and I would you know all the way down to the point where when I went to the
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.040]   drivers
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.320]   Driver get my driver's license in Colorado. They required a fingerprint
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:13.080]   So I you know I burned mine off and then and then gave them flat flat fingerprints
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.120]   So I you know I you know and I paid an all-in cash and I was all like screw you
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.400]   You're not gonna be able and then after a while I realized that that was kind of useless
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:25.240]   There's a lot of work for nothing and and so I I've kind of
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:32.280]   Get that there's a lot of things that are being looked at but I think that when we get to it's some point when we get to
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.160]   We get to a point where the government is forcing companies to write new code to build new tools
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.040]   I think it's all fair, you know, they want to build their own tools. They want to break into those things
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.400]   They want to hack those things. I think that's you know the government
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.920]   That's what they're gonna do
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.160]   But I think when you start forcing the companies that we're supposed to trust
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:54.520]   To do that for them. That's the precedent that they want and I think that that's the precedent that we absolutely can't provide
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.520]   You know, I think that you know
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:02.120]   The question is how long do these companies stay in the United States if you know how long does this technology stay in the United States?
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.160]   How long does the servers stay in the United States? I mean how you know that not all these countries now?
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:11.800]   There's gonna be some countries that are gonna use this to push the entire precedent, you know, so China Russia
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.560]   They're gonna use this to force Apple to do that on their end
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:20.080]   On the other side of that you're gonna have some countries that see a financial gain in making sure that they're not gonna do that
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.760]   And then you're gonna end up with lots of secure servers that are you know
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.760]   And I think that we've just
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.640]   In it vertically I think the FBI has created more of an arms race than they had before I think now
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.040]   It's it's not just marketing for Apple. I think it's marketing for everyone to
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.760]   Build much more robust security than they had before because now everyone's awake to it
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:46.240]   The other day I saw just good looking guy on the CBC talking about the very first Macintosh ransomware and
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:52.120]   He's here right now. Look at him. Good looking fella. I want to talk a little bit about
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:59.520]   Sad sad day the first ransomware on Macintosh and how many people were affected how they got affected what Apple did about it
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.520]   What you can do about it lots more to come?
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:07.960]   Renee Richie's here from imore.com Alex Lindsay from the pixel core from Chicago Sun times of course Andy and not co
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:14.480]   We are talking Mac and Tasha Mac break weekly. I don't know if you noticed gentlemen, but I have a very smooth
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.680]   Corrigious Leo beautiful, isn't it? I
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.840]   Shaved this morning with my Harry's razor and it's never
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.320]   Felt so good
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.160]   You know I learned something it says in the book shave with the grain of your beard now
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.480]   I never had a grain in my beard so I just started shaving in one direction and now I actually get a better shave
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:38.240]   I didn't realize that I my dad should have taught me that here. I am 59 finally learning how to shave thanks to Harry's
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:43.920]   I love getting up and facing my beautiful. I have a Winston which I love with a metal handle
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:49.360]   Uh, I even got the copper winter Winston actually comes started a point now where I'm collecting Harry's
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.120]   Handles I have the term and said as well. They're really gorgeous
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:58.560]   So here's the deal Harry's is one of these great companies that's that look that looked at how the business is done
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.920]   And said hey, it's the internet era. We can do it better
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:07.360]   In this case that crazy notion that you should go and buy razor blade first get it
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.000]   You know you get the cheap handle and then you buy the razor blade said four bucks a pop
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.160]   So expensive they lock them up at the at the drugstore
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:23.040]   I just it was crazy. I bought some Gillette blades before I found harry's. This was this was the turning point
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.240]   I had a
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:30.640]   You know, I was at target or something and I got them to unlock the racer blades and I got an eight eight blade thing and a
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.440]   And then and then I saw 32 dollars
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.440]   What?
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.600]   buying gold here
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:42.320]   So harry says that's not good either. That's why they bought the factory and they make the blades
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:48.160]   And deliver them directly to you. No lines. No plexiglass cases to unlock
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:53.600]   No wonder over a million guys now. I've made the switch to harry's so go to the website

[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:17.600]   I used to shave with a sword. It says somebody in the chat room
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:23.280]   I'm a chatte. I'm a chatte. This is better. Trust me. I'm a chatte don't shave
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.920]   So
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.560]   This all started with a bit torrent client called transmission. We've used it everybody's used it
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.720]   I think it was it's probably the number one bit torrent client on mac and tush
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.200]   somebody hacked their website
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.640]   And for a couple of days when you downloaded transmission from the website you didn't get
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.840]   the transmission you thought you were getting
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:54.560]   You got transmission with a malware installed kos 10 ke ranger a
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.680]   And it's ransomware
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:02.640]   Now this is something that's plagued the windows scene for a couple of years and it's very lucrative for the bad guys
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:08.640]   It uses strong encryption good encryption. We don't I don't know about ke ranger, but on the on the windows side
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.600]   crypto locker and it's ilk
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.520]   use
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.160]   You know strong encryption to encrypt your data
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.880]   And then pop up a thing saying hi
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.040]   You may notice your data is unusable. Well, if you were to send us
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:28.400]   Something like 40 bitcoin. That's what happened to the hospital in Pasadena. Actually, they usually ask for that much
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.720]   I was $17,000 40 bitcoin. We will send you the key you could unlock it
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:39.040]   There's a lot of problems with this first of all, you know, if you give them money, you're uh, you're funding
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.240]   cyber terrorism
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.160]   But also a lot of times you don't get a key that works or you never hear from them again
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.760]   So, you know the solution is having a good backup
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.560]   so rene
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:57.600]   Do we know anything more than what I just said the basic facts of it?
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.560]   No, I mean you're spot on at some point
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:06.080]   Transmission had this installed so people who downloaded it and they figure there might have been up to 6500 people
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.320]   Who downloaded it during that window? Not all of those people would have installed it immediately, of course
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.800]   But if you downloaded it and installed it then you would be infected with these files
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.880]   If those files hadn't phoned home yet and started doing the encryption process
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.400]   You can go into terminal and remove them if they had then
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:27.120]   If you're lucky enough where if you're smart enough to have a good backup strategy, you probably need to go back and roll
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:33.840]   You know use time capsule or backblaze or anything that does versioning which time capsule does will be okay because the
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.800]   What happens?
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.000]   Of course is once that's encrypted it's backed up by any backup tool
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.080]   So the most recent backup, you know, as soon as you discover that you're you probably already backed up the encrypted version of the file
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:49.360]   But but like with time machine you can go back versions and some of the at some point one of them will be unencrypted
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.880]   Yeah, and the interesting thing here
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:57.040]   I mean the good and bad thing here is it only affected you if you turned off use mac app store apps only because of course transmission is available
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.400]   On the web but they did have a trusted apple certificate a developer
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:06.320]   So yes, that's the key most the default and most people set it up so that I don't want to just limit myself to the app store
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.880]   But I have that middle setting which is as you said
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.320]   App Store or signed by apple in this case it was
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.280]   Yeah, so that means that it would launch if you double-click on it
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.600]   It would it would actually launch and let you go through the setup process
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:22.160]   How do they do that? How did the bad guys modify the file but not modify apples?
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:30.480]   Doesn't apples be certificate their own certificate they apply for the bad guys did yeah, they apply as a normal company as a legitimate company
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.360]   I forget the name of it
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:36.320]   But there was a legitimate company certificate on it they acquired it they signed with that certificate put it on there
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.600]   Now of course, it's midded apples alerted the good part of this process is that they can
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:45.280]   Add the definitions to x protect which is the built-in anti-malware function of of os 10
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.880]   And they also revoke the certificate
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:51.760]   Which means that if you hadn't launched it yet the next time you try to launch it gatekeeper activates and says this is corrupted
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:57.120]   Please trash it immediately and it will not allow it to run on your system. That's a good system
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:02.000]   Uh ku ranger asked for a single bitcoin a mere 400 dollars. Yeah
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.520]   Um
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.000]   So there's no guarantee that if you pay you'll actually be unlocked
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.040]   No guarantee this they're not leaving stuff on your computer to lock it again in three or six months and make sort of extortion
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.440]   We're out of it. So it's the ideal is always have a good backup strategy in place
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.040]   The certificate was given apple gave the certificate to a turkish company
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.040]   Yeah, uh, it has revoked those the certificate that's kind of
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.240]   Um
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:30.880]   Something that is important to know which is that apple apparently doesn't do a lot of due diligence before awarding a certificate
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.880]   It just gives them a kill switch
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.240]   Yes
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.560]   So that's I mean I think I does like we applied for one
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.560]   I think when we started doing our apps and and you had to go through a fairly rigorous process
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.800]   Like you had to prove that you're a company. Oh, okay
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.400]   They double checked a whole bunch of stuff
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.080]   They had make sure who was signing for the company and that that person was on the company
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.200]   I don't know what it may be different given the laws and jurisdictions in turkey
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:57.520]   But it was quite like we had the problem because mobile nations is doing like smartphone experts is doing business and mobile nations
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.480]   So they wouldn't accept mobile nations. We had to do it as the original company name
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.240]   So there was some rigmarole to get it set up. So it wasn't an easy process
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:10.480]   Steve Wong is asking on twitter if you had transmission and ran the normal update would you have been infected?
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:17.520]   It was in the installer. So that's the interesting thing about this the other reason is like you can't trust the installer anymore either obviously
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:22.400]   But if you're downloading some apps you download the entire app again and then you replace it some apps
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.160]   It does an installation in place and relaunches itself. I'm not familiar with transmissions
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.080]   Process so I don't want to ever say somebody is safe if there is some chance at risk
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:35.360]   So I would just burn the app to the ground and reinstall it fresh from the website if I had any it's okay now on the website
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.360]   It's fixed. Yeah
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:42.800]   And this is an open source project. So it's it was probably fairly simple for a bag I to download
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.280]   everything and and add this
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:51.680]   The the infected transmission installers added an extra file called general.rtf
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:57.360]   In the transmission dot app contents resources directory. So you could open the you know right click
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:04.640]   Show contents on the transmission app and go to the contents resources directory look for general.rtf
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:10.160]   It is not an rtf. It's a mako format except executable
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:17.200]   And there is a myth some people believe that open source software is inevitably safer and as we learn you know mac and tosh isn't safe for open source
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.200]   Isn't safer just because you can look at the code doesn't mean there's someone looking at every you know
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:27.280]   The billions and billions of lines of code you have to be careful no matter what kind of software you're running and scooter x in the chat room is telling me that
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.600]   What the transmission folks have done, which is great
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.080]   Uh if you update to 2.92
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:39.440]   It will detect and remove the malware installed by a 2.90 the rogue 2.90 install now
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.640]   That's a little nerve-wracking because you'd have to run the app and there's always a possibility
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.920]   Do we know of anybody who got bit was encrypted?
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:54.800]   I haven't seen anyone actually say it they just think they've I've seen mostly just potential numbers and methods for removing it
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:00.400]   But I assume I think it was Palo Alto that yeah the researchers that yeah Palo Alto networks
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:06.160]   They're security researchers. This is there. I'm looking at their website the post by clodshau and jin Chen
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.680]   They detected it probably somebody reported it. I would guess
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:18.800]   And so the kind of person running transmission might also be the kind of person running packets and ifers and running inspectors
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.480]   What processes are running permanently with little snitch help you in something like this
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:28.480]   It might so some of the things they were recommending and I hate saying recommending because this is not a mainstream solution
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:35.200]   Is that you run a bunch of monitoring tools that sort of looks for these kinds of changes looks for new persistent applications monitors network activity
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:40.960]   I don't think little snitch would necessarily help because all it does is tell you warn you if there's outbound activity that you haven't seen before
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:47.760]   So I don't know if there'd be outbound activity before you got encrypted before it called it's command and control and that starts the encryption process
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:52.640]   Right. I don't know is there yeah, maybe there's is there's command and control over it like a bot out there
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:58.480]   Maybe I believe they said this a couple days for it to phone home and start right who's supposed to take effect yesterday
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:02.240]   Yeah, so app again apples revoked the certificate
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:07.760]   So you wouldn't be able to install if you had if you downloaded over the weekend and you had a bad one gatekeeper will block it
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:13.120]   And uh, they've modified and this is actually really great this expert text
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.880]   Why don't you tell people about that? I don't know if everybody knows about that because it happens behind the scenes
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:22.480]   Yeah, so it's basically I think it will familiar with this on the windows side at least there's there's it's first party anti
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:31.280]   Malware and it basically it runs on os 10 apple continually updates the definition and it detects for known malware signatures when they're trying to get onto the mac
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:35.280]   Because you need them. It's just things are so complicated now you have to have multi-level security
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:39.680]   You have to stop things from getting on there. You have to you have to stop things from launching if they do get on there
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:43.840]   You have to have systems in place to prevent them from getting out of the sandbox of whatever they manage to infect
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.840]   If they do manage to infect those things
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:52.080]   So uh, x protect is that first line is those definitions that tries to stop anything from getting on your system that is known to be harmful
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:56.560]   Very good. And it's interesting especially now because you know the old theory was that you know
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.000]   There's no there's no
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.120]   Viruses or malware on the mac and part of the reason for that was economics
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:04.800]   The mac market share was so small that it literally was not worth people's time
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:10.240]   To go out and create these programs and and it was resilient enough that you probably wouldn't get a lot of victims
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:14.320]   And if you can't scale it then you're putting an awful lot of effort into getting just a few people
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.920]   But once you can find something it can affect a hundred a thousand ten thousand people
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:22.480]   Uh, you build it once you deploy it and then you hopefully get you know small amounts of money
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.560]   They're smart. They don't ask for a huge amount of money from everybody they try to make it almost like patent trolls
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:32.160]   They try to make it low enough that people will just a bitcoin surely you have one bitcoin lying around
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:36.480]   Absolutely and when you get to a certain amount of people and it's easy enough to make the software
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.480]   That's when you start seeing little outbreaks like this. Yeah
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:43.360]   Actually 400 bucks is not an insignificant amount of money if you got a thousand people
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:49.440]   Uh, you know and that the 6500 downloads in two days. You could easily have a thousand infected computers
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:54.480]   Yep, that's 400 thousand dollars. That's not insignificant and some guy in turkey
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.880]   Uh, probably an out-of-work programmer
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.960]   There was an episode of the good wife
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.920]   I think where they went through this where all their computers got encrypted and they kept trying to find out
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.480]   How do we pay you and it was harder and harder to actually pay it a person?
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.400]   Don't pay them a law enforcement will tell you that
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:12.320]   The solution is have a good backup and this if it didn't get bit good news, this is a little
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.440]   Warning bell for you to get something
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:20.400]   Uh, lots of you know, uh carbonite our sponsor carbonite works as you mentioned backblaze
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:24.720]   Time machine works something that does versioning even dropbox
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:28.560]   Like I keep my documents holder on dropbox. So a copy of everything I have is on dropbox
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.160]   Yeah, now the problem is if you have continual backup to dropbox
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:35.440]   At some point the crypt encrypted files are get backed up
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.080]   Um, so that's potentially
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:42.400]   Uh problem. So you want something with versioning. Yeah, I don't know if carbonite does versioning on mac and tasha
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:47.360]   It doesn't windows that's one of the other persons from dropbox. I don't know about that either. Oh, have you? Yeah, I think
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:55.280]   You can rewind on dropbox. Oh, that's one of the reasons that's one of the reasons why part of a backup strategy should include an air gap of some kind
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.920]   Meaning that i've got you you've got a at least one backup that is completely in amber
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:06.160]   It's on uh, if you've got your drop documents folder on a flash drive and you've unplugged it and it's in a drawer somewhere
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.120]   Or you've got a backup hard drive that's in a drawer somewhere
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:12.640]   Uh part of my strategy is that I have a separate NAS
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.640]   Uh, that does backup so that there is definitely a place that
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:25.200]   The important documents are two or three places that no automated software can get at it so that no worst case scenario
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:31.280]   Uh, I think that I think with my current strategy the very worst case is that i've got everything that I did as of
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.680]   At worst about two weeks ago
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:39.680]   So that so long as I can get at this physical media that is not attached to anything during those two weeks is not being backed up
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.840]   Uh, nothing can nothing can touch me except for losing two weeks worth of data
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.320]   And for the folks that are overly paranoid
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:50.800]   Uh, uh, I have about every quarter. I have the the key documents
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.680]   There's photos and certain things there's a little bit of expense to it
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:59.840]   But I the the most important photos and the most important other that's are saved on on drives and oftentimes
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:06.080]   I will about once a quarter every every six months the most have have another drive that actually holds those data and right now
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.240]   It's not that much it's less than a terabyte
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.520]   Um, that is not been updated. I have this little library
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:16.080]   Of of of stuff because if I get hacked, I want to be able to go back
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.560]   You know, I don't want to ever have written over that
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:22.560]   Um, and it has saved me a couple times when I've had bad drives and stuff like that
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.720]   It's probably a little excessive and at some point I usually you know, it's I don't keep them forever
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:32.000]   But um, you know, I want to make sure that I have six months to a year of of backups that I can um
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.560]   You know run back to that that I wasn't constantly updating so that I don't cost
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:41.360]   You know, possibly get something into the middle of it and if it's something was there for years then I'm in trouble
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:51.040]   And I think you posted uh this article from business insider a battle for the future of the app store
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:54.160]   Is brewing
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.480]   We've been talking about this for some
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:02.240]   Almost want to say years now in fact, I remember when the app store first came along it concerned me
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:08.400]   I was over. I was on it wasn't I was over concerned. It didn't it didn't turn out to be a problem
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.080]   But the idea that
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:15.120]   All apps would have to come be approved by apple and there were limits to what of course the app store
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.840]   uh, allowed
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.920]   Casey newton in the verge wrote a long
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.880]   uh piece last week
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:30.000]   Quoting a app developed named pick site which makes photo editing's uh software for the iphone and android
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.640]   uh, their revenues, um
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:38.960]   In 2014 I went you went up to a million dollars, but of course then google photos came out and that kind of killed that
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.760]   um
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:46.000]   They say at first the store looked like a the promised land for developers and it's early this day
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   You'd hear success stories of programmers quitting their full-time jobs to focus on iphone apps
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.840]   They they made his jokes that turn into smash hits
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:59.600]   But as the market got more crowded app developers had to work harder to get customers and keep them
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.040]   um
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.520]   Clash of clans, hise lem niecing doing it's our
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:13.040]   Ads arnel chorz and ager is doing ads for another competing game. Thanks, trike
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:21.280]   It's crazy. Um, so what is the why why are people worried about the app store?
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:28.400]   Uh, it's it's a two prong sort of thing number one that every company likes to be able to control its own destiny and they
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:35.920]   Developers feel as though they become in effect a subsidiary of apple or in microsoft's case a subsidiary of microsoft
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.800]   that if you have the ability to simply to uh,
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.040]   write
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:46.480]   apps to whatever standard that you feel is best for your users and best for your product without interference
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:53.520]   Then you can not you can basically transcend what the operating system can do you can you can uh transcend what the hardware can do
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:39:00.000]   And so when you're limited to a set of apis when you're limited to a set of rules it doesn't allow you to innovate
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.200]   uh
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:05.680]   The second problem is that oftentimes uh apple will really
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:12.320]   Really put a lot of demands on a developer that the developer feels has nothing to do with their own business
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:17.520]   Has everything to do with apple's business such as if you want they might want to get access to this data api
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:22.480]   But if they want to get if they want to access that api they also have to support every other api
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:28.240]   Which means that the windowing system for instance they have that works great for their ui is no longer compatible with this
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:34.720]   And so now instead of spending three weeks of project time adding this one new feature they wanted to add with this new api
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:40.960]   Now they've also got a five three or four or five weeks to rewrite their entire windowing windowing system to make a compatible
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:47.520]   Even though windowing has absolutely nothing to do with uh how this app functions or any extra value to the user
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:53.040]   So they feel as though they're helping apple to look a lot sexier with uh o s features
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:58.240]   Even though these aren't features that are going to benefit the company their own company or their users one tiny bit
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:03.040]   Uh, and then you get to the other long stint these this is like the the latest round of discussion
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:08.160]   The you always you also get to the problem where you the app store model kind of prevents
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:13.120]   A lot of developers from having that sort of intimate relationship with their customers
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:23.040]   Uh, I'll use the analogy of how I relate to the artists who do my favorite web comics and who write uh some of my favorite blogs and news blogs where I feel as though
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:26.000]   Uh, I know danielle caseto
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:33.360]   Uh when she does her girls with slingshots or uh, uh, steve or uh, uh, uh, uh, scott kertz when he does uh pvp online
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:39.680]   Because I have a one-to-one rela- they are serving me their product directly if they were working through a syndicate
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:46.800]   I wouldn't feel that way and therefore scott and danielle and these other creators wouldn't have the ability to know here's what andy likes
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.480]   Here's what our here's my readers likes here's what oh, they're really responding to this character
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:55.840]   So i'm going to give more story precedence to these characters or that t-shirt that we just I just offered as a whim
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.680]   Is selling gangbusters and people are ordering them two or three or four at a time
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.840]   So i'm definitely going to do more shirts like that
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:07.440]   They feel as though that they don't have the ability to build that sort of relationship and have that sort of knowledge of their customers
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.280]   That will help them to be more responsive to them because apple kind of
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.240]   in the guise of uh
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.920]   protecting consumers
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.920]   from the praying hands of
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.000]   being exploited by
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.120]   Their software providers are in a way preventing those software providers from giving them better service
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:31.200]   So it's it's I think that it's I'm not sure if a crash is coming so much as I think that there's going to be a point at which
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:37.280]   Uh, uh, a lot of developers are now are no longer going to be inclined to sell things through the app store
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:43.360]   We've already seen a couple of high profile pullouts. Uh, the most erudite one of course was rich segal
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:47.920]   Who decided that and his partner to bear bones who decided that bb edit
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:54.560]   It's just not worth all the all the amount of work they have to do for the limited reward of having a visibility in the app store
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:42:00.640]   It's just no longer worth it. And so there's the they always sold their product directly to consumers and now that's exclusively
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:06.160]   How they make their product available? It's funny that you know, all the things I was worried about with a mac app store are actually
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.880]   Becoming a cost for concern on windows
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:19.840]   Um, tim swainey who is the guy behind gears of war? He's at epic games wrote a editorial in the guardian saying microsoft wants to monopolize games development on the pc
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:25.920]   We must fight it and it's because they have this universal windows platform initiative and they basically
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.920]   They're pushing for everything to be developed for this closed
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.320]   store platform
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:39.520]   That's that's a particularly big problem with games because you have no appreciation for exactly how clever those developers are
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:46.480]   How good they are at finding hidden pockets of extra pro extra processing power that's inside a platform
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.920]   That's the reason why
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.000]   What a new uh gaming platform comes out
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.800]   The first games are really really good and it's using all the features that the new game platform and the new hardware gives you for free
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:01.360]   But then the second third fourth generations. It's like an entirely new piece of hardware
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:07.360]   It's not because microsoft has improved the the software of the xbox one. It's because developers
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:10.000]   Uh, we're able to figure out that
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:17.120]   If we do an end run under this little bottleneck, we can actually increase the frame rate significantly given that we don't need these
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.800]   Atmospheric effects for this for this scene that we're doing
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.760]   That's a way that we can make things a lot more responsive and here's a way we can
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:31.120]   Make a make our our inputs a lot faster and a lot more reflexive and here's how we're supposed to only get four channels
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:36.160]   Through this signal here's a way we can get actually six channels out of it over and over and over again
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:40.880]   But when you uh are limited to exactly what the what the uh maker
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:48.160]   Let's you do that means that you can't make a game that's as good as it can possibly and that is just fundamentally frustrating
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:52.320]   This is this did not happen on and it was one of my concerns with the mac app store
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.280]   But it did not happen on the mac app store, but it's starting to happen on the windows side
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:01.520]   This is what swiney writes the specific problem here is that microsoft's shiny new universal windows platform is locked down
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.080]   And by default, it's impossible to download
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:11.120]   uwp apps from the websites of publishers and developers to install them to update them and to conduct commerce in them
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:17.360]   Uh outside of the windows store. He's replaced the mac store or the iphone store with windows and you know
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.160]   That was the concern a lot of people and myself included had
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.360]   Um, there is still a brisk
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:29.200]   For on the desktop. There's still a brisk ecosystem outside of the app store, but there isn't on the iOS side
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.040]   I mean it's app store or nothing
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:35.920]   It's super interesting because for a long time. I you know, I love india apps if you look at the home screen on my iphone
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:39.120]   It's almost all india everything from the tweet bots to the fantastic als
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.240]   I love them dearly, uh, and then and I was just saying you know apple
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:45.760]   I don't know why they're not doing this. Why aren't they doing upgrades? Why aren't they doing?
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.560]   Uh trials, why aren't they doing this or that?
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.320]   Um, and it's super frustrating especially when a lot of your friends are indie developers
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:53.760]   And this is how they've always made their money
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.520]   But it was it was interesting to me that the last time I was out there
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:03.760]   I met with an uh an indie developer a really well-known one and whose name i'm not going to use because they believe their views would be highly
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.000]   Unpopular amongst their their friends
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.880]   But they sort of were were rethinking their future and not saying that I need to be outside of this
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.880]   But that I don't understand that there is a fundamental change that's been happening
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.120]   That's sort of the invention of pop apps
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.960]   And the when we were talking about it
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:23.360]   It was like almost like when wooden toys started to become plastic toys and the mom and pop toy stores
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:27.280]   Became toys or us and you did lose that direct contact with your customers
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:32.000]   And you did learn you lost all that artisanal that beautiful work that went into it for years
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.240]   And now you have very low cost very cheap very mass produced plastic toys
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:41.280]   And you hear a lot of things like if apple pulled this lever or that lever and then you look at the google play store where
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.480]   They're far fewer restricted. They have far fewer rejections
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:48.320]   All of these things are way more open and they are the sum total of zero better apps
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.840]   I mean some people like launchers, but launchers aren't the apps that change the world is apps like uber
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:57.040]   It's apps like instagram and those apps are proven to be just fine on iOS games like candy crush
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.200]   You're making a fortune on both platforms
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:05.360]   And they're absolutely not the apps that i'm interested in but I come from sort of this golden age of computing when things did grow
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:11.200]   From independent developers like you know rich seagull who's app you'll have to take out of my cold dying hands one day
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.640]   I use it every day, but I don't think my mom has ever heard of it
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:20.080]   And I don't think the the millions and hundreds of millions of people who are now coming into computing through smartphones
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:24.480]   Have heard or even think about all these beautiful independent apps that to me are the cornerstone
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:30.800]   Of the experience and I think we are really in a change and you have sort of the developers who existed before
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:35.600]   The advent of mobile and app stores and the very beginning years when there was a gold rush
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:40.880]   Into the ones coming in now and where it will be sort of just like amazon is putting little bookstores out of business
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:44.560]   And walmart is putting little general stores out of business these massive companies
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.200]   Are going to be the ones owning the future of apps
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.640]   And even if you say like we're going to protect you from like apple is going to provide all these new
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.840]   These new incentives to make apps more valuable again
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:58.400]   Doesn't stop a vce or amazon or google from making a free version of your app anyway
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:03.760]   The way that that apps are profitable and successful has completely changed and i'm not sure there's any going back
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:07.760]   Well, and I think that also this is a trajectory that happens in almost every industry
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:12.240]   You know, so whether you're talking about oil or you're talking about the railroads or you're talking about
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:17.760]   Uh the movie industry, you know, there was there was a rush where suddenly anybody could do it at any point in time
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:21.600]   They didn't have to have business sense. They didn't have to have marketing sense. They had a good
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:26.160]   Core of an idea and they were able to be in the right place at the right time
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:33.920]   Uh, and then you know almost always that eventually gives way to a winnowing of of the of the market where you know
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:39.840]   Out of that comes larger companies and out of that comes people who really understand
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:44.480]   Um, you know either really understand their technology or really understand marketing or a little bit of both
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:48.720]   Uh, and so I think that what we're seeing here is is what I would consider a natural
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:55.200]   Maturation of the of the market which is that is that you really do have to really understand how you're going to make money
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.720]   At the business that you're you're doing not how you're going to market it
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:02.640]   How are you going to you know grow it how you know and have a clear idea of what that looks like?
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:06.720]   And I think we're going to see you know another set of companies coming out and I do think it's harder now
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:11.520]   It's going to be harder to uh, you know, quote unquote break in there's so many apps out there
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:16.800]   They're probably already do most of what you thought of so and if you have if you come up with something original
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.280]   Uh, you know, you have to you know, I
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.480]   I just think that that's the you know, and it isn't it
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.760]   It isn't going to be as easy as it was before
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:30.000]   Um, and I think that that that's kind of just a reality of of any
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.560]   industry that that begins to mature
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:36.880]   Oh, but that's that's the real problem. I think is not uh maturing
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:40.480]   Uh, the the ability of a company to compete mature
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:48.320]   It really is almost a I don't want to say first amendment, but it's a you want to have give programmers and creators as
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:52.000]   Many opportunities for free expression as possible
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.880]   And think about right right now think about how uh podcasting works
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.400]   Where anybody can simply record audio
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:03.360]   And release it and they've got a podcast
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:09.360]   Doesn't matter if they're using they if they're using the microphone on their laptop and they're typing while they're using that microphone
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:13.120]   Doesn't matter if they keep burping into the microphone
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:19.360]   Doesn't matter if they're just talking about a nail hole in a piece of wall stud that's uh, that's eight feet away for them
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:23.280]   And they're so high that they forget this talk for 20 minutes at a time
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:27.440]   Nobody can stop them from doing that and that's the reason why there's so many
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:32.160]   Fundamentally and heroically bizarre and wonderful podcasts out there
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.600]   uh
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:34.800]   We can have
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:40.320]   fundamentally wonderful and bizarre apps out there and I can download a wonderful bizarre and
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:48.080]   Stupid heroically stupid app for my mac or for my raspberry pie or any mac or any pc that allows me to simply
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:50.720]   Download a piece of arbitrary software and run it
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:56.720]   But once we have a problem we have a problem with the ios for instance where a piece of software cannot run on it
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:01.680]   Unless somebody at someone who was not attached to that creative process said all right
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:05.760]   We think that our users should be able to take a look at this piece of software
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.880]   I mean
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:10.000]   There apple famously had its ban on flashlight apps and fart apps
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.960]   And it's not as though the world was waiting for a great fart app to be out there, but
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:17.520]   who's
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.520]   if they're going to turn down something that
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:25.200]   999,999 people agree is stupid and a waste of time
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:29.280]   You're still denying it to that one person who's kind of curious about it as kind of interested
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:36.080]   And you never know when you're going to get when you're turning down the next lonie's monk because you don't understand that kind of music and it's just noise
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.200]   Anywhere and it's not good enough. So that's why as
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:45.040]   A user positive as a lot of the controls that apple puts on the ios app store are
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:48.000]   We have to acknowledge that there's also a cost to that
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:54.480]   Because create programming and game development particularly they are creative arts and sometimes
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.680]   You cannot understand
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:02.320]   Somebody who's taking something to the next level and that's the reason why
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:09.120]   Picasso paintings didn't sell at the very beginning and that's why van gole sold only one painting in his lifetime
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:12.560]   He was a nut until everyone caught up with him and then he wasn't a nut anymore
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:15.600]   Well, by the kind of life isn't it you're a nut until you're not
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.120]   I think it's my career on this
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.600]   But I don't see I don't see a lot of people
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.080]   I mean I feel a lot of people complaining about it or some people complaining about it
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:28.000]   I don't see a lot of people jumping to android to to solve that problem where they have a lot more freedom
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.480]   You know and I and I think that part of the issue is that and then some of them have I mean
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:35.200]   I think some of them have decided to go that direction, but I think that
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:40.640]   The vast majority stick are trying to figure it out in the iphone ecosystem because there's a lot
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:43.600]   I think traditionally there's been a lot more money in the iphone
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:49.520]   Ecosystem even though it's a smaller part of the market and and I think that some of that has to do with the controls
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:52.560]   Some of that has to do with the ease of I don't have to worry about certain things
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:55.520]   I you know things are going to kind of work through there and I think so the eco
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.200]   You know man, you know and I don't know
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.400]   I don't necessarily think that all of it's perfect the way that apple does it
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.960]   But I think that it it is a fragile
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:09.120]   Environment and I think that it you know changing those things may change that environment where it becomes more difficult
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.920]   I think that you know given the price of apps
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:16.960]   You know, I buy them fairly often and I don't worry about them. I don't worry about you know, whether they're going to be you know
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:22.400]   There's going to be you know, malware or or other things. I maybe I should more than I do
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.920]   But I you know, it's it's a very easy to use ecosystem. I you know
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:32.560]   And I choose to buy on the desktop. I bet you a lot of apps that aren't in the app store rarely
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:33.840]   Really?
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:37.600]   You know for me if an app is more than a less than a hundred dollars and it's not on the app store
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:43.360]   It's got to be I have to die for it like it's not really like it's I've kind of stopped, you know, now
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:46.000]   they're after you don't worry about a mono culture kind of
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:52.560]   Killing creativity as Andy's describe I restart my you know, I get a new computer and I and I go into the
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:57.760]   Into the app store and I just click everything that going down and then I go back and I have lunch and I when I come back
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:02.320]   My computer is the way it was before, you know, and and the thing is is that that is so valuable to me
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:06.320]   I I it used to be this thing that I'd not want to update my computer
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:12.080]   Not want to move to a new computer because I was like, oh now I have to figure out where all the installers are and where all my serial numbers
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:16.160]   Are and then I have to do this and and you know, and I think that that is
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:19.360]   You know, those are the kind of things that I don't have to do anymore
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:23.760]   And so there are definitely apps, you know, whether it's the Adobe apps or playback pro or
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:27.920]   Nuke or other things that are high-end that I get that they don't want to go 30%
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.480]   I'm going to use that product, you know
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:33.840]   For a variety of reasons and I'll and I'll work with them directly
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:40.400]   I wish that they were in the app store make it easier, but I understand I understand them for those large costs
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:42.400]   but for the smaller ones I
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:49.680]   You know, I it's just too much trouble for me to deal with little apps that that I I'm gonna have to go find and figure out how to install and
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:56.480]   Everything else and so and there's a handful of apps that I've done that with in the past and every time I install them and they're you know, inexpensive apps
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.960]   Unless they're specifically
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:04.720]   I bought them because they break the app Mac App Store, you know, like little stitch or whatever it the
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:08.240]   You know, I
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:13.600]   You know, it's just like oh, I can't believe I'm doing this and I and I really lean towards things that are Mac App Store
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.760]   if given two
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:19.200]   Applications that close to each other like oh, they almost do the same thing
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:21.920]   I'll get the app Mac App Store one because I just don't want to do it
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.920]   It does make it easy when you get a new Mac
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:29.360]   What's funny for us is that for every complaint we get that you know, there may be the app store is too controlling from especially from developers
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:35.200]   We get a bunch of complaints from people who just say there's too many apps in there that they wish that there'd be less that there's so much noise
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:40.960]   The discoverability is terrible. They don't need a million apps. They only need maybe, you know, a few thousand really good ones
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:44.880]   If you don't like the Mac App Store go to go use the windows app store
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:50.800]   Well, but I'm not gonna get back to me like people who come from console models like the development is so different it's thousands of dollars for an emulator
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:56.400]   It's really hard to get your apps in there. There are only a few apps available and it's very clean customer experience
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:55:01.920]   And it's a very high quality. You know, especially the previous days is a very high quality experience and the app store isn't that either
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.560]   I think one of the issues is it's not a flea market
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:09.040]   It's not a complete open flea market where anything goes, but it's not a highly-created boutique either
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:11.280]   It's something that has sort of the stuff you want
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:15.680]   But so much of it you can never really find exactly what you want and then it becomes, you know, consumer issue
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:19.520]   Yeah, Peter Bright our friend Peter Bright and ours teckika says
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.920]   Rebutts Tim Sweeney's art editorial on the Guardian saying the PC honestly is a bit of a mess
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:32.480]   We really we really need the universal with this platform because the PC platform is you know
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:35.360]   is and so
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:39.680]   It's clear. There's two sides to it the walled garden has some advantages
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:46.400]   It also has some strong disadvantages and I think right now apple the way apple's done on the desktop is is a nice balance
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.560]   You could argue that on the phone and the tablet it's not
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:53.600]   Uh, you know, it's a little bit more. I'll walk it. Let's transmit it
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:58.480]   But it also stops a lot. Yeah, right and but it makes more sense on a mobile platform. You really do want to kind of
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:05.040]   Constrain the mobile platform and apple get some real advantages on iOS in battery life and other things by being very restricted
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:09.040]   There's no perfect system. There's no perfect system. They're pros and cons to each
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:13.520]   Let's take a break come back. We're gonna talk more with our panelists
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:21.360]   Of course, it's really nice every Tuesday get together with you guys because they know everything and he not go from the chicago sun times and
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:27.040]   Alex lindsey from pixel core rene richie from imore and mobile nations
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:31.600]   What did you do at mobile nations meet up thing?
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:35.280]   So one of the things is that we're a highly dispersed company
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:41.120]   So like my boss kevin lives in winnipeg and phil who runs androids centrals in florida and down who runs windows central is in boston
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:45.760]   And we usually only see each other at ces, but then we're all so busy. We can't actually spend any time together
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:49.760]   So this year we decided that we'd send less people to ces and then i'll get together
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:56.080]   Uh in end of february beginning of march and just you know have a good idea to talk or yeah, or we can't together
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:00.560]   It's all looks like fun. I saw your pictures and serenity's pictures and it was gonna be fun
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:02.640]   But then they all had to review their sam songs
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:06.960]   But you got to play with three different s7s
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:12.800]   Yeah, because you have three different editors that had s7s that was a weird thing though because i got uh mine
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:16.480]   Just because i bought it team mobile sent me my last week
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:21.200]   And then today the embargoes went off and everybody could suddenly is reviewing the s7
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:24.960]   I feel like gee I should have made a bigger deal of the fact that I had this
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:31.680]   A week ahead everybody as much as people criticize apple pr for being controlling they are just super well organized
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:35.200]   I mean last year samsung canada just gave out the phones and said hey do whatever you want with them
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:38.240]   And then reviews were coming out while the american media was losing their minds
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:43.920]   And this year they just said carriers go ship go ahead ship and again people are getting their phones while all the people who have
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:47.120]   Review units can't say anything about it in their lives in their mind of money
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:53.600]   Okay, they're they're also not having to pay for phones. Yeah, I cost me 800 bucks for this privilege
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:57.600]   Of privilege. I'll also say that one one thing that's sort of been on my mind
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:00.720]   And I don't feel as though this sort of organized
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:06.320]   Having embargo dates all in for everybody at the same date. I'm not saying there's anything nefarious about it
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:09.200]   I'm just saying that one of the side effects of that
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:14.160]   Is always going to be that there is going to be a huge flood
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:18.320]   media attention all coordinated on this one day
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:25.040]   When samsung or apple or any other whatever companies are ranging this can time it so that they can take advantage of all the attention
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:29.920]   That's getting and if instead they either went to a lottery system or if they simply said, okay
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:34.160]   The Canadian we're just gonna send our Canadian subsidiary is going to send those out on this day
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:38.000]   We're going to nus on this day. We're going to end in the uk on that other day
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:45.600]   You feel as though it it feels a little less like as a member of the media you're being conscripted as part of the marketing plan
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:49.120]   That's why I buy. I mean, I'm I'm lucky I feel lucky that I can afford to
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:58.080]   To buy these because I now 99 out of 100 times on the one who's a week behind because I have to wait till it comes out and buy it
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:01.840]   Um, it's funny. He's hearing the cracking was like twit on sunday
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:07.040]   And I know he had one but he couldn't even say that he had one so I'm talking all of that and he's just gotta go
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:11.360]   Well, one of the things like like leo you're an influencer like people will wait and hear your opinion
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:14.240]   They don't necessarily want to know about the galley. They don't want to really want to read a review
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:15.760]   They want to know what you think about it
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:20.480]   But not all journalists have that so for them if if some people have it earlier and get to review it earlier
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:24.960]   No one else cares by the time they get to it and literally no one else cares and that's how they feed their families
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:28.080]   For them it becomes a problem. Yeah, I mean yeah, I don't
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:35.360]   I'm not a print journalist. I don't I don't have any lead time and and frankly I don't need to be the first to review anything
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:38.240]   I appreciate you're saying those kind words. I don't think that that's the case
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:44.640]   But I don't I don't feel an urgency as long as we can get it roughly when everybody else is getting it and people are making the decision
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:50.720]   Whether to buy it or not like these weeks are now. No one's looking for galaxy s7 review. Yeah. Well, the truth is I
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:56.000]   I don't know if that's true. I mean, that's one of the things about google search is great is you don't really look at the review until
[00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:02.640]   You're in the market for a phone and then having all those reviews out there even six months or a year later is very useful
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:10.000]   Yeah, when when I write something I'm hoping that I'm running something valuable enough that someone who is not necessarily buying an iPad
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.400]   The first week is coming out when they've got the money three months from now or when their last iPad dies six months from now
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:20.320]   I'll still have something that's in depth and and valuable that will that will stand out
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.000]   I think that there's a need for all kinds of coverage. There's definitely there
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:29.040]   To to play my own devil's advocate there's ad okay
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:34.720]   There's also a lot of people that have our first hearing about the galaxy s7 on the week that's being released
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.320]   And that's the time when they've got their first level of interest in learning more about it
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.800]   So there's there's there's need for pretty much everything
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.120]   So I'm not I'm not denigrating anybody else's
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:49.040]   Likewise, like I don't even think the review is that important. I would much prefer to write hell like the minute I get the phone or the watch
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.640]   My mission is to write as much help content. Yeah, that's a great
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:59.600]   Yeah, me too. That's a great positioning review is kind of a secondary. Yeah, I think I've often thought that the reason why you don't call
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:04.080]   You call your site iMores because the missing manual dot com is already we're already taking
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.080]   right
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:11.040]   Um, well, we're gonna did a great did a great thing about apple pencil by the way. Oh, I love that. I don't know if that's in the show notes that was
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.720]   That was not what did she say what did she talk about?
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:17.200]   She did a she did a cartoon comic book review of a
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:22.960]   Really in-depth after several months review of apple pencil and she drew it with the apple pencil
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:27.440]   So it's not like bullet point a bullet point b had h2 level one
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:32.160]   It was basically her drawing and cartoon versions of her talking about well. Okay. Yes
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.280]   It's kind of it kind of sucks that there's no eraser, but I find myself I got over it and also the
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:42.480]   The the charging port is good and that you can also if you to prevent yourself from losing the tip
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:47.200]   You can magnet you can magnetically click it into the magnets that are on the that are on the ipad
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:52.640]   And it's just the sort of thing that it gets your attention and even if you weren't particularly interested in the topic
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:59.040]   You will read it anyway because it's just such such lively content and so nicely put together
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:02.640]   And that for me that that's something that I think is such a great goal
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:07.360]   It's something that I've been pursuing for my entire career that I want to I want to create something
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:11.120]   That's interesting enough that whether you care about the topic or not you're gonna take a look at it
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.520]   And as someone who's had an apple pencil
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:17.840]   Several months. Yeah, it's she's just she's just aces
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.760]   Renee is she an artist or is she is she just kind of an answer?
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:28.880]   She wears many hats Leo. I mean she can sing she can do plays. She can act. She can draw. She can roll a skate
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.680]   Just everything. Yeah, I mean you know what she's really good at is pictures of herself
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:41.360]   She's a good cartoonist. She is she does. I mean that character character is really great. I really like it
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:44.480]   This is a very good review for something like the pencil, isn't it?
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.440]   And it's a unique situation the feedback that no one wants her to do anything but these from now on
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:53.040]   Yeah, just do anything all of your reviews just be drawn. Thank you very much
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:58.960]   And this is this is what I'm talking about. This is some of the people couldn't even get the pencil like the first month
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:04.480]   Uh, and they might have forgotten they might have lost that sort of oh, it's brand new. It's only a hundred bucks
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:08.160]   I'll buy it. I'll buy it. I'll buy it and now that's three months later. They're like, oh, maybe I don't know
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:13.840]   Maybe I don't even use a pencil that much and now later on is the time when they'll start looking for information like this
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.280]   And a piece like this will just absolutely lay out ears
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:22.400]   I've been using this for two or three months. I am an act as you could I'm demonstrating to you that I am an artist
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:29.920]   So it's not as though. I'm just someone who's who's you know drawing pictures of poop emojis with the with a magic marker tool
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:33.280]   And so I can give you a really good in depth and informed thing
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:38.640]   This is this is the this is the sort of thing where a year from now people are still going to want to take a look at this
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:44.560]   To learn especially as new iPads come out that that use the apple pencil
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:50.480]   This is really really great. Just epic. Yeah, so um speaking of review units
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:57.840]   I guess apple's event according to the rumor mill is a week from next monday almost two weeks from today
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.320]   21st
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:04.000]   And that means you guys will get your invites if you get one next week
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.480]   Right, usually it's a week ahead of time
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:11.600]   No invites yet, right? No, I've heard of no not not in time to get your
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:16.880]   Exactly. It doesn't matter. Yeah, of course. Why should we give you a lead and you leave?
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.280]   That's the great. That's the great thing about apple
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:25.200]   You will have your frequent flyer miles available for vacations and things like that because you're not going to be able to use them
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.960]   That's why they do that
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:32.320]   They want to make sure that you can go to you'll you'll have him accrued enough
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:36.720]   You can actually afford to get that free flight to Paris to take spends a little time for yourself
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.920]   Yeah
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:44.080]   And my guess it'll be like a town hall thing because if if it was moved around it has to be a venue that apple can move around and
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:49.680]   If it's a smaller event and they have that facility on campus that's much easier for them to sort of coordinate and control and soon
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:56.400]   That's the vibe i'm getting for the content. It feels like more of a town hall event than of a get 800 people
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:04.720]   Cheering minimum plus wevered jaded ink stain stain ruches or are typing was there people talking in uh in about a year
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:07.120]   probably in time for um
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:13.760]   If they do a spring event next year certainly in time for the iphone 8 announcement will be going to the apple campus
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:18.480]   And they just put the lid on it. They put the lid on look at this giant carbon fiber
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:21.200]   Ability is like wallie
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:22.320]   Oh my gosh
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:26.640]   That is the largest according to apple freestanding carbon fiber roof ever made
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:31.360]   Is the renderings the renderings of it. I'm just like uh maiden Dubai
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.960]   Um
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.520]   The home of stupid architecture Dubai
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:43.040]   Yeah, I would downplay that yeah, I wouldn't make you but they were the only people who had to do it premiere composite
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.760]   I guess you know how many bakers gave their lives for that roof
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:49.760]   The circular roof is made up of 44 identical radial panels
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:55.520]   I was more thinking about like all the workers who were like sealed inside there so that the secrets of the
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:59.740]   Mothership would not never build up the escape. This is not the whole campus
[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:04.060]   This is just that theater that will be the the new venue for apple events
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:09.820]   Um, it is a thousand seat theater with 360 degree views of the campus
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:13.740]   And then stares down to the event area, which is underground
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:18.380]   Yes, sort of like the new york apple store you go in and then go down 80 tons
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:22.940]   It's a 44 identical panels. There it is. There's another picture of it
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:24.780]   um
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.780]   70 feet long 11 feet wide
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:34.140]   All connected to a central hub position in the middle and I guess they assembled the whole thing before dropping it on the uh, so
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:37.980]   Then the 2018 do we get apple campus s is that how this works now?
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:44.540]   I was wondering if like each one of those glass panels has one of those like little laminated plastic things on a tab
[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:47.580]   You have to pull off like on the island to protect it
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:50.300]   Wow, that is so sweet
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:56.220]   That is just it must be fun for the the guys and gals building this to have to be there watching this
[01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:58.220]   Yeah, largest
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:05.100]   These big construction projects are so cool because if you go back the the gimbal they had to they had to build a really complicated gimbal
[01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:07.580]   Just to lower that thing in
[01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:11.660]   And that after that thing is installed that other piece of metal will be recycled
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:16.140]   I'll show a bunch of engineering when it just building this ring so they could crane it in
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:20.460]   Yeah, and i'll be interested to see if they do i'm i can only imagine that they are
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:27.900]   Creating a bunch of behind the scenes of how it was built because a lot of times not only are you building very specific items for this bit
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:31.580]   But sometimes very specific machines to build, you know stuff at this level
[01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:36.620]   And so it'll be interesting to see if anything was developed, you know, but it just i mean the renders just look stunning
[01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:40.940]   You know and and you know obviously we fully expected to look like the renders so
[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:49.340]   Um, just just looks amazing. Where did uh, where did mashable get these images? They oh, courtesy apple. So yeah, those were the original renders
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:53.420]   I think yeah, but then the pictures of the actual installation were distributed by apple and mashable
[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:58.140]   So and you think you apples now going to be probably you know every event once this opens
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:01.980]   You know every apple announcement is going to be most likely coming from here
[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:07.820]   maybe ww dc will be the one time they come out of the out of the uh spaceship and uh
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:11.980]   You can just see how much uh influence it could have on on uh
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:18.220]   Uh folks when you just walk into something so yeah, you want to awe the presses they walk in make them feel small and an
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:21.580]   They were also doing the same things like for the last uh iphone event
[01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:24.460]   They paid millions of dollars to put air conditioning into that
[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:29.980]   Venue because it just wasn't any in there's they installed temporary air conditioning nice
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:34.300]   It's a ridiculous stage that they all basically throw away at the end of it at least be
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:37.340]   Sad I think I will never ever be allowed inside
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:41.980]   Never seen ever Leo that's life. No, I don't even want to go now
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:46.780]   I I don't know why I got a I got invited to an apple event once
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:50.380]   I used to get invited every apple event. I don't know what happened, but uh
[01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:56.220]   After the skype session, I don't you know people say that I don't think well. That was the last one. Was it?
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:09:02.460]   Was that the last one that coincidence? Yeah, you're right, right? That was the last one I got to go to was uh the uh
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:04.780]   original ipad announcement
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:09.420]   Um, but you know what I feel grateful that I got to see all of this almost all the steep jobs announcements
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:15.580]   Um, that was you know, that's really why you want to go. I don't I see it as well now from my seat here
[01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:19.820]   Watching the stream as I would if I were in the studio in the in the theater. So I'm fine
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:23.500]   I don't want to drive to wall the way to segues this guy. I have to admit
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:27.500]   I'm really fine with just watching the stream. I'm fine. That's fine. I would love to go to this
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:33.580]   Theater this new theater when it opens at one point if you're listening apple. I'm not anti apple. I'm not
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:36.300]   Our show today. Uh, by the way
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:42.540]   It's very timely brought to you by gazelle because yes, we were pretty sure in two weeks. There's gonna be a new iphone
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:47.340]   You know what happens when the new iphone comes out. Well two things happen first of all your
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:52.380]   Existing phone drops in value. Well, it's been dropping in values as the day it came out. That's what happens
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:58.700]   So now would be a very good time to go to gazelle.com and lock yourself into a 30-day quote
[01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:01.340]   Now you're really not locked in they're locked in they're promising you

[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:27.500]   Google microsoft
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:32.540]   Um, so that's one of the things that happens when a new iphone's and that's the other one is a lot of people sell their old iphones
[01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:37.420]   So this is a great time to go to gazelle or will be soon a great time to go to gazelle to buy
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:40.060]   Yeah, they sell the best stuff they get

[01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:20.060]   Hardware defects and everything. So this is really nice
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:26.460]   You don't have to but you can I love that help is available 24/7 a process claims a return your device
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:28.860]   Should you have a problem?

[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:38.940]   gaz
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:41.020]   And the time to do that is right
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:48.540]   Now as we approach a new iphone. I like it that they're splitting up the iphone announcements to twice a year
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:55.420]   iPhone se any new rumors we I think we've covered this all that we mentioned last week that the new
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:12:00.140]   iPad won't be an air. They'll call it a pro. It'll be air size 10.9 inches
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:02.700]   Uh, but it will support the pencil
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:08.300]   And all that stuff is market. I mean they can lock in any name they want up up until the very last could all change
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:15.420]   Yeah, but the idea is that the iphone whatever five se the just the iphone se is that people still love four inch iphones
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:18.140]   Even if it's only nine or ten percent that's still tens of millions of people
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:20.940]   And just like with the ipod touch if you can give those people
[01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:27.580]   Incredible experience by putting in an a nine and putting in a new i-site camera and doing those things then why wouldn't you do it?
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:32.300]   It makes them happy it allows you to have different screen sizes so you can segment your market a little bit
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:36.220]   It gives you differentiation between your flagships and really everybody benefits
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:39.340]   And by the same token you add the features that everybody loves about the ipad pro
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:42.860]   Uh, but some people don't just don't want that size is too big for them
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:48.380]   So you put all that into the 9.7 inch form factor and whether that's an air three or a pro is again marketing decision
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:53.020]   But those features are what matter to people and giving it to them in the best way possible is what matters to apple
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.540]   Yeah, I think for you know for me
[01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:58.940]   I mean I we're gonna buy a bunch of iPhones for our employees and we're about to update them
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:01.580]   We had a whole bunch of older ones that are no
[01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:03.580]   Batteries aren't working anymore
[01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:07.100]   And so we're gonna upgrade a bunch of them and it's just much easier if it didn't cost quite so much
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:10.940]   You know, I'd love to say that i'm gonna get everyone a six s plus but probably not
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:15.500]   Listening if my guys are listening probably do we know what these are plus do we know what these are gonna cost
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:22.700]   They're usually less that slot if they apple keeps the slot the same and they've been usually very good about that it starts at 450
[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:26.540]   450 bucks on law. That's a good price
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:31.740]   And for me the big thing is just the the the camera because we we actually have very business
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:35.900]   Business uses for it. We're at a lot of sites that we have to you know take pictures of and so on and so forth
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:40.220]   So if the camera is relative close to the success, which it sounds like it's going to be
[01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:44.380]   To me, it's kind of an automatic and I think you could I could imagine a lot of companies
[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:48.940]   You know issuing phones that are a little smaller as well. Plus it fits in my tiny clutch
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:51.180]   Yeah
[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:53.180]   A lot of companies have been covering a lot of different best that way
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:56.700]   But one of the other interesting things is if apple decides to
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:03.740]   Not even bother putting a digit on that new phone if they just simply call the se
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:08.060]   Which would sort of track with what they've been doing with the iPad a couple years ago
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:12.940]   They decided to try to stop calling it the ipad three the ipad four the ipad five
[01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:19.260]   And simply say here is where we're going to describe what the role of this thing is no matter what hardware we put into it year after year
[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:26.300]   After year, there's certainly instead of for them to do that with to keep a number with their prestige iPhone because
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:30.300]   Part of the reason why iphones so so well is that
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:38.380]   Society can shame you in saying oh you have the iphone five oh five is a lower number than six isn't it? Oh, that's too bad
[01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:43.100]   That's good. That's right. Yeah, but but the but the the purported se phone
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:49.100]   It's not there for people to be impressed with the phone that you got it's it's a phone that's going to support a specific
[01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:53.500]   Role in the lineup so maybe they'll just simply say we'll just call this the se and every year or so
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:58.220]   We'll keep bumping it up and also reduces expectations that there's going to be a new one each and every year
[01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:02.540]   Uh, which again doesn't really work towards apples interest me if they don't have a real
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:08.540]   Need or desire or they don't think they can really get those first adopters to convert
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:15.180]   To second generation or third generation of hardware people you may as well just simply say that we have this one product mark
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:19.900]   And we just keep updating the hardware like the iPod touch. I think it was what three years when from a five to an eight
[01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:23.340]   Yeah
[01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:28.380]   Yeah, and I could I could definitely see something where it's every other year or every third year that they update the se
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:33.820]   You know and um, you know, I think that especially if you look at folks that aren't going to buy it out right
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:36.460]   You know, you know gonna theoretically possibly get it for free
[01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:41.900]   um, you know waiting for their two-year terms to to add up could make a lot of sense as well
[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.940]   I um
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:47.420]   New watch bands
[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:50.700]   Pretty excited about that. Yeah
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:54.140]   Uh, what is this so as we watch
[01:15:54.140 --> 01:16:00.220]   Reading tea leaves here, but we watch new betas came out for all the stuff right are we gonna expect
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:06.700]   Anything announcements, uh on the 21st about new o s's will we see a new o s?
[01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:09.340]   Well, nine point three nine
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:12.140]   iOS nine point three apple tv o s nine point two
[01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:14.140]   Those come out on the 21st you think
[01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:18.300]   Uh, yeah, I mean one of two things it depends if we see the golden master earlier than the final versions
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:22.940]   But apple typically does a gold master on that date that announces the release date sometime when the device is ship
[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:26.940]   Got it that way developers can test the final version, but there'll only be one new device
[01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:29.340]   They're not gonna ship new watches new television. I
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:33.900]   Well, there's gonna be two is gonna be the uh, the the smaller ipad pro the seven i was seven
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:35.500]   It's ipad pro and the i-c
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.020]   So that would be reason to do iOS for sure
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:41.660]   And it's it's a good demo like if kraig gets up there and does it on the iphone it does education for the ipad
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:43.820]   Yeah, yeah
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:45.420]   Uh
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:47.820]   Craig now a published author federate
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:49.820]   Followed about the craig figure a
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:52.140]   Hope he's enjoying that $732 check he got
[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:57.580]   supreme clart court declined to review the decision against apple in the
[01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:02.540]   The publishing anti-trust suit apple must comply with the settlement it reached in
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:04.700]   2014 with the states
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:08.780]   $400 million it'll pay to the e-book consumers i don't know how we're gonna get that money
[01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:14.060]   But $20 million to the states $30 million in legal fees so a total
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:19.420]   Judgment of $450 million and it's over. I mean the supreme court said we're not gonna overturn it
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:21.340]   So that's done. Can't take it to the Hague
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:25.340]   Let's take it to the Hague
[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.820]   uh
[01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:29.660]   You know
[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:34.060]   The smoking gun was steve job zone emails and statements at the apple events and drew the ipad
[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:36.140]   He said why would you buy a book through the i-book store
[01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:41.420]   At for $14.99 when the same items available on amazon for $9.99 or somebody asked him that
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:45.740]   Job was paused and with a knowing nod responded the price will be the same
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:51.420]   He stroked his little tiny white cat and we sure sure that was kind of
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:56.300]   Publishers are actually withholding their books for amazon because they're not happy he said
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:59.180]   and because
[01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:01.660]   Here we come
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:05.820]   You know what for it's not a not chicken feed half a billion dollars almost but it's
[01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:08.380]   It's doable. I
[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:11.340]   Wish they could pay with those euro dollars. They have stored up somewhere
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:14.380]   That would be they would probably be very nice for them
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:18.300]   Uh, do we want to talk about this secret meeting?
[01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:20.860]   Uh
[01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:24.940]   I don't know. I'm Canadian leo just explains you. I don't understand what I don't understand it either
[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:29.260]   And I don't even think it's important it was an island a private island off the coast of georgia the
[01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:32.220]   american enterprise institute held their
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:37.020]   Annual world forum. Tim cook was there so was larry page from google
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:38.940]   Sean parker
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:44.540]   Elon musk so we're selling a private island off the shore of georgia. What is happening this? Look at that
[01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:48.620]   No, I wasn't a much worse island than that. Yeah, sea island georgia
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:54.060]   Uh, a bunch of republicans including mitch mcconnell carl rove paul ryan
[01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:58.940]   Tom cotton kori gardeners tim scott rob portman ben sassy. I don't see any uh
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:01.820]   illuminati i don't see any democrats here
[01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:04.700]   Uh, all the tech guys
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:06.780]   Yeah, and the tech guys right
[01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:14.780]   Uh, the the uh the guy who holds the who owns the island. Philip and shits is a billionaire a gop donor
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:21.900]   Uh, he was oh women democratic rep john dulaney was there and the publisher of the new york times arthur seltzberger and apparently
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:29.580]   According to bill crystal this a specter was haunting the world forum the specter of donald trump
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:33.260]   There was much unhappiness about his emergence
[01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:37.420]   By the way that that is a referral to it kind of a
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:41.740]   Tip of the hat an homage to carl marx's communist manifesto
[01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:48.620]   Um, there was much unhappiness about his emergence a good deal of talk some of it insightful and thoughtful about why he's done so well
[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:50.620]   And many expressions of hope
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:53.660]   That he would be defeated talking about someone who's going to visit the hag
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:57.340]   I know you know what i've been to the bohemian grove
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:04.780]   And much of what happens at these so-called events where the illuminati gathered to decide the future of the world is heavy drinking
[01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:09.900]   And not a lot of not a lot of a lot of grab ass a lot of grab ass not much
[01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:16.220]   Being in on trees that kind of thing. I think we imagine more more stuff gets done and then actually does
[01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:18.540]   apples
[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:20.620]   Go ahead when I hear about conferences like this
[01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:25.900]   I I worry more about like the stuff that happens behind the scenes at like ww dc
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:28.620]   Yeah, where it's not the stuff that's on the agenda
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:33.580]   It's you happen to get a drink with someone else who's happened to be looking for a place to get a drink
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:39.500]   And then you sit down and then you start talking to each other and a new idea forms that would not have formed otherwise
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:43.900]   And when carl marx is part of the group a lot of bad ideas can happen
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:46.540]   A lot of people with way too much money to make bad things happen
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:52.620]   All right, tim apparently tim cook got in a heated conversation with a congressperson about uh in the encryption thing
[01:20:53.980 --> 01:21:00.860]   Who cares? I don't even know why I brought it up apple has a new twitter account apple support very popular
[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:05.500]   It was helping thousands of people in its first day
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:08.700]   Um
[01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:10.700]   So there
[01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:14.460]   I don't know what else to say about it. I'm seeing all these numbers
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:17.980]   I don't know if it's important
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:20.620]   Anybody are you all following apple support?
[01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:27.020]   Yeah, I mean, it's a great it's an interesting idea and it looks to me like it launched off of the apple music support that they were doing
[01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:30.300]   And uh, it's a really interesting thing because they've proven that if you can
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:35.660]   If you can fulfill the social promise like if you can cater to a large number of people and do it relatively quickly
[01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:38.380]   And with good humor and a real human element to it
[01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:41.420]   Then you can make a deep customer connection and that's the sort of thing apple
[01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:46.300]   People expect from apple, but they've they've never had like a corporate twitter account or anything like that in the past
[01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:51.020]   Uh, and this I don't know they had the itunes accounts for a long time and then the apple music account
[01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:56.060]   And this seems like a really really good step forward for them 186,000 followers
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:58.780]   9000 tweets
[01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:01.580]   They're probably got a hot team of 100 people doing this
[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:04.940]   I mean, this is using that software. I forget what it's called if you'll see it when you scroll down. It's like
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:08.540]   Something fire, um, that lets you do sort of high level
[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:12.860]   Uh social engagement stuff, you know, it's awesome. It's it's got a lot of tips
[01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:15.740]   You probably should follow it just because of all these uh tips
[01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:20.220]   You know the notes ask us a sprinkler sprinkler.com sprinkler
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:26.620]   And it's a little sort of stuff as a typical sort of stuff where if you have a complaint and you include you add include apple support
[01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:30.140]   If you if you click on the tweets and replies tab, you'll see them talking to
[01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:33.980]   Uh a whole bunch of people about glad you love your macbook. We're happy to help with the battery issue
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:38.300]   Dm us with your serial number to get started. Yeah, see if you just look at the tweets there aren't that many
[01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:41.980]   But if you look at the tweets and replies, oh man, they're busy
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:45.340]   Busy busy. It's it's like when it's it's a good idea chief
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:49.500]   Because you got to go where the people are you can't make them go to a support
[01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:54.300]   To a support message board as as thick with thieves as that places
[01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:57.180]   You have to if people are people are expecting to
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:04.060]   Uh the only place to get get a complaint filed about your airline or your cable company now is to at tweet them
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:08.140]   Uh, and so they got to be where the people are uh, it's also it's it's
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:11.260]   It's not a natural fit for apple
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:16.300]   I mean, I wouldn't have said that this is a company that would obviously have done that because here is a fear is a place where
[01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:23.420]   You can actually again click on that tab in the twitter client and see here's everything that everybody is complaining about
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:27.740]   Normally what you see that. Yeah, well, it's it's it's going to be really valuable because
[01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:32.620]   It's part of the value of this kind of public support is that are if you're having a wifi problem
[01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:37.020]   If you're having a cabling issue, you get to see how many other people will see we having cabling issues
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:40.620]   Uh, and unlike some of the forums that are on apple.com
[01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:43.580]   They're they're all really really useful, but they're not really official
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:48.780]   They're just users helping users and here you're seeing base you're seeing apple at least
[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:54.460]   Uh being aware of you see the stuff that apple is definitely aware of and that could be super helpful
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:59.660]   They're also using the hashtag apple support, which is interesting. So it's five a.m. To eight p.m
[01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.820]   Seven days a week too, which is pretty cool. Nice
[01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:08.300]   Pacific time so hashtag apple support if you want to kind of keep track of the conversation around apple support even
[01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:15.660]   Very interesting next time i live tweet amazing race. I'm definitely hashtag unless definitely hashtag them in so they can have some entertainment as well
[01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:17.900]   on a friday night
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:28.380]   Anything else we want to talk about before we take a break and go to our tips of the week 23 new flyover locations and apple maps
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:32.540]   Yeah, transit directions in time for south by south west in austin perfect
[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:35.340]   Anybody going to south by
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:37.340]   I forgot i was on this here
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:40.620]   I'll be there talking about vr on friday. Oh cool
[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:42.940]   Nice
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:45.820]   Are you doing any work down there streaming anything we ought to know about?
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:47.980]   Uh, nope. Nope. I'm just I am
[01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:52.860]   I'm just talking about vr. I'm going to come down speak speak at one event and then probably that night be back
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:56.460]   Back here. So I uh, I thought I'd do more but
[01:24:56.460 --> 01:25:02.780]   It always turns out that way. I'm always just in and out google has updated its photos app for ios live photos now work
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:06.860]   Uh, you can use split view and ipad pro support built in
[01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:13.660]   That's really slick. I really encourage people to at least try it out if you haven't tried google photos before it's uh, I'm not
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:18.540]   I'm not an opponent of apple photos. I think apple photos is really really super
[01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:25.260]   Um, but one of the nice things about google photos particularly with this new update is that it really does feel like what apple music
[01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:30.140]   Was trying to do which is to give you sort of this live experience
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:33.020]   Uh and this live connection to your media
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:38.700]   Uh, where you launch it and there's just a stack of cards that is walking you through here's here's here's what we did
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:44.140]   But this photo here and here's something new feature that we've added and oh by the way on this year this time two years ago
[01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:50.700]   Here pictures you were doing, uh, and the it's just it's actually fun every few days for me to actually just check in with that
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:56.620]   And see what's waiting for me what movies are waiting for me. Uh, they've they've added some new stabilization features where
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:26:02.620]   Uh, I've I'm often like bracketing photos for instance, uh, so i'm just taking like
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:09.580]   Over exposed underexposed stuff like that, but it will see it will line up every single photo to a common element
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:15.100]   And so I have this little animated gif in which all the build all the buildings are the same all the statues are the same
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:19.020]   But you see people moving in and out and i'm like, wasn't I clever to do that?
[01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:21.420]   I'm definitely gonna save that pretended that was my idea
[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:26.940]   But I I love I love the front face of this where it's not here is your albums here's the last
[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:29.180]   That you have uploaded it's cards
[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:32.700]   The stack of cards somebody says here are things we'd like to tell you about your photo
[01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:38.140]   Uh, the photos that have been added what we've done with it and things you'd like to explore and i'm just it's a it's a big
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:41.420]   It's almost as good a timewaster as instagram for me because I just want to see
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:48.220]   This what's what the sky indian outgo took photos of and my goodness isn't he talented. Yeah, that's the assist all this stuff
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:54.060]   We've done. Yeah, and then they also they're still doing the stories which are uh, these are this was an automated story that it did
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:57.020]   Uh, we at least and I went to mennacino
[01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:03.900]   Um last week are we that kind of stuff makes it compelling because it's delightful. I just enjoy the experience. Yeah
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:08.780]   I heard they also updated google docs and I and I haven't tried it yet
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:13.020]   But it's it's been a dumpster fire and ipad pro just because it crashes and doesn't really support any of the features
[01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:20.060]   So hopefully that's been fixed as well. Yeah, yeah, I mean modified this but it's really kind of amazing what but it does just automatically
[01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:26.060]   I don't know where i'm right. I'm so i'm so glad that apple is sort of like shaming older apps
[01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:33.820]   Because the time I had to I was using my ipad pro like in bed and like updating a doc for a podcast been doing later tonight
[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:37.580]   And I oh I bet oh that's right. I forgot to add that thing to this google doc
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:43.980]   We're using and the moment that after using this ipad for like three or four hours like writing actual like columns and stuff like that
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:45.740]   and
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:50.620]   And so i'm in google docs and so I click the edit button and this tray of marshmallows
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:55.100]   Sprolls up because it's the old-fashioned keyboard. Yeah, and i'm like, oh
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:28:02.220]   You must be everyone at google who works on this app. You must be so embarrassed every time that happens everywhere
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:07.100]   You must use google sheets constantly and it just it just I was using it on the airplane
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:11.900]   I've always used my ipad pro on the airplane. I just crashed it just crashed every few minutes luckily google is good at saving state
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:16.220]   But I would it would just crash and i'd launch it again and edit a cell and it crashed and i launched it again and edit a cell
[01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:17.820]   And I couldn't do split screens over me
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:23.260]   I usually keep slack open on the side while I work and I couldn't do that because it doesn't support and I just I just want it to set it on fire
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:27.900]   So it's so super painful every time you're that I love my ipad pro
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:30.220]   It's one of the best computers I have ever bought full stop
[01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:37.900]   And I am it's it's heartbreaking when I see an app that doesn't take full advantage of split screen and split view and
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:41.820]   All these and the new keyboard and all the other features. There's a
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:47.260]   I wish that there's a wonderful new word processor an updated update to an old
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:53.260]   Word processor that is going to be released tomorrow. Unfortunately, I'm still under embargo
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:57.020]   But and i've been using this like as my day-to-day word processor
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:29:03.580]   And it's just such a joy to use even compared to the same app on on my mac
[01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:08.860]   And other apps that are on my mac and it really does show you all the potential of this device when you
[01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:13.340]   Have a creator who is willing to treat it like a like a first-class device
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:18.620]   And so that's why it's just it just breaks your heart when you want to slide over and just like rene
[01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:24.700]   Said have have slack going into the in the in another column or as i'm usually doing having a chrome
[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:28.780]   In this in a column so i could do some fact-checking as i'm going and like, okay
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:32.220]   I can slide it in and then i'll have to slide it back
[01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:37.580]   And i'm not being mean to go i'm telling you how important your software is to me google side really appreciate it if you get those
[01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:41.660]   I was engineers because i don't know what is it get to it they'll get to it, but oh goodness
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:43.660]   They really need to get to it now
[01:29:43.660 --> 01:29:48.700]   Well, and i think that that you know it i found myself at first up
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:51.180]   It was kind of like my mobile thing and now my my app had pro
[01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:54.380]   Is my preference for doing things like working on?
[01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:57.420]   Presentations in keynote because i can open up notes and i can draw
[01:29:57.420 --> 01:30:00.940]   Ideas of what i'm gonna put in there and then copy it and put it in there
[01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:05.020]   You know really quickly like and having both of those just kind of open and being able to draw really quickly on the screen and
[01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:05.820]   Figure out, okay
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:07.900]   This is how i'm gonna do this and this is what this is gonna look like
[01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:12.860]   I think is has you know that that whole like interaction between the drawing the touch the
[01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:16.540]   You know all the bits and pieces is something that for me is actually better on
[01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:19.100]   On an iPad than it than it would be on a
[01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:21.580]   On a big machine and that's been that's been a very slow transition for me
[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:27.340]   I'm doing my own like i'm not doing it as a cartoon by doing me. I'm like serenity called bell style
[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:31.180]   Uh new piece on the the iPad that's gonna be the new thing. That's the new web
[01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:34.140]   I'm gonna do a call well
[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:39.500]   I kind of want to because like both serenity and i are taking this like online class by danielle kurt corsado
[01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:44.140]   Who's just a wonderful illustrator and so i'm doing a lot more drawing than i used to but i'm like no anti
[01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:48.700]   You're having fun. You're enjoying this you can even share some of your sketches on twitter and instagram
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:52.300]   You are not ready to publish any of this as journalism yet
[01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:57.500]   but uh, but it's like it's but i'm so i'm writing this like six months on like this is not the
[01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:02.380]   I wrote one piece that was like a month or a month and a half after it was released and was positive
[01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:09.180]   But this one is like i've got i've i've rewritten the first paragraph like two or three times i'm like tone it down
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:15.020]   You can you can be you can be sincere you can be enthusiastic but tone it down
[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:19.820]   People people are going to be on google street for you trying to see is there like
[01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:27.580]   Is there like your and he's kind of crap beater car but then a brand new like tesla with an apple
[01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:34.300]   bow on the back of it in his driveway if you publish that intro because like i said i i i rarely have been as
[01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:39.660]   enthusiastic about a computer as i have been about about the ipad pro it's just the perfect computer for me
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:45.980]   Uh anything else to say before we take a break and come back
[01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:51.260]   With your tips of the week i think we've covered the main points of the week
[01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:57.900]   Uh, we will uh have our uh picks of the week coming up in just a second with Andy and i co rene richy
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:02.940]   Alex lindsey but first a word from legal zoom, you know i was watching the yo j simpson
[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:06.220]   Uh tv show which i'm enjoying
[01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:09.820]   The people versus soj it's it's total tabloid right
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:16.860]   Uh, but uh john dravolta does this great job playing robert chapero who led the dream team oj's defense team
[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:22.060]   And i'm looking up on robert robert chapero after that, you know what he did he founded legal zoom.com
[01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:25.580]   I had no idea. Oh, yeah
[01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:29.580]   So shapero who was holly, you know like the hollywood lawyer
[01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:33.740]   Um and a bunch of other lawyers sat down and said you know we want to do
[01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:38.220]   We want to make it easy and affordable for people to get legal expertise online
[01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:44.860]   And legal zoom was born. It's been more than 10 years. I know because i used legal zoom to set up twit
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:50.620]   Uh, it was at the time. I think 60 bucks to get the llc and that was awesome kevin ros told me to do that

[01:34:56.540 --> 01:35:00.220]   A tip of the hat for this pick of the week. I've used ow sees
[01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:02.620]   pci express
[01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:07.820]   Flash storage their ssd's in the past to upgrade max including the mac i'm using right now
[01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:10.700]   They've just introduced the aura pci e
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:15.820]   Flash storage upgrades for macbook pros and macbook ares
[01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:19.260]   This you know the best upgrade you can make
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:26.380]   To any computers to put a solid state drive in it and now that ssd's have gotten so inexpensive
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:28.380]   It's taken a while for apple to
[01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:34.380]   To lower the price when you buy it up front, but it's not so hard believe it or not in the macbook or macbook
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:39.420]   macbook pro or macbook air to upgrade to as much as a terabyte of
[01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:43.020]   Of flash storage
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:48.220]   And these aura drives are really good. I've been using one i is it in this machine? I can't remember which one
[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:53.020]   But the prices are good and i'm a big fan of other world computing in there at max sales
[01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:55.660]   dot com

[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:16.220]   With your old 128 gigs or whatever and you and that's not i have my i carry it around it's really handy like a little usb key so there it is
[01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:20.300]   uh max sales dot com little little tip of the hat i think we
[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:26.700]   We mentioned them. They're not an advertiser. I just feel like they really make great stuff for mac people
[01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:29.820]   uh rene richy, what's your pick this week?
[01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:37.100]   So i have two and they were sort of motivated by the the news early on like we spoke about earlier uh online backups are great things like
[01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:39.820]   uh carbonite and black plays all of those are great
[01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:47.420]   Sometimes you just want to keep your stuff where you are too and there's sort of two options here broad options that i like one is super easy
[01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:53.660]   I actually use both of these so one is apples time capsule and that you it just looks just like an airport extreme router
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:57.020]   You buy it you plug it in you connect to it like any wife fire router
[01:36:57.020 --> 01:37:03.020]   But every night it just goes through and does first a big backup of all your stuff and then an incremental backup of all your stuff
[01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:07.980]   And if you have multiple max in your house, it can do backups of all of those you just choose a storage size
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:11.740]   That makes sense to you and they have i think two gig of two terabytes and three terabyte options
[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:16.460]   And then it just quietly in the background keeps versioned copies of your computer
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:22.700]   So if anything does go wrong if you delete a file and want that file back or if you get an infection and you want to roll back your entire computer
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:28.860]   You get a new computer and you want to just pull everything off of this you have all that information really easily available
[01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:37.740]   To you i've given these to several family members too because it saves me having to drive over there to sort of fix their manual backup process or find out that the drive was unplugged
[01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:43.740]   Three months ago and nothing was happening. So i'm a huge fan of these if you are more sophisticated. I love this too. This is
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:51.020]   Super duper which is just an amazing value. Let's you love it. Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it. I'm sure we picked it a dozen times before but it's always
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:57.980]   worth mentioning again. Mm-hmm. Yeah, all you do is like the free version you can plug in and you can just make a clone of your drive
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:02.380]   I will pay fistfuls of money for this and so I get the intelligent backups
[01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:07.180]   And I just plug it in and I have one that just backs up my iMac every night and then
[01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:11.900]   Kindly what Alex says I have a bigger drive that I do a copy of several machines once a month
[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:15.020]   And then I put it somewhere safe so that if anything ever does happen
[01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:20.300]   I actually leave a copy at my mom's place because that made it was convenient enough that I could always get it in case of an emergency
[01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:22.060]   And that's pretty off-site as well
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:26.860]   And just it does its job at night it schedules it automatically as long as I don't do anything dumb and unplug the drive
[01:38:26.860 --> 01:38:30.540]   It just works and that to me. It's that kind of protection is just priceless
[01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:35.500]   Recommend them both could not write very nice and I couldn't agree more
[01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:41.660]   Uh, let's uh go to Alex. Oh one other thing I shouldn't tell you about this rene
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:44.140]   I was mentioning kevin rose
[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:48.460]   And his you know, he's the new CEO of hodinky. They've opened their hodinky shop
[01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:51.260]   And I know you have a little bit of a watch jones
[01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:53.820]   Oh no
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:57.500]   They're now selling
[01:38:57.500 --> 01:39:02.060]   Watches, but you know I this is the one I really there's a rare fines tab. I love this and I thought Alex
[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:08.860]   I mean, uh, and he would love this a rolex wall what oh clock with the pan am logo goodness
[01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:12.620]   It's sold out which is good because it was $9,500
[01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:17.260]   And they have those stupid lugs that you put any band on an apple watch and i'm gonna go there and just
[01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:23.420]   Oh, they have straps and straps and straps and I know you're a strap fiend strap hound there goes martyme
[01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:26.140]   I'm so sorry. I i'm so sorry
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:32.300]   Oh, they're a fantastic website. Yeah, hodinky's great. I'm really glad they opened the store. So congratulations kevin
[01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:34.780]   I didn't know about this, but uh somebody in the chat room mentioned
[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:37.180]   Uh
[01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:42.300]   Andy, I'm sorry. Let's do alex, lindsey will save Andy the best for last alex is well, not the best but you know
[01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:44.300]   Thanks. Thanks man
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:46.860]   No, you're the most expensive
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:52.140]   So so my my recommendation is the black magic micro studio cam now
[01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:57.500]   This is an expensive pick, but it's not relatively expensive compared to other professional level cameras
[01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:00.220]   So it's this little guy here and this one's got
[01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:03.900]   Stuff on it. Sorry. This is the one that I have it sit in my office
[01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:09.180]   And so so this is this tiny little camera is a four thirds four k video camera
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:13.580]   And i've got you know, I've just got this little olympus four thirds lens on it
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:15.500]   So take any micro four thirds lens
[01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:21.340]   Any micro four thirds lens and then you can also get a micro four thirds to can an adapter, which we use often
[01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:26.780]   Um, so you put big cannon lenses on you can also get whether what I call it for those in broadcast b4 lenses
[01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:32.380]   You can actually convert the b4 lens to this little guy. We almost put him. We had these box lunges for an event
[01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:35.020]   Um, uh last week
[01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:38.460]   76 x, you know broadcast lenses and we almost got one of these on do it
[01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:42.140]   We just didn't have the adapter with us given the funniest thing is this giant lens
[01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:46.220]   And then it just has this little camera and it it looks I mean the lens
[01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:50.140]   Um, you know the the chip looks great, but what really makes this
[01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:54.300]   Uh, just a great little camera now it doesn't have a viewfinder, but you can always add one
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:41:01.100]   Um, and this is a wooden camera makes these little ectoskeletons that we put on them put on all of them to make sure that uh,
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:06.460]   Um, you know, we can mount anything we want to it. So you know other monitors and so on and so forth, but
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:11.580]   Black magic really made this. This is the geeks camera, you know black magic made this so if you look at these
[01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:14.700]   These uh, you know all these little connectors here
[01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:18.780]   This is this is just you know, this is just connected to my camera here
[01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:22.060]   And you know what I have here is I have ptz control
[01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:27.180]   So if I hook it to a pan tilt zoom head, I can control the head now. Here's the important part
[01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:32.700]   You can control the head from my switcher. So, um, uh, there's power
[01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:36.540]   Um, this is uh ref in so you can sync the cameras
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:40.380]   Uh, you can control a b4 lens. That's a standard broadcast lens
[01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:43.820]   Um, you control the lens and that means that from the switcher
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:49.980]   Um, you know, so from my black magic switcher, I can control the zoom and the focus and the aperture
[01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:54.780]   From the switcher, you know, um, and because you can log into your switcher from anywhere in the world
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:59.180]   Uh, you can actually, you know change the shading on a camera that's half of you know
[01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:01.420]   Another part of the world which we've done
[01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:07.420]   And then a length so you could you could even control the camera, you know with just your the standard little length controllers that you can buy
[01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:11.900]   Um, and then of course there's this which is the kind of the geekiest version the thing
[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:13.340]   This is the s bus
[01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:17.660]   Now the reason the s bus goes and you take it you take a little receiver like this and you plug
[01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:20.460]   You plug your s bus in
[01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:23.500]   So you plug your camera into this little receiver
[01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:26.940]   And uh, yeah, just so you know that means that you can control
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:29.660]   Your camera with this
[01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:37.340]   So this is you know, so this is the the s bus is made by phobata and it so you can actually control aperture and and and
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:42.780]   You know a lot of other things, uh, you know through a controller here like this, um remotely
[01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:49.260]   So again, it's the the the camera has been made to be hacked. Um, it's you can either hack it through the switcher
[01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:56.860]   Um, you know, you can hack, you know, we have, um, we actually control the shading on these cameras within our dweino, uh powered
[01:42:56.860 --> 01:43:00.620]   Um, um, controller
[01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:04.540]   So, you know a lot of this stuff is all built very very not open source
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:08.940]   But definitely an open api that that lets you have a lot of access to this thing
[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:12.700]   There's a company called scar off, uh, I think out of finland that that does a lot of these
[01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:16.940]   Updates that we that we've started to buy a lot of and so it's just a great little camera
[01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:22.780]   Um, uh, it's my favorite my favorite little camera that I it's my and generally my webcam
[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:26.060]   I had some setup issues this morning, but I've generally my webcam
[01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:29.180]   Um, and uh, it's it's pretty cool
[01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:34.060]   So you're looking for one to do geeky stuff with
[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:36.380]   Um, and he's telling me what he's done
[01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:42.940]   Right and leo if I was building a new studio somewhere
[01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:48.460]   I'm listening to you
[01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:55.100]   I would just say that you know, they're pretty nice cameras that you could you know
[01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:59.740]   Well, we could replace these cameras. Well, you know what the truth is it's going to cause us so much money to build this new studio
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:03.420]   I don't really have money for new cameras. Oh, there you go. Much of the camera though
[01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:08.940]   These are like 1200 bucks each. That's not much. Yeah, exactly. It's it's we all need them Alex
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:12.140]   Sorry, no, you know, we all need them. No, it's not
[01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:14.940]   I
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:19.500]   Renee, I think I think you'll agree with me that if Alex is going to be using this camera
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:23.020]   I mean we were all using these logic tech 920s now we have to all buy them
[01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:26.460]   I'm just I'm just worried that we won't have that consistent look from
[01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:32.860]   Not listening
[01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:34.860]   But I am not listening
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:41.500]   I was telling myself but I'm telling myself but Andy it's it uses micro four-thirds lenses. You've got
[01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:44.140]   those
[01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:50.540]   That's a part Andy exactly. It's just a box that you put light through that's all the camera is
[01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:54.300]   It's photons photons are free. They're pretty cool
[01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:59.420]   We've been watching the development of these and they've just gotten better and better and more and more interesting and yeah
[01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:02.300]   Not buying them
[01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:06.060]   Don't get your hopes up there Jason. Plant this is going
[01:45:06.060 --> 01:45:13.820]   Okay, yeah, we should do someday. We'll do our shows in 4k
[01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:16.940]   Then not this year
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:19.180]   Andy
[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:23.980]   Andy and Ico let's uh, let's wrap it up with that and he's and he's always got something interesting
[01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:27.980]   I'll wait for a open box or scratch. Yeah, exactly
[01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:32.060]   Yeah, I got a tip and a pick both of them are hopefully pretty quick
[01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:39.660]   Obviously, I love like using my camera and my phone as a as a camera camera as opposed to a snapshot camera
[01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:43.980]   And I did I came across this kind of neat thing
[01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:46.540]   By accident. I was testing out
[01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:52.300]   Uh, I was I had I had my uh my phone like on a on a tripod mount like this
[01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:55.580]   Uh for some stuff I was doing like in the park and stuff like that
[01:45:55.980 --> 01:46:01.020]   And because I mean this mine is this nice redicam like metal one that doesn't let go
[01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:05.660]   It's your your thing is not your phone is not gonna is not gonna pop out of this thing for sure
[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:10.620]   Uh, and because I was occasionally hand holding it in case I had like I had this basically
[01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:12.620]   I didn't want to take it on and off all the time
[01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:18.220]   And then I found out this was like a month ago that my goodness with just like the stand like on this
[01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:21.660]   This is a really nice grip for the phone
[01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:27.340]   And I feel like I've got a good hold on it. I don't feel like I'm about to like like drop it or some place
[01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:30.460]   It it falls in the hand the way that I naturally do
[01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:35.980]   Obviously, this is a lot chunkier than johnny. I would ever approve of for for the thickness of a phone
[01:46:35.980 --> 01:46:37.820]   but it's still
[01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:40.380]   Compact enough that I could stick it in my pocket and take it out again
[01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:48.220]   Also the fact that it has a tripod mount at the bottom of it means that I can put one of these like tripod screw lugs
[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:52.940]   On the bottom of it and have it like hanging out to my side or have like a wrist strap on it
[01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:55.900]   So again, I don't have to worry about dropping it or something like this
[01:46:55.900 --> 01:47:01.820]   It's just such a comfortable way of holding this that now this is if I know i'm going to be taking a lot of pictures
[01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:05.340]   Of the course of the day. This is just even if I don't have my tripod with me
[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:08.940]   This is just this thing just stays on it. It's also kind of cool
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:11.340]   uh because um
[01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:13.340]   The uh folks at loom cube
[01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:15.900]   Uh have an adapter so that you can mount
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:18.540]   the loom cube light
[01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:25.180]   On the device itself and so now this really does look like like an old type like an old-fashioned old-timey camera
[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:28.060]   Uh if you have not now the second bracket on it
[01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:32.620]   Uh, so I just uh there there are companies like the the folks who do
[01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:34.140]   uh
[01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:35.260]   There's there's some
[01:47:35.260 --> 01:47:38.140]   Who does that kind of does that really they're really good at the yolo clip company
[01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:40.380]   They have a system that costs 80-90 dollars
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:46.460]   For adding accessories that work really nice, but I already have this this cost 20 bucks
[01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:51.180]   And like I said, it really helps me to hold this and use it like a regular camera
[01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:55.500]   Uh, so i'm a really big fan of that and i'm surprised that i've had this for like
[01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:57.980]   Years and this is the first time I've kind of switched to that
[01:47:57.980 --> 01:48:02.060]   Uh, the second thing that the actual pick is a better snap tool
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:06.700]   Uh, which is available on the mac app store. It's a really good
[01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:10.380]   Windowing windowing tool for uh for macOS
[01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:15.180]   Uh, we talked we're ready we're talking about how cool it is on the ipad pro to be able to slide in
[01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:20.540]   An app and do split screen and obviously the new version of lace version of macOS has split screen
[01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:23.580]   This has a couple of advantages over that
[01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:29.020]   Uh, it allows you to you just drag a window to the side of the screen and it will automatically snap
[01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:36.620]   To either one half the size of your screen and snap to the side or one quarter the size of the screen and snap to that corner
[01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:43.500]   Uh that so that's added functionality that split view doesn't do in the lace version of macOS
[01:48:43.660 --> 01:48:49.260]   The other thing is that you obviously have to have the latest version of macOS to have split screen going
[01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:53.260]   Uh, rest this will still work in uh, 10.9 and previous
[01:48:53.260 --> 01:49:01.180]   Uh, and it's really it really is a a simple but it's the ipad pro really got me into this idea of
[01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:06.300]   I really wish I would like to have two apps dominating the entire screen at once
[01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:09.740]   And when i'm doing podcast like when i'm doing the material podcast tonight
[01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:12.620]   I will have my show notes snap to one side of the screen
[01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:16.380]   I will have uh, slack snap to the front quarter so I can talk to
[01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:20.300]   To have us have a back channel with the other host and then the other corner of the screen
[01:49:20.300 --> 01:49:25.660]   I will have under that I will have a twitter just in case there are people who are mentioning things that we should talk about
[01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:32.860]   Like during the show or chat channel, uh, and once you have the ability to very trivially have non overlapping windows
[01:49:32.860 --> 01:49:38.940]   You realize how much productive you can be when you're not you don't have to always be cycling through windows all the time
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:41.740]   Or preventing windows from overlapping from each other
[01:49:42.140 --> 01:49:45.340]   And it's only this uh and better snap tool has been around for a long time
[01:49:45.340 --> 01:49:49.180]   That's only three bucks. Uh, and that's for some of the easiest money i've ever spent
[01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:53.100]   Very nice
[01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:59.260]   Andy and i co chicago sun times always always a pleasure and don't forget his podcast
[01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:02.620]   Enochos almanac
[01:50:02.620 --> 01:50:07.660]   That's on the five by five network and material which is on where's materials i'll replay dot FM right?
[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:11.580]   Relay dot FM relay not replay relay dot FM like her lease and network
[01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:14.940]   Great to have you as always andrew
[01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:22.380]   Renee richy i'more.com. He does a few shows himself on the i'more podcast including that great debug anything you want to plug
[01:50:22.380 --> 01:50:26.780]   We have the i'more 500th episode coming next week hard to believe
[01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:30.620]   Wow, yeah, we did two a week for the while when i catch up with us. Yeah
[01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:37.260]   We're back to weekly after the ipad actually just passed us. Yeah, we were only at 497. So closely oh
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:39.580]   man
[01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:44.220]   It's hard to keep up with her. We had uh, we had jamey newberry on last week
[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:47.580]   She's just phenomenal on debug. She is the new cOO of
[01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:53.180]   Martian craft and previously she was at zappos and it's on consulting for a lot of really awesome companies
[01:50:53.180 --> 01:50:58.780]   She's not allowed to mention but she does a lot about corporate culture and in design and just fantastic cool
[01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:00.940]   cool
[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:05.980]   And Alex lensy the pixacore best thing to do if you want to know what Alex is up to is follow him on twitter alex
[01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:10.060]   l-i-n-d-s-a-y what did Alex lind say
[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:13.260]   That's what i how i remember that
[01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:17.500]   Yeah, and i'll be uh, i'll be at two two to three and at the four seasons
[01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:22.460]   I think talking about br and golf of all things for south by and uh nost it's out by yeah, that's friday
[01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:27.260]   Yep, i'll be there friday. Um, probably thursday night i'll probably try to find somewhere to meet people
[01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:32.780]   Um, but uh, but so um, but i'll i'll tweet it up. I really enjoyed south by and uh
[01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:37.500]   We used to go down there every year, but it really turned out to be mostly just a big party
[01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:44.060]   It was a yeah, and i always miss the party part because i always come for the interactive part and so it doesn't get cool until the next
[01:51:44.060 --> 01:51:46.620]   I mean it's it's it's useful. We're not when i go
[01:51:46.620 --> 01:51:51.820]   But it's not as cool as when you start having those big parties and i just all like every time i think of south by south west leo
[01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:57.980]   I just think of you. Um, yes, i know i'm proud surfing. Yep. Yeah, crowd surfing with the live you dummy. What a dummy i was
[01:51:57.980 --> 01:52:01.100]   Great. It was great. That was good. That was good. That was good
[01:52:01.100 --> 01:52:04.380]   It'll be something i'll look back on in my old age. Oh, wait a minute. That's right now
[01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:06.300]   Uh
[01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:11.580]   I remember body sharing when i was a young man live screaming it. Yeah
[01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:17.420]   We do mac break weekly every tuesday 11 a.m. Pacific two p.m. eastern time
[01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:24.860]   1900 utc on a twit you can watch live of course we would love it and you can come to the studio too if you're in the area
[01:52:24.860 --> 01:52:29.420]   We're in northern california about an hour north of san francisco just email tickets at twit.tv
[01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:34.940]   We're going to be in this studio through probably the summer i'm thinking uh move in august or september
[01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:40.940]   So if you've always wanted to see the brick house, uh, you probably should make your way out here in the next seven or eight months
[01:52:40.940 --> 01:52:44.620]   Uh, although you're pretty much just taking everything and
[01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:47.660]   It'll look the same
[01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:50.460]   Uh moving it over to another place are the bricks going?
[01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:58.220]   Yeah, we uh, we don't know about that so i our uh, our project manager who is a long time construction guy says
[01:52:58.300 --> 01:53:00.860]   Yeah, I don't know you put a pick to those they're gonna break them
[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:06.220]   So what we're gonna do is we're gonna take a high res pictures of everything
[01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:12.220]   Uh first and then we're gonna try to pry him off if we can then we'll move him if we can't which
[01:53:12.220 --> 01:53:16.140]   He seems, you know at their way they're attached because we've moored him onto the wall
[01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:19.100]   You're never going to be able to get those off without breaking them
[01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:26.220]   Uh, so what we're gonna do is print vinyl wallpaper of the bricks and have they'll you'll you'll still be able to visit your brick
[01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:27.980]   It just won't be made of brick
[01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:31.820]   That's okay, right? That's great. That's great continuity. It's the next best thing
[01:53:31.820 --> 01:53:34.700]   I would love to bring the bricks. We just didn't think ahead
[01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:38.700]   No, we're with 11 supporters to there we could take the wall
[01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:41.900]   But then what do you do?
[01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:46.620]   Now we got now we got you know 20 feet of wall
[01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:50.460]   I don't know what to do with that
[01:53:50.460 --> 01:53:54.780]   So, uh, i'm trusting uh better minds than i'm in mine on this kind of thing
[01:53:54.860 --> 01:54:01.180]   Um, but at least we know we can do that we'll do the wallpaper if we don't do the bricks themselves. I think that's good enough, right?
[01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:03.660]   Yeah, I feel bad
[01:54:03.660 --> 01:54:08.140]   And I'm very grateful because all the people who donated made made it possible build the studio
[01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:10.460]   And if you're saying well gosh, you know
[01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:16.860]   Move but we're gonna take almost everything that we built all of this stuff was designed to be removed as all tv sets are
[01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:20.220]   And move to another location including the port hole wall and everything
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:22.940]   So, uh, we're taking the big gear behind me and
[01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:25.580]   All of that stuff will come so uh
[01:54:25.580 --> 01:54:30.540]   But that's costing so much. I don't have money to buy all new cameras. It'll be just like home
[01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:31.900]   It will be
[01:54:31.900 --> 01:54:34.300]   Yeah, effect if you're watching most first of all
[01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:38.380]   Only, you know a small percentage of our audience watches at all
[01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:41.340]   So if you're listening it will sound the same
[01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:46.460]   Even if you're watching it'll probably look pretty much the same there'll be slight differences, but yeah
[01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:48.860]   It's too thick of a signature mr. Laporta slightly different
[01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:53.340]   Actually, it's gonna sound better because uh, we're gonna wall in the studio
[01:54:53.340 --> 01:54:57.580]   One of the complaints people have is that we have an open studio in the offices are open and nobody can talk
[01:54:57.580 --> 01:55:02.700]   When we're working if you wall it in properly or you can get one of those new dobe at most sound bars. Oh
[01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:06.540]   You need a reflection surfaces
[01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:10.220]   Yeah, and then you'll be able to listen above you and below you
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:14.540]   Great. Hey, thanks everybody for joining us. We'll see you next time
[01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:18.220]   But now it's time to get back to work because break time is over
[01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:28.620]   [music]
