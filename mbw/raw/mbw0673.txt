[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.300]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we talk about,
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.220]   the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.100]   Don't let the Mac fool you.
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.300]   Sometimes we talk about iPhones.
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.180]   Laurie, Laurie Gill is here from iMore
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.180]   managing editor over there.
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.780]   Hi, Laura.
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.500]   How are you?
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.540]   I am great.
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.300]   Did you get an Apple card invite?
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.860]   I didn't.
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.100]   But one of our associates at the mobile nations did get one.
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.420]   OK, hold on.
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.940]   I'll have some details.
[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.340]   I want to introduce everybody before we go.
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.460]   But I'm just asking you one by one, Mr. Renee Ritchie
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.300]   from iMore.com.
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.980]   You're Canadian.
[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.060]   I don't think you're even eligible.
[00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.560]   Are you?
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.060]   I have the Canadian Apple card right here.
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.940]   It's invisible.
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.020]   Wow, it's even better.
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.420]   It's like maybe one day we'll get it up in the frozen true
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.060]   north.
[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.060]   And you know, the Canadian Apple card really saves you money.
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.620]   Yes, it really does.
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.220]   Cash back.
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.180]   We never even take any cash.
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.140]   And in Aco, here from WGBH Boston, any Apple card
[00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.420]   in your hand, they did send me an email saying,
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.540]   don't embarrass either of us by asking for credit.
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.620]   So at least a month at radar.
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.420]   And finally, in studio with us, really glad to have Alex.
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.940]   Lindsay hasn't been here in a long-- you were in Australia.
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.780]   It was.
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.380]   How was that?
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.020]   There's a lot of Australian--
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.700]   The Kangaroos.
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.060]   Crazy, crazy things.
[00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.060]   I wonder the thing that's--
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.940]   A lot of Australians.
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.820]   I was expecting the Kangaroos and all the other pieces
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.900]   that you would go out and see.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.420]   But the coffee in Melbourne is the best in the world so far
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.260]   that I've ever had.
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.180]   And I've been to Rome and Paris and London
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.420]   and no London is not very good.
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.980]   But I don't know what went on, but I drank so much coffee.
[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.260]   And it was--
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.300]   The coffee in Australia is in Sydney, anyway.
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.500]   It's very, very good.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.860]   The story, I guess, is that a lot of Italians
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.420]   came over right after World War II.
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.580]   So it's the real espresso.
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.980]   It's like they're very serious about it.
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.980]   Like when they say coffee, they don't make you coffee.
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.220]   They make you espresso.
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.100]   And it's like the little donut shop
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.900]   does better cappuccinos than anything
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.740]   that I've had here.
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.820]   And so it was good.
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.420]   And I walked a lot.
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.700]   I mean, Melbourne's a great walking town.
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.940]   So in the Central Business District,
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.460]   just wandered around a lot.
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.340]   And then we got out of the city a little bit.
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.660]   And so it was fun.
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.500]   I mean, you didn't get an apple cart either, did you?
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.300]   No.
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.740]   No one said something.
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.500]   Today's the day.
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.460]   According to Matthew Panzareno, who did interestingly
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.140]   get an apple cart that Tech crunches Matthew Panzareno,
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.100]   today's day apple will start rolling it out
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.900]   to select users, none of whom is on this panel.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.340]   So Laurie spent on Disney and choose
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.020]   just in the last 10 minutes on that card.
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.980]   That's the big question.
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.020]   I'm going to get it the minute I can.
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.740]   I of course have read this, went to my email.
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.580]   The way you'll find out is you'll get an email inviting you.
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.340]   And then you go to the apple wallet
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.820]   and your apple wallet will have transformed.
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.540]   You'll have a add card button that lets you add an apple cart.
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.300]   So Laurie, tell us about the mobile nations folk.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.180]   Yeah, so I'm not going to use his name.
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.300]   He said it was OK, too.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.980]   But you know how you don't want people
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.060]   trying to get in touch with him for weird reasons, right?
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.420]   Or trying to get him to get more credit cards.
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.900]   So he applied this morning.
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.300]   And it was super quick.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.620]   It was so quick that he didn't even take screenshots for us.
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.460]   Yeah, because he just was so anxious to get it, right?
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.820]   Exactly.
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.300]   His credit limit was $5,000 at 23.99%,
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.860]   which is the highest interest rate that they offer,
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.700]   which I said, wow, really that high.
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.780]   Can I ask you what your credit score is?
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.500]   And his credit score fits within the good standing category.
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.740]   He's got 724 from Equifax and 730 from Experian.
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.740]   Well, that's very good.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.740]   And they put him at 24% interest rate.
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.940]   So wait a minute, he has--
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.580]   So what I would judge to be a very good FICO score,
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.780]   and he's still getting that high interest rate.
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.180]   Wow.
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.500]   Yeah, which I thought was very interesting.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.740]   What do you have to have 750 to get?
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.700]   Hmm.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.540]   Right?
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.220]   So I was surprised.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.940]   Actually, my credit standing is excellent.
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.300]   So we'll see what I get.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.500]   Because I'm not the highest that you can get.
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.220]   But does that mean that to get the lowest interest rate,
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.060]   you have to have like 850?
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.980]   Because the credit score that he has to me,
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.500]   it should have been more like 15% to 17%, maybe 20%,
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.060]   but not the absolute highest interest rate.
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.900]   It's reasonably good credit.
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.540]   So I thought that was kind of interesting.
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.060]   Hmm.
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.540]   Hmm.
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.540]   Hmm.
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.180]   Are they taking advantage of the fact
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.940]   there are going to be so many people who are going
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.420]   to be signing up for this as they're-- maybe even
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.180]   as their second or third card just to have it,
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.340]   that they know that they can offer whatever terms
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.820]   and people are going to accept it?
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.860]   I hope that that's not the reason.
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.660]   And I'm sure that you can renegotiate with all credit card
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.460]   companies once you've been there with them for a while.
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.100]   And they-- you know, we'll give you more credit.
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.460]   You can actually say to them, actually,
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.020]   could you lower my interest rate instead?
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.780]   I'd prefer that.
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.020]   So it doesn't mean he's permanently at 24%.
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.180]   It just was a surprise to me that his credit score, to me,
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.860]   was good enough to get a decent interest rate.
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.380]   And he got the-- basically the same interest
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.740]   rate that you would give to somebody who has poor credit.
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.340]   So I don't know.
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.140]   That doesn't seem right.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.700]   Panzareno has been answering questions all morning on Twitter.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.780]   I gather he got one from Apple as a journalist,
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.500]   because he said that his credit card was in the mail
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.740]   and had gotten lost, which means he got it earlier.
[00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.580]   But apparently some normal people
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.500]   will be getting-- none of these journalists,
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.580]   but some normal people will be getting it.
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.820]   He says it uses TransUnion's FICO score,
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.860]   as we know for your rating.
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.100]   As we know, the back end is handled by Goldman Sachs.
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.620]   There are no numbers on the card,
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.780]   but it isn't coded on the mag strip.
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.660]   Technically, Apple Pay transactions are tokenized,
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.980]   so no number is transmitted.
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.740]   Yes, the card shimmers.
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.740]   When you move your phone, he has an image.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.820]   He's already somehow charged $286 on his card.
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.340]   So--
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.860]   Just for testing purposes.
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.540]   All those meals are now tax deductible.
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.460]   You were testing out the Apple card.
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.860]   No signatures required.
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.260]   That's not-- the law has changed,
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.740]   and so signatures are not required.
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.300]   But he says, I live in a small town
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.220]   where some people insist be prepared to have an argument
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.140]   or don't use it.
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.980]   That's actually why I do Apple Cash.
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.500]   So it'll be interesting to see what happens.
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.380]   I use Apple Cash a lot.
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.740]   I transfer a lot from my account to Apple Cash,
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.100]   specifically because it means I know I won't have to code in
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.820]   and I know I won't have to sign anything.
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:03.660]   That's good.
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.140]   And the other thing that happens sometimes--
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.540]   and somebody tweeted him saying this,
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.300]   my small town post office says, they insist on checking
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.660]   the signature on the back of the card when you use it.
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.060]   There is no signature, and there's
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.380]   no place to put a signature.
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.900]   Keep in mind that just this weekend, I once again
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.820]   had to teach somebody how tap to pay works on their own payment
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:25.660]   terminal.
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.420]   So--
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.860]   Well, the only thing is not to get the card,
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.180]   but I think that you're going to be educating a lot of people
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.580]   to work for retail.
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.620]   I didn't actually-- when I was in Australia,
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.300]   I didn't get any Australian cash.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.260]   I literally used my phone for every transaction.
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.820]   And even some people there didn't know.
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.940]   They were like, can I use my phone?
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.620]   And they're like, I don't know.
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.460]   So I just went over and it would take it.
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.580]   That's actually going to change the crap you don't have to get
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.420]   in paper bills.
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.660]   Not a single paper bill.
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:52.980]   I mean--
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.340]   Because I always come back with a little extra currency
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.260]   from every country.
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:56.980]   Right, right.
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:57.740]   I have a cable.
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.340]   You came to Zimbobway 10,000 pound note.
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.900]   I have literally a shelf that has all these different--
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.100]   when I'm going to Cambodia, I take this.
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.620]   If I go to India, I take this.
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.220]   I have all these spare dollars that I take that I can manage
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.540]   in the airport or whatever.
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.420]   And I was amazed.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.980]   I was kind of wanting to see how long I could go.
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.460]   Well, it turns out 10 days you can go in.
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.380]   That's really annoying.
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.100]   Literally, didn't use it.
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.300]   The only place it didn't work and the irony was not lost.
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.940]   I mean, it was the Apple Store.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.660]   So not the Apple Store.
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.780]   Apple Store, there was a My Mac or something.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.500]   And they couldn't get it to work, which
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.380]   I thought that they should probably fix.
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.460]   But every coffee shop, every restaurant, every--
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.340]   I mean, buying--
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.860]   everything was-- I mean, even buying the cards
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.980]   to use the train, it was amazing.
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.620]   Apparently, while there's no number on the card,
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.300]   nor is there a virtual number in the--
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.820]   there is a virtual number in the Wallet app, which
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.940]   will get added to your Safari auto fill.
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.660]   So you will have a credit card number
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.100]   you can use in places that need a credit card number.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.580]   Not clear if that's a rotating number.
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.660]   No, it's permanent until you ask for a new one.
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.140]   OK.
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.220]   If you ever feel like it's being compromised or just--
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.980]   for the lulls, you can press a button and ask for a new number.
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.220]   But otherwise, it's semi-permanent.
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.220]   I'm just scrolling through Matthews.
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.060]   You've been answering lots of questions all day.
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.860]   I'm just scrolling through his Twitter.
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.900]   We've already mentioned 1% cash back when you use the card,
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.420]   2% when you use Apple Pay.
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.180]   This really is all about Apple Pay, not the card.
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:32.100]   And 3% when you use it to buy Apple gear.
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.580]   Again, that is that is indecent, but not the best
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.580]   in the business.
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.260]   In fact, there's nothing about this card
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.540]   that makes it, from a financial point of view,
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.820]   the best card to choose.
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.020]   Well, he pointed that out.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.460]   Like he said, he's a big points person,
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.140]   and he likes to get points for a lot of things,
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:48.140]   especially travel.
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.700]   And Apple's not playing the points game almost at all.
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.660]   If you cash back on-- especially Apple purchases,
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.380]   especially Apple Pay purchases, and a little bit
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.260]   on other things.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.860]   But they're not making it an offer that people who are points
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.260]   guy type followers are going to want to jump onto.
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:08.060]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.100]   I'm just going through it.
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.060]   I think that's pretty much it.
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.780]   He's trying to show it to how it shimmers on the watch.
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.380]   But this is pretty hard to get it.
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.780]   But apparently it does.
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.140]   We tell what he's buying based on the cards.
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.380]   I look like he's showing it.
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.700]   He's showing it.
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.820]   So show of hands, how many of you
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.700]   are going to rush out and get one?
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.980]   I was thinking I will.
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.900]   You, you, you.
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.380]   The only person who's not is Mr. Renee Richie.
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.900]   He would.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.740]   I was thinking of getting one.
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.100]   I'd like to acquire my card, Renee.
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.540]   Here's one thing that discourages me.
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.540]   And Matthew may be wrong on this, but he says--
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.900]   when somebody asks, how do you cancel it,
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.060]   he says, I think you have to call Goldman Sachs.
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.540]   I think you can also message him too.
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.260]   Can you message him?
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.460]   But yeah, you have to give a touch with Goldman Sachs.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.620]   Not Apple, yeah.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.700]   So really it's a Goldman Sachs card.
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:58.820]   You can switch to Android.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:05.140]   Yeah, you must have a Apple Pay capable iPhone
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.660]   to even get this card.
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:11.180]   And as I said, I think this is really Apple helping
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.220]   to support Apple Pay more than anything else, right?
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.900]   Also, when I signed up, when I signed up to be notified,
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.580]   they were asking for the email address associated
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:26.580]   with my Apple account as opposed to my real email address.
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.460]   So maybe this is also a way to get more people
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.060]   into Apple account.
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.380]   I'm sorry, that's a silly thing, because if you haven't
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.780]   I found you already do have an account.
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.940]   Forget this, I'm sorry.
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.580]   Your friend's interest rate is at the top, by the way,
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.100]   Lori, that Apple says the interest rate will be 12.99
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.540]   to 23.99.
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.260]   Exactly.
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.340]   So 23.99.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.820]   That's like the worst you could get.
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:50.340]   That's terrible.
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.300]   And he has good credit.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.140]   He has it.
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:52.980]   Yeah.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.860]   You have 28 days after the closing of each bill cycle
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.700]   to pay before you charge interest.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:03.180]   We have mentioned before, you can't buy cryptocurrency
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:07.140]   with it, neither can you buy gambling chips.
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:12.620]   You can't buy, what was the other thing?
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.420]   You can't bet the ponies with it.
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:15.420]   Then I'm the ponies with it.
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.260]   Can't buy porn.
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.740]   I mean, we have our limits here, Leo.
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.220]   Yeah, we have our limits.
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.380]   Any illegal purpose, obviously.
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:26.300]   Well, I immediately thought, well, what if you go
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.540]   to your local weed store to buy, you know--
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.540]   That's legal in California.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.380]   You're animals.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.900]   Right, but it's federally illegal.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.180]   So what is their standard for legal versus illegal?
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.700]   Well, I want you to go try it.
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.820]   I think it's a lot of work at the Google Play Store.
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.660]   That's--
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.260]   Oh, wouldn't that be funny?
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.820]   Sorry, we don't work with Google.
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:47.540]   I think most of the, across the states
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.420]   that have legalized marijuana is still mostly a cash business.
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.260]   Really?
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.100]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.100]   You can't go trouble banking.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.860]   No, well, they're moving towards it, but even--
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.340]   I've used a credit card at a dispensary not to buy pot,
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.660]   but to buy a jewel for my daughter.
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.620]   Maybe if I were gonna buy, if I'd bought marijuana,
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.220]   they would have said, no, you have to pay cash.
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.660]   I think that they were set up to take credit cards.
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.020]   But this is Marin.
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.020]   Right.
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.860]   It's still a large credit card.
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:15.700]   It depends.
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.140]   I know that that was an issue in Colorado, where they--
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.940]   The problem is they're afraid of federal law.
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:20.460]   Federal law.
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.700]   And so they keep--
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.060]   It would make a record of you making that kind of a purchase.
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.980]   Well, no, it's not so much that it was mostly a--
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.940]   they can't-- it's the banking on the dispensary end.
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.460]   Oh.
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.420]   It's still the issue.
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.300]   Yeah, credit card companies won't work with them.
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.300]   Yeah.
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:35.980]   Interesting.
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:40.340]   Yeah, well, nor will the Apple card probably.
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.060]   All right.
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.500]   Well, it shows you what a lot of FUD can emerge.
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.500]   Even with Apple, I saw an editorial the other day about--
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.140]   well, you can't buy cryptocurrency
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.540]   with the Apple credit card.
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.940]   I wonder what else Apple will say you can't buy with it.
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.820]   And if I were the person who replies to such things,
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:05.260]   I'm saying, because it's the same reason why you can't buy
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:09.100]   like a gift card with a credit card, usually.
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.460]   Or you have to-- you can't buy an unsecured thing.
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.860]   You can't buy a secure method of payment
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.420]   with an unsecured method of payment.
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.340]   I have faith that they're going to let you buy a white suit
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.380]   or a white dress after Labor Day, if that's
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.620]   what people are worried about.
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:26.140]   I don't know.
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:27.260]   I think it's very common.
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.220]   I think it's very common.
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.700]   And I think it's very common.
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.180]   Go ahead, Laurie.
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.180]   I think it's very common that banks--
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.940]   they're all starting to go that route.
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.020]   I think at the beginning, cryptocurrency
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.780]   is sort of a little of an unknown quantity.
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.660]   And then once banks started realizing
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.540]   the volatility of that type of currency,
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.780]   quite a few of them-- the big majors like JP Morgan and Steph,
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.420]   they've all said, no, you can't buy and sell
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.700]   with cryptocurrency with that.
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.020]   So it's a Goldman Sachs thing.
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.860]   That's not an Apple thing.
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.460]   That's just the way this bank is making decisions
[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.980]   on how to protect themselves, basically.
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.380]   And I still think with all of this,
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.180]   with Apple Cash and the Apple credit card,
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.900]   I mean, they are like--
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.820]   because the Apple Cash is essentially a savings account
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.540]   that doesn't give you interest.
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.700]   But that's what Venmo does.
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:17.580]   That's what PayPal does.
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.580]   And all of these guys want you to leave your money
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.500]   in their thing because--
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.060]   They make money off the end of the wealth.
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:27.900]   I want to do a little explainer on the whole notion of float.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:28.940]   Because that's what this is.
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.580]   They make money on your money, and you don't give you any of it.
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.740]   Well, the question that I have is
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.860]   that once the credit card gets moving and all those pieces,
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:41.540]   when does Apple just say your Apple Cash gets interest?
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.940]   That is a savings account.
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.100]   They just started paying you interest on your Apple Cash.
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.260]   And then they're floating all that money
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.020]   that then supports the credit card.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.940]   That would be interesting.
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:53.820]   There's a cycle there that--
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:54.940]   They wouldn't have to pay much.
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.620]   I mean, even a savings account of the bank is usually less--
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.620]   It's less than one million.
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.620]   I'm just doing the math.
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.020]   On Alex having six Mac Pros times six displays
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.580]   for each of those Mac Pros.
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:05.780]   All in his Apple Cash.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:06.780]   Three percent of what he has cash back.
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.220]   But look like that.
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.300]   But these two things together form a pretty interesting cycle,
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.900]   especially if you think about using credit
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.700]   for your hardware purchases.
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.100]   Well, that's all I have.
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.860]   Apple has a completely closed system.
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:19.700]   People put money in.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.140]   But they also make money from all the merchants, right?
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.420]   It's like a regular credit card.
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.140]   There's a percentage charge to the merchants.
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.020]   I think it's a standard--
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.380]   It's a two and a half or whatever.
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:30.900]   Well, Goldman's getting started.
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.700]   Does Goldman get all of it?
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.300]   I don't think it all of it, but that's all.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.300]   I think that's--
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.460]   It's kind of important to understand.
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.460]   This really is a Goldman Sachs credit card.
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:39.980]   Yes.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.220]   With an Apple cost.
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.540]   That Apple did the software for the wallet.
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.340]   They have the wallet.
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.580]   It ties to Apple Pay, but so does every credit card
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:46.940]   in the world.
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.900]   They designed the card.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.020]   And they designed the titanium card.
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.180]   But everything else, you're really
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.420]   getting a Goldman Sachs card.
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.540]   Goldman, by the way, wants to get into banking, too.
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.780]   They created an online bank called Marcus.
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.860]   And so this is their first credit card.
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.380]   This is--
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.500]   This is singular.
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.700]   What's singular was to the iPhone.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.580]   Desperate company will do let Apple do almost anything
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.500]   that they want, but they're still providing the service.
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.500]   But truthfully, there's a win-win for Goldman, right?
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.900]   They get all the gloss of the Apple brand.
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.860]   They get to create a credit card that's going to have big uptake.
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:16.260]   That's right.
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.500]   They're good customers.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.060]   They would never--
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.260]   Goldman would never be able to launch a credit card at this level.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.380]   Not with this kind of success.
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.780]   Talk about getting into the business.
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.220]   I mean, because everybody I know that has an iPhone
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.340]   wants to get a--
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.740]   Is it a MasterCard or a Visa?
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:30.660]   Visa, I think.
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.660]   MasterCard is a MasterCard.
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.460]   Is it a MasterCard?
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.660]   I think the logo is a MasterCard circle.
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:34.460]   It's a MasterCard.
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.300]   It's a MasterCard.
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.460]   OK.
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.260]   So MasterCard probably gets a little big, too, right?
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.100]   Yeah.
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.860]   But there's another question that there's
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.300]   a point at which the government needs
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.820]   to know if someone is making a lot of money
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.660]   or someone is being paid a lot of money.
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:54.180]   So if the AppleCard was ever being used in such a way
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.420]   that I'm paying you under the table--
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.260]   because I'm paying you under the table.
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.900]   So I'm paying you with my ApplePay.
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.060]   And it's not-- it's going from my ApplePay account
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.780]   to your ApplePay account without going
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.420]   into what could be called a bank.
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:12.500]   That could be a regulatory problem, I think.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.700]   So I don't know if Apple is ever going to want to let people--
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.140]   let people use the AppleCard as a way
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.580]   to park a great deal of money indefinitely
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.820]   or transfer a great deal of money indefinitely
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.340]   without, at some point, putting it into an actual bank
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.180]   account, because at some point the government wants to see
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:36.620]   that, hey, I wonder why Alex paid Andy $12,000
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.940]   two weeks ago.
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:42.140]   Right before he made that trip to that place
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.700]   where they make the bad things.
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.580]   I completely agree with you.
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.180]   I don't think there is a point where
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.220]   it's an official bank Apple account.
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.500]   But I don't think that you could go very softly
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.060]   into that right now.
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.460]   So I think that you could just say,
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.380]   hey, we're going to give you interest for the AppleCash.
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.580]   And then that would be it.
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.180]   They don't have to--
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.340]   I wonder if Goldman would let them--
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:06.020]   because Goldman is offering 2.15% of its savings accounts
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:06.620]   on Marcus.
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.980]   So I think this would be competing.
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.340]   Unless they use Goldman to do it.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.620]   Now, if they use Goldman to do it, it seems like it would be--
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.420]   That would-- and if you gave me 2.15%,
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.020]   I would believe it all in there, right?
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.260]   That's better than you're going to get for most banks.
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:19.820]   Exactly.
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.580]   And that's where I think that this--
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.460]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.980]   So they're really in bed with Goldman.
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.020]   Oh, I don't know if they are.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.860]   But I'm-- oh, it would make it very easy to--
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.060]   for next year, they would add a new feature saying, oh,
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.220]   by the way, now we have investment services.
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.580]   Now we have-- we've partnered up with Goldman Sachs
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.980]   to give you investment services--
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:36.980]   Right.
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.260]   --and retirement services--
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:38.260]   Right.
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.260]   --and saving services.
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.900]   And we make it so easy to transfer money on a regular basis
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.580]   or even voluntarily from your Apple--
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.420]   Guarantee.
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.100]   --into your bank.
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:46.100]   Yeah.
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.660]   I mean, that's a guarantee they're going to do that.
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.300]   I mean, Apple has an opportunity to do
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.940]   a market opportunity every time you have for Apple,
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.820]   every time you have an industry that isn't run very well.
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:56.820]   Things don't work.
[00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.900]   But you could say that, but it's still covalent in general,
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.420]   that that's the opportunities to disintermediate these old--
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.260]   But Apple specifically is less about--
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:09.660]   because Bezos says, your margin is my opportunity.
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.300]   For Apple, it's your ineffectiveness--
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:12.820]   Yeah.
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:13.780]   --is our opportunity--
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.380]   --your inefficiency-- and ease of use.
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.300]   And so I think that the banking industry has--
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.460]   and I don't think that the investment industry is--
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.460]   that one's so complicated.
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.620]   I think that-- I think Apple could spend a lot of time
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.780]   in just the consumer side of savings.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.580]   They could do that for a decade before they did anything else.
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.300]   Because it builds such a tight relationship with your phone.
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.180]   Also, given that you've got companies
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:41.220]   like Robinhood coming along offering no fee stock purchases,
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.060]   that's going to be a tough market, I think.
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:43.660]   Well, and also--
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.740]   You're going up against Schwab and Fligality.
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:46.820]   And then Robin--
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.260]   It's much more volatile.
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.620]   I mean, people's savings accounts are their savings accounts.
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.260]   Whereas if you start getting the loans,
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.780]   now you're starting to worry about the economy,
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.300]   and I don't know where the economy is going to go.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.500]   I mean, the stock market went down
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.980]   a 1,000 points last week yesterday.
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.700]   So we don't know-- that's a really volatile place to live.
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:06.660]   Whereas savings and basic credit is a much simpler place to be.
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.540]   And I think that it's easier to cut into that market,
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.740]   because everyone-- it's complicated and painful
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.140]   for everyone right now.
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:14.860]   I keep checking my email.
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:15.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.420]   I'll cut you an evade.
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.220]   I shouldn't have thought you'd innovate, but they could do.
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.180]   What could they do?
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.580]   I'm looking at my email.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.580]   Please.
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.220]   Send me an email.
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.900]   I don't know whether I'm more anxious to get an invitation
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.660]   in next month's iPhone event or a card invitation.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.660]   Why not both?
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.060]   Why not both, Apples?
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.060]   Let's kiss and make up.
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:38.700]   What if they gave you your card at the Apple event?
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.180]   Oh.
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.860]   As soon as you walk in the car, they just handed over.
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:43.180]   Yeah.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:43.860]   At the door.
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.180]   You're a card for everyone.
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:49.060]   And they had new iPhones available at the exit.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.780]   That would be cold blooded.
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:52.420]   Cool.
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:58.540]   Well, your brain is still filled with irrational molecules.
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:03.540]   I need the 512 gigabyte version of this with a larger screen.
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:06.060]   Who turned about four of them?
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:09.980]   And if I'm buying it with my Apple card, I'm saving money.
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:13.100]   3% back in Alex Blux.
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.740]   Let's take a little break.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.020]   And we have the quarterly-- it seems like a year ago,
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.460]   but Apple's quarterly results came out one week ago.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.020]   And we've had time to digest.
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.340]   And more importantly, Jason Snow has had time
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.020]   to make color graphs.
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.740]   And we couldn't have--
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:27.660]   What would we do without that?
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.060]   We can't start talking about it until we have the color graph.
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.340]   Jason's funny because I asked him.
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:32.340]   I said, that must take a lot of time.
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.460]   He says, no, it takes zero time because it's all automated.
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.260]   Brilliant.
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.180]   Always create blog posts you can do on your sleep.
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:41.660]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.980]   That's the secret to success.
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.060]   Our show today brought to you by Cap Terra.
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.460]   I'll tell you another secret to success.
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:51.340]   Stop using that software that the boss's nephew Joey
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:56.900]   wrote in 1998 that requires Windows XP and an Explorer 8
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.060]   to run.
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.860]   That's no way to run a business.
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.540]   Unfortunately, I know many businesses.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.700]   There's still that one XP machine in the corner
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.340]   because they need it to run their line of business software.
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:11.220]   Cap Terra is a directory of modern business tools
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.620]   that you can use, that you can make your business run better
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.540]   on right now.
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:22.180]   Don't Google, don't ask friends, just go to Cap Terra
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:27.660]   and pick the software you need to turn your business around.
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.300]   And one of the things I love about Cap Terra
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.500]   is you get thousands, hundreds of thousands,
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.500]   almost a million now.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.060]   They're up to 975,000 reviews from people
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.820]   who actually use the software.
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.820]   So it's like you are getting the recommendation from a friend.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.500]   Here's data extraction software.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.500]   I don't even know what that category is.
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.060]   Once you find the category you want,
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.260]   there's 700 categories and drill down a little bit.
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:52.500]   Then you can narrow it down based on number of stars
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.700]   and how it's installed, whether you install it
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.620]   on a hard driver, it runs in the cloud on how many seats,
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.260]   whether you can, you know, it has features
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.980]   that you want and so forth.
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.940]   And those features, by the way, are specific
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.740]   to the category you're in.
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.420]   So with data extraction software,
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.140]   there's data extraction features.
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:11.740]   You know, you can check the boxes.
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:14.100]   And then get a side-by-side comparison
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:18.980]   of the top choices and then read reviews from actual users.
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.340]   And the nice thing is,
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.420]   oh, look, that's new popular comparisons too.
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.860]   So you can see what other people are comparing
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.740]   in that category to get more ideas.
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.740]   This is all about getting ideas for the software
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:32.700]   you can use to transform your business.
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.940]   And with more than a thousand new reviews every day,
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.260]   these are a fresh up-to-date reviews,
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.500]   almost a million of them from actual users.
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.100]   Kaptara's really good about vetting all the reviews.
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.020]   You're gonna know exactly what you're getting
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.260]   before you get it.
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.660]   No matter what kind of software you be,
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:47.660]   your need for your business.
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:52.060]   Kaptara makes it easy to discover the right solution fast.

[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.260]   Kaptara believes software makes the world a better place
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.500]   'cause software can help every organization
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.780]   become more efficient and more effective.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.660]   Kaptara.com/MacBreak.
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.460]   Software selection, simplified.
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.420]   Free, that's my favorite part.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.620]   Free, free.
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:52.420]   All right, six colors, two, six colors we go for the graphs,
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.300]   but before we do that, let's get the top line
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.340]   from Renee Richie.
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.900]   You, of course, had to hustle off the show last week
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.540]   to listen to the call.
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.500]   Impressions, what did you think?
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.780]   Yeah, it was really interesting.
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:07.420]   It was the first year since 2012
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.100]   that the iPhone didn't account for more than half
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.100]   of Apple's revenue.
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.980]   And that's a little bit mushy
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.900]   because this is the lowest quarter for the iPhone
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.180]   and come Q1, you know, come the holiday quarter,
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.300]   iPhone's probably gonna be back over that line for now.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.060]   But it's interesting in that Apple was way too dependent
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.500]   on iPhone previously.
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.660]   And now that iPhone is more of a mix in their products,
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.500]   some people are worried that the iPhone is like,
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.940]   we're post iPhone era, the iPhone is over.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:36.260]   But I think what Apple's done successfully
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:37.900]   is build out the wearables.
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.340]   Wearables was up 50%, including AirPods
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.420]   and including Apple Watch, that right now supplement iPhone
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.140]   but are becoming increasingly independent year after year.
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.420]   And also the content services, which were up even in China,
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.860]   which people, you know, those sell into the massive install base,
[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.460]   which Tim Cook said was growing thanks to people
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.060]   still switching, people still upgrading
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.140]   and people who are still new to iPhone
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:03.980]   and the install base of the iPhone was up again this quarter.
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:07.180]   So I think it's a very transitional period for Apple
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:11.020]   because the iPhone was a business that made fossil fuel
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:15.100]   magnets just jealous with profit driven rage.
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.940]   And now it's becoming a much more mature, much more flat,
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.620]   probably iPad style business where it will go up and down
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.660]   depending on the newness of models, the level of competition
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.340]   and how many of the billion people are upgrading any given year,
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.740]   but they're supplementing out with many more diverse products
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.220]   that are built up on top of it.
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.900]   So I think it's Wall Street hated the old narrative,
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.300]   which was Apple was a product company
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.740]   and this is a really big product
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.140]   because they never thought it could last,
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:44.180]   but they seem much more enamored with the current services
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.940]   and more diverse product portfolio.
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:50.300]   And I think we're not for the tariff fears we're seeing right now,
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.820]   Apple would have come out of the quarter pretty well positioned
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:53.820]   going into the next one.
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:59.300]   - Here's the pie chart that Jason generated of revenue by category.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.020]   And yeah, you can see the iPhone is only 48%.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.180]   I mean, it really is a little slice there.
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.900]   But if you include all hardware, iPhone, iMac and iPad,
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.220]   it's still a hardware company, 68% hardware company,
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:15.340]   services coming on strong and make an interesting point.
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:18.780]   10% of revenue came from wearables,
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.220]   which is a bad name, it was the other category.
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:23.460]   It includes wearables like the watch and the AirPods,
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.420]   but also the Home Hub, the HomePod rather.
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.740]   - Beats, yeah.
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:31.340]   - All of Beats, is Apple TV in that? Where is Apple TV?
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:34.180]   - I think the HomePod and TV are in accessories,
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.100]   but I'm not positive.
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.780]   - Okay, so that's the accessory, wearables, home accessories.
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.740]   So 10%.
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.060]   But yeah, that's the bottom line is we knew
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.460]   we would be watching services and services.
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:46.860]   - And it's kind of sort of hardware,
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.260]   but it's differentiated with its software and services.
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.260]   There's always been Apple's thing.
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.860]   Like if you want a Mac OS, you have to buy a Mac.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:54.900]   - Right.
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.660]   - And Mac revenue up, which is great,
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:03.100]   5.8% increase, I'm sorry, it's 5.8 billion,
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:06.620]   which percentage-wise is an 11% increase year over year.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.140]   - iPad was strong, too, not to the degree wearables were,
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.060]   but they were still strong.
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.140]   - Yeah, iPad year over year, revenue up 8%.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.620]   So yeah, and I think that's the iPad Pro, right?
[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:17.980]   That's a really important.
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.700]   - And iPad Pro, but also they released the Air
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.260]   and the new Mini, which probably give them
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.060]   a good jolt going into the quarter.
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:27.340]   - iPhone revenue, the lowest it's been in about two years,
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.540]   typical though for a Q3 to be kind of low.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.260]   - Yeah, and also one of the big changes,
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.860]   everyone loves to say that Tim Cook is way too money-oriented
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:37.060]   and way too squeezing profit out of Apple,
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.580]   but margins have been down considerably
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.140]   since the end of the Steve Jobs year.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.780]   They think they peaked in 2012 as well.
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.060]   And because the components and what Apple's putting in them
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.700]   have been getting more and more expensive.
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:48.780]   The margins have been going down
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.220]   and that means the profit from those in businesses.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.300]   And now that Apple doesn't disclose unit sales
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.540]   and we're looking at profit,
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.260]   it doesn't always look so good for them.
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.820]   - I should point out service revenue was flat
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:30:59.820]   from last quarter.
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.540]   I mean, it's been going up, it's 11 and a half billion,
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.900]   but it was 11 and a half billion last quarter too.
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:06.820]   Does that mean anything?
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:10.540]   Services is not as cyclical as you can see from this chart
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:14.060]   as hardware sales, those are very cyclical.
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.020]   Services should be going up fairly steadily every year.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.980]   Why did they not go up this quarter?
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.060]   - I like the way that Jason does it in that,
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.860]   like he does to make a role rather than doing
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.780]   straight quarter to quarter or year to year compares,
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:28.060]   which always fluctuate because of the number of the weeks
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.940]   in the quarter or because of the currency fluctuations.
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:33.020]   So there's all sorts of different factors,
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.540]   but Apple, we're still waiting for those big TV,
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:36.940]   Apple TV plus launch.
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.820]   We're still waiting for the Apple Arcade launch.
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.940]   We have Apple News, but that's been factored in
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.260]   for a few quarters now.
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.660]   Apple Music was growing and Apple Care was growing,
[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:47.380]   which I wasn't anticipating.
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:48.900]   Not that I don't think Apple Care is good,
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.620]   I just didn't think it was a huge growth bonanza for Apple.
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:52.860]   - Yeah, and so that makes sense.
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.220]   Without anything really new to talk about,
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.820]   it makes sense it would kind of hum along,
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:01.060]   but expect to bump because of the Apple card,
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.820]   because of Apple TV plus.
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.620]   - It does feel like the next quarter of the day.
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:05.460]   - Next quarter, big.
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:06.380]   - Yeah.
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.580]   - Laurie, what was your top line?
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.380]   'Cause you had to write it all down.
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.020]   (laughing)
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:12.820]   As you're listening.
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.980]   - I successfully got the transcripts done, yeah.
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.260]   - That's the top line.
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:19.780]   - I think just listening to the entire thing,
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.220]   I remember going, whoa, really?
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:25.300]   When they talked about the wearables category
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.660]   and it's the how well it's doing right now,
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:29.740]   it almost makes me question,
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.980]   like did they start throwing something into
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.140]   the wearables category that we don't know about?
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.660]   And that's why it's doing so well and growing so much,
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:42.660]   but it's just getting more and more successful.
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:46.620]   And if the fact that home is one of the categories,
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.420]   right now Apple doesn't have any home hardware products,
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:54.420]   but they did announce that HomeKit is coming to routers
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:58.900]   later this year, so we might see them
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.620]   kind of get back into the router business
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.980]   and maybe that's why they've adjusted that category
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.420]   titling a little to include home.
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.540]   Otherwise, why would they do that?
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:09.980]   Because what are they putting in there
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:10.940]   that they're calling at home?
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.620]   So it's interesting to see that in,
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.460]   yeah, the wearables category.
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:20.460]   And I was honestly surprised, not surprised in the numbers,
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:25.900]   but surprised to hear that iPhone was not above 50% this year.
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.500]   I don't think it means anything negative.
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.060]   I think it's actually a very positive thing.
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:30.980]   - It's probably good.
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.460]   You don't want to have too much of your company
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.380]   bet on one product.
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.700]   - Exactly, they're spreading out their portfolios
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.220]   so that if something were to happen
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.220]   and people just suddenly decided
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.740]   that they don't give a crap about iPhones,
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.980]   we're only losing 48% of the business now,
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:50.460]   which a couple of years ago it was a huge portion.
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:53.100]   - I do wonder this September announcement,
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.900]   iPhone announcement, it's only a month off.
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.060]   I do wonder what it is that's gonna be in the new iPhone
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:01.180]   that's gonna make me say, oh, my 10S Max is at a date.
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:05.820]   I can't see them doing anything spectacular.
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.140]   I mean, adding another camera.
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.940]   - I mean, their goal is to,
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.540]   their goal with the iPhone 10S was to get iPhone 6,
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.420]   and iPhone 6.
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:13.740]   - So that's what they're doing.
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:15.620]   - They're saying we're gonna get the three or four-year
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:16.460]   upgradeers.
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.300]   - Yeah, it's not.
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.140]   - Previously, it was like every two, three years now.
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:20.700]   It's now they're aiming for iPhone 7,
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:22.820]   so it's gone to about two to four years.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.220]   - And it's a huge upgrade if you're using an iPhone 7.
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:26.060]   - Oh yeah.
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.540]   - And it's gonna be better than it was before.
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:30.180]   And so there's a lot of people there
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:33.580]   that are pregnant to buy.
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.060]   So I think that they have a lot of people there
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.340]   that they can keep moving forward.
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:39.780]   I don't think that they have to.
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:44.020]   I think I'd love to see a longer lens on the camera.
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.100]   I do a lot of zooming.
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.580]   - I think that's the rumor, right?
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:49.860]   They're gonna put a third lens on there.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:52.740]   - The profit was the lowest.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:54.380]   It's been in a couple of years as well.
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:58.500]   A mere $10 billion, which is all right for three months.
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:02.220]   They're on a run for the last year of about $55 billion.
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.460]   That's profit.
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:07.340]   They do have a much smaller cash holding now
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.260]   because they've been buying back stock.
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.740]   And they've also been investing.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:17.420]   One of the things extracted from the quarterly report
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:20.620]   is a big jump in R&D spending for Apple.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:25.620]   Probably the largest R&D spend in many, many, many years.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:29.500]   - Lori, did Tim Cook address that at all
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:33.940]   when he talked about forward looking stuff?
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:35.700]   - You know, I think it was actually a question
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.060]   that was addressed to Luca.
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.340]   And I think he was the only one that addressed it.
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:41.660]   - What did Luca say?
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:43.500]   - It was about the Intel thing.
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.100]   I think he was kind of mentioning that.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.420]   - So that's one reason for the increase
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:47.900]   is a billion dollars to Intel.
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:48.740]   That goes under R&D.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:49.580]   - Right, right.
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:54.580]   And they're constantly looking to invest in their future.
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:59.980]   I think if I remember there's like this,
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.740]   do they call it the Cook Doctrine,
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:06.740]   which is we want to be in control
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:10.500]   of all of the technology that goes into what we do.
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.900]   So they're kind of just spreading it out,
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.820]   doing a lot of research and development
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:15.660]   to make sure they're kept on.
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:17.020]   - The cracks me up, they call that the Cook Doctrine
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.340]   because honestly, isn't that what Steve always said too?
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.180]   - Yes.
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.340]   - Vertical integration.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:23.860]   You make the best software, if you make the best hardware
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.420]   and you make vice versa.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.260]   - Right.
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.580]   We wouldn't have max and iPhones and iPads.
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.820]   It went for that doctrine that came long before it's in Cook.
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.660]   - Right.
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:34.500]   - It's always been there.
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.340]   - One of the things that.
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.260]   - The only time they moved away from it
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.540]   is when they started licensing the OS
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:40.140]   and that was a huge mistake.
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.740]   And that was before Steve.
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.140]   - That's funny 'cause you've been asking
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:44.180]   that for that for years.
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:46.340]   You want Apple to give away Mac OS.
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.060]   - I want them to give away when they're ready,
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.180]   when they're done with it.
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.020]   - Right.
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:50.860]   (laughing)
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.820]   - That's a drop, take a version of it
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.260]   and push it into the end, you know,
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.100]   and give it away.
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:57.820]   - So what you're saying is we should have
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:00.140]   the open source OS 9, Mac OS 9.
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.820]   - You know, this is like.
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.100]   - This is some seven, open source it.
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:03.940]   - You can use it in OS.
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.500]   - And these guys have to let people run with it
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.820]   so that they can, you know,
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:10.700]   but it depends on when the merge actually,
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:11.980]   you know, we're slowly moving toward.
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.020]   You can just see these two OS's.
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.500]   I don't think they're necessarily going to become
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.140]   one or the other, but you're seeing kind of this,
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.540]   the iPad experience. - Some kind of scurrying on it.
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.540]   - The iPad experience is more like the Mac experience.
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.180]   The Mac experience is more like the iPad experience.
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:26.020]   - It feels like the other shoot-and-drop will be armed.
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:30.260]   - And then once, we've talked a lot about this
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.220]   and I think, I don't know how you guys feel.
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:36.100]   I think mostly the sense I'm getting from a lot of people,
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.540]   including Jean-Louis Gesset and his Monday note,
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.020]   which he wrote last week,
[00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.300]   is that there will be Intel high-end,
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:44.420]   the Mac Pro is going to have to stay on Z on.
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.980]   It's going to have to stay on Intel,
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.660]   but that everything else can go arm, everything.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.740]   You'll have a MacBook Air on all.
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.100]   - What I'm curious about is now that we saw this,
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.780]   I mean, the most incredible piece of desktop hardware
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.260]   that I've ever seen released.
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.340]   I mean, you know, it--
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.580]   - I'm still cleaning up the drool.
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.420]   - I know, it's like--
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:01.420]   (laughing)
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.100]   - I have to clean it up every time I look at the page,
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.660]   you know, and I would love one of those so bad.
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:06.500]   - Oh my God.
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.340]   - But they just can't.
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:08.580]   - So anyway, so--
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.580]   - And borrow Elieces.
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:12.540]   - What that keeps having me think about is
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.980]   I want that version of a MacBook Pro.
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.660]   You know, like I want them to build the tank version
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:22.620]   of the MacBook Pro, and then that stays on Intel,
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.340]   but it's got two Intel processors,
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.260]   and it's got, you know, and you know,
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.420]   it heats up your, you know, like it--
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:29.260]   - Yeah.
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:30.260]   - You have to have a special pad
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.100]   so it doesn't light up your desk
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.420]   when you have it sitting on it.
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:34.260]   - Cooks it on it.
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:37.140]   - But the idea is like to have this gorgeous, massive,
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.900]   super powerful MacBook Pro is something
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.980]   that I would love to see, and then arm for everything else.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.260]   You know, and because most people are not using it that way,
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.180]   and the reality is is the new MacBook Pros
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:50.420]   are not MacBook Pros, they're MacBook-er-ish kind of things,
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.780]   you know, so I'm also squeezing my iPad.
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:53.620]   - One of the--
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.700]   - R&D spending-- - Go ahead, Renee,
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:56.540]   and I'll talk about it.
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.180]   - One of the things to remember is that when Apple made
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.380]   the iPhone, just in terms of Apple R&D,
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.860]   that was largely a resource that they already had
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.140]   at their disposal, they just were more efficient with them,
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.860]   they moved people over to make the iPhone.
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.620]   There were some things like antennas and modems
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:12.060]   that they had to work on, but that was largely just all Mac,
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:15.140]   the same ID department, same human interface department,
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.620]   same Objective-C department, all working on the iPhone.
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.860]   So the R&D was ridiculously low,
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.420]   but as they move into augmented reality
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:23.300]   and into autonomous technologies,
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.500]   those are all brand new.
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.820]   There's no company, they're buying a bunch of small companies,
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:29.100]   but it's not like just buying next
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.700]   and doing something for years
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.700]   and then just popping them over to something else.
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.340]   So the massive increase in spend we see
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:37.060]   is because they're working incredibly hard on miniaturization
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.380]   and they're working incredibly hard
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.700]   on brand new tech, breaking brand new technologies,
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.340]   which is always much more expensive.
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.500]   - According to a CNBC, Apple is spending the largest
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.620]   proportion of its revenue on R&D since 2003,
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:54.620]   $4.2 billion this quarter, which means it's on a pace
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:59.100]   to spend $16 billion for 2019 on research.
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.660]   - And that includes micro LED, that includes modems,
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.220]   that includes all the autonomous technology,
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:06.900]   all the AR technology, all the things that are going into it.
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.380]   - I agree 100% with what Renee's been saying,
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:12.740]   that I can't think of a time when Apple has been,
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.940]   so they've been working so heavily in stuff
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.860]   that absolutely does not exist yet,
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:21.060]   where they can't buy manufacturing capacity for this.
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.780]   They can't buy this technology from somebody else,
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.940]   they can't adapt something that someone else has
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:28.340]   before they figure out how to do it themselves.
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:32.340]   Just as Renee said, if you're working on augmented reality,
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.060]   we don't have wearables yet
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.660]   that can really do augmented reality,
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:37.860]   they're gonna have to design it.
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.420]   If they really are serious about autonomous vehicles,
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.180]   we don't really have that yet,
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.340]   so they have to build that.
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.580]   And even the components like micro LED,
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.940]   that is really going to be a big part
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:51.460]   of the next part of miniaturizing wearables.
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:54.740]   If we wanna get an Apple watch that's substantially thinner
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.060]   than what we have right now,
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.900]   or can finally last two or three days between a charge,
[00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.060]   we're gonna need brand new display technology,
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:02.580]   which doesn't exist yet.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.460]   And so if Apple really wants to continue to be ahead,
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.060]   there's, I can't, like I said,
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.660]   I can't remember a time in Apple history
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.860]   where so much of what their plans are
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:15.260]   involves stuff that they're gonna have to cook up themselves.
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:18.580]   - Lori, did Tim Cook say anything about AR?
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:22.780]   - It was like 45,000 words, give me a break.
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.300]   (laughing)
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.020]   - I just, the reason I asked that is he said
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.940]   every earnings call until the last one he mentioned
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.180]   he would talk about how exciting this opportunity was,
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:34.860]   and then he seemed to have kind of dropped it.
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.100]   - Yeah, so that is something interesting
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:39.620]   that we didn't hear, I'm not gonna say
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.340]   we didn't hear anything about AR,
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:44.660]   but we definitely didn't hear that same sentiment
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:48.140]   from Cook or anybody with this,
[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:49.860]   we're bullish on the future of AR,
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:53.420]   that kind of, you always heard it for a couple of years now
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:56.700]   that's been part of their chant at these earnings calls,
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:59.340]   and there was no significant mention of it,
[00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:01.260]   possibly not at all.
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.780]   - What forward looking stuff did they bring up?
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.500]   Did they talk about cars?
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.380]   Did they talk about-- - Nope, nope.
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.100]   Nope, they didn't talk about cars.
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.260]   - 'Cause as I remember last week,
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:14.460]   one of the things we said we were gonna pay attention to
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.340]   is Tim, 'cause they do this every year,
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.940]   the CEO and the CFO will maybe say,
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:22.620]   and here looking forward, here's our prospects looking forward,
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:24.660]   a lot of times that's just stuff for the stock market,
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:28.380]   like we'll expect sales, cost per share,
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.220]   whatever, I don't know, the terms,
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:32.460]   but we expect sales of iPhone to go up 10%,
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:33.740]   we expense the earnings per share
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.640]   to go down three cents or whatever.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:39.460]   Did he say it, Renee, did you remember anything particular?
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.660]   He said about the future that would be of interest to us
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.340]   as you use it. - He does it?
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:46.180]   - Sometimes it really depends on the technologies.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:47.980]   Like you had to have Gene Munster every quarter
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.980]   asking about the Apple television to get that hard.
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:51.420]   - Yeah, he does stuff. - Every quarter.
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.060]   And this year they didn't,
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:54.900]   like there weren't those types of questions.
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.260]   People were really preoccupied with China.
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:58.380]   One of the only questions was,
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.300]   what do you think they asked about catalysts
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.180]   and about the technologies that were introduced at WWDC?
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.300]   And I think Cook was not prepared.
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.180]   Maybe he thought about it,
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.660]   but it was such a kind of a mundane question.
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:09.500]   He's like, yeah, of course people are super excited
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.340]   about him, we announced them at WWDC.
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.100]   If they weren't exciting, we wouldn't have announced them.
[00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:16.140]   - Yeah. - No, that's a stock answer
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:17.980]   if I ever heard one.
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:20.340]   - Yeah, but I could send the message to the president,
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:21.860]   however, and we talked a little bit
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.460]   about the political crosswinds, tariffs and so forth.
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:27.060]   And President Trump has tweeted something about,
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:30.820]   Apple should be moving all its manufacturer back to the US.
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.100]   We had, Apple didn't specifically say
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.620]   where the new Mac Pro will be made,
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.020]   but the implication and the rumors were in China.
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:40.940]   Cook said he wants to make the Mac Pro in the US
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.260]   as the original Mac Pro was.
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:43.780]   - Yeah, I didn't say that, or did he refer,
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:47.380]   I couldn't tell if he said they want to assemble the 2019
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:49.060]   Mac Pro in the US.
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:51.140]   - I mean, he's put the doors on.
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:52.700]   - Assembly. - Yeah.
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:56.420]   - Is why Apple requests the exclusion from the tariffs
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:58.020]   on importing goods from the China.
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.500]   By the way, Mingchi Kuo and others think that Apple
[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.420]   just absorb any tariff costs, the price says enough.
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:06.020]   - Yeah. - You know, the margins
[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:08.420]   have enough resiliency to absorb the tariff.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:11.140]   In terms, here's the quote.
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:14.140]   In terms of the exclusions, that's the tariffs.
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.940]   We've been making the Mac Pro in the US.
[00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.540]   We want to continue to do that.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.660]   So we're working and investing currently in capacity
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:22.780]   to do so because we want to continue to be here.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:25.140]   And so that's what's behind the exclusions.
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.620]   So we're explaining that and hoping for a positive outcome.
[00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:28.460]   This is his answer.
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:29.620]   - Yeah, so I didn't know like you wanted to,
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.620]   but that's why I'm parsing the words,
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:32.500]   'cause they want to.
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:33.500]   Of course they want to,
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:34.660]   the one they're able to.
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:35.940]   - Yeah, he promised nothing.
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.860]   He promised absolutely nothing.
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:40.580]   - Also, when you talk about making Mac Pros,
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:42.940]   what are you talking about as Alex sort of alluded to?
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:45.820]   Are you talking about, we'll ship in all the components
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.700]   and we'll just have people operating screwdrivers.
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:48.700]   - But that's a subtle thing.
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.260]   The president doesn't care about or know about.
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:55.780]   So that's what I was getting at more is that
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:58.660]   the Mac Pro is probably a platform where built order
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:00.980]   is going to be more important than any other Mac
[00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:01.820]   that they're making.
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:04.260]   So it would be to their advantage,
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.180]   at least for sales in the United States,
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.940]   to assemble these in the United States.
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.540]   Or at the very least to make sure that they didn't build
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:13.660]   too many of one that's not selling anymore.
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:14.980]   And when they need to get more of,
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:16.660]   oh geez, we didn't know the more people
[00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:19.140]   we could be wanting the $30,000 kit
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:20.580]   as opposed to the baseline model.
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:21.740]   Great, we'll manufacture more of those.
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.420]   We'll have those in stores very, very quickly.
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.100]   It'll be more interesting if they said
[00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:29.780]   that we want to assemble iPhones or Mac book airs.
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:31.180]   That would be, oh my God,
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:34.420]   because those simply just arrive completely made.
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:38.220]   There's nothing that takes full advantage
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.180]   of overseas labor and all the advantages you have
[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:41.900]   on using overseas labor.
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:44.300]   That's going to be the big deal
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:46.300]   in terms of moving manufacturers to the United States.
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:47.660]   And if you look at what Foxconn's doing,
[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:50.900]   I mean, they are working very hard
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:53.380]   at automating the entire iPhone process.
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:55.220]   So there's still a lot to do there.
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:56.780]   It takes a human being to do a lot of it,
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:59.540]   but they've talked about it a lot
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:02.500]   about how far they're pushing the automation.
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.900]   And they can come back to the United States
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:04.740]   if it's automated.
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:08.420]   I hope he has the, on iOS today, my app cap was these DJI,
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:13.180]   DJI, DJI, who does the Mavic Pro
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:14.140]   and the other Jerome's.
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:15.460]   They pretty much do the same thing.
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:18.380]   They make these bots, they're called Robomaster.
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:19.380]   This is the Robomaster S1.
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.900]   It's a set of for kids.
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:23.540]   There's apparently a Robomaster competition in China.
[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:26.340]   And so they are selling these now for 500 bucks each,
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:29.060]   but they come disassembled for the most part.
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:29.900]   So you have to put them together.
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:33.020]   70 parts, several hundred screws.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:37.260]   And it gave me a great empathy for the people in Shenzhen
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.300]   who are working night and day to build these.
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:41.820]   'Cause mostly when you buy this kind of stuff, it's done.
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:42.980]   - It's done, it comes in.
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:44.340]   - And I think it was, it's actually,
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:49.340]   there was a, I think a subtle subtext from DJI.
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:50.780]   You wanna see what we do.
[00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:54.500]   - It's so angry at Ikea shells, can you imagine?
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:57.780]   - And by the way, the documentation that they sent out
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.860]   was Ikea style, there was no text.
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:02.500]   It was just pictures and extremely difficult
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.700]   to parse in some places.
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.780]   - There is such a massive market coming
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:10.820]   to the upgrade of manuals, like in construction.
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:11.660]   - Like the fact that works.
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.860]   - Like I'm amazed that Ikea hasn't figured this out.
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:16.140]   Like I just want an iPad app that shows me how to do it.
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.980]   - There's some thought.
[00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:19.620]   This is a little weird.
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.420]   That Ikea doesn't want it to be too easy
[00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:24.820]   because the more you've invested into building this thing,
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.860]   the happier it turns out psychologically,
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:27.700]   the happier it will be.
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:28.540]   - Dude, but I'm never happy with it.
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:30.100]   - It was never built perfectly.
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.980]   - It's always a little, I have shells left over at the end.
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.860]   - It's always like, there's a couple of screws
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:35.860]   and I put one plate on backwards.
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:39.020]   You know, you always look at it going.
[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:40.140]   - Yeah, but it's yours.
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.060]   But you made it.
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:41.900]   - Yeah, but then I feel bad.
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:42.740]   - But it's your child.
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:43.740]   - Yeah, screw that one up.
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:46.620]   - You know, I think if that was their strategy,
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.180]   it's back for him, because people talk about
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:50.700]   how horrible it is to his little Ikea French.
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.500]   - I tell my wife if she gives me Ikea furniture
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.860]   that she has to take the kids out of the house
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.460]   'cause I don't want to be here the language.
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.660]   But there's a serious political point to this,
[00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:01.060]   which is that I don't think American workers
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:02.820]   really want that job either.
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:04.540]   - We don't have people that want it.
[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:07.220]   - It's done in China because that's where you can get
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:09.060]   the people to do it.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:10.220]   - And it is the position.
[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:13.580]   - I've talked to many manufacturing people in the US
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:17.620]   who say we would, I was talking to somebody
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:19.700]   who has a plant in Texas.
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:24.620]   We would, we can't hire people, enough people to do it.
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:26.260]   - And seasonally, they're not even full,
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.780]   they're not even all year round jobs.
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:28.900]   They're highly seasonal jobs,
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:31.900]   which makes them a lot worse for many countries.
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:33.700]   - So I think that that's part of it
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:36.060]   is you may want to assemble it in Dallas.
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:36.900]   - Sure.
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:37.740]   - Awesome. - Good idea,
[00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:38.580]   but it's not gonna happen.
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.420]   - But if there's nobody to do it, how are you gonna do it?
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:41.260]   - Right.
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:42.100]   - Yeah.
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:44.420]   - But if you've offered a contract with medical benefits
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:47.980]   and everything as opposed to dealing with a subcontractor,
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.100]   these jobs might become more attractive.
[00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.220]   - I don't know, the problem is that
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:54.660]   if Amazon is getting complaints about the warehouse,
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:56.940]   the complaints on an iPhone assembly line
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:58.540]   would be astronomical.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.020]   - We need to compare it.
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:04.060]   - I'm not sure that Apple would allow the sort of workplace
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:06.500]   to afford to do it. - No, they couldn't afford
[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:08.500]   to do it, I mean, it's much worse.
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:09.340]   - Yeah.
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:10.180]   - I think they could afford to do it,
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:12.060]   they'd have to raise the price or absorb it lower
[00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:15.180]   than margins, but I've seen studies that say,
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.540]   it would add maybe five, $10 to the cost.
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:20.540]   The problem literally is you can't get Americans to do it.
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:21.380]   - Right.
[00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:22.460]   - Your turnover would be high.
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:24.020]   - You can't get the people to do it.
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:25.620]   And yeah, you nailed it.
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:27.820]   If people hate working in the Amazon warehouse,
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:30.260]   imagine what it would be like to assemble iPhones.
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:32.180]   It's just not a great job.
[00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:35.620]   The good news is the suicide rate at Foxconn has dropped.
[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:38.020]   That's only 'cause they put nets everywhere.
[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:40.460]   I mean, I shouldn't laugh, but it's...
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:43.780]   I don't know.
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.740]   Some people say it's not the job that's repellent,
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:48.700]   it's the wage, but if you put that little tiny screw
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:52.580]   in 500 times a day, and that's all you do,
[00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:55.540]   five days a week, even if you're well paid
[00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:57.100]   and you get benefits.
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:58.740]   I used to do that.
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.260]   I mean, I used to build circuit boards.
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:01.100]   - Yeah.
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:02.140]   - It's grinding.
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.220]   - It's grinding because you have to pay attention enough
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:05.220]   not to screw it up.
[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:06.580]   Like it's not something that's automatic.
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.820]   - By the way, it's something robots do very well.
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:09.660]   - Well, that's what happened.
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:12.100]   What was interesting to me in the company that I worked
[00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.580]   as one, I got out of high school,
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:15.300]   I started shipping, receiving, turned out,
[00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.980]   I was good at packing things.
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:19.060]   And so they went ahead and put me in,
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:20.460]   had me start assembling some stuff.
[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:24.460]   And I was, we were good at it,
[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:29.220]   but they moved, it was a big economic lesson for me.
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:32.060]   They moved the minimum wage from 325 an hour
[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:34.020]   to 375 an hour.
[00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:36.300]   And when they did that, the company laid off 30 people
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:37.820]   and put in a surface mount.
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:39.580]   And they said they were just, it was just amortizing
[00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:41.780]   over a X number of years, it was all they cared about.
[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:42.780]   - So they sold some costs.
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:44.980]   - And they literally just, 30 people lost their job,
[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:47.140]   but this one person got paid a lot more money
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:50.820]   to manage this big machine that just pushed out all the boards.
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:53.540]   And they just said they couldn't do it until it amortized.
[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:57.060]   - The other, let's see, what else did they talk about?
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.580]   Is that pretty much it?
[00:50:58.580 --> 00:50:59.420]   - 5G Leo.
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:01.060]   - 5G, there's the buzzword.
[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:03.500]   - They would not comment about future products.
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:06.060]   - They wouldn't say, yeah.
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:08.140]   Rumor is it won't be this year, it'll be next year.
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:09.900]   - It's gonna help, I hear it's gonna hear,
[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:12.700]   5G's gonna make a huge difference in the rural areas.
[00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:13.740]   - No, it's not.
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:14.580]   (laughing)
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:15.580]   - No, it's not.
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:18.740]   - You see all these things, like how 5G's gonna transform
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:20.580]   the rural areas and you're like,
[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:21.420]   - That's the whole thing.
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:22.940]   - One place is not gonna transform anything.
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:23.820]   - You know, there's--
[00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:26.340]   - 4G they call 5G will be helpful in rural areas,
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:28.260]   but the actual 5G won't be there.
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:31.980]   - Let's take a break and there's more to talk about.
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:33.660]   We will have that in your picks of the week as well,
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.220]   but first a word from our sponsor.
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:39.460]   If you are out in the wild, using the internet
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:42.660]   on an unknown wifi access point,
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:45.020]   you might wanna check out a VPN,
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:48.140]   a virtual private network to protect your security.
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:49.580]   But you know what, you're in the wild,
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:50.420]   even when you're at home,
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:51.940]   because you're in a net service provider
[00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:54.220]   loves to know all the sites you go to.
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:57.220]   And in many cases, even sells that information
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:00.020]   to third parties without your permission or knowledge.
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:04.140]   It's in the fine print, read the agreement you didn't sign.
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:08.300]   ExpressVPN is my choice for a virtual private network.
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:11.820]   It's funny, we were talking on Windows Weekly last Wednesday,
[00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:13.820]   Paul was talking about his travel kit,
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:17.620]   what he uses when he goes, he's using Amsterdam right now,
[00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:21.380]   and at Airbnb, or I guess it was a house exchange.
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.980]   But he says, I don't know what the wifi is like or whatever,
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:25.500]   so I use ExpressVPN.
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.380]   I don't think even knew they were a sponsor,
[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:28.460]   but I thanked him.
[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:31.540]   ExpressVPN, that's our choice.
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:33.140]   ExpressVPN is easy to use,
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:35.580]   there's apps for every platform,
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:38.700]   with one click to connect and you're protected.
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:41.340]   It's very fast, this is important with a VPN.
[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:43.940]   You want somebody that's got a lot of servers
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:45.780]   and puts a lot of horsepower behind it.
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:47.500]   That's why you want, you got it, honestly,
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:48.620]   you wanna pay for a VPN.
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:51.140]   Free VPN is not really worth it.
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:54.420]   And ExpressVPN is most importantly,
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:56.300]   and they just went through a third part,
[00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:58.700]   independent third party audit.
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:01.540]   In no way keeps track of what you're doing,
[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:04.860]   they do not log, so your privacy is protected
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:06.860]   even with ExpressVPN.
[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:08.860]   They've got a new cutting edge server technology,
[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:10.900]   they call it trusted server,
[00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:12.540]   that keeps the operating system and apps
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:14.060]   from ever writing to the hard drive,
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:18.220]   that means the VPN can't know who you are,
[00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:19.060]   what you're doing.
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:21.060]   It's a whole new standard of privacy and security.
[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:23.940]   That was a feature that the third party auditors looked at
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:26.660]   and they said, "Yep, trusted server works exactly
[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:28.740]   "as advertised."
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.500]   ExpressVPN is the fastest VPN I've ever used,
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.820]   and I think $7 a month, which is what it costs,
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:37.580]   is absolutely appropriate for the level of service
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:40.700]   you're getting, and you do get a 30 day money back guarantee.
[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:43.820]   So, are you ready to secure your connection
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.740]   to protect yourself from snoopers?
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:49.580]   Take back your online privacy and security
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:52.820]   with ExpressVPN, protect your online activity today.
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:53.860]   We've got a good deal for you,
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:57.020]   three months, extra months free with a one year package
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:59.900]   at expressvpn.com/macbreak.
[00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:04.900]   Express EXPR-ESS, spell it out, expressvpn.com/macbreak
[00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:07.540]   through extra months free with a one year package
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:10.540]   when you go to expressvpn.com/macbreak.
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:11.540]   Did we get any back?
[00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:14.020]   Andy was kicked out of his library.
[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:14.860]   I think.
[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:15.700]   No, no.
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:20.420]   For some reason, Skype decided to disconnect all my USB.
[00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:21.780]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:24.100]   And then it was quit in order to restart it so.
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:26.300]   Well, I thought when you disappeared, I thought,
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:29.900]   "Oh crap, we over went his time."
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:31.340]   No, no, no, that's a good.
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:33.820]   I have a chair wedged up against the door.
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:35.660]   (laughing)
[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:38.300]   They call that the Andy Inaco Memorial Chair
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:39.500]   broadcaster, Lisa.
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:42.700]   Let's see, that rumor continues
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:46.020]   about the 16 inch MacBook Pro, the one I want.
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:49.140]   You were saying, Alex, that the current MacBook Pros
[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:50.500]   are barely pro.
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:52.420]   This is the MacBook Pro Pro.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:55.140]   It's what Andy calls the Pro squared.
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:59.420]   We'll be a 16 inch screen in the roughly a 15 inch.
[00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:01.880]   In fact, the rumor is now, this is Chance Miller
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:03.340]   writing a nine to five Mac.
[00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:08.060]   He's basing it on an analyst's note from IHS.
[00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:10.460]   Jeff Lynn says, "The production of the new MacBook Pro
[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:13.460]   will start next month, which aligns with the rumors
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:14.820]   of an October release.
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:18.880]   The 16 inch monitor will use the Coffee Lake H processors,
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:21.860]   the same used by the current MacBook Pro.
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:22.740]   That's a little disappointing.
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:23.980]   I was hoping maybe those new iced.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:26.500]   They don't have an ethernet jack.
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:27.900]   So it's not professional.
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:30.060]   You're just stirring up trouble, aren't you?
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.420]   If it's up to USB-C, it's like a--
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:33.580]   Up to eight cores, up to eight cores.
[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:34.420]   I'm trying.
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:35.260]   I'm trying to eat the ethernet jack.
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:38.420]   You know, longer bowl, ethernet is fresh.
[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:39.820]   When Intel announced the new generation,
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:41.300]   it could take a generation to get here.
[00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:42.140]   I think that might be it,
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:44.820]   'cause Ice Lake was announced for mobile, but last week.
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:47.020]   Yes, but which specific chips have been announced
[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:48.060]   and we've actually released it.
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:48.900]   When will they be released?
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:50.740]   It could take a year to figure out.
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:53.140]   It used to be that Apple was the first
[00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:54.700]   to use new Intel chips.
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:55.540]   Almost all these--
[00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:56.380]   They still are.
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:57.260]   In many cases, they'll have a,
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:58.940]   you'll see like a new computer will come out
[00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:00.660]   and the chip won't be on Intel site.
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:03.380]   It may be like an Intel Singapore buried at the bottom,
[00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:06.500]   but it'll be, Apple does almost everything customized.
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:07.700]   And this will still be the case.
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:10.580]   It just means that Apple doesn't usually take,
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:12.420]   the first ones are usually very cookie cutter,
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:15.420]   but Apple wants like the different graphics options
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:18.340]   and the different, they want everything done the way they want.
[00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:20.940]   I mean, those usually take six to eight to 12 months
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:22.300]   after announcement to come out.
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:23.620]   So, okay, fine.
[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:25.740]   We'll get, we'll take the coffee lake age process.
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:27.100]   Eight cores should make a difference.
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:29.900]   I like the idea of a 16 inch screen
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:32.100]   in a roughly a 15 inch form factor,
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:33.380]   but that begs the question,
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:35.780]   well then what happens to the 15 inches?
[00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:40.220]   Lin says it is confirmed from OEM and panel supplier
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:42.420]   that 15.4 inch MacBook Pro production
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:44.140]   will end in November.
[00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:47.060]   I am pretty sure he says that a MacBook 15.4
[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:49.140]   will be end of life.
[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:50.300]   So, that's kind of the case.
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:51.220]   - My guess is they keep it around.
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:52.460]   And I think Groll said that too,
[00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:54.380]   because there's gonna be a price hike
[00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:56.300]   just based off the technology they're using.
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:57.940]   And the best way to mitigate a price hike
[00:56:57.940 --> 00:56:59.780]   is to keep existing options around.
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:01.460]   If not, and they just lowered the price
[00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:03.740]   for a lot of the built order options
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:05.940]   and the base models all just went down.
[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:08.380]   And I think that's a good way to stop price shock
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:11.100]   for people who see the 16 inch model
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:13.820]   and maybe all the technology associated with it.
[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:17.340]   - Be nice if you could get more RAM in it.
[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:18.540]   Is that an issue for you, Alex?
[00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:20.100]   The limit is a 16 gig limit.
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:22.060]   Would you want 32 if you could get it?
[00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:24.900]   - I mean, I don't always put more in if I could.
[00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:27.020]   I've kind of just given up.
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:27.980]   I don't have it.
[00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:28.820]   - You just don't do it.
[00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:29.660]   - I've started two new ones.
[00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:30.500]   - You can get 32 on this.
[00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:32.340]   - Desktop's for stuff that I want you to heavy lifting.
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:35.620]   - Oh, the new, the refresh has 32, doesn't it?
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:38.180]   - Yes, it's the 13 inch that doesn't have 32.
[00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:39.580]   And that's something that I slay
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:41.500]   'cause it is again supposed to fix.
[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:42.580]   - Okay. - Okay.
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:44.340]   - It's hard to get all these things
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:45.980]   into the chips, Leo, until it's dry.
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:48.340]   And but it's hard to get display port standards.
[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:50.660]   It's hard to get the low power RAM
[00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:54.540]   'cause the 13 inch still uses the low power DDR RAM.
[00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:55.980]   And that's still on three.
[00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:57.340]   It hasn't moved before yet.
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.180]   It's troublesome.
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:01.180]   - Apple has been granted a patent
[00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:03.460]   for Face ID on Macintosh
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:07.300]   with a smart auto wake feature.
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:12.820]   This is Ben Lovejoy writing at nine to five Mac.
[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:14.980]   It's for a more intelligent version of Face ID
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:16.860]   than you see on the iPhone right now.
[00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:21.300]   It could allow the Mac camera to do two things.
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:22.660]   If there's someone in front of the machine,
[00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:23.700]   it won't go to sleep.
[00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:26.740]   I guess that's good.
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:32.460]   - And then the second function, he's deciphering
[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:35.420]   what he calls dense patentees
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:37.580]   to say that perhaps it looks like the Mac
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:40.140]   can automatically wake and log you in
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:41.820]   even if it's sleeping when you approach it.
[00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:45.180]   In other words, it'd be watching even as it sleeps.
[00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:48.060]   It sees you and says, "Oh, hi."
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:49.580]   Hi, Leo. - Hello.
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:50.900]   - Hello.
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:52.980]   - Another security, but that's still creepy.
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:54.980]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:56.460]   - It's pretty complicated though,
[00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:57.300]   when you think about it.
[00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:59.860]   When you want to put a Face ID inside a phone,
[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:02.940]   you kind of know how people are going to be facing the phone
[00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:04.860]   and how far away the phone's going to be.
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.060]   On a Mac, you don't know if they've got it on an arm.
[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:09.060]   They don't know if it's going to apply up low.
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:13.460]   They don't know when should the Face ID actually activate
[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:16.220]   and should it activate every time it sees the face?
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:19.540]   Like when I just simply remembered
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:22.300]   that I forgot to pull my phone off the charger.
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:24.340]   If I just simply duck back into my office,
[00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:27.420]   grab the phone, is that going to unlock the Mac?
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:29.500]   And now do I have to manually re-lock it
[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:32.260]   because I'm not sitting down, I'm just grabbing my phone.
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:34.380]   I happen to stick my face into the magic cone
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:36.620]   that unlocks my Mac and makes it available
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:38.020]   to everybody inside the house.
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:39.700]   It's a really complicated idea.
[00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:41.420]   - Yeah, and we should point out, it's just a patent.
[00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:42.660]   It doesn't even mean they've solved it.
[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:44.580]   - Yeah, exactly. - It's just a patent.
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:46.660]   - The Google post from last week was super interesting
[00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:48.220]   because they were using solely in addition
[00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:51.420]   to a very Face ID, like sensor to detect you approaching
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:53.380]   the phone so you can get ready to unlock
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:56.100]   where Face ID still depends on you either tapping the screen
[00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:58.500]   or the accelerometer registering you lifting up the phone
[00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.420]   in order for it to activate.
[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:04.020]   And that also gets into the exactly what Andy's describing.
[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:06.900]   I don't necessarily want it unlocked all the time.
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:08.780]   I'm looking at it and I necessarily want it looking
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.020]   and I don't have it unlocked.
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.500]   - And typically there's preferences for that.
[01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.340]   I mean, you know, to decide where it's going to unlock
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:14.260]   and how it's going to unlock it.
[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.700]   I think that if we look at this in combination
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.260]   with Sign In with Apple, I think it's really interesting
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:22.900]   because we're really moving away as an Apple user,
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.540]   I think we're moving away from passwords,
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:26.300]   you know, where you're going to be able to log in
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:28.100]   and it's going to be biometric for everything.
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:30.420]   And when we think about it, ease of use,
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:33.140]   I mean, I am just getting to the point where I can't,
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:33.980]   I can't remember.
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.340]   I mean, I even have LastPass and I have, you know,
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:37.180]   other things tonight.
[01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:39.900]   But I'm just tired of passwords.
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:40.740]   (laughs)
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:43.060]   - Well, I know what you mean.
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:46.820]   - Like I'm like now, if I go into iTunes
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:49.060]   and I sign up for something and then you ask me now,
[01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:50.380]   I have to fill out another thing
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:52.420]   and give you a password and email.
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:53.860]   Half the time now, I'm just letting out.
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:55.900]   I'm not gonna. - But I have to point out,
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:58.500]   with all of that Face ID and whatever,
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.900]   Apple still asks me for my iTunes password,
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:02.540]   every third purchase.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.020]   It tries to mean nuts.
[01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:05.780]   It's like, you know who I am?
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.140]   I'm logged into my phone.
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:08.060]   Why are you asking?
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:09.860]   You don't get asked for your password all the time.
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:11.140]   - Yeah.
[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:12.140]   - Not me either anymore.
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:13.660]   - Well, I'm just never happy.
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:14.780]   - I have to remember what my password is.
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:17.340]   - No, I get asked, in fact, you could say,
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.420]   "Don't ask for the password for 15 minutes
[01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:20.740]   after I give it to you once."
[01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:21.740]   - It just looks at my,
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.260]   it always just looks at my face and there's a message.
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:24.100]   - Well, I don't know why,
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:27.020]   but I still have to enter my password far too often
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:28.100]   on my iPhone.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.940]   - Absolutely, I never have to.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:31.340]   - Yeah, never have to.
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:33.540]   - So with regards to the Face ID and Mac
[01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:37.380]   and the proximity complaints that you guys are talking about,
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:39.700]   you have to keep in mind that Apple Watch does that.
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:42.340]   It uses proximity when you walk into a room
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:45.580]   and grab your phone, for example.
[01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:47.500]   If you're wearing your Apple Watch
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:48.980]   and you have an open with Apple Watch,
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:51.580]   it'll do something very similar
[01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:54.700]   and it's like, "Do you wanna open your Mac right now?"
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:57.140]   And you can walk away from it and it'll shut down.
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:01.620]   So this idea of like Face ID on Mac to me
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:05.060]   doesn't seem that much different than Apple ID on Mac.
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:07.540]   It's just that it's using the proximity of your body
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:09.140]   instead of the proximity of your eyes.
[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:11.220]   - And for me, it's as soon as I move my mouse.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:14.100]   So as soon as I move my mouse on my iPad or my iMac,
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:17.380]   it just pops open and uses my watch and goes in.
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:18.220]   You know, like it's--
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:19.060]   - So fast.
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:19.980]   - Yeah.
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.100]   Well, maybe it just doesn't like me.
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:22.940]   - Yeah, we can.
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:23.780]   (laughing)
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:26.140]   - For an Mingshi Quo, Apple is gonna reduce,
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:31.140]   and not this year, not next year, but in 2021,
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:36.260]   a phone with both Face ID and an under screen touch ID.
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.700]   - Mingshi Quo versus Barclays
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:40.220]   in the battle for which future version of the iPhone will
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:41.300]   have to be-- - How could he,
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:44.060]   how could he even know what it's gonna do in, basically?
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.180]   - So this isn't normal.
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:47.620]   Normal, what he, normally what he does is brokers deals
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:49.740]   with supply chains to get access to schematics
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:50.980]   and things and deals.
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:53.740]   And, but this is him conjecturing saying that
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:56.020]   the technology right now, the original ones
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:57.740]   were capacitive and those worked pretty well.
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.340]   The new ones were either ultrasonic or optical,
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:01.460]   they don't work really well, but he's saying that
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:03.700]   within the next two years, the size of the modules,
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.180]   the resilience of the technology, the reliability of it
[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:08.300]   are all gonna go down to the point where he thinks
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:11.620]   Apple will re-adopt them and offer them together
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.300]   with Face ID and--
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:14.140]   - I don't touch any-- - I don't touch any
[01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:15.620]   of the way to 2021, look at this.
[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:20.620]   This is the OnePlus 7 Pro, which has a optical
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:26.020]   under screen scanner, can you show my phone?
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:28.300]   You see that fingerprint right there,
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:31.700]   which looks a lot like the one that 905Mac is using.
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.260]   But watch, when I touch the fingerprint,
[01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:35.340]   watch how fast it works, it's very accurate.
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:37.620]   Now maybe there's a security issue with it,
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:42.180]   but it is just as fast as Apple's old physical--
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:44.180]   - They're getting better and Qualcomm's all about it.
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:48.300]   - This is as good as, in fact, I prefer this to Face ID.
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:50.900]   So my question is, I mean, may, now the only thing
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:52.500]   I don't know is maybe that's insecure,
[01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.580]   maybe like, here go ahead, you use it
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.500]   and see if you can get it to unlock.
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.780]   (laughing)
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.180]   - No. - No.
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:01.260]   - It works really. - Leo now has my phone--
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:02.500]   - Leo now has my phone-- - Thank you very much,
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.340]   I'll be using it.
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:06.340]   - See Leo, that works for you, but not for YouTubers
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:08.900]   and Apple ID works for us, but not for you.
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.460]   - So there are YouTubers going on saying
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.260]   the OnePlus 7 Pro fingerprint reader doesn't work?
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:13.260]   - I think all of them,
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:15.580]   because you watch a lot of videos
[01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:16.820]   and sometimes it's hit, sometimes it's miss.
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:18.060]   I haven't seen that one specifically,
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:19.220]   but they have been--
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:21.060]   - I don't trust on It with YouTubers,
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.220]   let me tell you, it works.
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:24.980]   - The Galaxy S10 was terrible.
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:27.460]   No, no, no, and I have an S10 right here, I'll show you.
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:30.500]   The S10 is very disappointing in terms of,
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.260]   and it's using an ultrasonic fingerprint reader.
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:37.580]   So I think the optical ones see the same little thing there,
[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:40.700]   but you saw how long that took.
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:42.140]   Took twice as long.
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:44.780]   - And I think the idea is that the one Apple wants to use,
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.340]   it covers a huge amount of the screen,
[01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:47.380]   so you don't really have to care about
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:48.620]   where you put your finger.
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:50.820]   It's just as you pick it up to use it, it unlocks.
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:53.620]   - Well, okay, I mean, it wasn't a hardship
[01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:55.460]   to put my finger on a physical fingerprint reader.
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:57.420]   - My guess is that Apple doesn't want touch ID
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:59.860]   or face ID, they want an eventual system
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:01.460]   that just understands biometrics,
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:03.020]   and if you happen to touch it and unlocks,
[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:04.740]   if you happen to look at it and unlocks,
[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.260]   if it happens to recognize your gate,
[01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:07.860]   if it happens to hear your voice,
[01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:10.300]   eventually we shouldn't have to actively unlock anymore.
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:13.620]   The device should always be sort of at a threshold of trust
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:14.460]   as we use it.
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.380]   - Threshold of trust.
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.540]   - What I'd like to see Apple do in the future.
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.460]   - Go ahead, Rachael.
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:22.460]   - I'd like to see Apple allow the option
[01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:27.020]   to have biometric and passcode unlock,
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:29.980]   because I think there's the camp of people
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:32.060]   who will only always ever use a passcode,
[01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:34.020]   because they feel that that's more secure,
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:36.860]   and the camp that feel that they always want to use
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:38.940]   touch ID or face ID, because it's convenient,
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:41.740]   and it is secure, but then there's also a group of people
[01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:43.540]   out there in the world who think that biometric
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:47.540]   and password scanning is the absolute definitive,
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:50.100]   most protective way, and especially when you're hearing
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.220]   some of these crazy things that are coming out
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:54.780]   of other countries of being slapped in the face
[01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:58.020]   and forced to look at your camera so that it unlocks face ID,
[01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:01.860]   if we can have the option to always use a passcode
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:05.620]   and always in addition to using our biometrics scan,
[01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:07.020]   that allows us to decide,
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:10.540]   not just, oh, I better lock my phone before the police
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:14.100]   catch me when I'm at a protest, but just 100% of the time
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:17.060]   have a passcode that you would enable in addition
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:19.180]   to your facial scan or your fingerprint scan.
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:20.980]   So I would like just, I think it'd be great
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.260]   if we just had the option.
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:27.460]   - Okay.
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:31.020]   Your option's probably good for everybody.
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:33.740]   Clarice is back, baby.
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:35.980]   - Clarice works.
[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:39.020]   - Filemaker changed its name back to Clarice.
[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:39.860]   - What?
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:40.700]   - What?
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:43.980]   - Remember Clarice 1987.
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:44.820]   - Isn't it Clarice works?
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:46.820]   - Clarice works, which is awesome.
[01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:48.780]   - You can date yourself really fast
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:50.860]   if you can just punch down on Clarice works.
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:54.100]   - They did Mac Wright, MacPaint, and Filemaker.
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:55.980]   Apple spun them off in 1987.
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:57.660]   Clarice is the moucal.
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:59.340]   - Yes.
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:00.180]   - Right?
[01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:01.020]   - Yeah.
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.340]   - It's the dog that moves.
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:03.180]   - Mouf.
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:05.900]   - The dog that woofs, I don't know what it is.
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:10.700]   In 1998, Apple spun it back in,
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:13.220]   but they kept Filemaker out
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:15.220]   and Clarice changed his name to Filemaker
[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:17.580]   'cause it didn't do MacPaint, Mac Wright,
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:20.380]   or any of the other stuff.
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:21.460]   - So now Filemaker.
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:23.420]   - It's a paint program.
[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:25.660]   - Filemaker's changed his name to Clarice International.
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:28.700]   Filemaker will stay Filemaker.
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:31.900]   The reason for the move according to TechCrunch
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:34.820]   quoting CEO Brad Frytog
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:36.780]   is 'cause the company is starting to, yes,
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:40.100]   you nailed it, look beyond its core Filemaker product.
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:44.140]   God, I didn't even know these guys were still around.
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:45.380]   (laughs)
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:46.380]   - Yeah.
[01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:48.100]   Well, it shows you how valuable it is
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:50.900]   when you create a product that isn't really for consumers,
[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:54.260]   it's for people who run their entire industry on it.
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:56.060]   That doesn't, it doesn't matter if it's not flashy,
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:58.660]   doesn't matter if it's not reinventing anything.
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:01.580]   The fact that someone created this Filemaker database
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:05.020]   in 1994 and they've never found anything better
[01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:08.860]   than what some consultant or some temp did 20 years ago,
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:10.060]   they're willing to keep upgrading
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:12.060]   because it just works.
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:14.980]   - According to Filemakers, more than a million end users
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:19.380]   working at 50,000 different companies use Filemaker today.
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:22.980]   It's been profitable for 80 consecutive quarters.
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:27.180]   They acquired a company, an Italian company called Stamplay,
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:30.380]   which makes tools for connecting the APIs
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:31.580]   to various enterprise tools,
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:34.260]   and they're releasing that as a product
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:36.780]   called Claris Connect, a tool for integrating
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:39.820]   various cloud services and automating workflows
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:40.660]   between them.
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:42.020]   So that makes sense, you wouldn't want to call it
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:45.660]   Filemaker Connect, 'cause that'd be confusing.
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:49.580]   So, okay, okay, I mean, I think,
[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:51.260]   actually I knew Filemaker was still around.
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:54.300]   I even looked at it for doing a,
[01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:58.780]   our In-House solution for our sales team
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:00.180]   because it's perfect for that, right?
[01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:02.460]   It's cross-platform, it runs a server.
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:05.580]   It's form-focused, so it's very easy to design a UI.
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:06.660]   - Right, especially if you're doing secure,
[01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:07.820]   you don't want to put it in the cloud,
[01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:11.460]   you want to buy it and not have to pay a subscription.
[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:14.100]   You have people who already know how to use it.
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:15.460]   It doesn't take very long to figure it out.
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:18.220]   I mean, I've sat down and built Filemaker databases.
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.340]   - For years, I've been doing that.
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:20.180]   - Yeah, really fast.
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:22.100]   Like, oh, I just need to organize this data
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:23.580]   and have, like, a lot of times it's like,
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:26.100]   I want to input things quickly into something
[01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:27.820]   and then build it out into a spreadsheet
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:29.020]   or build it out into something.
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:32.340]   And I can build, and a lot of what we would do with it is,
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:34.820]   I built lots of different interfaces for different people
[01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:38.500]   with different access to different data.
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.380]   But I can design it to look exactly the way
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:42.700]   I wanted to look for this person,
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.580]   so it's really easy for them to do at, let's say,
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:47.340]   a point of sale and this person who's managing something else
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:50.260]   in the back end, and you can kind of do that relatively,
[01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:52.180]   with relatively low code.
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:53.420]   I mean, everything's just drag and drop,
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:55.580]   but you just have to know where it all is.
[01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:57.340]   It's a great, I mean, I will say that,
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:09:59.540]   you know, I've been using FileMaker for,
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.020]   oh, since it was an Apple product.
[01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:01.860]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:03.180]   (laughing)
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:04.420]   - Since 1998.
[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:06.660]   - And even now, I think, oh, I'm gonna go try to do this
[01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:09.220]   in Zoho, I'm gonna do it in Salesforce or whatever,
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:10.940]   and I get in there and a web interface,
[01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:11.780]   and I start going through it,
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:13.100]   and I'm like, I'm just gonna go back to FileMaker.
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:15.260]   - FileMaker's so straightforward, yeah.
[01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:17.820]   - It's not, I mean, it can be a relational database,
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:18.660]   but it's really more like--
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:19.660]   - It is a relational database.
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:21.020]   - No, that's a full relational database.
[01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:22.020]   - It's a full relational database.
[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:24.740]   That's one of the big powers of FileMaker
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:27.020]   is that you can build the much more complex
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.780]   interactions between those pieces.
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:30.460]   - Okay, so cool.
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:32.300]   - I'm glad it's still around.
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:35.620]   It does say FileMaker and Apple's subsidiary.
[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:39.580]   So I guess Apple is still a, are they the owner of,
[01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:40.660]   or part owner or?
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:42.820]   - Yes, yeah, they've owned it for a long time.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:44.380]   It's been run as a separate company.
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:45.220]   - Oh, okay.
[01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:48.500]   It is an autonomous sort of, yeah.
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.980]   A subsidiary of Apple.
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.540]   - All right.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:55.100]   - They say they have actually some big plans
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:57.340]   in terms of other companies to acquire
[01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:59.180]   other technologies to add, so.
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:00.700]   - They're gonna make a FileMaker watch
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:02.180]   and a FileMaker Carephone.
[01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:04.180]   (both laughing)
[01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:05.340]   - I don't think so.
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:06.340]   (both laughing)
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:08.180]   I don't know if that's in the end.
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:09.220]   - Definitely solutions.
[01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.860]   I think that there's a big opportunity gap
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:16.700]   between shortcuts and Swift.
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:17.540]   You know, there's, you know,
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:21.180]   they're writing code and having a very simple step-by-step.
[01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:22.900]   - Is there Apple's script and automakers
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:23.900]   sitting that space?
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:25.180]   - Well, I don't think so.
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.700]   I think that Apple's script is still too far towards Swift.
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.020]   I mean, if I'm gonna learn Apple's script,
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:30.860]   to me, I might as well learn Swift.
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:32.740]   And so, and Automator,
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:34.020]   the problem with Automator was always,
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:36.780]   it's similar to, for me, to shortcuts,
[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:38.900]   which is that it was very like this to this to this to this.
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:41.980]   What I really want is nodal interface that programs.
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:43.940]   You know, so I wanna be able to draw,
[01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:45.780]   you know, a complex interaction.
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:46.940]   I wanna take this data and I wanna give it
[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:48.780]   to three different nodes and I want them to do something
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:50.460]   and I want them to come back and do another thing.
[01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:51.860]   And that format.
[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:53.420]   - It looks like that new Swift UI
[01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:54.940]   might give you some of that capability.
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:57.340]   - A little.
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:11:58.900]   I mean, I'm deep in Swift right now.
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:01.180]   So I, yeah, so it's, and it's not,
[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:02.500]   the Swift UI is exciting.
[01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:04.740]   It definitely makes a lot of it easier,
[01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:06.460]   but it's not, what I'm talking about is like,
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:08.260]   there's no coding at all.
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:10.100]   Like you just connect modules.
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:10.940]   - Yeah.
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:16.620]   - Let's take a break and get ready your picks
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:19.900]   as we wrap up this episode of Mac Break with Lear.
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:21.140]   We get ready to anyway.
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:24.140]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.

[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:01.900]   Alex, Lindsey, we haven't seen you in so long.
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:05.500]   I hope you have a very, very expensive pick of the week
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:08.380]   that I could purchase right now.
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:09.300]   Nothing at all?
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:11.740]   No, I have a, I have a, it's not expensive.
[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:12.580]   That's all.
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:13.580]   I mean, I have a great--
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:15.620]   I was saving up for your reemergence.
[01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:19.060]   I know, I should have thought of that when I came out.
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:21.300]   You know, my, the update, there was an update
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:24.340]   to AudioKit Synth One synthesizer.
[01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:26.100]   These guys are just crushing it.
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:26.940]   That's all I gotta say.
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:29.660]   I mean, you should go up to their website as well,
[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:30.500]   to AudioKit.
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:33.980]   They build, AudioKit is a backend for developers
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:37.260]   to build audio, great audio into their apps.
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:39.260]   But they also have a whole series of apps.
[01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:41.020]   And this one I believe is free.
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:43.020]   And this is, I already haven't installed,
[01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:44.380]   so it's always hard to figure out how much it costs,
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:45.580]   but I'm pretty sure it's free.
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:50.260]   But AudioKit synthesizer, it's just amazing.
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:51.300]   I mean, you can just sit there.
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:54.100]   I was sitting on the flight, playing with it.
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:58.220]   And it was just a, you know, it's this incredible,
[01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:02.540]   little synthesizer that gives you all kinds of ways
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:05.620]   of adjusting stuff, you know, that you'd have
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:08.340]   a full-blown synthesizer, but it's completely,
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.980]   I believe this is a free version.
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:15.220]   They have a more, they have a $14, $15 version
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:18.660]   that has a lot more tools to it, which is called,
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:21.300]   well, there's FM player, which I think is free as well.
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:23.580]   And they also have the digital D1,
[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:27.300]   which has a lot more tools, you know, kind of built into it.
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:29.700]   What they've done is genius.
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:30.940]   They have a handful of apps,
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:33.940]   and then they have this backend that people can use
[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:35.660]   to add audio to it.
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:39.340]   And so there's so many options here,
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:40.780]   and it's just worth going to their website,
[01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:41.700]   checking out what they're doing,
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:42.780]   they're downloading, buying,
[01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:44.540]   if you're interested in playing with music,
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:47.820]   and having fun with music, and playing with synthesizers.
[01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:50.980]   I got these installed on my daughter's iPad,
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:52.060]   she's really into music.
[01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:55.220]   She built stuff in GarageBand that I was listening to it,
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:56.060]   and I was like, "Who is that?"
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:57.700]   And she's like, "That was me."
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:58.860]   That's cool, isn't it?
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:00.860]   And all she did is she went,
[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:03.420]   as a side, as a slight side note,
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.660]   if you think that the free Apple classes
[01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:09.940]   at the stores are cheap and not very well-run,
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.860]   you're completely misguided.
[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:13.980]   And if you, 'cause if you have anybody who thinks that
[01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:16.860]   hasn't been to one, like my kids went to a GarageBand thing,
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:18.580]   and they came back as musicians.
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:19.780]   You know, like it was kind of like,
[01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:22.180]   I couldn't believe what they learned how to do.
[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:24.300]   And so now I've been moving her into,
[01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:25.700]   she's slowly moving into Logic,
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:30.100]   and into these apps for building her sense.
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:34.900]   And so she's, it's easy enough to get into it
[01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:36.220]   as a 10-year-old.
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:40.500]   But it's deep enough that even if you're a very skilled
[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.060]   musician, there's a lot to dig in here,
[01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:43.940]   and there's a lot that you can add to what you're doing.
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:48.420]   And so it's an incredible, incredible solution.
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:50.740]   So there's a couple different apps that they make.
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:54.020]   One is the Digital D1, that one costs like 15 bucks.
[01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:55.660]   And then there's FM player and synth one,
[01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:56.500]   just get them all.
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:59.100]   Just go get all of those and sit and play.
[01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:01.060]   They're slightly different, and two of them are free.
[01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:05.940]   So, so anyway, but just one of the coolest companies,
[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:08.100]   I think, out there right now, and in what they're doing.
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:12.060]   I started in audio, so I admit that I lean audio.
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:15.700]   But it's just incredible solutions
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:16.540]   that they're putting together.
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:19.260]   I see your synthesizer, and I raise you
[01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:23.060]   a pocket operator from Teenage Engineering.
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:24.060]   Wow, what?
[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:24.900]   Oh, what?
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:25.740]   Mr. Cool.
[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:26.580]   Mr. Cool.
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:29.340]   So these are, I got one, it's a calculator,
[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:33.420]   sized synthesizer, so it's a pocket operator.
[01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:34.860]   I'll play you some of the sounds.
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:37.900]   These, they come in, they're range in price from $49
[01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:40.180]   to somewhere on, they're just under 100.
[01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:42.380]   They're, it's a Swedish company.
[01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:45.500]   And what they did, they found a really cheap chip.
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:50.220]   It's like, it was used for traffic lights or something.
[01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:52.660]   And they've made these little synthesizers
[01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:53.900]   that don't sound cheap at all.
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:57.660]   In fact, I'll play, this is the speak that I have here.
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:18:00.540]   I'll play what it sounds like so you can hear it.
[01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:02.700]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:06.140]   But the thing is, it's in your pocket,
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.980]   because let me show you the mind real quickly.
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:10.900]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:12.500]   And I have a little rubber case on it,
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.740]   because it's basically a bare circuit board
[01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:17.740]   with a bunch of buttons, some knobs,
[01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:22.060]   and even a little LCD display that does cartoonish things.
[01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:24.700]   You can make it your alarm, it has a little speaker on it,
[01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:27.180]   but you could also plug it into headphones
[01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:30.620]   or any external jack, and it has an input.
[01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:32.700]   So you can record new sounds, you can record,
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:34.180]   you can play back.
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:38.020]   It is really wild, this, for $49,
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:41.860]   just I think something you wanna keep in your pocket,
[01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:44.380]   and just pull out while you're on the subway,
[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:45.740]   and just make some music.
[01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:46.580]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:47.420]   - Yeah.
[01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:48.420]   - Is that wild out?
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:50.540]   Are you familiar with Andy?
[01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:53.140]   - Absolutely, I've come so close to buying one
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:56.300]   so many times, because if you go on YouTube,
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:58.300]   you'll find people just building,
[01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.220]   going from start to finish, just building
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:02.340]   this really cool piece of music,
[01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:05.300]   or just this really cool loop just by starting with,
[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:07.100]   boop, boop, boop, boop.
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:08.100]   Then what am I gonna add to that?
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:10.540]   Then how am I going to modify that?
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:12.820]   Then can I play something that's sort of live
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:14.580]   by twisting this knob over that?
[01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:16.500]   And it just looks like the most fun thing ever.
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:19.860]   - It's fun, yeah, and you can record it and output it.
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:22.460]   Now I bought the speak because that one comes
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:24.900]   with a microphone, so it can sample.
[01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:27.580]   It's got 120 seconds of sample memory,
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:29.380]   so that's quite a bit, two minutes of samples.
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:30.220]   It's quite a bit.
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:31.620]   - It cost me a lot of money in 1989.
[01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:33.740]   - Yeah, eight voice characters, eight effects.
[01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:35.860]   You could transpose scale, you could change scale,
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:37.740]   you could slow it down, speed it up.
[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:42.820]   It's got replaceable drum sounds, $89.
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:45.780]   And then I spent a little more to get the little rubber sleeve
[01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:49.900]   because I feel like this is gonna get damaged if I don't.
[01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:53.700]   It even has a little metal stand that you could put up.
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:55.580]   So you could just put it on your desk
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:58.500]   and everyone said, "Well, start a new tune."
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.180]   I just think this is so cool.
[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:02.460]   - Yeah, and they make so many different flavors of this.
[01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:05.540]   Not like they have the, this one has more memory.
[01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:06.900]   This one has an extra output.
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:08.500]   No, they'll do, well, how about we do
[01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:09.820]   a Rick and Morty version of it?
[01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:12.860]   - There's a Rick and Morty version for the LCD.
[01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:14.580]   We'll have like Rick and Morty characters
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:17.300]   like free samples and it's like, "Oh my God,
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:19.940]   this is exactly what music is supposed to be about
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:24.380]   just killing time on the subway and just having so much fun."
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:26.540]   And then by the time you get to your stop,
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:28.780]   you're like, "Oh my God, I accidentally created something
[01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:30.980]   really cool that I actually wanna save."
[01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:33.940]   - Teenage Engineering makes some actual real big boy
[01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:37.180]   synthesizers, the ODM synthesizers that cost thousands.
[01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:39.340]   This is their $50.
[01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:40.500]   - We guess you start.
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:43.260]   - They make, they make, I can't remember the name of it,
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:46.980]   but it looks like the old like Casio calculator keyboard,
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:49.340]   but it has, it's another one of these devices that costs,
[01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:52.820]   it costs 900 bucks, but this one is like even more ambitious
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:56.260]   where you can, it's easier to play notes, it's easier to mix.
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:57.660]   It even has like a sample there.
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:59.140]   Yeah, that's it on the left.
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:00.500]   - The portable one or synthesizer,
[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:02.540]   which now that I have the $50 version,
[01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:03.900]   I'm really tempted.
[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:04.740]   (laughing)
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:06.420]   - I think that was a one.
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:09.060]   That was, you know, like you get, that's for you.
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:13.140]   - You talk about how much they understand having fun.
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:16.380]   That synthesizer even has like an FM radio in it.
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:19.780]   So you can tune into the radio and then just be listening
[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:24.780]   to a station and when you hear like a Glenn Miller riff
[01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:27.980]   on an old D station, you can just hear,
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:31.460]   "I'm just a bag of a baht, oh gee, I'm gonna sample that boom."
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:33.660]   And then that's like a, then that's a loop
[01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:34.620]   on the thing that you're doing.
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:37.100]   It's like, "Oh my God, if I had the sort of money
[01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.020]   where I could blow $900 on a toy
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:41.380]   that I definitely wouldn't use for three or four months,
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:43.260]   but then would be playing with so much
[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:46.180]   that I would lose focus on the things that make me money,
[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:47.260]   then I would definitely buy that thing."
[01:21:47.260 --> 01:21:50.020]   But the pocket operator is definitely something
[01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:51.420]   that I could afford naturally.
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:53.900]   - As little as $50, I mean, how cool is that?
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:54.740]   How cool is that?
[01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:55.580]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:58.140]   - And I bought for $10 the extra little protection.
[01:21:58.140 --> 01:21:59.540]   - It's a perfect stocking stuffer.
[01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:00.380]   - Oh, no kidding.
[01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:03.220]   I mean, honestly, this would be a great thing to give a kid
[01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:04.020]   because
[01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:06.500]   - This is another one that was just cool.
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:07.580]   Look at their website.
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:09.260]   It is like, we just play with audio.
[01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:10.100]   Like, that's what it feels like.
[01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:10.940]   - Yeah.
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:11.780]   - Right? - Look at it, they make speakers.
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:12.620]   - Yeah.
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:13.460]   - They make...
[01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:14.780]   - The story is great.
[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:15.620]   - We just...
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:17.300]   - Yeah, they even sell incense for some reason.
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:18.140]   So...
[01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:19.580]   (both laughing)
[01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:23.260]   So, I can't recommend this more highly.
[01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:25.260]   It's just a load of fun and $50.
[01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:26.620]   Although the one I got was a little more expensive
[01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:27.620]   because it's an input.
[01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:30.100]   - And like all the phones they have, headphone jack still.
[01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:30.980]   - They still...
[01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:34.420]   See, there's a reason for a headphone jack, kids.
[01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:36.100]   Lori Gill, pick of the week.
[01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:38.780]   - Well, first of all, it sounds like everybody
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:40.020]   wants to start a band.
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:44.620]   So you listen to all the instruments and get together.
[01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:47.780]   - Lori, we wanna join yours.
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:49.060]   Yeah, sick burn.
[01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:51.020]   - Bring your pocket instruments with you.
[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:53.100]   - Can I come on stage and play this with you
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:53.940]   while you sing?
[01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:54.940]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:55.780]   - That would be so nerdy.
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:56.940]   - That would be so fun.
[01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:57.940]   - So nerdy.
[01:22:57.940 --> 01:22:58.780]   You gotta wear a helmet.
[01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:02.900]   - And if I would've thought about using electronic instruments
[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:04.620]   when I was first learning how to play music,
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:06.460]   I'd be so much further along right now
[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:07.300]   than I can.
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:09.100]   - Well, it's changing the world, isn't it?
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:11.180]   I mean, this is amazing. - Yeah, that's for sure.
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:12.540]   - Yeah.
[01:23:12.540 --> 01:23:16.340]   - All right, so my pick this week is actually an old,
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:17.180]   a new game.
[01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:20.500]   It's the game Journey by that game company.
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:22.500]   - I love Journey.
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:24.140]   - I've never played before.
[01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:28.460]   So I just started this morning and I'm absolutely loving it.
[01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:31.460]   - I just... - Anna Burney Interactive, so cool.
[01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:34.380]   - Yeah, it just launched on the App Store this morning.
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:37.100]   - They have another one that's kind of newer,
[01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:38.180]   that's the same idea.
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.460]   So if you like this, I got a second one for you.
[01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:43.700]   - Yeah, it's Skye, the children of light.
[01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:44.540]   Is that fun you're talking about?
[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:45.780]   - Skye, yeah, it's awesome.
[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:47.340]   - Yeah, and they're very similar.
[01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:50.940]   They have the same kind of exploratory idea
[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:52.380]   where you just kind of walk in,
[01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:54.340]   not knowing anything about what you're doing
[01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:57.220]   and you just go figure it out.
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:00.580]   And you do a little bit of puzzle solving,
[01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:04.500]   but it's really just a lot of finding and collecting things.
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:07.060]   In this story, you're collecting glyphs
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:10.180]   that extend the scarf that you have.
[01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:13.220]   And actually Leo, you might even know more about the story
[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:14.620]   than I do 'cause I just started playing
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:16.860]   and I haven't played it before.
[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:18.620]   But I love the way it looks and sounds.
[01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:20.260]   - This is beautiful.
[01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:21.300]   - It's so relaxing.
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:24.300]   - This was a huge indie game on the PlayStation.
[01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:27.380]   And it gave me real hope for the future of gaming
[01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:29.820]   because you don't shoot anybody.
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:32.700]   You just, and you explore and it's beautiful.
[01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:34.540]   It just feels great, yeah.
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:36.700]   - Yeah, and the music is extraordinary.
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:37.620]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:40.780]   - So when I saw this, and actually when Skye came out,
[01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:42.740]   I felt the same way.
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:45.700]   This is the kind of game that I want Apple Arcade to have.
[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:48.980]   So I'm hoping that what we're seeing here is that,
[01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:51.140]   you know, though these games are,
[01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:53.660]   they've been around for a while,
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:56.780]   I would love to see that Apple Arcade is gonna have nothing
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:59.940]   but, or at least a huge section of games
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:02.620]   that are just like this where they're atmospheric.
[01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:05.540]   They sound good, they look good, they're relaxing,
[01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:07.620]   they're engaging.
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:09.060]   I'm just having fun with that already
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:10.660]   and I've only been playing it for, you know,
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:11.500]   a good 20 minutes.
[01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:14.380]   I think I just barely passed the first chapter, so.
[01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:15.220]   - Nice.
[01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:16.700]   Yeah, really, I agree with you 100%.
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:18.260]   Five dollars.
[01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:21.060]   Journey from Anna Perna Design.
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:23.780]   Is there a Mac version as well as a iOS version?
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:24.620]   I don't know.
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:26.580]   - I think the last time it came out on anything,
[01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:29.020]   it was just on the PlayStation 3.
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:30.300]   - PlayStation, yeah.
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:31.460]   - Yeah, really cool.
[01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:32.820]   - Really cool.
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:35.180]   Thank you, great pick, thank you, Laurie.
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:37.660]   Renee Ritchie, what do you got for us?
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:39.860]   - All right, Leo LeCorte, I'm gonna spend you some Alex,
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:40.700]   Lindsey, I'm ready.
[01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:41.540]   - Yeah, I'm ready.
[01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:42.380]   - There you go.
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:45.660]   - I would like to say if this OP1 portable synthesizer
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:49.900]   were not sold out, I would be $1,300 poorer right now.
[01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:50.740]   - There you go, Z.
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:51.580]   - Go ahead.
[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:52.420]   - There you go.
[01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:54.140]   - So I've mentioned this before,
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:57.020]   but when I first got it, it was hella expensive,
[01:25:57.020 --> 01:25:59.220]   and now it's just sort of half a hella expensive,
[01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:04.220]   but it's Samsung's X5 portable SSD drive.
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:07.340]   And it was, I pre-ordered it when it first came out,
[01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:09.020]   and it was like 1,400 bucks.
[01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:11.620]   Now I've seen it as low as 600 sometimes.
[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:14.220]   Right now it's down to around 850.
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:15.060]   Now it's-
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:16.660]   - That's for two terabytes, we should say.
[01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:18.740]   - That's for two terabytes, yeah, absolutely.
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.180]   And it is small, it is really oddly shaped.
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:23.500]   It does run super, super hot.
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:25.340]   So if you like to complain about thermal,
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:27.540]   boy do I have a drive for you.
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:30.980]   But what it does is transfer data so fast.
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:33.780]   And previously I didn't have a lot of storage
[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:36.380]   on my MacBook Pro because,
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:38.780]   I didn't want to be subject to losing that storage,
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:40.860]   but as I do more and more Final Cut Pro work,
[01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:43.820]   just not having to deal with external drives day to day
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:46.620]   is so nice, like especially when traveling.
[01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:48.700]   It is so great to just have two terabytes
[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:52.180]   on a computer, but then I do sometimes need more space,
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:53.980]   and I also do want to back it up.
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:56.100]   And backing it up over USB, you know,
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:58.340]   two USB three to a platter drive
[01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:00.860]   is just excruciatingly slow.
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:02.660]   Again, especially when you're traveling.
[01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:04.660]   And this is just so fast.
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:07.380]   It's hard, like it is an acceleration,
[01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:09.500]   like a supercar on the auto bond fast.
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:12.820]   It makes other drives feel pre-astorically slow
[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:13.940]   when you go back to them.
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:16.220]   So if you have the money, it's less money now
[01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:18.220]   than it was before, but if you have the money
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:20.620]   and transfer speed is really important to you,
[01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:23.620]   this is an excellent companion drive to a MacBook Pro.
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:25.300]   - I think what's important about this is,
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:27.620]   we're starting to see more Thunderbolt 3
[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:30.180]   drives and accessories, and they're falling to a price
[01:27:30.180 --> 01:27:32.900]   where they're now at least something you could consider.
[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:35.900]   This is basically, I think Samsung's Evo,
[01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:39.700]   NVMe based Evo in a case.
[01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:41.300]   - Yeah, exactly that.
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:44.700]   - Yeah, and a Thunderbolt 3 case at that.
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:46.860]   So that's part of the price.
[01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:48.460]   But that's pretty awesome.
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:51.460]   That is, I think I did just buy it.
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:52.820]   - It's like living in the future.
[01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:55.340]   - As a matter of fact, I mean, it's hard not to.
[01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:56.700]   Too terrible, I see. - And it's so portable.
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:59.900]   - Yeah, this is made for travel, isn't it?
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:00.980]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:02.340]   Very nice.
[01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:07.340]   - It might actually prime my portable drives out of my,
[01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:11.340]   I have stacks of just raw SSDs,
[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:14.020]   and then I have this Thunderbolt SSD reader
[01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:15.700]   that somebody made that doesn't make,
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:16.660]   they don't make anymore.
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:19.740]   And I still slide them in and poke them to my Thunderbolt.
[01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:21.740]   - Yeah. - And I keep on looking
[01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:23.060]   at these drives going, well.
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:24.220]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:25.780]   - They're hot, but they're good.
[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:27.580]   - No, no, they look great.
[01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:29.620]   - Do you think the heat is an issue?
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:31.980]   - I mean, some people just don't like it because it's hot,
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:34.220]   but Apple itself determined years ago
[01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:36.540]   that running a thermal Mac is not a problem for them.
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:38.420]   They have run the watch at thermal, thermal, maximum.
[01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:40.420]   They've run the iMac, sorry, the MacBook Pro,
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:42.940]   a thermal maximum, and they don't see it as an issue.
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:45.980]   So Samsung is a smart vendor too,
[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:47.540]   and they make all this technology.
[01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:50.260]   So I'm gonna trust them, maybe I'll lose or get it.
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:51.140]   - That's an important point.
[01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:54.780]   This is their drive, their NVMe drive in there.
[01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:59.540]   So, I mean, when you get a kind of an unknown maker in there,
[01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:01.500]   and they get really hot, I worry, when they,
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:02.980]   when it's like Samsung, it gets really hot,
[01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:04.580]   I'm like, well, they must have thought about this a little.
[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:06.500]   - Yeah, and I've had the T1, the T2,
[01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:07.980]   all of these little USBs. - Right, they've all worked.
[01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:10.220]   - So it's been great, they do get hot.
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:12.500]   That's just the nature of the game.
[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:13.340]   Sold.
[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:16.900]   - Sorry Leo, sorry. - You're welcome Leo.
[01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:18.460]   (laughing)
[01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:20.380]   - Andy and I, Andy and I, let's wrap it up
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:21.860]   with your pick of the week.
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:23.380]   - I got something really special.
[01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:25.180]   A lot of people who listen to the show
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:27.420]   probably know who J. Michael Striesinski is.
[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:29.100]   Some of them are such big fans of him
[01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:32.140]   that they can even spell his name correctly without checking.
[01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:34.180]   I am on that list.
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:35.740]   He's amazing creator.
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:38.900]   I first learned of him because he created the series,
[01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:42.580]   "Babble on Five," one of the greatest science fiction
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:46.300]   serial TV dramas ever made, even though it was made in the 1990s.
[01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:50.060]   It still is one of the things you wanna try to beat creatively.
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:51.700]   He also wrote "Murder She Wrote."
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:54.060]   He also wrote "Ghostbusters."
[01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:57.740]   He wrote, basically he's been writing,
[01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:02.340]   he wrote the movie "Change Link" directed by Clint Eastwood,
[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:06.300]   World War Z, he's just like, just super, super, super writer.
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:10.260]   And so he's written an autobiography/memoir
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:12.060]   called "Becoming Superman."
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:16.260]   And I want to, it's hard for me to describe
[01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:19.820]   how good a book this is, because already I was,
[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:22.460]   he actually got to read an advanced copy
[01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:24.940]   to hopefully provide a quote.
[01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:26.980]   And I was like, "Oh, great, I'm gonna learn about
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:29.140]   "what it was like to do all these behind the scenes stuff
[01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:31.460]   "about "Babble on Five" and what it was like
[01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:33.780]   "to write for "Ainchedula Lansbury."
[01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:38.780]   And no, this is an amazingly powerful story of this kid
[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:44.820]   who grew up with a father who was actively devoid
[01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:46.020]   of human empathy.
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:50.620]   So the point of almost being an evil character
[01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:54.140]   and how J. Maclister Stinsky as a kid
[01:30:54.140 --> 01:30:57.420]   developed a keen sense of empathy despite that.
[01:30:57.420 --> 01:31:00.380]   And maybe almost as a screw you to his father
[01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:03.100]   that he's going to learn, he's going to be a kind person,
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:05.900]   he's going to be thoughtful, he's going to be generous.
[01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:10.260]   When the story of his parents and his upbringing
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:12.860]   just keeps taking all of these incredible turns.
[01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:15.540]   And then when he moves out of the house as a late teenager,
[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:18.060]   even then the adventure just gets weirder and weirder
[01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:20.900]   and weirder as he starts to look into
[01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:23.500]   like what was our family's actual past
[01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:26.380]   versus what were the family stories about our actual past
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:27.220]   in Europe?
[01:31:27.220 --> 01:31:31.620]   How did like dad spend World War II in Germany?
[01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:33.460]   All this really interesting stuff.
[01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:35.300]   On top of all that though, it is again,
[01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:38.020]   an amazing story about the power and the importance
[01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:41.380]   of empathy, about learning that there are other people
[01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:43.060]   in this world, they all have feelings.
[01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:45.420]   Your experiences are not necessarily going to be
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:47.300]   this other person's experiences
[01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:50.180]   and that you really are nothing if you don't learn
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:53.740]   to acknowledge and celebrate the humanity of other people.
[01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:56.740]   And of course, and it's also of course a personal story
[01:31:56.740 --> 01:32:01.220]   becoming Superman, he is the title because he says
[01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:04.020]   that Superman literally saved his life
[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:06.340]   because he thought, well, here's in the comic books,
[01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:08.700]   here is this character that is not like his father
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:12.060]   that is going to save people, is going to rescue people
[01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:14.340]   and he decided to model himself after Superman
[01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:15.780]   and not after his father.
[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:19.900]   And the best thing I can say about it though is that
[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:23.140]   this is a memoir, this is a story told by someone
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:24.740]   who is a master storyteller.
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:28.300]   So it's not just sort of dragging you from incident,
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:29.860]   incident, incident, incident.
[01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:34.580]   He really has time and perspective and knows how to mold
[01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:36.940]   this into a story that's relevant for pretty much
[01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:40.420]   everybody reading it, it's not just him doing a confessional.
[01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:42.620]   It really, there's at least three times
[01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:44.940]   during the reading of this book that I really did
[01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:49.220]   have to just, I told him that it's a good length book.
[01:32:49.220 --> 01:32:51.620]   I told him, okay, I'll try to have a quote for you
[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:53.740]   in about a week 'cause I knew that that's about
[01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:54.940]   as long as it would take.
[01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:57.260]   And it took me much longer than that
[01:32:57.260 --> 01:32:58.820]   because there are a couple of points where I just had
[01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:03.820]   to, I'm there at the diner like, okay, I'm closing this book.
[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:07.340]   I'm going to put it aside for three or four days
[01:33:07.340 --> 01:33:08.900]   because I need to process stuff.
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:11.460]   And I also need to sort of recover emotionally
[01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:13.060]   from things that I've been reading.
[01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:14.340]   Amazing, amazing book.
[01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:17.140]   The audio book also is read by Peter Jurassic
[01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:19.980]   who played Londo Malawi on Babylon 5.
[01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:21.820]   So there's also that.
[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:24.020]   Again, highest recommendation, highest recommendation.
[01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:26.900]   - Adding it to my audible cue for the next time
[01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:29.340]   I get a credit that looks really great.
[01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:31.260]   Becoming Superman, my journey from poverty
[01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:33.580]   to Hollywood, J. Michael Stresinski.
[01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:35.660]   Introduction by Neil Gaiman.
[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:37.620]   Another, that's for bonus.
[01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:38.660]   That's pretty good.
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:39.860]   - Thank you.
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:41.580]   - Thank you, Andrew, Andy and Naco.
[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:46.140]   You hear him every week on Boston Public Radio, WGBH.
[01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:48.740]   Look for him in your local library, kids.
[01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:51.740]   - Yes, we're at the Boston Public Library on Friday.
[01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:53.620]   I'll be tweeting out what time is probably going to be
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:54.740]   about 12, 30.
[01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:57.540]   But yep, get a cookie, get a coffee,
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:58.820]   which you will have to pay for.
[01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:00.660]   But then watch the entire show, it'll be fun.
[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:02.300]   - No free coffee, man.
[01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:04.740]   - There's no public support.
[01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:05.740]   - It's super public support.
[01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:07.580]   - We wouldn't want the coffee,
[01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:09.660]   we could afford to give away for free.
[01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:10.500]   - That's true.
[01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:11.820]   - That's a good point.
[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:13.940]   Thank you, Andy, I really appreciate it.
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:14.780]   - Rich.
[01:34:14.780 --> 01:34:15.980]   - He's at imore.com
[01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:17.660]   and don't forget his great vector show
[01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:19.780]   at imore.com/vector.
[01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:21.860]   What's coming up on Vector?
[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:24.140]   - I've got Neil Sybart on the show later today
[01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:25.580]   talking all about how to view Apple
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:27.740]   in a post-iPhone world.
[01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:30.100]   And then Tomorrow Daniel Bader from Android Central
[01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:31.340]   is going to join me to talk all about
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:33.100]   the Galaxy Note 10 event.
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:35.220]   - That's right, in fact we'll be streaming that live
[01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:38.940]   tomorrow at about, what is it, noon, Carsten?
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:39.780]   - 1PM.
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:42.780]   - 1PM Pacific, 4PM Eastern time.
[01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:45.740]   If you want to watch our live stream of the event,
[01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:48.100]   Jason Howell will be joining me.
[01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:51.540]   And also of course, Jeff Jarvis and Stacey Higginbotham
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:52.380]   immediately after free.
[01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:53.220]   - That's pretty fun.
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:55.740]   She'll be talking about the Note 10, yeah, that's exciting.
[01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:57.220]   - Thank you, Renee.
[01:34:57.220 --> 01:34:58.180]   Thank you, Lori Gill.
[01:34:58.180 --> 01:35:00.020]   She's managing editor at imore
[01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:03.220]   and lead singer of the best punk band in the world.
[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:06.020]   Sickburn.
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:07.580]   - Don't let anybody hear you say that.
[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:09.500]   - I'm saying it for all.
[01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:11.420]   We're one on Sundry.
[01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:12.260]   Just 'cause I--
[01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:14.780]   - We would be the best band if you brought your pocket
[01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:16.620]   up for you. - They had their new synthesizer
[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:18.340]   player with them.
[01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:19.700]   I've just written a song for you.
[01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:20.820]   You might enjoy it.
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:23.340]   I call this...
[01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:28.140]   Sickburn rocks.
[01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:32.140]   Lori, thank you for being here.
[01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:33.300]   Find her at imore.com.
[01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:35.660]   She's Appleholik on the Twitter.
[01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:37.460]   Thank you, Alex Lindsey.
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:39.220]   Hope you're gonna be back for a little longer.
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:41.700]   - I'm gonna spear for a little bit.
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:42.540]   He's off again.
[01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:45.700]   - Yeah, I came out of my hole to see how things are.
[01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:46.780]   Everybody's still alive.
[01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:48.620]   Everybody's doing well, so I'm gonna disappear for a bit.
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:50.740]   But I spend a lot of time on Twitter.
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:55.740]   We have solved the mystery of what is the best Star Trek
[01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:58.100]   next generation episode.
[01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:00.660]   This was an inter-light.
[01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:01.500]   How do you know?
[01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:04.020]   'Cause like well-known, I asked, well first,
[01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:06.020]   so I've-- - Sean said it immediately.
[01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:06.860]   - Yes.
[01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:07.700]   - Oh, it's me.
[01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:08.900]   It's me, wasn't it?
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:09.740]   - So the--
[01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:10.900]   - Date state.
[01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:11.740]   - You know, the--
[01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:12.580]   - Date state.
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:15.660]   - So I had a discussion about that with somebody,
[01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:17.100]   and I was certain that it was inter-light,
[01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:19.620]   and they were certain that it was yesterday's enterprise,
[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:21.140]   and we were going back and forth.
[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:22.860]   So then I decided without saying anything,
[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:24.700]   I put it up on Twitter, I was like, okay, everyone,
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:26.540]   give me your favorite one.
[01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:28.260]   And so then everyone kind of threw a whole bunch
[01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:29.340]   of stuff into Twitter.
[01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:31.300]   Then I went up and said, okay, vote on it.
[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:33.340]   And so I put the vote up of the top four,
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:34.740]   and that was like inter-light--
[01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:37.940]   - Darmock.
[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:40.540]   - The measure of the man and yesterday's enterprise.
[01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:42.620]   - Not even enterprise had Kirk.
[01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:43.460]   It would have won.
[01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:44.660]   - Sorry?
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:46.660]   - If yesterday's enterprise had Kirk, it would have won.
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:48.060]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:50.860]   So anyway, for some reason I've really just settled
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:52.380]   into Twitter, I don't really do anything else.
[01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:53.700]   So this is a great use.
[01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:55.620]   This is probably the right use for Twitter.
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:56.940]   No, I'm having so much fun with it.
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:58.940]   I just started just like slowing down,
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:00.300]   and I'm like, I'm not gonna do a bunch
[01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:02.900]   of different social networks, so I'm just on Twitter.
[01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:04.500]   So if you wanna see me play on Twitter--
[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:05.340]   - Nice.
[01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:06.580]   - And what I'm really working on right now
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:08.060]   is like kind of audience interaction.
[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:10.900]   So asking people questions, and then doing little things,
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:12.860]   and just because it entertains me,
[01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:14.780]   I don't have any other good reason.
[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:18.660]   The inner light, 36%, 195 votes,
[01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:20.260]   I think it's a clear winner.
[01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:21.100]   - Yes.
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:23.620]   - You didn't even have that on here,
[01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:25.020]   whatever you're saying over and over.
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:26.100]   - Data stay.
[01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:28.380]   (laughing)
[01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:30.180]   - I just watched that last week coincidentally.
[01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:32.620]   - I've never seen any of those, but okay.
[01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:34.660]   You know what I should do is I should watch
[01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:37.420]   all of the top candidates, and give you my opinion.
[01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:38.660]   - Yes, yes.
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:40.140]   - Or just watch the entire series.
[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:41.860]   - How many episodes?
[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:42.700]   - Thousands.
[01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:43.520]   - There's too many.
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:44.360]   There's a list of the essential episodes.
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:45.200]   - So I was just watch those.
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:46.780]   - Essential TNG.
[01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:47.620]   - How do we do it?
[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:49.580]   - After you've watched all the Marvel movies.
[01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:50.420]   - Yeah.
[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:51.260]   (laughing)
[01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:52.100]   - Which I also--
[01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:52.940]   - And all the game of the song.
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:54.740]   - I guess I'm just not a good nerd.
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:57.080]   - I am Babylon Five Seasons one through four.
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:57.920]   (laughing)
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:58.760]   - Yes.
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:37:59.580]   - Oh my God, you know.
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:00.420]   - I'm gonna read the Stuzinsky book,
[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:01.940]   isn't that enough?
[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:04.340]   We do Mac Break Weekly every Tuesday,
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:05.620]   supposed to be 11 AM Pacific.
[01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:06.440]   We were a little late today,
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:08.120]   but that's been the case lately
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:10.700]   because of our lengthy iOS today shows.
[01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:12.900]   You know what, tune in all day Tuesday
[01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:14.600]   because there's lots of great stuff
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.200]   on Twitch starting at 9 AM Pacific, 12 Eastern,
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:22.080]   but we'll be on roughly around 11 AM, 2 PM Eastern.
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:24.200]   That would be 1700 UTC.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:25.820]   The stream is always available
[01:38:25.820 --> 01:38:28.840]   twit.tv/live, audio and video.
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:30.080]   If you're on the stream,
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:31.360]   you should be on the chat
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:33.080]   at irc.twit.tv,
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:36.280]   talking amongst the other folks watching live.

[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:42.080]   In the case of this show,
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:46.120]   it's twit.tv/mbw for Mac Break Weekly.
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:47.260]   But do me a favor,
[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:48.500]   click one of those buttons.

[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:51.740]   and subscribe.
[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:53.140]   That way you'll get a copy,
[01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:54.580]   the minute it's available,
[01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:58.060]   ready for you to enjoy it, you're leisure.

[01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:04.100]   Thanks for joining us everybody.
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:07.760]   But now as Alex Lindsey has said many times before,
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:08.940]   it's time to get back to work
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:11.500]   because break time is over.
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:13.080]   See you next time.
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:15.660]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:18.240]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:20.820]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:23.400]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.980]   (upbeat music)
