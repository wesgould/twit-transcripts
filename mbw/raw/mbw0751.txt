[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.400]   It's actually been a very good quarter. So there is a lot of news starting with Renee Richie,
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:12.000]   youtube.com/ReneeRitchie. Hello Renee. Hello, I do not get a percentage of Apple's earnings. So I'm
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.800]   not on a beach earning 20%. Man, imagine frozen Montreal. Imagine. Oh yeah. Imagine. Also with
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.480]   his Andy Anaco from the beautiful WGBH at Boston, public radio for Boston. Hello, Andrew.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:34.960]   Yeah, got a game stop, but God, wish I got a little Apple. I know. Hey, I said familiar
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:42.400]   laugh. Look who's here. It's great to have him back. The Alexander Lindsey, Sous vide to the stars,
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.600]   the pitmaster. Hello, head of office hours. Yes. I have you back. We missed you.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.160]   Good to be back. I think it was a busy fall, busy summer, but I'm definitely glad to be
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.320]   back on the show. Yeah. Now that the political campaigns are completely over, knock on wood.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:12.160]   We got a little taste of Alex, which is nice. It's really good to have you back.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.480]   So this is an interesting debate. By the way,
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.440]   we've spent the last week talking about GameStop. So this will be the first GameStop free show
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.720]   in the week. Okay, nothing. No, wait a minute. Never heard of it. Diamond hands. None of that.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.320]   Guys, still talk about how they hork me over on a trade on a gameboy like eight years ago.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:44.640]   That's okay. We give you $5 in store credit or $3 cash. Yeah, right. That's okay. But I'm
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.720]   starting to get complaints. I don't want to hear about shorting the squeezes anymore. I don't,
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.760]   I don't care. Pardon? I don't know. Pardon? Pardon a moi. But see, now I have a decision
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.640]   to make because I guess the big story last week was Apple's quarterly results. And of course,
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.920]   we're going to cover that. But also the new Mac OS 10 11 Big Sur 11.2 came out. And there's that
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.480]   to talk about. And I think that most of our audience would prefer to hear about Big Sur.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.520]   So let's start. And the betas, Leo, the betas. And the betas.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.400]   Yeah, using the betas. Big news and the betas. So let's start with that.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.880]   Because that's kind of more user stuff. Finance mark finance markets boring.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:36.240]   So first of all, Big Sur 11.2, the top line thing was fixes Bluetooth issues, which I don't even
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.520]   know about. Is that only on the M1 Max or is that on all the Max? Do you know anything about this
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.760]   at all? Really? Yeah, I didn't have it. Like it's one of those things where I feel like as Apple's
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.920]   user base has grown, there is always a percentage of them that have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth issues.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.160]   And whenever they fix it for some, it creates it for others. So it's just a permanent thing of
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.320]   whack-a-mole. But there was a higher than usual percentage of people who complained about
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.200]   Bluetooth connectivity issues with the M1 Mac mini in particular. And that just might be because
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.800]   more people use Bluetooth peripherals with the M1 Mac mini than they do the air or the MacBook Pro.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.720]   But there was this frequent disconnections and all sorts of problems and videos were made,
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.360]   columns were written about it. And the hope was that this would fix it. And it looks like,
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:27.440]   as usual, it has fixed it for some, but not everybody. Yeah. Also, so the perennial complaint was
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.680]   that. And then if you have one of the new Apple Silicon Macs, monitor, monitor, monitor, lots of
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:42.000]   issues with external displays. Supposedly, this fixes the fact that you get a black screen when
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.800]   using an HDMI to DVI converter. I don't know. Apple's saying edits to Apple Pro Raw in the
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.560]   photos app may not save. That's been fixed. iCloud Drive could turn off after disabling iCloud Drive
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.400]   desktop and documents folder option, which I always do. That's fixed. System preferences may not
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.440]   unlock what entering your administrative password. Okay. And the little things, it's a little things
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.960]   account. And then the globe key may not display the emoji and symbols pane when pressed. So just
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.840]   little things. There is a large, critical, if you can't get to your name, my emoji, man.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:23.360]   That is right at time. I don't have a globe key on some of my Macs. I only have it on the laptop.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.200]   I'm using non Apple keyboards and a lot of stuff. Do you think control command space bar like an
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   animal? Is that what I have to do? Control command space bar. That's good. I'll keep that in mind.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:40.160]   And then there's a security update in Apple had a big problem last week with three
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:47.440]   zero days on iOS. And I'm wondering if it also might have been related to that. So I don't know.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.760]   No evidence one way or the other. Oh, they have blast doors.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:56.480]   Yeah, we put up we put up blast doors. Alex, do you use you don't you probably use any of the
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:04.160]   new M1 Macs? Yeah, I have I have actually 12 of them. Okay, you don't use many of them. Just a dozen.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:11.600]   Just yeah. So we use them as a zoom machines for remote kits. So basically the mini.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.160]   Yeah, the minis are what we're using. And so we're installing those in. And so I tested one.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:23.040]   And then I bought a bunch of them. And what we do with them is we put them into kits with
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.880]   ATEM minis and 6k cameras and we send them out to people so that we can record them remotely so
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.600]   that even if they have a connection issue, we get we get a really good return and we can control
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.640]   the cameras because the iPad app that Blackmagic makes runs on the M1. And so we can actually
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.760]   control the camera change its eyes. That's nice. We want to do really, really powerful. And so
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.240]   and the minis have been just amazing. So now we're between we don't need as many kits. And so I've
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.200]   got lots of minis floating around that we're doing lots of testing with. And they're
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.040]   amazing little machines, you know, for the price I keep on. I'm just kind of amazed at what
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:03.200]   I get for, I don't know, $800 or whatever we spent on the eight gig ones for this. We just
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.760]   have time to wait for the 16s. So we bought a bunch of eights and they were plenty for zoom.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.040]   And just crazy fast and snappy. So have you had any of the monitor problems that people are
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.200]   complaining about with the mini? I don't know what the we haven't had any monitor problems. I mean,
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:22.000]   we're just doing HDMI out and and a USB C out for the two different monitors. Yeah. And so we
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.680]   haven't had any issues. I know there's a lot of complaints about the fact that you can't put more
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.960]   than two monitors into the mini. So the mini doesn't there are ways to hack it up to six monitors,
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.240]   but really it's it natively only really supports to. And so so those are the that's kind of the
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.240]   biggest complaint we've seen related to monitors around, at least within within our group, the
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:46.400]   office our group that I'm in every morning talking about these things that the two limit of two
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:54.080]   monitors is a big deal for some. Yeah, I'm looking now thanks Scooter X to the at the list of security
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:03.440]   flaws fixed in 11.2. Wow. It's kind of a long list. Analytics APFS CF network catch core animation

[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:37.600]   you know anybody? Any of them? Holy cow. This is a long way. I message was the only zero day.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:44.080]   And that's the one that had that weird anonymous attribution. Right. What was the I actually didn't
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.920]   trace what the actual I saw this the zero day, but I didn't trace what the what could happen.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:57.200]   Did we already discuss that? We did not. This is a new story. No, it was it was remote execution. I
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.600]   believe that they that they thought was being maybe used by nation states in the wild, but
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:06.400]   that's what prompted that whole blast or thing that we have now. They actually actually got an
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.800]   alert that they've actually seen it in operation in the wild probably by nation states, but still
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:17.840]   this is this is not a was an a preemptive thing. It was no, we caught the we caught the horse out of
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:23.200]   the barn. Yeah, they were going after journalists particularly. Yeah.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:32.080]   Blastor. What is blastor, Mr. Richie? When it's at home. So blastor is and this was not
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.680]   something at Apple analysis is something that Google's zero day zero day discovered. Yeah, I
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.480]   love it. Yeah. They discovered the architecture and decided to elaborate on it in the supremely
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.840]   geeky fashion that was project zero does, but this is this is typical of Apple. They don't want
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.080]   anybody. They're not going to you know, it's they're not going to announce stuff that they're
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.840]   doing, but they're always doing stuff behind the scenes to make your Mac more secure, which is
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.680]   they don't rely on security by obscurity, but they'll take obscurity as an additional layer
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.720]   on top of anything else that they can get. This is on iOS only, although I wonder would it
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:11.040]   also happen on given that we're using the iOS version of messages kind of sort of in big sir.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.760]   Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. I mean, I guess we just have to dig into it and see if it has
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.800]   rolled out already or when, but the idea is that it creates a vault where it parses and because
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:26.160]   it's been a whole history, even without zero days, it's been a history of Unicode parsing errors and
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.560]   not just like not really malicious payloads, but like prank payloads that would crash
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.200]   iMessage or crash your phone, which is still serious and can still be serious, but they were mostly
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:40.400]   used by people for the laws. But all of those things are now being handled in this vault in this,
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:46.560]   it's inside this box basically, right? It's it's like a sandbox, but it's almost like an
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.800]   isolated environment where they can open up this stuff and extract usable information while keeping
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.600]   it incredibly constrained from affecting anything outside of its perimeter. Yeah.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:03.840]   Some antiviruses are one of our sponsor's ESET does this. They if they don't recognize an
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:09.120]   attachment and email address, they put it in the cloud and execute it in a sandbox in the cloud
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:15.200]   and watch its behavior. And so this is kind of the same thing. There's if there's attachments on the
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:21.840]   message or other other suspicious stuff, they can analyze it behind the blast door.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.840]   Yeah, such a Star Wars reference. I love it. Yeah.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:31.440]   I don't know. I guess it's an Apple term because it's it's a it's named message is blast door service.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.040]   So I guess that comes from Apple. Yeah.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:41.520]   They're geeks at heart. Yeah. Send plug-in payload to blast door service for diffusion.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:48.720]   Little robots in there. We don't have to. We have diffused.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:57.440]   Diffused your pack and that's a sample. This is a ball. Oh, okay. Close the blast.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:03.520]   That's good. That's good. I love I love it that Apple does stuff like this, which is
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:10.800]   fairly sophisticated and does not send out a press release for obvious reasons, right? Yeah.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:17.600]   Which is maybe would have been in their best interest to at least grant an interview to certain
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:22.720]   people to say, Oh, by the way, you realize that there's been a that iMessage has been one of the most
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.360]   popular tax services for our most popular product. We have been listening, but we are concerned
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:31.680]   about that as other people are. And so we are taking probably we're taking steps to fix that.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:37.760]   So yeah. And I should I would point out that there's a good reason why you see these
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:43.920]   exploits happening in messaging programs. In fact, if you look at the fixes in Big Sur 11.2,
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.040]   there are a lot of them are in and Steve gives I only know this because Steve gives us always
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:56.000]   talking about interpreters. Things that take say multimedia content and render it or fonts
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.920]   and render it are always prone because they're basically fonts are programs and they're
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:08.320]   running these programs. So they're basically in there in very nature, you know, challenging.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:14.480]   And so anything they can do to protect these is actually is actually really good. Yeah.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.680]   Steve's talked a little bit about this. He'll probably talk about Blastor
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.280]   because we just we just learned learned about it ourselves.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:30.240]   Anything else in this update 11.2 you want to talk about anybody?
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:38.640]   Bluetooth external display issues security. I still think it's remarkable that we stayed on
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:46.160]   OS 10 Mac OS 10 for decades and it was 10.1 and 10.1.13 and that's a good point.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.960]   That's a good point. Oh, a point now we're at 11.2 already.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:54.160]   A point release was an actual whole new version of Mac OS, wasn't it? In the end of days.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.280]   And now it looks like we're going to get Mac OS 12 this year.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:02.560]   Must be going to 12. Yeah, Mac OS 12. Yeah, must be going to 12 because otherwise you're going to run out.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.600]   There's a huge shift in their strategy for how they're numbering these things,
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.760]   but also it has to live with the indignity of being two numbers lower than iOS because they
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.240]   didn't name it like Mac OS 16, which I thought they were going to do because it was 10.16.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.960]   They dropped it all the way down to 11. And now it looks like like iOS is the big brother.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.760]   And if I was I was Mac OS I'd be just non plus. The other thing I noticed in this security release
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:31.360]   is that a great many of these exploits were discovered by third parties. This is where Apple
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:37.840]   resisted for a long time bug bounties. They really didn't want to get in that business.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.880]   But it's paid off here. I mean, they're actually giving the credit to the team.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:48.800]   The CF network cache, which could lead to arbitrary code execution,
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:57.120]   was discovered by a juliang of Chihu 360 Vulcan team. I don't think that's an Apple team.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:05.440]   I think it's a much cheaper way to do it, actually, because if they fail, you don't pay them anything.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.280]   You want people on salaries sitting there banging on it. And you have people that are creative,
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.040]   that this isn't their only job. They're interacting with other clients, they're interacting with
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.800]   other code bases. They're not in the kind of the walled garden, and they're really banging on it.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:24.880]   It's good. And these are things you want them to bang on. The flaw in core graphics processing
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.520]   and maliciously crafted font file could lead to arbitrary code execution. In core media,
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:35.760]   processing a maliciously crafted image may lead to arbitrary code execution. Core text processing
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:41.920]   and maliciously crafted text file may lead to, you guessed it, arbitrary code execution. All of that
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:48.400]   essentially means a remote attacker can get into your system and execute.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:56.880]   Some of these together. These are all really significant. So my guess is this is a roll-up of
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:02.800]   everything people have discovered since Big Sur came out. So actually, some of them are for as
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.600]   Catalina and Mojave. These are problems that have been there. They're just web-based,
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:13.200]   which is everything. Is a lot of it webkit? Image, I own it. Well, I mean, WebKit has its fair share
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:18.320]   as those messages for similar reasons, because you're parsing a lot of code coming in.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.640]   From websites, it could not be in your best interests. Look at this one. This is one, two,
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:31.200]   three, four, five, six flaws in processing a maliciously crafted image may lead to arbitrary
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:37.840]   code execution. Jesus. That's our least favorite kind of code execution. It's the kind you don't want.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.560]   How about, well, I got an even less favorite in the kernel. An application may be able to
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:50.880]   execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. Yikes. Yikes. Quite a few kernel flaws. Anyway,
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:56.160]   it's good they're fixing it. This is an unusual, I don't remember Apple being this forthright about
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:04.320]   fixes in the past. They have been to some extent, and there was this weird period where other
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.200]   operating systems stopped reporting and Apple started reporting with large verbosity. And so
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.600]   it was reported that Apple had more bugs than anybody else. There was no amount of,
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:19.120]   because the other ones reported none. Obviously, they had no bugs. So I just always prefer a company
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:24.000]   to be as transparent and verbose as possible with this stuff. I'd rather know that they fixed it
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.200]   than live under an illusion they didn't have anything to fix. Yeah.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:37.760]   There's even an acknowledgments section here. We'd like to thank Junjilu,
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.160]   Mickey Jin and Jesse Chang of Trend Micro for their assistance.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:48.720]   There's quite an acknowledged. It's great. It should sound a little
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:55.440]   toughy. We'd like to acknowledge Philippe Hegg for his existence. Apple monogram locks.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:02.960]   Yeah, it's really funny. Again, remember that each one of these exploits is valuable
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:09.280]   on the outside. So it is really, really important that Apple acknowledge everybody from the outside
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:15.040]   who helped them out and make sure that they're, because it will also help these people's careers
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.600]   as security researchers and say, oh, I'm the one responsible for bringing this to Apple's attention.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.760]   And often, nation states are willing to pay a lot more than Apple's willing to pay. And so,
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.760]   yeah, do everything you can to make it desirable for them to turn these over to Apple.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.240]   I think that pins would actually go a long way because imagine if I'm walking up to somebody with
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:39.520]   20 pins across there. I'm sure you'll like, well, those guys. I have a sad feeling.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.920]   The ones who look like a North Korean general with them with them with them. Yeah. But the
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.640]   emblems that go all the way down the coat and onto the pants. Yeah. Yeah. I think they'll go.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.400]   I think people would be excited about that. They'd put all down their sleeve. It could be like a
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.440]   sleeve thing. There's a lot of opportunities there. Have I'm just going somebody saying,
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:07.120]   objective sees Lulu stopped working. Patrick Wardle is usually pretty good. And he's, he was able
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:14.240]   to get Apple to kind of change their policy in Big Sur so that Lulu could do its job. In fact,
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:23.600]   even Lulu is an outbound firewall, kind of like a big little snitch, but free. And he was, he got
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:29.040]   a lot done to make that workable on Big Sur. But if it's not working now, I don't, Lulu issues
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:35.120]   resolution so far disabled from login items restart, then start Lulu. Okay. Doug Am is having
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:42.560]   some problems. There was a big SUDO bug in Linux. I don't know if that impacted Apple. I'm sure they
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:48.080]   patched it. It's been patched on every Linux I'm aware of. So, but it does not mention the,
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:57.920]   I like to call it SUDO bug. SUDO. I know that's not. I would be thrown out of the MIT hackers lab
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.960]   for calling it that, but the SU do. Oh, come on. Hackers can have fun.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:09.440]   That's the problem. That's right there in a nutshell.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.640]   Or maybe if they joke to more, they get in trouble less. I guess if we're talking about new,
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:21.520]   new versions of Big Sur and iOS, 14.5, the beta. Yes.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:30.080]   From, for iOS, very interesting. New Apple card family feature from multi-user accounts. And if
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:36.800]   you wear a mask and you have an Apple watch, you can get face recognition, but though, I guess it's
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:41.120]   really watch recognition. Right? Yeah, I think I don't think there's any face recognition at all.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:45.040]   I think that they're just, they're literally just going, you're asking for a face recognition
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:49.040]   and you're wearing your watch. We will make that work. But I, you know, that's actually one of the
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:54.080]   features I love about the watch. Oh, my timer is still going. I was timing a traffic light.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:22:00.720]   That's one of the. Wow. Well, you ever do that where you get to travel that? This one is always
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:05.520]   really long. So I just was curious how long is really long, a minute, 10 seconds. That feels
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.040]   really long when you're sitting there. It does. It feels like an eternity. It's an eternity.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:16.640]   This was a really complicated implementation though because ever since launch, the Apple watch
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:22.960]   has, the iPhone has unlocked the Apple watch. And you, that can't be bidirectional for a host of
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.120]   reasons, including the ability to exploit it or just a, you know, time space loop that would end
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:33.040]   the universe. So what Apple did was create a set of circumstances where if it tries to read your
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:38.400]   face ID and fails because you're wearing a mask, because face ID needs three points of facial
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:43.760]   geometry, both eye sockets and the nose geometry. And if it can't read the nose, it's going to fail.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:49.120]   But instead of failing to pass code, it then hands off to another system that checks that you have
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:54.640]   an Apple watch in proximity that is unlocked and it's still connected to you, aka it's still reading
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:00.240]   a pulse. And then if those things are true, it returns the token that allows it to unlock.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:04.400]   And only for phone unlock, you can't use it for Apple Pay, you can't use it for iTunes.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:10.080]   It is only under these circumstances. So they carved a little tiny narrow tunnel through that
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:15.600]   potential paradox to make this work. And I think it's great because you can't retroactively go and
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.080]   add touch ID to everybody's phones who's struggling with a mask now. But this gives you at least a
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:25.520]   possible accessory option to that pain. It is a switch that is in the settings. So you'll have to
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:31.120]   turn that on. And if you've disabled wrist detection, it's not going to work for obvious reasons.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:37.120]   I didn't even know I could disable wrist detection. I guess that's how I would put the watch on the
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:42.800]   back of a phone and use it as a viewfighter. If you're doing that, okay, you're going to have to
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.920]   pull your mask down. You're a hacksawer. If you're a hacksawer. You have to have the passcode enabled.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:54.720]   It has to be on your wrist. It has to be unlocked. Face ID, you'll say, oh crap. He's wearing a mask.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:01.280]   And then I'll check with the watch. I love the unlock Mac OS with the Apple Watch feature. That's
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.880]   fantastic. I mean, before I could even think about it, even though I have fingerprint on my MacBook,
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:10.880]   it's unlocked. And then it's really great when you go into things that need escalation,
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.640]   like the system preference pane that you have to have an admin login, your watch goes and you
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.560]   double tap it and you're in. I love that feature. And it's even better than the watch version,
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.400]   because this will also it'll give you the same kind of tapping notification, but it also gives
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:26.400]   you a button saying relock. So like a friend of yours is trying to grab the phone because you're
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.640]   in close proximity and have your watch unlock automatically for you. You're like, nope, sorry,
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:35.200]   sucker. And he was pressed. That's a good point, because if he's wearing a mask, it might trigger
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.480]   the same thing. Yeah. And people like there's all these Bluetooth trusted objects. It's not a new
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.720]   thing. Like I feel Nickinson used to run Android Central and he had Bluetooth trusted object for
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.200]   his Android phones. So I would just take the little object and I'd be him, which is not what you
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.360]   want from a security point of view. This at least has some form of biometrics and fail saves.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:58.640]   Okay. There you go.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:03.120]   There's more feature there, Leo, that deserves that deserves a special call out. That is their
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:10.560]   enabling dual dual global 5G for the sim, which I'm always going to insist on pointing out,
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:16.240]   because as a feature that Qualcomm has claimed exists on the X 55 modem since launch in all the
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.800]   brochures, but has never been on a phone as far as I can tell. No one has ever had it working.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.360]   And Apple got asked all these questions about it. And so I looked and said, does it work on Samsung?
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:30.240]   No, is it work on this? No. Is it a real feature? And I even got yelled at by Qualcomm on social
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:35.120]   media for daring to ask. And now it turns out Apple is implementing it. And other people still
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:40.480]   haven't. So I'm just I'm calling shame on Qualcomm for this and kudos to the phone companies for
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:45.920]   pressuring them into finally enabling this. And by the way, even nine to five Mac is quoting your
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:51.040]   tweet. I mean, like you're the guy on this. So nice job. Nice job.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:58.560]   No one else apparently even noticed. But do you use dual sims up there in the Great White North or
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:04.080]   no? I mean, if this was a normal year, I would absolutely have a US sim at this point that I'd
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:10.080]   have had the sim on US and I'd have a Canadian sim on the thing. But that was my plan going
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:15.440]   right into 2020. I was going to be doing that. And I barely use cellular since 2020.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.920]   Why would Qualcomm drag their feet on talking about it?
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:25.760]   They put it in the brochure, but never implemented it. It required a bunch of new software to be
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.800]   pushed out for the modems. And as far as I could tell, they just never did it. And so another
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:36.080]   one wasn't dragging their feet. It was the phone manufacturers in the
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:42.240]   books listed a feature that didn't exist. And it didn't seem like any like any company until
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:47.760]   Apple deployed 5G was was angry, if forceful enough to get them to actually make it work.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:55.840]   Somebody responded to your tweet, Andrew Edwards saying, excuse me. Did you say dual sim 5G?
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:02.560]   Love Andrew. Excuse me. Pardon me.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:07.600]   Especially people outside the US, especially people in Asia and India, they live off of dual
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:14.400]   sim and until now it's been 4G 4G or 5G 4G, but not 5G 5G, which some people really want.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:20.800]   Yeah. Yeah. Okay. See, we started with the house. My earring of grievances.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:25.040]   The help. Yeah. We started with the airing of grievances. We didn't do the financial stuff.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:30.480]   We were saving that for later in the show. So I hope you're all happy.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:36.560]   Actually, it'd be good time to take a break before we get into Apple's stunning.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:41.200]   Stunning first. Have we talked about that? Did we talk about that last week? I guess we did.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.800]   Did we? I can't remember. I'm done. We have not because it came out Wednesday, right? Yeah.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:51.520]   Yeah. It came out after our show. So in a way, we're the last people to talk about.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:59.040]   We were busy, but the most important. That's that's what I'm saying. The most important.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:03.680]   We'll also talk about Tim Cook. We'll get the money. Doing a little subtweet against Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:11.920]   I like it. And then Jeffrey Fowler was fire. Yeah. Tim Cook's video was utter fire. I've never seen
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.000]   that. All right. Well, I'm good. I have to find that. Good. I want to see that.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.400]   And then Jeffrey Fowler at the Washington Post did some interesting homework with a surprising
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:28.240]   result and a big victory in the EU. We've got a lot of stuff still to come. It's so good to have
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:33.120]   Alex Lindsey back. I will take some time to spend talking to you, Alex, about the latest and
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:38.800]   the gear and stuff. Office hours still going big. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.760]   Picking up speed, actually. Every morning. Yeah. Every morning. Seven days a week. We actually
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:49.360]   added one day night. So now we have an EU. What are you nuts? Can't get enough. Can't get enough.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:53.920]   And you're not this. You don't charge for this, right? No, it's free. I mean, you don't have ads.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.000]   You don't do it. You just doing this pro bono. Yeah. Just having a good time doing it. Yeah.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.960]   And now eight days a week in the words of the Beatles. It's eight days away. Yeah.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.920]   I didn't think about that way, but yeah. Coffee with Alex so many mornings.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:15.600]   You're cray cray. YouTube.com/AlexLindsay, I guess, right? Off for office hours. You can see
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.200]   them there. You can definitely see them there. And then in any of those videos, you'll see the
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:25.120]   a link at the top of the description to join in Zoom if you want to so that you can actually
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:30.560]   be part of the conversation. But you can definitely watch. I mean, it's two hours. There's actually
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:35.040]   five hours every day of content, but there's two hours that that end up on YouTube.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.960]   You invented it. I don't think you knew this, but you invented clubhouse. You should get some of the
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.200]   clubhouse money. Yeah, exactly. Well, we were looking at clubhouse, but we're like, well,
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   we're doing clubhouse. We're just doing it with video. You're doing a better clubhouse than club
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.280]   house. The only difference is you don't have Elon Musk on, but other than that.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.480]   And I work on that. Yeah, that could happen there. That might be a feature.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:01.520]   It just keeps on getting more intense. So we're having a lot of great guests and a lot of
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:06.400]   interesting stuff. So it's a good time. I love the header image on your YouTube channel
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.880]   with all the good that is just, that's a good look. I take it. That was a,
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:17.760]   you know, that was a connection. I think we were connecting the stars of Star Trek. If you look at
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.920]   the little things that are from one of the Star Trek's to the space. Jonathan Frakes there.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.960]   It looks like it. No, no, it was the new Star Wars, the new Star Trek.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:31.360]   Yeah. And so we were connecting them to the space station. And so, but we had like,
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.440]   what? Conference room. Yeah. So they were, they were having a conversation. If you search Star Trek
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:40.560]   space station, you'll see the link. And anyway, so that video, this was the behind the scenes,
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.840]   because we had a conference room to build into. And it was still early on before we started
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:50.480]   using lots of cases. So it's just a lot of gag. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. I don't know how he
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:55.760]   does it, everybody. You think it's our, because you, on your office hours, you never have this
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:00.800]   is Skype issue. I've never seen this problem. So I think Skype has just done something crazy.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.560]   Yeah. I don't know what the connection is, but it sounds okay. Yeah, it sounds fine. It's just
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:09.280]   the video is not great. But we've been having actually a lot more of that lately. Maybe it's us.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:13.120]   Maybe it's something we're doing, John. I've literally never seen this with Skype,
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:18.160]   even Skype before. But definitely I do this every day. And I don't see what it was. Renee and Andy
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.800]   aren't Skype. We're not having problems. I know. But I just don't understand. We've been trying
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:29.440]   OBS Ninja. In fact, programming note tomorrow morning, the creator of OBS Ninja will be on
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.880]   Floss Weekly. So that is something that if yeah, he is really an interesting guy, Seguin, Paul Seguin.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:42.080]   That is going to be a really interesting Floss Weekly. What time does that start, John? 9 a.m.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:50.560]   930 a.m. The creator of OBS Ninja will be on Floss Weekly. Our show today brought to you by
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:55.200]   Uber for Business. Now I want to talk specifically to small businesses,
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:02.080]   medium businesses, big businesses. In this day and age, if it's hard to get
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:10.640]   people to show up or stay engaged in virtual team meetings or events, Uber for Business has a
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:17.200]   solution for you. It can be hard to find, you know, I know this simple, effective ways to keep
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:24.640]   employees engaged, to keep customers happy, especially during, you know, COVID and when face-to-face
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:29.920]   interaction is limited. If you're trying to find a way to stand out to your customers or to make
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:36.800]   your employees feel, "Oh, warm and fuzzy, you need Uber for Business. I had never heard of this
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:41.840]   until they told me about it." Of course, you know, we all use Uber as a way to request rides,
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:47.360]   order meals from restaurants you love, but Uber has a platform designed specifically
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:53.600]   for businesses. And I guess I was just the last to know because already 160,000 companies use
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:59.440]   Uber for Business to improve customer and employee satisfaction with vouchers from Uber for Business.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:06.160]   If you want to kind of spiff a customer or make an employee feel valued, you can add $20 to the
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:10.800]   personal Uber accounts so they can order meals. You could say, "Look, coffee's on me for this meeting
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.960]   through Uber Eats before a meeting. If you want to make your customers love your business
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:21.440]   every even more, offer them a voucher for a free meal or a free ride when they make their first purchase.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:27.840]   Isn't that nice, free meal?" And you could think of lots of ways to, you know, spin this to make it
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:33.680]   like, you know, "Hey, if you want to, you know, take a look at our video, we'll buy dinner while
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:39.280]   you watch it." That kind of thing. You can make it for any amount. Customer, any company can sign
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.440]   up for free, by the way, and immediately start delivering extra value to the people who matter
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:49.280]   most. The voucher is very simple to send for you, very easy to redeem for your customers and employees.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:55.760]   Your business has total control over who gets them. There could be an expiration date. You could
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:00.400]   say, "What portion of the ride?" You know, "All we're going to cover the first $10 or the first
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.720]   half or whatever the meal you want to cover vouchers are shared." Typically, you'd send them by email
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:09.360]   or text. But what's nice is, especially with text, you can redeem it with just a click.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:15.600]   And best of all, you only pay for rides they take or meals they order. You're not buying this up front.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.160]   It's, you know, it's only for the stuff they actually use. Right now, for a limited time,
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:25.520]   you get a $50 voucher when you create your first vouchers campaign and spend $200 or more. Go to
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:34.400]   uber.com/macbreak to find out more. That is a nice deal. Uber.com/macbreak, some terms and
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:41.280]   conditions apply. Get a $50 voucher when you create your first vouchers campaign and spend $200 or
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:49.040]   more. uber.com/macbreak. Nice little thing from Uber. I love seeing how companies are pivoting
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:54.320]   during quarantine, how they're figuring out new models because it can be, you know, some companies
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:59.200]   are not doing so well. Our favorite restaurants, a number of them have gone out of business. It's
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:06.160]   very sad. I think mostly not just the restaurant that I won't be able to eat at, but the employees,
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:11.760]   the cooks and the waiters and so forth who are not going to be working. So it's nice when a company
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:20.400]   can find a pivot, something that works in these troubling times. On we go with the show. Let's see
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:30.320]   here. Apple had, so we should explain, I think everybody knows this by now, Apple's fiscal year
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:37.840]   is different from the calendar year. They end their fiscal year in September. I mean, so that
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:43.920]   the first quarter of the new year for them is October, November, December, probably related to
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:51.760]   the fact that that's when the new iPhones come out. I'm going to guess. And it was a very good
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:36:00.000]   October, November, December for Apple, their best quarter ever all time record, 111.4 billion
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.640]   in revenue. 28 point. Was it like one of the top three quarters ever for any company? For any company.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:11.520]   Yeah, you know, Microsoft came out with its earnings this week too. And you know, I think
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:16.880]   Microsoft's a pretty big company. John C. de Vorek always used to say, I'd rather have Bill Gates
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:22.800]   wallet than Steve Jobs wallet. Not so fast, Johnny. It was like Apple X on and one other company.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:26.560]   Yeah, three quarters ever. Microsoft was I can't remember it was 14 billion or something
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:34.560]   in profit. $88 billion in profit. I mean, sorry, 28 billion. I gave them a little more money than
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:40.720]   they should have been. 28. A lot more. 28. It's still good. It's still like
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:50.560]   2020 at the DC universe of years. That's amazing. Yeah. Revenue by category. This is Jason Snell's
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:55.440]   fabulous color charts and six colors, which he always says, Oh, it's easy Leo. It's just an Excel
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:01.840]   macro, but I still am impressed. I'm still impressed, Jason. They're pretty. They're very well, more
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:06.960]   than pretty. They're useful for us. And of course, if you're not watching, I'll describe it for you.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:14.320]   But iPhone revenue still the lion share 59% this quarter. But look at the wedge that wearables has
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:22.880]   gotten to 12% of revenue now. That's for Apple Watch and AirPods, right? Whoo. But those are all
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:29.600]   like high billion dollar businesses. It's amazing. And the services, 14%. That was the thing I was
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:35.520]   interested in is how services did, especially with the advent of Apple one fitness plus launched in
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:45.600]   December. Apple TV, they keep extending the free trial. It's July now, right? The free trial for
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:54.320]   Apple TV. Revenue up year over year, 21%. But it was also really good news for Mac and iPad. Now,
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:38:02.320]   Apple did release its new M1 Macs, but that was in December. So I don't, I get, you know,
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:08.880]   PC sales were up a lot this year as well. Even Intel had a good quarter because of work from home
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:13.760]   and school from home. Yeah. I think that I think that we're going to see the revenue just continue
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:18.960]   to spike. I think, you know, for the Mac use, I think you're going to end up in a super cycle as
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:24.960]   well because the M1 and the what will be the M2, M3, M4 are so much faster. Can you imagine?
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:29.360]   There's a lot of people that are waiting, you know, to get something better. And there's been
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:35.600]   not really any significant reason to go to upgrade. And now we have a big reason to upgrade. So it's,
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.920]   it's, I think, as the new ones come out as we get the higher end Mac Pro and iMac and then
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:45.520]   the iMac Pro and Mac Pro, I think you're going to end up with a super cycle where a lot of people
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.600]   are upgrading. Andy, it's going to be a good market. What were you, Andy was going to say something too.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:54.080]   I was just going to say that every single tech, almost every single tech company
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:00.640]   was the beneficiary of a very of a huge bump from 2020 due to circumstances. They certainly had
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:05.840]   some problems that every other, every other company had to deal with. But it's going to be
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:12.160]   keen to see how this is, how this shakes out when we take a look at these numbers in terms
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:16.000]   in reflecting back from next year. Because again, there's, there's such a thing,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.640]   unfortunately, as the COVID bump for tech companies disproportionately tech companies have been
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:25.520]   having such a great year based on how much their services and their hardware is needed.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:31.680]   That in the, the was actually been arguing for it. We should be, we should be adding extra COVID
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:38.000]   tax to certain tech companies to help offset the economic hit that other industries are suffering.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:45.680]   So that's all the previous stuff with the novel standing that Apple had a hell of a quarter
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:51.040]   selling M1 Macs. The first really, really exciting Mac in a very, very long time.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.560]   But we have to take a look at that within context of 2020.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.200]   Yeah, look at this segment. This is the, in the line on the Mac revenue. The,
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:05.440]   this is a big growth all through the year, very steady linear growth. But I agree with you, Alex,
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:11.680]   you go into next year, that may still go up not because of COVID now, but because of the new Apple
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:17.360]   Silicon, which has to be. And I think that that also, there's a lot of things that have happened
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:22.320]   to companies that are not going to go back. You know, so we're really the longer the
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:27.680]   stay at home or work from home, you know, continues the more embedded it's going to become. And then
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:33.120]   that's going to probably not slow down too quickly. So I think that I think we're probably going to
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:38.800]   see a continue of growth for another probably 12 to 18 months. iPad had a great year as well,
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:46.320]   year over year iPad revenue up 41%. But again, it also had a very, very good 2020. And I think
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:54.480]   iPad probably, especially for K through six students, a very good choice for kids, you know, working
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:00.880]   from home, going to schooling from home. But similar numbers there growth, at least for me was that
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:07.440]   the iPad represents most of the tablet market, like it's not 100% of it, but it represents most
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:13.840]   of the tablet market. But still 50% of buyers were new to the iPad. The Mac, 50% of buyers were
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:18.800]   new to the Mac, but the Mac has a tiny share of the market. So it has huge potential to run,
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:24.320]   especially if Apple can really provide compelling experiences if M1 is a big, and that you know,
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:29.680]   M1 X, M2, if all of those things are big differentiators, at least in a certain segment of consumers,
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:35.120]   they can maybe start pushing that beyond the low team digits, you know, to single digits,
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:39.760]   they've always been trapped. And then watch was like 75% new, even though the Apple Watch is
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:44.800]   dominant in its market, that market is tiny. Like most people have a phone now, very few people still
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:49.760]   have computational watches. So just looking at how many new customers are still attracting,
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:54.400]   given the size of those individual markets means they still have a lot more room than I think a
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:42:02.480]   lot of analysts were expecting in those spaces. iPhone 12 was also a huge success. I think that's
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:12.400]   also very interesting. The 12 pro, yeah, iPhone revenue up 65%. Wow, year over year. And this
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:16.400]   is always the big bump. But if you look at the big bump for this quarter compared to big bumps
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:22.800]   for other quarters, it's a bigger bump. And then it was all in this quarter. Yeah, it's all yeah,
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:27.920]   of course, it always is right. That's how it is. I mean, I think one of the things, yeah, go ahead,
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.240]   Alex, you know, one of the things with the iPhone is of course there was 5G and I don't think it's
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.680]   you know, we'll see how that how much that really impacts it. But I think a lot of people
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:40.080]   psychologically think that 5G is important. Right. And then the camera is just stunning.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:46.640]   The shooting video, I've been shooting a lot of video with, you know, vision, the Dolby vision.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:52.080]   Yeah. And it's just, wow, really, like it's just it's just such a when you get used to watching it,
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.800]   because there's this thing where it pops up and it's a little dark and I don't know whether they
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.800]   do this on purpose just to make you feel better. But it's a little darker than it pops open to
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:02.560]   the full brightness and you suddenly realize it. But when you get to you, when you're missing,
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:07.440]   when you open these these files on your, you know, in Final Cut or something,
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:11.680]   you really see the difference between the Dolby vision and the interesting what you're shooting
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.920]   before. So it's it's it's pretty impressive. And a lot of people, I mean, this is their main camera
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:19.520]   now. This is what they shoot pictures of their family and everything else. And so
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:24.080]   it does become a point where it jumps enough in the quality that you want to upgrade.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.480]   Andy, you were going to say something I cut you off. Was it for the previous?
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:34.240]   No, I think I was just going to say that they did beat analyst predictions. I think they had
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:41.760]   revenue of 110 billion. Rest. They thought it'd be 100 101. Yeah. And remember the stock market jump
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:47.920]   a week ago Friday? Of course, you know, you buy on the rumor, but it was the highest
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:54.400]   stock price Apple had ever had. And it went back down when the news came out, as it always does. I
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:59.120]   think it's probably gone back up a little bit. Actually, Apple, okay, there is a little GameStop
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:04.880]   sideline here. And Alex Wilhelm from TechCrunch was a guy who pointed this out to me on Sunday on
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:11.760]   Twitter. He said a lot of these short funds in order in this hedge funds in order to cover their
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:18.240]   shorts had to sell other stock. And a lot of it was Apple. So Apple stock benefited from the GameStop
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:26.160]   rise as well, oddly enough, because people needed to sell some Apple stock. And the prices ended up
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:33.120]   going up because they had to cash in. So I don't know what that means, but there you go.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:40.000]   Services, that's the thing Apple really has put a lot of energy into over the last couple of years.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:47.280]   Look at that nice, smooth, linear. 680 million subscribers when you include all the App Store
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:55.280]   subscriptions. Wow. Well, that's a big advantage. That's billion iPhones and 1.7 billion devices.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:45:01.040]   Well, that's just that's just table stakes. That's what you get for. You get those users for free
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:06.640]   just by having them in your ecosystem. The difference is unfortunately that I break them down.
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:11.520]   But you make money. How many people are paying how many people are paying for a regular service?
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:18.400]   How many people are paying for extra data tiers on cloud storage and cloud services versus how
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:23.520]   many people are just getting whatever it is is required to get their iPhone actually running?
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:30.480]   I think that that graph, although it shows you really why services are so important to so many
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:36.800]   people is that nice, steady increase without any real drops. I mean, that's what powers
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:41.840]   subscription based services is the fact that it just doesn't vary very much.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:46.320]   And so as you build that up, you just have more and more income unless you do something really
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:50.880]   wrong. Well, credit to Apple because there is a churn issue with a lot of services. A lot of
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:56.480]   things I know I subscribed to stuff ago. That really wasn't worth it. And I think churn can be a
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:02.720]   problem. Clearly, Apple services people see value in it. So you just either there's not a lot of churn
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:08.960]   or the growth cover is hiding the churn. But I bet it's the it's the former that Apple just
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:15.040]   really provides value for dollar and people don't cancel Apple music. They don't cancel even Apple
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:20.120]   TV plus it's nothing nothing to cancel at this point. I even got a I guess I got a
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:24.000]   basically like Amazon Prime TV. You get it for free with the bundle. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:31.200]   what it's going to be. Let's see. This is year over year services revenue change double digit
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:37.680]   every single quarter every single quarter double digit growth. But this quarter 24% growth year
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:45.120]   over year wearable look at that graph. Whalable home accessory. So this includes this is like others.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:51.840]   This is the watch the AirPods the home pods. Apple TV, although I doubt it makes much of a
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:47:01.680]   difference there. Big, big, big year 13 billion in revenue, which is a 30% growth year over year.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:07.840]   Yeah, that's interesting because when the iPhone wasn't doing so well, Apple other businesses,
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:12.560]   the ones that they'd use the iPhone large part to build up sort of filled filled things in. So
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:16.560]   when we did have like there was softness in China, where there was a downturn or there was saturated
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:22.160]   for a quarter, those other businesses at one point even exceeded the iPhone in terms of collective
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:26.960]   revenue. But but now we're seeing what it looks like when the iPhone is firing again,
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:32.960]   and all these things are finally firing along with it. And it creates a benevolent cycle for Apple
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:39.040]   where they're all just driving income in each of the other's categories. And Apple made the Oprah
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:46.960]   honest by putting a billion phones in everybody's pockets. Y'all. That's one billion active iPhone
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:52.880]   users for the first time. That's active. That's not that's amazing. I mean, that's hitting the
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:57.360]   app store. That's that's why services are through the roof. And that's why they need to be because at
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:04.000]   some point growth slows with the hardware. People get the hardware. They're not going to buy new
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.360]   hardware every year. But services, that's just every month, the constant revenue.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.960]   It was still hungry though. Like on the call, he was like, you know, there's still a lot more
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:17.680]   people in the world don't have iPhones than have them. And we're making there's still six billion
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:22.800]   people left. I mean, there's still six. What are those six billion? We need to. Yeah, I want 100%.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:29.760]   That's another number that needs to be broken down a little bit. Because I think of it in terms
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:35.760]   of one in seven human beings, one in seven and a half people on the entire surface of the planet
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.480]   who have an active iPhone. And that's certainly not true. So,
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:44.480]   you sure that's not true? Well, you think some people have few. Have a few. Is that what's going on?
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:50.720]   Yeah. Most people you have 10 Leo. I have one iPhone. I don't have. Oh, wait a minute. I have
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:57.120]   you're right. I have an SE is activated to I have four on my desk. But you were outliers. You think
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:00.240]   I don't think most people have more than one phone. Do they?
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:08.320]   I'm trying to update my information. Last time I checked on good data on how many
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:14.400]   smart actual smartphones there are in play and the entire world. It was not that much greater than
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:21.040]   one billion that not not so much as to say, not so much as to cause the belief that one in three,
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:26.080]   one in four smartphones on the planet are our iPhones at this point, particularly given the
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:32.400]   differentiation of the market, particularly given the price sensitivity across in the market in the
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:37.920]   other place of the world. So, I'm not trying to be Debbie Downer here. I'm just saying that
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:42.880]   that's one of those numbers that wow, that is that is a legitimately objectively impressive number,
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:48.000]   but it kind of has to be picked apart to understand to before we determine what it actually means.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.800]   As we find up saying like every three months, Apple had one hell of a year, no matter how you
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:50:02.080]   slice the numbers, but let's just make sure we don't wind up getting new tattoos in more
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:07.680]   uncomfortable places because of how impressed we are. Yeah, no, you're right. Tim Cook said we
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:12.560]   would have done a lot better if the stores had been open, for instance. I'm still standing off
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:21.520]   my blackberry tattoos. Tim said he told Reuters in an interview,
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:27.760]   Apple has an install base of 1.65 billion devices of which one billion are iPhones. That means
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:38.080]   6.650 million other things, Macs and iPads and watches and stuff. China sales were up 57%.
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:42.720]   That's got to be good news for Apple. And Switcher is an especially up-grader
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:46.240]   is where a lot of people were waiting for the iPhone 12. It looks like to make that upgrade.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:51.920]   And 5G is noise in North America, but it's a big deal in China right now. At least the kind
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:55.520]   of 5G that's active in China right now is a big deal. It was table stakes to get
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:01.200]   those 5G iPhones into China. That's interesting. He said we have two of the three top selling
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:07.920]   smartphones in urban China, which of course, of course 5G is important. Upgraders in particular
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:12.320]   set an all-time record in China. Yeah, you have to give that 5G. That has to be fine.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.200]   Unless it's Dolby Vision video, I don't know. Maybe that's a big thing. I don't know.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:18.640]   Well, in North America, I think it's different. I think people are waiting on it. There's often
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:22.560]   people have had their phones for a few years. And there were big phones like the iPhone 6
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:27.600]   was a big phone. The iPhone 6, because that was literally the bigger phone. And those phones
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:32.000]   start to age out and people look for something new. The catches are eye to upgrade to. But I think
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.720]   he was also like, he said, India is still a market that Apple hasn't done well in any
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:41.520]   case specifics about how they're working to increase India. But there's still room left in all of
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:46.960]   this, which I find really interesting. It sounds like Apple broke out sales of things like Apple
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:54.400]   One, which I don't do they normally do that? According to Reuters, Apple won the Apple One
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:52:01.760]   bundle had 15.76 billion in revenue. That's good news. They do it when they want to like
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:05.280]   they'll tell you what any Apple users' subscribers is when it's a good number to tell you. Yeah.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:13.440]   iPad revenue 8.44 and the services building. Oh, I'm sorry. Services, I mistaken, I missed
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:18.960]   parsed the sentence. Services, which includes Apple One. Okay. Yeah. So the total services.
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:26.240]   Does Apple care and services? Yes. And so is a large deal of I think App Store is as well,
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.120]   which is a huge driver of service. That's probably the biggest one, isn't it? Yeah.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:38.400]   Big supply constraints for Max iPads and iPhone 12 Pro. Cook told Reuters that semiconductors
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:43.200]   are very tight right now. That's what a lot of people have said. That's why NVIDIA is having
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:47.920]   trouble. Like kudos to Apple for shipping as much as they did, given how little NVIDIA and AMD
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:52.560]   and others have been able to. Yeah. They managed to use that money to buy those process notes
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:59.440]   and they just clung on to them. We didn't share. Oh, I read that they own about 80% of the
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:05.040]   manufacturing capability for like the five nanometer process. So there's a lot of this is a lot of
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:10.960]   this Apple deserves even more kudos than possible. It's not it's not Oh, they had the exactly this
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:16.000]   like this part of the problems of the PC industry is suffering right now is because Apple decided
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.240]   that, Hey, this is for sale and we want it. So let's buy. Let's buy the ability to do this one
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:25.760]   technology. There's one technology that everybody absolutely needs for manufacturing. There are
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:33.840]   only like two or three or two like major foundries, I see foundries in the in the world. That's not
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:37.840]   something that's like generally understood. That's not like there are a million factories in which
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:43.280]   you can manufacture the CPUs you need using the the process that you need. It really comes down to
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:50.240]   like the one barbershop with two chairs and one big town. The day before Thanksgiving that
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:54.480]   that that thing is backed up to all the way down to the parking lot because there's not enough
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:59.040]   capacity in the world to manufacture the needs for the for every single sector of the technology
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:04.240]   industry. Yeah, there's two five nine meter processes. Taiwan semiconductors and Samsung's
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:09.040]   understanding is Samsung isn't quite as as good as TM this generation goes back and forth,
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:12.800]   but this generation is not quite as good. So everyone wants on to Taiwan semiconductors,
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:16.640]   but there's just not enough of it. So they can video and Qualcomm are using the Samsung one right
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:22.560]   now. Interesting. That's also why PlayStation and Xbox are hard to come by. We talked to Chris
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:26.320]   Capicello, the market chief marketing officer at Microsoft at the end of the year. And
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:31.040]   that was my first question is why don't you do what Apple did with the with the Xbox series
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:34.800]   X. So just tell me you guys can get in March. He said we would, but we can't. We don't know.
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:40.400]   Yeah. We have the Apple's wallet. We can't we can't we don't know if we're going to get the
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:45.360]   chips. So we don't want to tell people March and then find out we can't deliver. So that's
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:49.360]   and they're not using commodity parts either. They're using custom AMD so C's in both of those
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:54.160]   right gaming consoles. Right. I think one of the things is that that Apple does is able to take
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:59.360]   advantage of his margin because they have margin. They can pay premiums when they want to lock up
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.560]   right supply. Right. That's the value and then they can do that.
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:09.040]   This is if you want to understand how important that growth in China was, this graph is very
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:15.520]   telling. This is regional year over year growth. For those of you watching that red line is China,
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:22.000]   which was below zero for many of the last few quarters. In fact, it looks like almost all of them
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:30.320]   with the exception of Q1 2020 and Q3, but just barely over zero percent growth.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:37.040]   Now over 56 percent growth. I mean, just phenomenal. So that is that's really important to Apple
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:42.800]   because they've as you can see, it's fairly flat in Europe and America's that growth is hard to
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:50.880]   come by when everybody who wants an iPhone owns an iPhone. So big deal, 57 percent growth in China.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:57.040]   Other things we learned in the call Apple users set an all time record for FaceTime calls over
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:05.600]   the holidays. Tim Cook said, "The highest volume of FaceTime calls ever this Christmas, but he
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:12.480]   didn't say the number." So record number of device activations for the iPhone as well.
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:17.760]   And the quarter included the largest number of iPhone upgradeers it has ever seen.
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:28.880]   So very nice quarter. Anything else you observed or learned from the call or from analysts? Anybody?
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:33.360]   No mention of forward. Go ahead, Andy. Go ahead.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:39.920]   Just it's surprising there's no forward looking comments on. This has often been a place for Tim
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:46.320]   Cook. AR AR AR. Yeah, that's so even though there's a lot on the table they could possibly have
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:49.840]   gotten people excited about. I guess they just thought that we're getting people excited enough
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:55.120]   but with our sheer numbers. I think it's really interesting because he's been saying AR a lot
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:57:00.720]   and now he shuts up to me. That tells me they're getting close. That's like the alligator. The
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:04.560]   alligator or the crocodile comes up and it gets really close and then it goes underwater.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:08.320]   Yeah, you know, like here we go. Now is the time of the quiet. Maybe we may be we discovered
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:14.160]   like a canary clause that as long as I keep mentioning that we think that AR is really important,
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:18.400]   that means that we are not anywhere near close. If we if we stop talking about it means that we
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:22.160]   don't want to we don't want to crowd an actual announcement that we have planned for the next quarter.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:27.920]   Very interesting. Renee, I'm sorry. I cut you off. What are you going to say?
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:32.480]   I was just going to say that my favorite part is is watching the analysts try to get information
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:36.640]   out of them every question. Like how do we how do you think about future products? How do you
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:40.320]   how do you approach future products? What sort of future products are you showing interest in?
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:44.480]   We should mention not asking specifics. These calls journalists unlike
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:53.040]   Microsoft, are journalists allowed to speak in the in the analyst calls for Apple?
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:58.080]   Only financial analysts. Okay, so the same is Microsoft only a financial analyst. And it really
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:04.000]   bugs Mary Jofoli every quarter she talks about this. She says if I hear one more person say
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:09.760]   great quarter, Satya, and then launch into a can we have some color surrounding shipments.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:21.040]   Yeah, we're going to open the lines to Renee Richie on this call. What would you ask?
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.120]   What question would you what would you most like to know?
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:28.160]   Oh, I thought because immediately when you said that I flashed on when Elon Musk started taking
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:31.200]   questions from Twitter because he was so bored of the financial analyst. Remember that?
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:35.680]   Yes. It's called and just how off the rails that went and how quickly.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:41.200]   I don't know that I would have anything that's right.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:46.480]   I'd like to know. I like the numbers. I have a bunch of non financial questions. I'd love to
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:53.040]   ask them. That's right. Yeah, when you get to ask those at other other times. Apple TV plus
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:59:00.080]   reporting a viewership record with the new Justin Timberlake movie.
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:09.520]   Palmer record numbers launched on Friday. I've managed to avoid watching it. I just have no interest
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:15.120]   in it. But apparently I'm alone. Has anybody watched it? Palmer?
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:19.840]   Justin yet. Justin Timberlake. Yeah. I didn't want my DVD forever.
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:30.320]   Upcoming titles, the Snoopy show February 5th. For all mankind season two debuts February 19th.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:35.760]   There's a Billie Eilish special. The world's a little blurry on February 26th. Apparently,
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:39.840]   that's Billie goes to the eye doctor gets new glasses. I don't know what that's going to be
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:47.440]   about and Cherry. Great reality show. Yeah, Billy gets glasses and Cherry on March 12th,
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:54.320]   which is going to have a little theatrical release in earlier and then will appear on Apple.
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:58.880]   I don't know what Cherry is. Apple TV plus they're trying. They're really trying to add stuff
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:04.720]   to Apple TV plus. I've heard that their nature shows are the most compelling thing.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:08.160]   Tiny world is great, isn't it? Tiny world is amazing. And then they have the At Night
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:14.320]   series, which isn't as good as Tiny World, but it's still pretty impressive. But the tiny world
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:18.240]   is just you'll have to forgive me because I watch Tiny World and I think yeah, the guys who did
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:24.320]   Planet Earth said, can we do? Can we not travel this time? And can we just can we just get on the
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:28.640]   ground and shoot some bugs, please? It's so hard. Like the BBC.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.600]   A someone who shot who's done a lot of stuff around the world. What they did,
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:40.320]   it's almost impossible. Like what they created in Tiny World is almost impossible.
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:44.080]   How are they shooting that you think? A lot of time.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:48.000]   So when you- All of those nature shows, you just know there's guys out there
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.880]   for days on end in a little deer break. I read that somewhere that the
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:59.360]   was nine years of footage. Like it's- What?
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:04.480]   They've been cutting, they sold it to Apple, but it was nine years of shooting for some of those
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:08.960]   pieces. And you just end up spending months and months and months to get that perfect shot.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:13.760]   But some of the stuff is just- And again, they don't make any claims that I mean,
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:17.360]   generally, wildlife photography is not the most authentic thing in the world.
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:24.000]   Like just like reality TV. But they don't talk about how much is manufactured and how much is
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.600]   CG and how much? Because I'm pretty sure like there's a shot of the one of the owls that I was
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:30.640]   like, I don't think that's- Do you think they CG that stuff?
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:36.960]   I think some of it might be. I think it's not it might be. But I think that overall, it's not.
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:42.720]   But I think that the- You're waiting for a lot of it to happen. But there's some shots that you're
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:46.000]   just like- It's never going to get that. Well, do you think about the ones where the little bugs
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.200]   are inside the little seed? Well, how did they get the camera inside the little seed?
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.560]   Well, I was hoping you were going to tell me. So you think that's fake?
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:58.000]   The little lens. Yeah, yeah. They're popping lenses in there. So they show you the exterior of
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.400]   it closed, but you can't shoot it that way. It's like out in Brown, who's got- You know,
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:05.760]   he opens up the refrigerator. That's not a real refrigerator because it's got a camera in the back.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:10.560]   You know, they got a hole in the back of the camera operator. You know, and so, so it's the same thing.
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:15.840]   I don't like it. I don't let it know. That's so good, though. I mean, it's just this luscious,
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:19.840]   you know, you just wish that all educational material was shot like tiny world, that's all.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:27.760]   Yeah, just amazing. Yeah. Let's see if there's any other little tidbits from this Reuters interview,
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:36.720]   I can dig out. 620 million paying subscribers. That includes, of course, people subscribing to
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:43.520]   stuff on the App Store, but that's a lot. You said that earlier. That's their goal was to have 600
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:49.520]   million by the end of 2020. So they exceeded their goal. We talked about supply constraints,
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:56.880]   talked about China. Oh, Cook said this is the last sentence of the Reuters article.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:03.680]   Cook said, short supplies of the AirPods Max could continue into the company's current fiscal
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:17.680]   second quarter. So Apple's AirPods Max $550 wireless over the ear headphones. Still months
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:21.520]   of delay, right? You have to wait. What is the current if I ordered it today?
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:26.960]   Should I? I think it depends on the color still, but they and also like a lot of outlets
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:33.120]   seem to be getting them in store arbitrarily. So if you look carefully, you can find them popping
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:40.000]   up at Apple stores or Best Buy or Verizon, but some in at some point. Let me just, what would be
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:46.960]   the easiest to get like gray, right? Silver? What do people want?
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:51.120]   Pink was hard. Blue was hard. Yeah, pink and blue and green are going to always be hard.
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.400]   Base gray was the easiest to get. Okay, let's see. And I don't want any engraving
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:59.760]   because that's going to take more time. The little moji skull maybe.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:08.000]   March 3rd. March 3rd. So that's only a month.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.440]   We don't know how many they're making. So that's always a you always have to factor that into
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.040]   these stories. It's like if you sold twice as much of something and you only made one last year
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:18.720]   and you made two this year, that's very different. This may be one that's hit by chip shortages
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:24.080]   because maybe they didn't think ahead to order a lot of the whatever, you know, W1 chip or something.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:29.520]   I think the rumor is that they made changes to it very late in a cycle. And so they couldn't
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.200]   build up a stockpile ready for launch like they do with some products.
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:38.160]   There you go. Remember that this was there's an argument to me made that this was delayed a
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:44.240]   couple of different times just by basis of how early the the the the support materials for the
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:49.760]   stuff was out in the air before the actual hardware actually came. So this was this was not an easy
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:56.640]   birth. You can now watch the 12 minute video of Tim Cook, his keynote on privacy.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:11.520]   This is the CPCD conference on privacy. And by the way, Tim corner office just want to say
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:14.880]   is that as you get a corner office in a round building.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:21.920]   That is good point. Maybe they just make the the Venetian blinds look like he's in a corner
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:27.440]   office. I bet they do. That's a good point. His office must be in the in the in the
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:30.400]   can you imagine that phone call Johnny all I asked for was a corner office.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:38.160]   You want to tell me anything Johnny. What's this? Is this the new Apple HomePod mini there?
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:44.640]   He's got their squished the new squished one. What is that? It's the it's the it's the Korean
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:49.440]   hand thrown pottery version of exactly. You know there were a lot of meetings about that.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:56.320]   Oh, of course, of course, just a set. Can you move the plant three millimeters to the left?
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:01.840]   I'm seeing two leaves. I'd like to see three. You notice, unlike the Senate hearings where he
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:07.040]   dressed to blend completely into the background, he is actually wearing a splash of color. Yeah,
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:11.200]   only my only complaint was the audio was really it sounded like they got the accidently got the
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:15.920]   internal mic from the knowledge from the computer on this fitting occasion. Oh, yeah, that's not good.
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:22.480]   Privacy does not good. A little more than a room tone. Alex and people kept complaining during the
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:28.160]   live stream the entire time they need to hire. Oh, nine Oh media come in there. Give them a lav mic.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:35.840]   Do something in the room tone. It's a it's a really hard room and you just I would have, you know,
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:39.120]   I was kind of surprised because I at first I thought maybe it was the whole conference,
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.320]   but I skipped through the rest of it and everybody else's audio was fine.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:47.120]   Well, clearly what they should have done is put him in the anechoic chamber and then green screen.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:50.960]   The one of the lines. Couldn't they have given them the AirPods Max?
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:53.280]   When that assault everything I said, I've been wearing a nice pair of
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.240]   yeah, why is AirPods Max? Why is a lot of fluff up is due.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:07.440]   So among other things, Tim took this opportunity to throw a little shade on a little. You roasted
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:14.640]   them. This was a pole in the clouds. If a business says Mr. Cook, I wish I you know what, if I had
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:20.240]   if I were better at this at my job, I would have already had the video clip of him saying this.
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.160]   Picked out so I could let him say it, but I did. Oh, if you go to my YouTube channel,
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:29.280]   I just have these I just have the 10 10 best seconds of it. Oh, in one in one video.
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:32.080]   Thank you, Renee Ritchie for doing the work I should have done.
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:36.400]   I did slap some mural on it. So it wasn't quite all as Tim, but it's his words.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.800]   All right. Well, we don't care about that. Let's see where we're.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:42.240]   You do so many videos. I can't.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.720]   What's the fire on the right on the right hand side with Facebook?
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.080]   With Facebook on fire.
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:51.200]   To the innovations that make our lives better, more fulfilled and more human,
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:57.280]   or will it belong to those tools that prize our attention to the exclusion of everything else,
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:02.400]   compounding our fears and aggregating extremism to serve ever more
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:05.760]   invasively targeted ads over all other ambitions?
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:10.000]   Who does that, Tim? Who's doing that? Who's doing that?
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.760]   Mark Facebook. Mark Facebook.
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:18.240]   By the way, can I ask you just a technical question? Why did you put him in portrait video?
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:19.680]   Why did you put him in vertical video?
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:23.120]   So YouTube is pushing this new thing called shorts because they're trying desperately to
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:26.560]   compete with TikTok. So if you do a video under a minute, that's vertical.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:31.040]   Yeah, it has the word shorts in it, then it gets pushed through YouTube's short system.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.240]   Let's hear it again one more time.
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:37.520]   The future belong to the innovations that make our lives better, more fulfilled and more human.
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:43.600]   Apple or will it belong to those tools that prize our attention to the exclusion of everything else,
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:49.040]   Facebook and Google, compounding our fears and aggregating extremism to serve ever more
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:52.400]   invasively targeted ads over all other ambitions?
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.040]   Did I mention Facebook and Google Facebook and Google?
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:02.320]   Facebook and Google. He says, if a business is built on misleading users on data exploitation,
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:08.000]   on choices that are no choices at all, it does not deserve our praise, it deserves reform.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.720]   Too many are still asking the question, how much can we get away with when they should be
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.560]   asking what are the consequences? Wow.
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:21.840]   The first five minutes particularly were very, very direct about the
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:30.000]   Apple's particular support of the GDPR and the EU. And really, it really doesn't seem as though
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:36.240]   they're intending to champion further legislation worldwide. It makes me wonder how many
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:44.000]   different people in Congress right now are trying to line him up as a friend to testify on behalf of
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:54.160]   any sort of future legislation to modify Section 230 or in any other way, make sure that
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:59.040]   services, online services have better accountability and more responsibility or have limits to
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:06.720]   their growth. It does, as always, I believe that this is very, very sincere and he's making
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:11.040]   points that are very, very important that are not a lot of people's minds.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:17.280]   However, he's very, very brave when he's talking about how angry he is with an industry that Apple
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:22.960]   has absolutely no part of is making absolutely no money. And you talk about right to repair,
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:28.160]   oh, suddenly there's like, well, over a heavy handed regulation is an athema, the development
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:36.320]   of fine technology. But this was, this was such a big, on that exact same day, they also released
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:42.240]   like a white paper. It's actually more like a book, like a kid's book called A Day in the Life of Your
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:50.080]   Data. This is a subtitle, A Father Daughter Day at the fair at the playground, where he after a very
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:56.240]   after juicy Steve Jobs quote, he tells a story about John planning a day at the park with his
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.480]   daughter and everything that when he checks the weather, he's being tracked. And when he buys
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:06.080]   an ice cream with his credit card, he's being tracked. And yeah, so it's this is a full court
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:12.480]   press. This is not just, this is not just Apple suddenly being feelings though, Facebook has
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:18.720]   suddenly crossed the line with their, with their attempts to maybe file antitrust, a
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:24.000]   sub-linted lawsuit against the company. This is a long campaign that they are planning out.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.920]   So this is, well, what I'm going to get this is, if you're going to the mattresses on this one,
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:34.800]   let's just say. I do think that Apple would have quietly just required people to approve that
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:38.480]   Facebook's going to chase them all over the internet. And Apple wouldn't have said anything
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:43.520]   more if Facebook hadn't picked such a fight. You know, I think Apple was happy to just keep on
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:47.680]   tightening the screws and doing it quietly and doing what they're doing. And the problem is,
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:51.360]   is that Facebook, you know, it's an existential threat. And so they're, of course, reacting,
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:55.600]   but their reaction means that Apple has to defend itself and Apple has the high ground.
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.200]   I mean, nobody wants to get those ads. So the problem, you know, one's
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:05.040]   be tracked. And no one cares about the performance of their ads, you know, that came out here. So,
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:10.480]   so the issue is, is that Facebook is in a, in a disadvantaged position, and they've tried to,
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:14.800]   to move on that disadvantaged position. Apple's in an advantage position, and now it's going to
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:19.600]   press down, you know, and I don't think that I think Facebook's smart because they're saying,
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:24.640]   it's not us. It's not, don't think about it as damaging us. Think about all the small businesses
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:29.360]   who buy ads on Facebook. That's who small businesses. That's who's really suffering. It's the little
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:34.640]   guy. Now, I will say, you know, something, this came up in our office hours this morning,
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:38.640]   someone asked like, where should you advertise? You know, ask me, like, and Facebook. I'm not saying,
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:43.600]   I was like Facebook. I mean, like that. There, I don't even understand how any other ad network
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:49.280]   survives. I know, I know enough, I know enough about how it works, that, that it is, it's
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:54.800]   stunning. It's like the end of the sun. I know. And so, and so, and so, so, so, the thing is,
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:13:00.480]   is that it, um, actually, you know what it's doing? Alex, is it's making my business podcasting,
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:06.720]   and every other business seek the same kind of information. So that's why Spotify is buying a
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:12.080]   podcast, why Amazon's buying a podcast? Because if you use the Spotify app, they can provide the
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:16.640]   same kind of information that Facebook does. So what Facebook is in effect doing by being so good
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:21.120]   at this is forcing everybody else who wants to sell ads to try to do the same thing, to try to,
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.760]   you know, aggregate the information. Like the difference though, like the difference that they
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:27.760]   is that Facebook is willing to cross a line that Apple isn't, and I don't think even Google is,
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:33.120]   where there have been business opportunities in the past, where Apple has said we're not,
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.240]   we don't want to make this kind of money. And even Google has said, and I'm not saying like,
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.800]   even Google, but Google, whose business is predicated on all of this sort of data harvesting,
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:45.200]   is that we don't want to make that kind of money. And even in the analytics business,
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:49.360]   there are companies that get really detailed analytics that do not care at all who it belongs
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:53.040]   to. They want to know the what, how many people blah, blah, blah, but they don't care about
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:58.160]   knowing any individual person. And at every one of these instances, it is documented that even when
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:03.120]   other executives pled with them saying, we do not need to do this, it'll only cost us a little bit
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:09.280]   less money not to do it. The direction from Mark Zuckerberg at all was no do it, do it more,
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:13.840]   be even more invasive, keep going, keep going. And I think that's the point where it trips into
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:20.640]   egregiousness for some people, many people. Even in specific response to Apple's new requirements
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:27.280]   for app disclosure and nutrition labels, so to speak, Google's response has apparently been,
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.840]   we feel as though we can achieve what we need to achieve within this framework,
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:36.480]   both by a book by combination of accepting that this is going to affect everybody,
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:41.440]   not just us, but and also we are Google, we have ways, or if there's something we absolutely need,
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:48.880]   there's a way around it that will not violate Apple's terms. It is emblematic of the way that
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:55.600]   Facebook operates that when you have one person who is very, very much in charge of everything,
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:15:01.600]   the mood swings of one person can swing the entire ship very, very fast. So Facebook run by
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:08.240]   Zuckerberg is capable of doing what could be self destructive things that alphabet led by
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:13.440]   Sundar Pichai definitely would not be doing. Yeah, Google, I think that Google also is figured out,
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:18.560]   I think technologically a way to get all of the information without using Apple's ID for
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:22.000]   advertising. They also make compelling offers or Facebook doesn't want to offer us anything.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.080]   Google's like, give us your photos, we'll give you a way better photo app and Facebook's like,
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:29.360]   we're just going to take it, we don't want to ask that. Why you get Facebook,
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:34.000]   for what it's worth, you get Facebook. Google doesn't have a social network. I might be,
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:38.720]   go ahead. I was going to say Google doesn't have a social network where there's a handoff from the
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:46.400]   phone to the rest of the world. Google is the rest of the world. If Google+ had become a thing and
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:51.280]   it was on the phone and they were doing that handoff, that'd be a problem. For Facebook,
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:55.920]   it's much different because you click on something and then it takes you to the web or you go out of
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:01.920]   that and they need to know where you went when you did that. With Google, you're in their space,
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:08.000]   you're in their space all the time. Those things are all tied together so they can see the performance.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.480]   It's not just being able to identify who you are, it's being able to see the performance of the ad.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:17.760]   And so when you click on a Google ad, it's paying attention to when you went, how long you went to
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:24.320]   that website, how many deep clicks did you make, did you do a purchase? All of those things are in
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:30.000]   that data that Google has. They don't want to bring attention to it. This is the problem that
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.120]   Facebook is willing to fight. The problem is the more they talk, the worse it gets. The more
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:41.120]   Facebook talks about why you should do it, the more everyone goes, "I don't want to go there."
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:48.160]   And so the problem is Google has much more, I think, they're smarter about it in the sense that
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:53.760]   they don't want people thinking about how deep they go. And so they're not going to talk about it.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:57.600]   They're like, "We'll figure it out on the back end because they don't want to bring to light
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:03.760]   the incredibly invasive amount of data that they're pulling in." And it makes our searches better.
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:08.960]   And a lot of things work a little bit more conveniently. And it does do that. So there is a
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.120]   benefit to that. And small businesses absolutely benefit from Facebook because it means that you're
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:17.520]   spending a lot less money to get to the people. That's very efficient.
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:26.640]   When you talk to advertisers, they talk about the multipliers. What's the multiplier? How many
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:30.000]   dollars in to how many dollars out? And they know that. They know that information.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:30.640]   Absolutely.
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:37.120]   And so the thing is is that the multipliers are incredible. And so the thing is is that,
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:40.960]   but for small businesses, they're trying to get the word out that you need that advertising.
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:47.840]   It's so much more effective than a billboard or a classified ad or a mailing with the USPS.
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:52.880]   All of those things are just small potatoes compared to how much you can target it.
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:18:00.720]   When I looked at doing advertising in the past for Pixelcore, I looked at that. And when I saw
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:06.800]   the targeting, it was just stunning. Just stunning what I could spend and how many people I could reach.
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:12.720]   And so I think that people underestimate that. But I still think that the more Facebook
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:17.440]   shouldn't talk about it. They should figure out a solution because again, the more they talk about
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:22.240]   this process, the more gooey it sounds. It's like someone trying to dig their way out of something,
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:25.120]   you're like, put down the shovel. Just put it down. Like, you know,
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:30.480]   just to be fair, though. Facebook is the leader in this and very good at it. But ad tracking
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:39.200]   is becoming more and more pervasive. And, you know, there's huge pressure on us as a podcaster to do
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:44.640]   ad tracking. This is going to be, this is what advertisers, and, you know, by the way, there's
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:53.200]   the jury still out on how effective targeted ads are and stuff. I agree with you that they're
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:57.920]   efficient, Alex. And certainly you don't want to spend one ad dollar advertising to somebody who's
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:04.960]   not in the market for your product. So that's where Facebook really wins. But nevertheless,
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:12.080]   ad tracking, buying Google ads, there are some issues. And if we're that perfect,
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:20.080]   I think I would have, I think people would be less willing to cast it to the wind.
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:27.120]   But as Kerry Corey Doctorow points out right now, it's the largest consumer boycott in the history
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:31.680]   of the world is the use of ad blockers and tracker blockers, which is because, I don't know what
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:36.560]   the percentage is, but people are starting to really fight back on this.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:40.720]   It's, I'm talking about the ones that are the super effective are the search ads,
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:44.720]   like just those little text things at the top of your search, right? Incredibly powerful,
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:51.360]   but increasingly you're only going to get the people who say, okay, who don't use ad blockers,
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:56.640]   who don't use track blockers, who use family. If you're using Facebook, you're saying, okay,
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:00.800]   by the way, doesn't matter what Apple does, you know, it doesn't matter what you turn off.
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:04.560]   If you open the Facebook app, you're saying, yeah, here's everything, right?
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.680]   So,
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:09.680]   because Apple is only blocking third party. Yeah, I think this this tracker only stops
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:13.680]   third party doesn't stop first party at all. Right. If you open the app, if you're using
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:18.160]   Instagram, what's app or Facebook, you're already given Facebook everything. So, it doesn't matter
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:26.080]   if they app tracking transparency. What is a TT app tracking transparency kick in, Renee? Is
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:32.480]   there a date that Apple has given? Yeah, it's in the beta that just came out. And when that
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:36.880]   goes into the fees, it'll be activated. Okay. Yeah, it'll be activated. Okay. And then what that
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:40.720]   does, because people keep getting confused by this, I think, and Facebook is not being truthful
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:44.880]   about how it works, but it only blocks the third party stuff. So, if you're at Facebook,
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:49.520]   if you're in the Facebook app and you're in a knitting club group, they can serve you all the
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:53.760]   ads they want on knitting. But if you leave that and you go to Lego and then you go to Jeep,
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:57.680]   and you come back to Facebook, they're not allowed serving you ads based on Lego or Jeep,
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:03.520]   unless you've agreed to let them monitor your web activity. And they're saying that Apple has a
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:08.560]   switch that's different than all of this, but that switch that Apple has, Apple doesn't do any
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:12.640]   third party tracking, and that switch that Apple has turns off first party tracking,
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:17.440]   which all that means that Apple will no longer recommend similar apps to you when you're in the
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:21.680]   app store. Even when you're in the app store, they will no longer recommend similar apps to you.
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:27.040]   And everybody's going to say, and I guess it's true, Apple's only doing this because their own
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:32.800]   ad network never took off and they killed I ads. They wanted to do it, but they couldn't do it.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:38.320]   So Apple's making a virtue out of a necessity. They've realized the value of saying, hey, we are
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:46.080]   privacy first. I bet you it sells a lot of iPhones. Here's Alex, here's that PDF you're talking about.
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:52.640]   A day in the life of your data, a father, daughter, day at the playground. This is like a, like a
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:59.520]   children's book. It does open with the St. that juicy Steve Jobs quote that I think is almost like
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:04.080]   an olive branch to companies like Google saying where Steve is saying, hey, there's some companies
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:08.320]   collect data. Some companies do not. The ones that don't that offer something in exchange for the
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:12.960]   data have to just explain what they're doing with this stuff, which is not the bomb throwing
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:16.880]   rhetoric that is probably going to be coming up the next two months. Yeah. I believe people are
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:21.520]   smart. Some people want to share more data than other people do. Jobs said, this is at all things
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:26.640]   digital conference 10 years ago. Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:30.560]   that they get tired of you asking them. Let them know precisely what you're going to do with your
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:37.840]   data. Yeah, I think that's fair. Yeah. You know, who's the same dad, Alex? Who are
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:44.320]   the fact that they made it a PDF seems odd to me? Who are they trying to say?
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:48.320]   So you can print it. You can share it. You don't have to go back to a website. I mean,
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:52.720]   it's take it to your mother's group meetings so that everybody knows your congressman.
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:58.160]   Again, this is not a fight that Facebook wants to have. I know they want to have it. This is not
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:03.600]   a fight they should have because they're not going to win. This is going to keep on making them look
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:07.920]   bad and it keeps on building up apples because Apple has built their entire business model
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:14.800]   around privacy and just going to keep on tightening it. And their entire business model is built
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:20.000]   around this. And so I think that and the problem is that Android can't do that. And that's why
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.880]   Apple can keep on doing that is because Android depends on all the advertising. They depend on
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:29.840]   all those things. And so there's not they don't have a real competition for privacy. And no one
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:36.480]   else is really going down this path. And so as a result, it's really a differentiator for Apple.
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:41.760]   And they're going to keep on pounding on it. But they're doing it now because they're
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:48.160]   responding to Facebook. And I just think that this is just insane. Facebook is just insane to go
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:53.120]   down this path. Like it's pretty much guaranteed. Google will do something similar on Android
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:56.720]   because they have to. So they'll offer some point earlier though.
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:00.800]   Dear point earlier though, there is like Apple can do this because they don't make money off of
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:06.320]   off of this kind of stuff. But a conversely Google and Facebook have been hugely profitable for
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:11.280]   years because they could do things Apple couldn't by basing everything by subsidizing hardware
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:15.600]   software services off the revenue they get from serving ads and from doing data
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:21.520]   data harvesting and data exploitation. And for people, not everybody is a financial millionaire,
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:26.320]   but everybody is a data millionaire. Everybody has this pretty much the same amount of data that
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:31.760]   is so extremely valuable to these companies. And consumers have gotten huge bargains on discount
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:37.360]   Nexus devices and free social networking boards and email services and all of these things.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:41.840]   No longer Google's data is much anymore, but we can get to that. But just in general,
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:45.760]   so many problems are so much less money. And it's just now talking about the cost of these
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:50.640]   different services. I think that we do need to like when you as someone who's bought
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:57.360]   streaming services from big companies like Akamai or something, I'm very clear of how much a simple
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:03.120]   stream would cost in retail. It's like what you're doing right here. You're streaming out to,
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:10.080]   let's say, YouTube and other platforms, try buying that from Akamai with a number of viewers and
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:16.880]   Twitch wouldn't be able to stream anymore. It wouldn't add up. And so we do, I think that making it,
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:21.040]   when they talk about the benefits people get, benefiting small businesses, one thing, but people
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:25.120]   having what they have on Facebook, I understand, we can talk ethically about whether they should do
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:30.160]   it or not. But I do think that people are benefiting a great deal from the tradeoff,
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:33.200]   it's just that they're not consciously betting on it. And I think that Facebook has to
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:38.640]   have them consciously say, I'll give you the data because I appreciate the receipt. And Apple's
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:42.400]   not cutting them off. They're just saying, hey, you should consciously just say, I'm willing to
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.680]   give you that because of that. And maybe Facebook says, if you turn that off, I'm not going to let
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:50.640]   you stream anymore. They can make all these rules about, we'll just take away all your
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:55.840]   apps. I guarantee you what Facebook's waiting to see is how many people say, no, they're worried
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:59.120]   about it. But I think they're also waiting to see it. By the way, I love your new glasses, Alex.
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:04.560]   Those are really cute. Yeah. I'm sorry. Maybe 80% is enough. Maybe they don't need to know our
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:08.400]   individual, like there's a level of granularity that they don't need. And they could make 80 or
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:13.760]   90% of the money by being just 10% less invested. That's my contention. What Google's going to do
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:19.200]   is say, oh, well, don't worry. We turn that off because they have so many better ways of tracking
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:22.880]   you with super cookies and other tracking technology. They've been developing years. Same
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:27.920]   IP as Google search from yesterday. Thanks, Leo. Yeah, exactly. And I apologize. Andy,
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:32.800]   I'll give you credit for that PDF. I gave it to Alex. That was a good find. No worries.
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:40.400]   Real quickly, Jeffrey Fowler at the Washington Post went through a bunch of apples, privacy,
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:48.160]   nutrition labels. He got a third party to analyze them and found that there's a lot of lies.
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:55.440]   A lot of lies he gave as an example, satisfying slime, which, you know, who doesn't want that app.
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:05.040]   It's actually aimed at kids. He said, oh, maybe it's not. It's a de-stressing app. So it's for all of us.
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:14.080]   It gets the app store's highest label for privacy. But in fact, it's collecting a ton of information.
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:20.400]   So I presume Apple is going to do something to clean this up. The satisfying slime simulator,
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:28.320]   which claims it gathers no information, was sharing a way to identify my iPhone and other device
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:33.440]   properties with Facebook, Google, and a service called Game Analytics. It was sending Unity,
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:38.480]   the software that was used to make it, not only my phone's ID, but my battery level,
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:45.040]   free storage space, general location, and even volume maker. He contacted the satisfying slime
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:49.840]   simulator. Never heard back. My guess is a small guy who probably didn't even know that he was
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:54.480]   agreeing to Unity's data collection. But there's a lot of these.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:28:03.600]   It is an honor system-based system. It's not as though they're running a lint against it to make
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:11.120]   sure that to check for access to different privacy elements, it is a voluntary system. The one bit of
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:16.160]   meat on that bone is that they are supposed to give an honest appraisal. And if they don't,
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:21.680]   that gives Apple the muscle to somebody. Guess what? You're not on our store anymore. Have fun.
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:25.280]   Maybe they should spot check or something. And one of the things is that
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:30.960]   with many of these things to avoid the appearance, especially with all the antitrust and everything
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:35.760]   else, is you start something and then you give it some time to sink in. You say it's going to be
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:42.720]   voluntary and then you just slowly start tightening that process. And it means that people were
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:50.240]   out doing it for a while and they have time to sort that out. So I think this is probably Apple's
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:55.360]   first, like, "Hey, we're doing this." And then over the next couple of years, you'll just see them
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:02.320]   slowly pull that corral in and tighten the solution where it becomes much more aggressive.
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:05.920]   The first thing, introduce it. And then you can start making this.
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:09.680]   Take a little break. I want to take a little break and we'll come back. We have lots more to
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:16.080]   talk about. We are an hour and 40 to the show. We did go to space for a while.
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:21.920]   We went to space. That took a little time. Andy and Aco Renee Ritchie, and it's great to have
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:27.040]   Alex Lindsay joining the panel, the founder of Mac Break. So we've got to give him a little bit
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:32.160]   of credit. And you know, that seat now vacated by Lori Gill because she could have a good job.
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:36.480]   She did two things. She took a job with the fruit company and got married. So she had no time for
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:41.120]   us. It's always available to you, Alex, any time you want. I'm hoping to come back as often as
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:48.000]   possible. I love it. Yeah. You've probably all seen the ads. I see them all the time.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:53.120]   First by the founder, then by another guy, "Gobby, I use Gobby. You could find, save money on insurance
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:57.440]   with Gobby." And I've seen those ads over and over again. And then I use it and I went, "Oh, wow,
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:03.040]   this thing is amazing. I want to tell you about our advertisers. Gobby Insurance, G-A-B-I.
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:11.440]   If you ever have done this, you know how hard it is. If you've ever shopped your car insurance
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:17.600]   or your home insurance, try to find, gone to insurer after insurer and tried to find the best
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:23.760]   price. It is, they don't make it easy. They don't want to make it easy. It is difficult to do.
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:30.320]   Gobby was created by tech people who said, "You know what? We can pressure these companies into
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:37.920]   doing APIs. We can write a program that will do this work for you." They told me, "The average
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:42.880]   online quote takes 1,100 keystrokes." And you have to do that for each company if you're doing that
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:51.200]   by hand. So that's 1,100 keystrokes per company because then Scobby is going to go out and compare
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:56.000]   your current coverage with 40 of the top insurance providers, the big boys, progressive nationwide
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:02.880]   travelers. Just multiply that 40 times 1,100 keystrokes. That's how many keystrokes Gobby is saving you.
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:08.880]   It's a very simple process. You put the app on your phone, you answer a few simple questions,
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:14.240]   and they're going to go out and they're going to do the research automatically for you using the
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:21.760]   API and give you quotes. They're going to tell you how much they can save you. Now, what I love
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:27.200]   is they're very honest. So I shopped both my car and home insurance. And they said,
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:33.760]   after I gave them some basic information, you got a great deal. We can't beat it. They literally
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:38.640]   said, "You got the best deal." So congratulations. On the home insurance, it was a little different.
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:48.320]   They saved me $2,800 a year on home insurance. I was blown away. I was-- and this really worked
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:54.560]   and it really happened. It's very simple. So they said, "Okay, well, who are you getting
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:58.560]   insurance from for car?" I won't name names. I want to shame anybody, but who are you getting
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:04.960]   it for car and who are you getting it for home? So you link your account in. So that way, they get
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:09.200]   the information from the current insurer. And then within a few minutes, you're going to get quotes
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:14.080]   for the exact same coverage. That's what I did. If you want to move forward with one of the quotes,
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:17.200]   the insurance company you selected, and they'll show you all the different ones. They'll show
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:21.920]   you the ratings too, by the way. I found for our home insurance company that has a better rating
[01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:27.520]   than our current insurer. Then-- now, I should warn you, and I want to be really upfront about this.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:31.600]   The next step is you say, "Yeah, I'd like to find out more about that." No point are you committed at
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:36.240]   this point. So yeah, I'd like to find out more about that. Then they actually go to the insurer,
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:39.680]   and there's a-- you probably will have additional questions because the insurer's insurance
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:43.440]   company's underwriter now gets involved. And so they're going to review the details.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:48.240]   And there may be adjustments based on info that wasn't shared prior because otherwise,
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:54.160]   Gabby would have to ask you a lot more questions. Unfortunately, not all of the insurance companies
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:58.960]   in the world are as automated as you and I would like. So occasionally, you'll need to speak with
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:05.600]   a Gabby Register insurance agent who will-- because they require this, these various insurers,
[01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:09.680]   some of them require it, who will review the details and confirm the final price.
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:14.800]   So I just want-- I want you to know upfront, it's very fast to get that initial quote,
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:18.400]   and then there may be additional steps. You're still not committed, by the way.
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:22.880]   Go through that whole process, and only if you're satisfied that you're getting a better deal,
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:29.520]   then you can go through with it. But I can't tell you how much time this kind of blew me away.
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:34.320]   Our insurance company this year raised our rates-- at least it told me I can't rate. It was like
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:40.000]   $7,000. It was like our home insurance. And Lisa said, "We got to shop this." And I said, "Yeah,
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:45.280]   good luck. Have fun." I didn't want to do it because it's a lot of work. It's a lot of phone calls,
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:49.920]   in many cases. It's a lot of typing in other cases. If they do have a website that you can do this with,
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:57.040]   Gabby, it was literally a couple of minutes. They got back to me. We looked at the various quotes,
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:00.320]   we said, "Yeah, that's a really good one from a company we know and trust.
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:07.920]   $2,800 they saved us." I was blown away. And I love it that they-- if they can't find savings,
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:11.360]   they'll let you know because on the car they said, "Yeah, that's-- you're getting a good deal."
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:17.680]   That actually made me feel good. Gabby customers, on average, saved $961 a year.
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:24.720]   That's, on average, we're about three times that. I tell you what, it's incredible. They--
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:30.960]   and very privacy focused, they do not sell your info. No robo calls, no spam.
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:38.320]   They have a very fast, very efficient online tech support. The chat is great.
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:44.320]   Sometimes you come in the chat on some of these sites and it takes a long time. They respond in
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:50.800]   seconds. We were able to get all the information we needed. Look, the chances are, you're overpaying
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:55.840]   on car insurance or home insurance. In fact, chances are, you know that. And just like me,
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:35:00.080]   didn't want to go to the trouble of finding a better deal. You got it. Oh, it's yourself. Download
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:06.720]   Gabby, G-A-B-I. No obligation, free to check. They don't ask a lot of information. They protect your
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:13.040]   privacy. gab.com/macbreak. I want to actually give you the address so that they know you saw it here.
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:22.800]   gab.com/macbreak. I, you know, all I can say is, I'm really-- I'd seen those ads a bunch of times
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:27.920]   on TV and I registered it, but I didn't think about it. At some point, when Lisa said they went up by
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:36.560]   7,000, I said, "All right, quick. I got Gabby and amazing gab.com/macbreak." It's well worth it.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:41.520]   And you know what? No cost, no obligation. Your privacy is protected. I think it's what you want
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:50.000]   to do. On we go with the show. I thought that privacy conversation was great. In fact, I won't
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.760]   move us on. If there's anything else, Alex, was there anything else you wanted to add
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:59.120]   to the story before we move on? I just want to add that I think my camera's better.
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:06.160]   Oh my God. What did you do? I restarted the Skype camera. You scrubbed. I just turned it off.
[01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:12.480]   You scrubbed the Vaseline off the lens. I did. I literally turned it off while you were
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:16.320]   talking or something. We were watching the space thing. I turned it off. I turned it back on.
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:18.880]   Here we go. That's when I noticed how nice your glasses are.
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:24.640]   Right? Right? Because you would see them before. They were wearing glasses. So you
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:29.200]   effectively rebooted the camera. What kind of camera is it? No, no, I rebooted Skype. I just
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:34.160]   literally just turned the camera off on Skype. Oh. You know, I just muted the camera in Skype.
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:38.800]   And then I un- Skype muted it. And then it was fun. Most of our shows should be titled. Oh,
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:45.760]   Skype. Oh my gosh. You know, the funny thing is, is the only thing I use it Skype for now,
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:49.680]   is that you know? Are you zoom on all the stuff you do? We use a lot of different. I mean,
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:54.080]   I'm on a lot of different meetings. What's your favorite? So zoom. I mean, zoom's got the best
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:59.040]   tools and the best. It's actually the best quality at this point. Well, we have a 1080p account.
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:05.440]   So it's a good. Could we use zoom to do what we do now like this with a full screen?
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:12.400]   You could. We do it. We do what you do with up to 14 computers where we have a point to point
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:17.120]   with every computer. Every is dedicated. Yeah. Yeah. And it's actually even better because
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:22.800]   with zoom, if you have a zoom room, which is what we use, you can actually have a, you can have
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:27.440]   the screen share from the person as well as them, which means that if they want to show you
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:30.880]   something, you can actually just be cutting back and forth between his two inputs for us at at
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:36.480]   1080p that's coming in from each zoom room from each presenter. And so, so you have, you can very
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:42.400]   seamlessly move back and forth. And the audio quality now is better and or at least as good zoom as
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:47.520]   as type is. Yeah, sounds good. Yeah. And we should try zoom. We keep trying stuff.
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:52.880]   I really wanted to like OBS Ninja because it's open source. But we've had a little audio issue. And
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:58.080]   I think it's just our audio system doesn't interfere with it. Well, the hard part with any of the
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:04.960]   we tested WebRTC and then stopped using it because it has a hard time traversing complex
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:10.320]   networks. So if it goes through basically to two routers, it has a hard time coming back the way
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:15.200]   we wanted it to. And so we did some pretty extensive testing with it and then decided it wasn't
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:21.280]   ready. So the special sauce that zoom ads on top of what they do and Skype and other ones that are
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:27.600]   that have a dedicated app will generally work better than WebRTC. WebRTC is great and it's free.
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:36.160]   But it definitely has some network traversing issues. When you do a lot of it, we've tested
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:40.560]   it and found it to be a problem. So it's so that's been the reason that we haven't used the WebRTC
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:47.520]   solutions, whether it's OBS Ninja or VMix, caller or memo call it, all of them have the same
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:52.000]   same issues. It's not all the time, but it's a high enough percentage that when you're doing 50 to
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.160]   60 different people a month, I bet you that's start showing up. I bet you that's our issue because
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:01.600]   we have a lot of people with free. And we also have very complex networking setups. And I bet
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:14.160]   you that's the issue. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Let me see. What have I missed? Actually,
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:20.560]   we might be at the show. We haven't. Oh, Hyundai, let's do a little Hyundai.
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:24.960]   This is going to be the gift to keep on giving as you remember, Hyundai and Porsche.
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:30.080]   Hyundai and Porsche. We've got years of discussion. So Hyundai, as you know,
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:34.320]   probably foolishly announced that they were talking to Apple about a car.
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:41.680]   You got a lot of them. Stop talking. Just stop talking. Now they released a story,
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:46.240]   which I think is just an ask covering story saying, you know, even within Hyundai, we're not
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:50.640]   sure if we want to give up the autonomy, we'd have to give up to work with Apple. So we probably
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:54.720]   didn't want to work with them anyway. That's the reason why I refuse to buy,
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:40:01.440]   build a car for Apple as well. I, you know, I'm an individual. I don't fit in with that.
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:05.520]   I'm a maverick and Apple doesn't like that. That's why I'm not making any back in their car.
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:10.960]   Hyundai, this is blooming. She put out a report saying that they're going to use Hyundai's
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:17.440]   EGMP platform that has like 500 kilometers of range charges 80% in 18 minutes and go zero to
[01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:23.840]   103.5 seconds. Okay. And that is slated for 2025. That was a gourmet cheese latest and
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:28.160]   simultaneously, Business Insider Germany announced that Apple had poached. Let me get his name right.
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:34.960]   Manfred Herr from the Volkswagen. Yeah, of all ran chassis design at Porsche and previously
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:39.200]   oversaw the Cayenne and is considered a all star in the car design department.
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:44.880]   What if an Apple car looked like a Porsche? Oh, baby. I'm also saying it's going to be more
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:48.720]   expensive than a Tesla. It's like a premium version of a Tesla.
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:53.120]   I have to admit that I really thought of myself as wanting some kind of sports car or
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:57.760]   or Tesla could drive itself. And maybe it just because of my, I just reached some point in my life,
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:02.720]   but I just want a self driving box. I don't need to go very fast. I mean, it can go as fast as it
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:06.960]   needs to keep up with the slow, it can be patient. I just want, I just all I want to do is I want
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:10.880]   to get in. I want to have it have a big screen on one end. And then I want to be able to roll out
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:15.760]   a bed or a desk or an exercise bike. And that's it. Like I just have my little, like, I just,
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:20.080]   I'm now going to go somewhere else that will take whatever time it takes because I'm connected
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:24.000]   and I'm on my phone and I'm or computer or whatever. I'm doing my thing. If I want to take a little
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.640]   nap, I just pop up in the bed. If I want to exercise a little bit again and if I want to work.
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:34.080]   You want a zooks? Yeah, but I just I just want it to be a box, you know, and not having all the
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:36.560]   zooks, the problem is zooks is all those windows. I'm like, I don't need any windows.
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:40.000]   Well, you don't want windows either. No, because I just want to be in my own world.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.080]   Picked up and then do one of those high orbit low orbit insertions to get you around the world
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:48.480]   in two hours. Is that how? I think we're great. I just think I think you just put wheels on a
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:54.080]   cargo on a cargo container. This is it. But you know, you could we should put we'll just put
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:56.960]   blinds in the windows so you don't have to look outside. You could do that. But I think a lot of
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:59.920]   people want to see the world. They just want to see the window. I know the window is going to be
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:03.040]   VR early. You're going to look like Jurassic you'll look outside and you'll see Jurassic Park. You're
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:07.440]   not going to see our world anymore. My thing is, is that I think that you could I'd be okay with
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:11.920]   the zooks is fine, but it could be bigger. That's all I'm saying is like it bigger so that you
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:15.200]   have a little space. This is like a little living room. You want a big living room.
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:19.680]   I want like a big living room. Like I can do what I need to do. I'm just saying I'm just and then
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:25.280]   I don't care. It doesn't go here fast. It'll be in a like shield. But yeah, you put it to Renee's
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:29.680]   points, put some hooks on the top so that so that you can just get picked up and put somewhere.
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:33.520]   You know, like you're just your little here's your little living room. It's arriving at
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:37.680]   quite tower just for you. It's not big enough. It needs to be stackable. Like just think of it.
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:41.600]   You could take it and you want an upstairs to ask just like a double-decre bus. No, no, no, no.
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:45.440]   I want them to be able to stack the cars on top of each other. Just think of all the parking you'd
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:49.920]   say just had a stacking system and they just all just sit on top of each other. Don't worry.
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:58.320]   Once we have these things in Boston, they'll be stacked on top of each other. I don't want to
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:02.400]   drive anymore. I've driven a couple of times in Boston. I've decided that I don't need to drive
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:08.560]   a fun in Boston. I don't know why all of you fear our hyperloop future. One simple tunnel from
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:14.400]   Los Angeles to Boston. You can be there in about 12 seconds. Cushy comfort. I just, you know,
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:19.520]   I think you can't leave people by the nose. That's what I've learned. This is what you want.
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:21.520]   You want dinosaur. Oh, no, that's not it.
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:28.000]   You don't want that. It's close.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:37.040]   We just think, yeah, you have little folks. I was trying to find the cars from Jurassic Park
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:45.520]   and I found that instead. It's a dinosaur hanging in a sling. I would say either a self-driving box
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:50.960]   or a Tyrannosaurus Rex. I could go either way. Either just give me a saddle. Yeah, that would be
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:56.720]   a good idea. Here is a picture just in case you want to know him of Montfort. I remember actually
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:59.760]   when they announced the Taekon, I watched this event. I remember these guys because I remember
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:07.760]   their skinny pants. There he is in the Porsche uniform, which is apparently a suit with skinny
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:15.680]   pants and a white shirt and no tie. Though the brown shoe guy, he's the president of
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:21.680]   style. So he's okay. He's a lot of the wear brown shoes. This is consistently the one reason why
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:27.840]   I continue to have some faith in their project. The fact that they keep poaching these really,
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:33.360]   really high-end people away from extremely successful careers. Whatever that pitch that
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:38.480]   comes to be, whatever that slide that you show them is, it's got to be hot spit on toast.
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:45.840]   Sure. I think it's got a lot of tax of cash. Yeah. Poor Tim Cook is going to have to do a seven-hour
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:52.960]   deposition in the Apple versus Epic. He's the court ordered him to a seven-hour deposition.
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:59.760]   That's like getting dental surgery, poor guy. Judge Thomas Hickson says,
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:09.120]   "This dispute is less than meets the eye." But we still want Cook for seven hours. Actually,
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:13.600]   there was a dispute over whether Cook should be deposed for four hours or eight hours.
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:18.640]   So Hickson pulled a little Solomon and said, seven hours.
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:25.680]   That's still a big loss. Every single hour of a CEO's time is incredibly value.
[01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:30.800]   The point. This is why they fly in private jets. It's not just prestige and comfort,
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:35.680]   it's that they don't have time to wait for a schedule. So every time that a CEO gets pulled
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:41.440]   out for a deposition, whether it's in front of the Senate or for a lawsuit, that is a very expensive
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:47.840]   and serious proposition. And also you have to confront the fact that maybe Tim Cook is not the
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:53.680]   best, most valuable witness for this deposition because he is the CEO, but maybe he doesn't know
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:46:01.280]   exactly what the contract is providing him to the portfolio. Speaking of CEOs,
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:09.120]   Amazon just announced that Jeff Bezos is going to step down as CEO of Amazon. Later this year,
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:17.680]   he'll become executive chair and CEO of Amazon will be Andy Jassy. He's currently CEO of Amazon's
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:23.360]   most successful branch Amazon Web Services. According to the testimony, he doesn't know
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:30.400]   how Amazon runs anyway, Leo. He's way too busy. Amazon has no idea. Amazon. What is that? Blue
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:36.800]   origin finally finished building a space ride. You're not so far off his. Here's the statement
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:42.160]   from Bezos as exec chair. I'll stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives, but also have time
[01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:46.800]   and energy. I need to focus on the day one fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, the Washington
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:51.040]   Post and my other passions. Spending my money.
[01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:53.200]   Exactly. Spent some more outside of my life.
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:04.000]   Big victory for Apple in the EU tax battle. Remember, Apple moved intellectual property to Ireland
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:10.960]   so that all non-US revenue could be channeled to Ireland, which had a zero corporate tax, I think,
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:21.360]   at the time. The EU called Fowell saying, "You can't do that, Ireland," and demanded that they
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:26.560]   collect back tax. I believe that Apple has, I mean, how it was routed has been, they've been doing
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:29.840]   that for a long time. They didn't move to Ireland. They've been in... No, no, no. They moved their
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:34.480]   IP to Ireland. They said, "Ireland, you have the rights to all the intellectual property." And so
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:38.880]   everything that's purchased through Apple goes through Ireland. Well, there's royalty fees paid
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:42.960]   to Ireland where there is no tax. That was that... Double Dutch.
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:47.040]   Yeah, the double Dutch. And that was all that money that finally did get repatriated thanks to
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:54.400]   the new tax bill from the President Trump, I think was his name, which allowed Apple to repatriate
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:48:03.680]   all that money and buy back all that stock. And anyway, the EU has lost in court this 15.7
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:09.120]   billion dollar... I believe to see you... I think this is the... If I read that correctly,
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:12.080]   I think that this is actually their appeal. They lost, I think, in July.
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:16.080]   That's right. We have that story. They filed an appeal on Monday. You're right, exactly.
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:22.960]   So they're... Yep. Also, Magrata Visitor is not going to let this stand. They've already said that,
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:30.160]   "Look, this court does not know what it's doing." They did not take into account the fact that
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:35.440]   its IP was not being developed in Ireland, that the manufacturing that's being called upon is not
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:40.640]   being done in Ireland. So this is just the next... They do their thing, and then the EU does their
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:46.560]   next thing. And this is not going to end. And also, this is not... This is a principal thing for this
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:51.520]   particular EU commissioner. This is not going to end the way that it often does with regulatory
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:56.080]   agencies in the United States, where at some point they want a negotiated settlement. The EU
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:49:02.320]   wants to win... Magrata, I'm sorry, Ms. Prampster, named Magrata Visitor wants to win here, and she will
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:09.120]   not stop until she gets it. I always call her Magrata, "Vestay hai hai hai." But I am making it up,
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:13.840]   so I don't know. She is the EU's competition commissioner and has been very aggressive against
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:20.640]   all big tech. She's kind of the big tech bet noir in Europe. And really, the dispute is not so
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:26.320]   much with Apple as with Ireland. And the whole idea is Ireland, you should never have allowed
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:31.920]   this special tax deal. We don't want any members of the EU to be doing this kind of thing. So,
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:36.560]   as much as it's going to cost or a good cost Apple, it's really all about Ireland.
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:41.840]   It really is the classic case of you got a lawless western city, and then there's a new sheriff
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:46.480]   who just ain't having it. And then all of a sudden, boy, everything's changed. It has been
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:54.000]   going on for a while, but new sheriff, this sheriff is not having it. Your saloon is going to be
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:59.120]   shut down forth with doesn't matter how many guns, slingers you bring in, your saloon is out of business.
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:02.880]   And regardless of whether they win or not, the EU and the US could find some common ground,
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:07.680]   because right now the EU cares so much about competition. They often do things that cause
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:13.600]   direct consumer harm. And the US cares so much about lowest pricing that they often do things
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:18.160]   that cause competition, irreparable harm. And neither of them seems willing to budge off of
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:22.160]   those hills. Like they want to die on those hills rather than say, what can we do to increase
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:26.400]   competition? We'll also better serve in consumers. And what can we do to give consumers better pricing
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:31.120]   options while also giving them more choice of who they're buying from? And just those little tweaks
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:36.400]   would make it so much better for everybody. There's a world war at stake with regulation.
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:41.360]   Australia is the big Mavericks, the entire planet, where every time they come up with something that
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:48.000]   is meant to address a problem that I think most people acknowledge is a problem. But they come
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.280]   out with the most, we just want to blow everything up. And we don't care if this is a workable solution
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:51:00.000]   or not. It's just that, hey, let's make it, let's make it okay for a news corporation to charge
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.160]   Google simply for linking to an article and make sure that they don't have any rights.
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:07.760]   I want to hold on. I want to apologize to Alex because unfortunately,
[01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:12.000]   for some I've ever seen somebody punished for a low latency connection. Everybody else is
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.320]   late and Alex tries to get a word at edgewise. They all talk over him because they don't.
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:21.040]   No, they don't even hear you, Alex, because they're like a second behind. So I want to make sure
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:27.680]   you get the talk. I think that all I was saying was that the
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:34.240]   regardless of whether they win or not in the EU, this could take another five to 10 years to go
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:40.160]   through, it's creating a calculus for all the other companies. It's letting people know that
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:44.720]   there's going to be a scrap. If you keep on doing this, and again, I think that
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:50.160]   even companies like Apple don't need to do this. They have a solid product. They're not
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:54.880]   making money because of some technicality. They're making more money because of the technicality.
[01:51:54.880 --> 01:52:00.640]   But they don't need it to be profitable. But they're going to keep fighting.
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:03.440]   Again, we get to talk about this every six months for the next five years.
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:06.480]   I love it. I think the FTC investigating Facebook and Google,
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:11.120]   antitrust action in Congress against Google, I think all of that's good.
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:15.840]   Even if it doesn't result in a decision, it keeps people a little bit more honest.
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:24.160]   It just reminds them, you aren't in deadwood. There is a law. There's the law man in town.
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:31.040]   And if you stop calling people for past interference, eventually, it turns into a mass.
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:36.080]   That's right. To put it in actually much more appropriate. Super Bowls coming up.
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:42.320]   You're Steelers. I'm sorry. Big Ben. It is best.
[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:48.080]   It's very relaxing though. Because the Steelers are very tense for me when the Steelers are in
[01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:51.440]   playoffs. So once they're done, I don't really care. I'm just like, I'm just like,
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:55.440]   Lisa, Lisa's the same way. She's like, I don't want them to go to the Super Bowl.
[01:52:55.440 --> 01:53:01.760]   Because then if they lose, I'll be really unhappy. I made a prediction before the playoff started.
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:08.080]   So far, I'm still on track. So I guess Casey. I predicted Casey will be
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:14.160]   back in the years 33 to 27. You predicted the actual teams? Wow. Casey was easy. They were
[01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:18.080]   in the Super Bowl last year. But Tampa Bay, that's a good prediction. Good job.
[01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:21.600]   Couple of close games I thought maybe I'd lose. Now, now, now, down to just the score.
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:24.000]   So we'll see how this gets. Do you have some money on this thing?
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.200]   No, I don't bet. No.
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:27.440]   That makes me feel good. That makes me feel good. That makes me feel good.
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:28.240]   That makes me feel good. That makes me feel good. That makes me feel good.
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:38.880]   Our final story is a sort of non-story. The headline in 9-5 Google. Apple iCloud Passer's
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:46.560]   extension for Chrome is now available on Windows. Then no, it's not. But the general gist of this
[01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:52.640]   is good, which is Apple has a very good password manager. As anybody who's used iPhone and a Mac
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:58.400]   knows, it's excellent built in a Safari, but it's Mac. It's very secure, but it's Mac only.
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:03.520]   So it's very interesting. It doesn't do authenticator codes yet, which is my big hang up.
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:07.920]   You don't want it to do authenticator codes. I do and it doesn't like one
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:12.000]   pack last past. Because then it's a single point of failure. You want to have separate
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:16.560]   password management and authentication. I don't know if I really do any more Leo.
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:22.000]   I just like I get stuck so often not being able to get those codes that I've locked myself out
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:26.640]   of so many things that it would be nice if I remember. Especially like I'm not traveling.
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:28.960]   If I was traveling, my phone has them separately.
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:34.880]   So I guess I do. I'll damn it. We're all a little bit empty inside, aren't we?
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:38.800]   Oh, no. You might not be Apple's fault. I got to tell you, I was reading,
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:45.920]   there's a privacy tools subreddit where the most privacy-addled people are.
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:51.200]   A guy was saying, "Oh, never store your email password in your password manager."
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:56.000]   And he went, "What? Well, if somebody gets in your password manager, then they get your email."
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:01.280]   And then they can, I said, "Okay, that might be going a little far. That might be a little..."
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:04.320]   Don't use DuckDuckGo because then you'll be using DuckDuckGo, dude.
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:08.720]   I'm going to get to the internet. Very similar. One of your own robots.
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:13.920]   Same people. In any event, I like this idea that Apple might extend some of the benefits of
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:20.800]   Apple's password system to Windows. It was in version 12 of iCloud for Windows, which was released
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:27.760]   somehow prematurely and has been pulled from the Microsoft Store. It was a Chrome extension
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:32.480]   that came with iCloud for Windows. If it's a Chrome extension, that probably means it works with a
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:39.040]   lot of the Blink Chromium-enabled browsers, including maybe even Edge and Microsoft's own browser
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:46.240]   and Brave. Anyway, it was on the store. I hope you got it. If you didn't, you'd probably come back
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:57.200]   again sometime soon. Is there anything I left out? Anything you can now AirPlay your Fitness Plus?
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:00.880]   That's great. And the latest macOS beta just came out.
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:06.080]   Oh, two seconds ago. Just now? I'm just getting used to 11.2.
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:12.400]   Anything exciting. It is 11.3 beta. You can customize Safari better. It has iPhone and iPad apps
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:17.440]   preferences pane for resetting your keyboard preferences for the touch controls, better sorting
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:22.560]   options and reminders made for you shortcut live events and listen now in Apple Music,
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:28.160]   a redesigned News Plus tab and support for the new Xbox and PlayStation controllers.
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:34.240]   And I've got to say, given how hard iOS 12 and all of that generation was, and given 2020 and
[01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:39.920]   2021, Apple is really pushing out quality of life improvements. We used to have to wait a year
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:44.720]   for those and they're really doing things like AirPlay with Fitness Plus and the Watch unlock
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:50.720]   for the iPhone at a much more, what's the right word for it, compassionate pace than they've ever
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:55.760]   done before. So please keep this up. Be compassionate, Apple. That's all we ask.
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:57:00.000]   Well, help us. I mean, like before, I think they were concerned about scheduling and now I think
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.640]   they're more concerned about actually being helpful and I really like it.
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:07.280]   I think next we're going to do our picks of the week. What do you think?
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:16.640]   Picks of the week start with our special guest this week, the wonderful Alex Lindsey,
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:21.840]   because I've missed your $700 picks. I really, I need to spend some money.
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:28.800]   This was not $700. So the one of the things that we're talking a lot about in office hours right
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:35.360]   now is a program called Zoom OSC. And so there's Zoom and then there's Zoom OSC. Now,
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:41.040]   OSC is open sound control and it's really used by a lot of applications to integrate with other
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:45.680]   applications to automate things and so on and so forth. So programs like Companion,
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:50.000]   which allow you to automate lots of stuff in the event world, all use OSC to pass this
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:56.560]   information back and forth. And so what Zoom OSC does is it actually builds a new version of Zoom
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:04.560]   that is totally controllable. So where the little pains show up and what everybody's volume is
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:09.760]   and what we would use. This is what we want. This comes out tomorrow.
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:14.640]   It's launching tomorrow. Well, it's not from Zoom though. This is from a third party, right?
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:20.560]   It's a third party. But they're using the Zoom, basically they're using the Zoom API and then
[01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:26.160]   making it available through via OSC to control, which means that you can tie it into things like
[01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:30.720]   these little stream decks. You can have all kinds of controls that you would have with the stream
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:33.920]   deck and you put a push a little button and it could highlight a bunch of people all at one time.
[01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:37.680]   And there's a lot of other, you know, there's a lot of control. So whether you're trying to run
[01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:42.160]   that next level of event with Zoom, where you don't want it to just be the normal, you know,
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:47.680]   Zoom event and you want to or for someone like me, if I want to tie it into all of our hardware
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:53.840]   and have it do things, you know, as the as we ask for it via other controls, all of those things
[01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:59.280]   are suddenly available to it. And so we started getting to we were doing training. So the actual
[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:04.160]   founder of Zoom OSC or one of the founders of Zoom OSC who is one of the programming staff is
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:09.360]   actually every Saturday hanging out with our group talking about Zoom OSC. And if you go on
[01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:13.600]   YouTube, you'll see us talk about it. It was amazing two hours of talking about it of what's
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:21.280]   possible. And this basically this turns zoom. This would be like, no, we don't need a tricaster.
[01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:26.960]   We just need to streamcast and zoom kind of it's, you know, do graphics. It's halfway out. You can
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:31.520]   have lower thirds and you can have graphics and playback and all those things that you want.
[01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:36.240]   Now, does it replace the hardware that we use? Maybe not. But it does integrate with that hardware.
[01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:42.560]   And it is a huge it fills that gap between I have a zoom. Yeah, you can tie it. You can have the
[01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:47.120]   A-TEM talk to it so that for instance, I can push a button and it would actually tell, say,
[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:51.600]   highlight this person and pull them up or I can push, you know, so all the controls, the A-TEM
[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:57.200]   talking can be converted back to OSC and then sent back into the into Zoom. And so there's so
[01:59:57.200 --> 02:00:02.160]   many places where you can basically supersize what you're doing in Zoom. And so a lot of people
[02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:06.240]   are trying to figure out how do I build an event that I don't want a lot of hardware.
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:10.000]   I don't want to build something huge in the cloud, but I want something better, you know,
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:17.360]   a more refined event than what I can get. And so this is just kind of amazing.
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:18.960]   Is this free?
[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:24.640]   So there's a version of it that's free that you can do a lot of the work on it. And then the,
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:30.720]   I believe that the new version, the pro version of it, so for is free. So you can do a lot of the
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:36.560]   stuff that you want to do for free. And then the pro version, I believe, is like $35 a month for
[02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:42.720]   instance or whatever. And so and right now, the folks that are, you can sign up until the end of
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:48.240]   the until then to Thursday, folks that are in office hours actually get a month of it for free
[02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:53.360]   so that they can learn how to do it with with Andy, who's who's one of the programmers and
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:00:57.920]   one of the founders. And so so you're actually able to learn how to use it over the next month
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:04.320]   inside of office hours. And it is, it's mind blowing. Like it really is like what you can control and
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:07.920]   everything else. It kind of takes zoom to an entirely different level. So if you're trying to do that
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:12.720]   kind of thing, and you're trying to figure out how to, how to push it, it's a pretty amazing app.
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:17.680]   And I would definitely, wow, definitely check it out. And office hours, what's the easiest way to
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:22.880]   get that link? Follow your choices. The easiest way to get the link is to just go to any of the
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:28.000]   YouTube's at the very top of the description of all the YouTube's or all the last couple months.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.240]   You can just click on it and register and site for zoom. The other you if you just want to type
[02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:38.640]   it in it, just bitly slash with camel caps, the office hours, so capital T, capital O, capital H,
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:44.480]   the office hours. So bitly, bitly, bit.ly slash the office hours.
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:49.120]   So that's easy. You can get that. Yeah. So you can just use that or you can go to YouTube and
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:53.280]   on my channel and see all these ones. And you'll you can link, you'll see a link there for it.
[02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:59.200]   There's about 3000 people now that are in the group and about 1000 on Discord, a little over 1000
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:04.320]   now on Discord. And then and then we have anywhere from four to 600 people show up every morning.
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:11.120]   And so it's so it's general Q and A and inside of office hours. But this is an initiative that
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:18.880]   we're doing. So right now we're doing training on zoom OSC. And then in the future, we have some
[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:22.480]   training that we're going to be doing on resolve and all of its free. So you know,
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:28.080]   Blackmagic's a DaVinci Resolve will be doing some training for HDR work. Virtual production
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:34.080]   is coming in the summer. So we're kind of continuing to have more and more fun as the as the group
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:39.280]   gets. And then we have great, we're having great guests. We have we've had the the director of
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:43.440]   South by Southwest came on for an hour like like you came on and and I guess everyone here
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:50.000]   has had an hour and the Renee and you director of South by Southwest came on ahead of their EDU
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:54.720]   has come on. And so that that's been some, you know, some fun discussions. And we've got a lot
[02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:58.080]   of them coming up every every morning, almost every morning we have some kind of special hour
[02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:01.280]   that we're talking through. Anyway, but you know, see,
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:06.480]   it's cool. You had another friend of mine who who does the who does the animated displays in
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:11.920]   Times Square for an entire hour last last week, a week before was that it? Yeah, yeah. So Phil,
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:16.400]   yeah, Phil Langer does the all the display manages, I don't know all of them, but a lot of the
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:22.800]   displays in the in in Times Square. And so he gave everybody this incredible like tour of like
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:27.200]   what this actually looks like and how it actually gets done. And Phil's been doing stuff in Times
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:30.800]   Square for, you know, I don't know, 30 or 40 years. And so there's an incredible amount of
[02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:34.960]   knowledge there. And he's just one of the many incredible when we have the
[02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:46.480]   there's we have like the founder of, you know, the computer aided teleprompters, you know,
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:52.960]   Courtney is is he's he comes to every day. And we talk about teleprompters, man. He can really
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:57.760]   tell you what how it used to look. So so anyway, lots of folks like that that just have incredible
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:02.000]   backgrounds from all over the world. It's usually on any given day, there's four or five continents
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:08.160]   represented on the panel. Very cool. Pretty slick. Wow, you invented clubhouse. That's all I can say.
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:15.040]   It's it's Alex's clubhouse. It's it's a lot of fun. It's it's becoming less and less mine,
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:17.920]   more and more ours every day, because it's just an incredible group of people that
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:22.880]   shows up every day every day to be part of the conversation. Andy and Ico has come up with a
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:30.640]   pick of the week that involves paper. Yes. Well, we're we're still stuck in and locked on in one
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:35.440]   way or another. We still have crafts projects you have time for. There's an artisan designer by
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:41.680]   the name of Rocky Bergen, who makes paper craft models of classic computers. And his model of the
[02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:50.720]   Mac 128 is just mind blowing. So you start off with the Mac itself where, okay, it's it's cool
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:56.320]   shape. I'll make a couple inches high. The model is each face is print is designed specifically
[02:04:56.320 --> 02:05:00.720]   photographically, realistically, in color. Okay, and gets all the contours and all of the things
[02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:04.960]   shape. Okay, of course, you're going to get the keyboard. Sure, the mouse sure the external
[02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:10.400]   disk drive bonus points. That's great. But he also did. So you also get the floppies for Mac
[02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:15.600]   right and Mac paint and the boot disk. He also made like the box that the Mac right and Mac
[02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:20.640]   paint software would come in with the manual inside. He also did the training cassettes.
[02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:26.080]   Even went so far as you get like little versions of the Apple computer stickers
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:32.720]   and the and the 1984 style like Apple credit card. Wow. And it's like, I said, you know, I
[02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:38.720]   did you do this out? I was I was about to I printed it out on my but all I have is a laser printer.
[02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:43.600]   And as soon as I saw it in front of me, I thought that this deserves I have an order in with Aspen
[02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:49.200]   photo for like an actual like quality print of all this stuff. Because it said full it would
[02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:54.640]   just feel like I'm not doing this man. Oh, look, these are pop ins that go where the screen is
[02:05:54.640 --> 02:05:59.280]   for different games. Again, you can have like Mac paint, you can have like the back of the
[02:05:59.280 --> 02:06:04.480]   Macintosh startup screen. There's like a couple of those things. And if that doesn't float your
[02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:11.120]   boat, the also has less ambitious but still awesome models of the of the Lisa one, the Apple two plus
[02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:19.520]   it's just again, you just want to. I was just looking for a box somewhere on this site where I could
[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:24.000]   just say, where can I just like put money in a box and mail it to you? Because this is just so
[02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:31.040]   I'm looking for I have I have I have the Lego kit for the Apollo 11 like lunar landing that's still
[02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:35.360]   ready for me to go someday. I am not looking forward to assembling that as much as I'm looking
[02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:42.640]   forward to assembling this papercraft Mac when 28 it's just amazing. So this is a new term to me.
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:49.280]   This is a hobby thing called papercraft where you fold paper to make things is that? Yeah, well,
[02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:53.600]   it's not it's not origami as you can see you get it's just a PDF that you download print
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:58.880]   and you just get an exacto knife and you cut out like all of these like shaped fold paper and
[02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:03.360]   you fold it were and their tabs read just like glue things together and you wind up with this
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:08.080]   beautiful paper model there. Yeah, exactly. It's like a model kit only made out of like bits of
[02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:12.640]   paper. So so don't think of this origami where okay, so I'm going to do the crane fold and then
[02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:18.800]   oh yeah, it's easy. Yeah, yeah. Now, have you done this printing it on photostock before? Have you
[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:27.280]   is this new? I've done this kind of stuff before and the results are usually pretty good. Sometimes
[02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:31.840]   you if the depending on how thick the paper is I might have to score it on one side. Yeah,
[02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:38.880]   so it folds exactly where I want to. But again, I saw it's on I saw in black and white paper or
[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:43.600]   my laser printer and I thought, yeah, I know I'm this is something that I want to like
[02:07:43.600 --> 02:07:49.440]   put under like a little like display glass and put it on the shelf. So I want to I want to go
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:53.520]   I want to go for it. I want to I want to take the big swing at this thing and it's free. We just to
[02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:59.680]   give you incentive, we will highlight it when you finish it. I want to see it. Yeah, I was hoping
[02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:04.560]   I was hoping to have it finished by before I showed it off that that I really know. I think
[02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:09.840]   you're smart. I'm denying people the month that it would take like to enjoy this on their own.
[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:15.680]   So and where are you getting it printed? Oh, I mentioned I mentioned it before. So you can just
[02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:23.280]   send them a PDF and they will print the PDF and it's eight and a half by 11 paper. Yeah, there it's
[02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:28.560]   a lot of different paper a lot of different prints, photo print services will just have eight
[02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:33.200]   and a half by 11 as one of the options aspen aspen Creek. That's what I was what he should use.
[02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:36.800]   And so you print this on photo paper, then it's going to read the colors are going to pop.
[02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:41.040]   It's going to really look good. Yeah, if you have a halfway decent coloring jet printer,
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:43.200]   I'm sure that would work just as fine. I just don't
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:46.960]   chiefly because every time I want to print something in color, it's like
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:51.680]   I used to have a I used to have a color in jet printer, but every time I use it so infrequently
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:57.200]   that step number one order $80 or the inks replace the cartridge that dried out since the last time
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:03.040]   that I used it. So I'm like, okay, I'll just order out rocky Bergen dot com slash paper craft.
[02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:11.440]   He also has an inside. Yeah. He's good. This is really cool stuff in Amiga and Amstrad
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:19.680]   and that was model three Lisa. Wow. Also, also with like appropriate screen images.
[02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:26.400]   Yeah. That's like on the model three model, I was looking at the I have not seen that dancing
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:34.240]   ASCII ASCII alien in a long time. I'm having flashbacks. This is so good. I love this.
[02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:39.040]   Yeah. Look at that IBM. DHP. That was the first like test up computer of all time.
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:46.640]   Yeah. You get a Nintendo advanced video system, the Sega master system. Make them all. Make them
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:52.400]   all. Yeah. Sinclair. Wow. Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:59.680]   So my pick is this site, the sub site on apple.com that went live, I believe it was yesterday and
[02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:03.760]   it's Apple's new mini site for racial equity and justice initiative, what they've been
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:10.000]   working on for the last week as part of Black History Month, but also just as part of Apple's
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:14.720]   commitment to this issue going back since they established their $100 million fund. I think it
[02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:20.160]   was last last year already and this sort of lays out everything that they're doing, everything they're
[02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:27.120]   planning, the purpose, the reasons for it, why they believe that it is critically urgently
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:35.120]   important to address this, not in general terms, in vague terms, some point in the nebulous future,
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:42.080]   but immediately and sort of what they're doing, why they're doing it. And I know it's been hard
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:46.960]   for some people because everyone likes to self identify with everything that companies that they
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:52.080]   like do. And some people look at this and say, well, this doesn't represent me or why don't I see me,
[02:10:52.080 --> 02:10:57.440]   there are why isn't this for me, not understanding that everything has been for us for decades,
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:03.200]   for centuries, and that Apple really believes that more has to be done to make it available truly
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:10.080]   for everybody to give everybody the same level of opportunity. And it's not so much something that is
[02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:18.880]   dedicated to one group of people, but something that is imperative to make us all one bigger
[02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:24.400]   group of people so that we're not holding anybody back anymore, but we're all being able to run
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:31.440]   faster further together. And this just does an excellent, beautiful job of laying all of that out,
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:36.640]   along with everything else Apple's doing across their services and even product lineups as part
[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:40.160]   of the initiative. So that was really, really well done and wanted to share it.
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:47.120]   Apple News Spotlight, I've seen the stories, the Black Life stories on Apple TV Plus.
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:52.400]   This is good shot on iPhone 12 when yesterday as well, I think where they had a bunch of
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:58.800]   photographers just documenting stories from their lives. It's an amazing body of work from Lisa Jackson
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:05.440]   and her team. Just in time for Black History Month and it's Apple's Racial Justice Initiative.
[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:11.600]   It's a long URL, but I suspect if you go to apple.com, there'll be a link there, I would guess.
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:19.280]   Fantastic. I want to mention a new program. It all began for me many years ago. Remember
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:24.640]   Quicksilver? And he doesn't like to install these because he doesn't. He says, I want to be
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:30.560]   able to use any Mac, but I love these, you know, you press command space and you get a launcher.
[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:37.680]   There was Quicksilver, then there was Alfred. Apple kind of sure locked it a little bit with
[02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:43.200]   command space for Spotlight. But there's a new one that I think is really interesting. This is
[02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:51.120]   free. It's called Raycast and it is at raycast.com. I've actually, it does all the things Spotlight
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:58.640]   will do, but it does a lot more because you can integrate it with other tools. It supports plugins
[02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:07.520]   and there are a lot of tools like Jira, your calendar and reminders so that you can quickly
[02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:13.440]   enter stuff into Git. For instance, you can have your whole Git workflow go through command space.
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:17.760]   I think it's very, very interesting and it is free. This is a good time to try it.
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:24.880]   Quicksilver is still around. It's got an open source. Alfred is still great with the Powerpack.
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:30.480]   This is a little bit like Alfred's Powerpack. I think it's pretty amazing. If you look at the
[02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:38.720]   range of extensions, it's already very, very complete. Asana and G Suite and GitHub and Jira,
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:47.200]   window management. You can actually have special keys that move, scale, windows,
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:52.640]   again, just by command space and then you type a couple of characters. I think it's a very
[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:57.680]   interesting app and worth a try. I've installed them all my Macs because I really like it.
[02:13:57.680 --> 02:14:06.880]   RaycastRA1. Not a great name. It sounds kind of industrial. Raycast@raycast.com.
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:12.880]   Folks, time has come to say goodbye to all our family.
[02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:18.160]   ReneeRitchie, youtube.com/ReneeRitchie. Anything you want to mention that's coming up?
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:24.320]   Always many videos there. I'm doing this whole YouTube shorts experiment now where I try to
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:30.800]   post sub 60 second videos on the biggest news of the day. It's odd because YouTube is still
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:34.320]   fractured between their desktop experience and their mobile experience. They're trying to be
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:38.480]   TikTok but still want to be YouTube. It's causing some confusion, but I'm hoping that I can just
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:42.160]   press onwards with it and people will find these short little news briefs interesting.
[02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:48.400]   Are you going to put them on TikTok too? I'm thinking about it. Both TikTok and Instagram,
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:55.200]   I'm thinking. The problem is that the formats are different. YouTube allows 15 seconds in the app
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:59.760]   if you create them, but you can do up to 60 seconds if you upload them manually. YouTube is
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:06.240]   I think TikTok is also a minute, but Instagram is only 30 seconds in reels. There's after work
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:08.800]   on figuring out how I can adjust it for everything.
[02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:16.400]   youtube.com/ReneeRitchie. You'll also find his Apple Talk show there he does with Georgia Dow.
[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:21.440]   Great stuff. You're just knocking it out of the park doing such a great job.
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:26.160]   Thank you so much. Her channel is taken off now. She's got I think six videos up already.
[02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:29.840]   She's going to hit a million subscribers way before I do. I've already settled it.
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:37.840]   You can live with it. Andy Anaco, when are you going to be on WGBH next? Back to a regular
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:45.760]   schedule. Looks like Friday at 1 p.m. If you're an Athama to test the rest of the radio, you can go to
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:49.280]   WGBHNews.org and stream it either live or later.
[02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:58.000]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, we know about office hours. B-i-t dot l-y slash T-o-h right? The office.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:04.160]   Well, it's camel cap. You have to spell out the office hours, but oh, it's not T-o-h.
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:08.320]   It's the office hours. I get it. But you use to use capitals or you end up in somebody else's
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:12.400]   YouTube channel. I didn't know. I didn't know. I didn't know it was case sensitive. Oh, yeah.
[02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:17.760]   It's case sensitive. It's great to see you. Check that out. We're having a lot of fun.
[02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:20.560]   Yeah, good to see you. I'm coming back so good. Yeah, absolutely.
[02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:23.840]   And we're going to start a new feature on all of our shows, the GameStop
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:30.880]   stock check down at $90. So I hope you got out.
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:39.680]   No, I shouldn't laugh. That's me. Meanwhile, for some reason, Google's just going through the roof.
[02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:45.920]   I don't know what's going on with Google, but there must be some big story there. Maybe the
[02:16:45.920 --> 02:16:50.880]   maybe the Redditors have decided to invest in Google. Ha ha ha.
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:55.840]   Hang on. Way up after announcing Bezos, which is interesting. Is it? Wow. Look at
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:17:00.880]   that. Look at this. Look at this alphabet stock after the after the close. That was weird.
[02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:07.280]   That's usually the sort of announcement that comes like at 4.48 p.m. on a Friday. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:11.840]   Alphabet. Alphabet revenue grows 23%. Oh, it was the revenue results.
[02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:16.080]   OK. Yeah. Amazon up down up. It's been a very, you know,
[02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:20.480]   usually they profit take when they announce revenue. So it's still good that it. Yeah.
[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:27.600]   I'm just glad I don't know anything because it would make me a nervous. Not even Dodge
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:33.520]   coin, Leo. You don't even know. No, dogecoin for me, baby. Nope. Nothing. I do have a Bitcoin wallet,
[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:37.360]   but I can't get into it. So it's like not you can buy some Apple bonds. It'll be fine.
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:43.280]   You know, this morning, Patrick Delaandie, one of our team members, our coder,
[02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:50.320]   took, showed us on his he's got a framed Apple stock share. Actually, he's a couple of shares,
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:56.080]   I think, that is his grandma gave him. I said, you're worth a lot now.
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:18:02.720]   But he's just he says, no memories of gamma are priceless, though. Yeah, that's exactly right.
[02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:09.440]   No price on that. We do Mac break weekly, Tuesdays, 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time 1800 UTC.
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:14.240]   You can watch us do it live. As with all our shows, we have a live stream at Twit.tv/live audio.
[02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:22.800]   Oh, there I am. Audio and video. That's weird. Then I'm thrown. I'm thrown. I can't, I can't
[02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:30.160]   look at that. And then just to just to darn handsome. Oh, no, look, it's going to go. It's going to
[02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:36.160]   get all it's going in the mirror world. We also have on demand versions of the show on our website,
[02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:42.480]   twit.tv. There's a YouTube channel dedicated to Mac break weekly. You can also subscribe,
[02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:45.760]   but that's probably the best thing to do in your favorite podcast application. That way,
[02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:50.720]   you'll get it the minute it's available of a Tuesday late Tuesday. So you have it for Wednesday.
[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:55.360]   Thank you everybody for joining us. We'll see you next time on Mac break weekly. Bye-bye.
[02:18:55.920 --> 02:19:02.960]   Hey folks, thanks for tuning in to another show here on the Twit Network. If you are a fan of home
[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:09.360]   automation, Internet of Things and all things smart technology, you should check out my podcast
[02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:15.680]   Smart Tech Today. I do it with Matthew Casanelli and we have so much fun talking about all the latest
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:25.200]   news for all things smart tech.
[02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:37.680]   Oh, quick switch to the launch. Starship is going up right now. Test flight. Look at that.
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:42.560]   Sorry, we didn't get you the countdown. Is this SN9 is in is airborne?
[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:48.000]   I'm glad they're finally making really fake looking rockets. You know, I got to ask
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:51.840]   how much of that is Elon going? If you could add some fins.
[02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:57.200]   My fault kid loves power ranges. He won't shut up about it. Can you explain it by Marion Oates again?
[02:19:57.200 --> 02:20:01.040]   Oh, a Hester's Space expert, John Slanina, who is running the board today. Is this one that
[02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:03.760]   they're going to go up a little bit and then come back down? So they're going to try to do it with
[02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:08.640]   last time that they exploded on landing. And this time they are hoping to get it to land,
[02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:12.800]   but it might fall over. But that exploding will be a step. Well, it might be falling after fall.
[02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:18.480]   So this is a test of going up and then they tilt it around so it comes down on the side.
[02:20:18.480 --> 02:20:22.640]   So it's a test of that part. They're they'll be happy with it even if it does explode on landing.
[02:20:22.640 --> 02:20:25.680]   Yes, as they were last time, although I did see that they violated if a rules with the last launch.
[02:20:25.680 --> 02:20:28.800]   I hope they've got a clear answer. They got clearance this time. Okay, because if there's a
[02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:33.440]   plane up there, it's kind of embarrassing. There's a picture of a truck. Okay, is that where it's
[02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:35.600]   going to come down? I don't know what they're doing there. They said go to the truck and go to the
[02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:38.960]   coach's. Quick, switch to the truck. Something's happened. That is it. This is the one that is going
[02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:44.560]   to later this year launch the first commercial space flight, right? No, this is the one that's
[02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:48.320]   the fucking heavy. This is super hard. This is super heavy going to Mars. Okay, it will be interesting
[02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:52.320]   to watch for the first time in my lifetime. Astronauts and spaces that are purely commercial
[02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:55.440]   flight. That'll be later this year. Are they using the galaxy as 21 for these shots?
[02:20:55.440 --> 02:20:59.680]   Yeah, they need to study the study cam in the next 21 to really get that and that 1000
[02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:05.680]   X zoom. That's a crazy. I'm sorry. We're kind of space crazy here. I mean, for this launch.
[02:21:05.680 --> 02:21:12.480]   We're finally back in an era in history in which visible understandable changes and breakthroughs
[02:21:12.480 --> 02:21:16.880]   are happening like on a several times a year basis. We're gonna have another Mars rover launch
[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:20.160]   very, very soon. And this one's gonna have like a million selfie cameras for live video of the landing.
[02:21:20.160 --> 02:21:24.240]   So this is exciting time to have a streamable video. Is this going to be like one of my
[02:21:24.240 --> 02:21:27.200]   SD rockets John where it just keeps going. I'll rinse out a fuel that turns around and heads back
[02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:30.960]   down to earth. Double recovery. Yeah. Yeah. You'll on set on clubhouse that he has a hard
[02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:33.040]   time implant. You really can't plant that complaint in your game. So this brain.
[02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:39.360]   Yeah, right. How much longer should we stay with this John? Is it going to, uh, I do. How long is it
[02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:43.840]   going to be? Okay, we'll stay with this forever until the top pops out and we see that orange and
[02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:49.680]   white plastic thing is not a safe, it's not a safe launch. Then we should tell the editors you
[02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:53.520]   can, uh, you can speed this up when you do the version. So it's not quite so. And our voices
[02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:57.040]   all sound funny. Hell, let's go fast. Okay. So we're getting to shut down. Of course,
[02:21:57.040 --> 02:22:00.240]   it's the partial helium environment that's in the spacecraft. The cameras have lost it.
[02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:04.560]   Oh, there it is. Don't get every, every time the streaming video breaks up a little bit and
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:08.960]   my heart goes in my throat, at least why now. Anybody who survived Challenger knows it's, you know,
[02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:13.040]   this is still a very scary. There's no, there's no humans on board this. So it's,
[02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:16.640]   it's not risking lives, but you're in elementary school. We're not having that happen. Yeah, we all
[02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:19.120]   like the MSR D's hard drive in here. We never know. Yeah, we were watching the gymnasium school
[02:22:19.120 --> 02:22:22.560]   gymnasium. Oh my God. They will the television in back of the day before yet. I was writing
[02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:28.080]   me, I was writing some 68,000 code on my Macintosh plus or something and watching it in my, oh, here we
[02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:33.520]   go. Here we go. It's just like my SDs. It's got a, yep. This is going to get put around.
[02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:36.960]   So, but it's not, it's going to go through your knuckle. Oh, that's what the fins are for. So now
[02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:41.200]   it's, now it's aeronautic. Now it's, uh, it's going to, it's going to fly. It's going to fly.
[02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:44.800]   It's going to fly. He flies up. He flies all the way down. Look at that. That is amazing.
[02:22:45.920 --> 02:22:52.560]   Much fun. Yeah. It was the commercial flight, 50 million dollars per seat and of course,
[02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:57.440]   no waiver on the one, on a year full of training. So, so what, so a guy bought his seat and then
[02:22:57.440 --> 02:23:02.160]   bought three more for the public, right? Um, no, this, this next one coming up is actually a
[02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:06.560]   copy that does not like space tourism. It's more like commercial space flight. So, each one of
[02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:09.840]   those seats is being fulfilled by one of the scientists. There's another one that's doing some
[02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:12.960]   other kind of research. They might be, they might be rich people who wanted to be in space and
[02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:16.640]   wanted to get a year of training, but they're not just, they're like getting YouTube videos of EDM
[02:23:16.640 --> 02:23:19.440]   and M's and zero gravity. They're actually, they actually have work to do up there. Um,
[02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:22.400]   and the long range, very interesting, the long range plans of the same company is to
[02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:26.960]   build a space station or build modules attached to the ISS, uh, partly for their own crew and
[02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:30.960]   their own visitors, but also ultimately so that when the ISS space, space frame fails, they can
[02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:34.640]   just have a detachable then be a fully completed private space station and start ordering on their
[02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:38.800]   own. So this launch, which is coming up, uh, in the fourth quarter, inspiration for the
[02:23:38.800 --> 02:23:44.640]   words first all commercial astronauts from the front. There's a clip down. It's coming. Oh, yeah,
[02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:50.240]   that's too bad. That's true. It's exciting. It makes the launches a lot more exciting than just
[02:23:50.240 --> 02:23:53.440]   all they went to space. It's like, they gotta get two things back. It gives no meaning to sticking
[02:23:53.440 --> 02:23:56.960]   the landing. Uh, yeah, it's the angle that it's not. There's another one doing next to it. They're
[02:23:56.960 --> 02:24:00.880]   showing, look, it's okay. We got another. Uh, wow. Okay. They got a little closer though. This time
[02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:05.360]   was able to kind of, you know, they didn't look at that back and swung around all the way. Right.
[02:24:05.360 --> 02:24:09.600]   It was like, it fell faster than they thought it was going to. But okay, there's no failure. This is
[02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:13.440]   not like a tech product where one spectacular failure means that the executive is going to move
[02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:17.040]   on. It's been more time with his family. This is anticipated that even even even the Apollo
[02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:19.920]   landings, it was like we're the first attempt is going to be Apollo 11. We're not assuming that's
[02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:23.440]   going to be successful. That's why the first people to land on the moon could be 12, 13 or 14.
[02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:25.840]   That was part of what they're thinking. They weren't expecting to lose a crew, but they were
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:29.520]   expecting that. Okay. We have a fault here, so we can't do the landing. So yeah, so yes, it's
[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:33.280]   yesterday, SpaceX announced the inspiration for will be in the fourth quarter of this year, the
[02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:37.200]   world's first all commercial astronaut mission to orbit. The founder and CEO of a company called
[02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:41.840]   Shift 4 payments, Jared Isaacman bought his seat and is donating the three seats alongside him or
[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:45.360]   the dragon to individuals from the general public will be announced in the weeks ahead.
[02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:51.920]   Exactly. Gold and ticket, baby. You can go to inspiration4.com. You will get,
[02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:55.760]   so you mentioned training, Eddie, it's not like it's going to be kind of limited. You'll get
[02:24:55.760 --> 02:25:00.640]   commercial astronaut training by SpaceX, which will include operating in microgravity. You'll
[02:25:00.640 --> 02:25:04.080]   learn such things as zero gravity, stress testing, emergency, preparedness, training,
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:07.600]   space suit and spacecraft, ingress and egress, exercise as well as partial
[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:10.480]   full mission simulations. But obviously you'll be an abbreviated one because they haven't even
[02:25:10.480 --> 02:25:16.000]   picked them yet. It is going to be a vomit comment. But if I will go with it, I'm going to apply
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.560]   because I'm probably too old, but this multi-day journey orbiting Earth every 90 minutes along
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:24.080]   a customized flight path upon conclusion, you'll reenter the Earth's atmosphere for age.
[02:25:24.080 --> 02:25:28.320]   How many seconds again? I didn't say, but Jared already bought it. So don't get your hopes up.
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:33.520]   You'll get a soft water landing. We don't want the landing we just saw.
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:38.800]   So we're 26 days. The countdown to cruise selection is on. We're 26 days off. If you want to secure
[02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:43.280]   your seat, I'll give him a little laddier. Go to inspiration4.com. Josh, show this. Show the
[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:50.560]   screen real quick. If you click secure your seat, you can donate to St. Jude or start a
[02:25:50.560 --> 02:25:55.200]   shift for shop because of course it's shift for the Hispanic for this and post your inspirational
[02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:58.160]   business story on Twitter for the opportunity to secure the seat representing prosperity.
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:02.560]   There's a seat for prosperity and a seat for generosity. Or I wonder if it's based on how
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:08.400]   much you give to St. Jude. Well, anyway, 26 days. You know, I probably shouldn't do this right
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:11.600]   after the rocket ship explodes because maybe that's not the best. Under so, under so.
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:16.560]   Spaces are opening up. This one will be safe. Now this makes me a little nervous. The mission
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:19.920]   will be commanded by Jared Isaacman, the 37 year old founder and chief executive officer of
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:24.720]   Shif-4 payments. Oh, and an accomplished pilot, the adventurer. All right. All right. Well, that's
[02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:27.920]   okay. I could have been thinking of a different mission. There's another similar mission.
[02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:30.800]   Which the leader of the crew is actually a former ISS commander.
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:35.040]   Yeah, no, this is the first commercial space. And it's a bit of a highly commercial.
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:38.240]   Apparently, here's a picture of your fabulous seat aboard the inspiration for.
[02:26:38.240 --> 02:26:41.520]   Jared will probably be in this one, you know, where the steering wheel is. And then
[02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:46.240]   the other two are slightly larger. Maybe that's just a closer, I don't know. Meet the crew. Look
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:50.880]   at that. See, there's generosity, prosperity and hope. I don't know how you get into the
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:56.880]   hope seat. That looks like it's kind of those strippers. You'll be Jared in three strippers.
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:00.560]   Oh, sure. Why not? It's kind of amazing when you think about it that our kids are probably going to
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:04.320]   do low orbit space flight as commuting. Like, you know, to get from one side of the earth to the
[02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:10.240]   other. Like six hours. SpaceX's first mission with an all civilian crew. And I love it that the
[02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:13.840]   three out of the four will be, you know, put the picture from the general public.
[02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:17.680]   I just want to know how much of how much internet access is on the ISS.
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:23.120]   There's actually NASA has a document commercial and marketing pricing policy.
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:27.760]   So when there's a commercial habit on the ISS, there's actually a price list of like what you get
[02:27:27.760 --> 02:27:33.440]   charged, including like $11,250 per group per day for life support, $22,000, $22,500,
[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:38.400]   $25,000 for crew supplies, food, air, provision, supplies, medical kit, exercise equipment, etc.
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:42.000]   Data down like is $50 per gigabyte. So wow. Competitive with the cruise industry.
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:45.120]   Yes. That's right. I remember the last deep cruise. It was that much. Yes, exactly right.
[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:51.120]   Scooter X is admonishing me that Jared is a very accomplished pilot. He races jets. But
[02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:54.080]   I understand that I tell very much that really let him drive.
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:57.280]   He's just going to be sitting there. I'm guessing. But maybe I'm running the computers
[02:27:57.280 --> 02:28:00.880]   to do both of the driving at this point. I would guess. Yeah. He has several records.
[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:03.840]   Scooter X tells me, including a speed around the world flight, the race money for the Make-A-Wish
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:07.840]   Foundation, he's flown in more than 100 air shows with the Black Diamond Jet Team. So we know he's
[02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:12.480]   brave and a decade ago. His castle run. Yeah. A decade ago in Kowakow,
[02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:14.920]   uh... drachan international strength pilots for the armed forces
[02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:15.880]   so it's basically the pilot
