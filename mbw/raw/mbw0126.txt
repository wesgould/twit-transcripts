[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   and a great show planned for you today with a great cast.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Let's start with Horse Bowed, but not unbroken.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Mr. Alex Lindsey from Pittsburgh.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Hello.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   You're a little horse today.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   I'm a little horse.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I did a little yelling.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   That's a little excited.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Congratulations to your Steelers.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   That was a good game.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Yeah, baby.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   I hope Kurt Warner comes back another year because he was amazing.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   He says he might be done.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   He says he might be done.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I can't believe he can leave.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I mean, I am somewhat on a high note, but I mean, he was amazing.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to say thanks to the great Jeff Smith.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   We now do all have jingles.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   And here's yours, Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Oh, man.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Also from the Chicago very special.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   From the Chicago.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   From the Chicago sometimes.

[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Hello, Andy.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And the not go.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   That's really good.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   It sounds like you'd call him if you had drains, drain problems.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   It's in my nine out by five.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   If you've got drain problems, who do you call?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And the Tennessee Ernie Ford rendition of which way the goose goes.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Speaking of which, there he is.

[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   You are the man.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   He did a really, really nice job.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Of course, me.

[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I thought that was pretty appropriate, wasn't it?

[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   He's amazing.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Great Jeff Smith.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So Frederick, you've even got your own.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I like it.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Insert name here.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I want that one exclusively for me.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I'm the only special guest.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Everyone else can be guest.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I'll be the special guest.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Special guest.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   All right.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I think we got everybody.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Big cast today.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   It's great to have you all.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Big story.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And I don't actually, Frederick, you'd be a good person to address this.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   It's used to work for the Big A.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Which Big A?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Both Big A's.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Both Big A's.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Well, I don't know.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Apple's rumors that Adobe's going to do Flash for Apple, then Adobe's CEO says, well, it's harder than we thought, but we've been working on it.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And apparently Apple's helping out, which is the big, I guess the big story.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I guess the big question would be, what has Apple said about that?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Has Apple officially said that they're helping out with that?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Not a word.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   You know, until Apple says, hey, you know, we're doing Flash on the iPhone, then, you know, I'm going to take everything with a grain of salt, you know, because, uh...
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Because they've kind of said, don't be said this before.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I've ever heard this before, honestly.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   You know, we've heard this in the beginning, you know, working on it, working on it, working on it.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   But until I hear it from the horse's mouth, the people that actually make the hardware that it's going to be running on, you know, I hope it's coming.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   It's just wishful thinking on my part.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   It seemed like this was, you're right.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I mean, Adobe said it right away when the iPhone was announced, and then, didn't Apple poo poo it at that time?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Did Apple respond in any way at that time?
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Apple's talked a lot about the amount of CPU and battery power that Flash would take this for.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Well, that's what Apple says.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   The other issues, of course, are that as the iPhone grows, it undermines Flash because people can't get to certain parts of the web without, on your iPhone.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And a lot of us that are surfing on iPhone, you get to a page that is Flash and then you just don't come back.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   But, you know, on that, how can you render a Flash, you know, like a big Flash file in that?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   I wonder about the experience on the iPhone.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Of course, I want Flash, I'm with the video and all that.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Is it already with YouTube and now you stream, isn't it playing H.264 video?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I mean, it flashed that much harder to do.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   The difference is, remember that Apple has full access to all the hardware and all the graphics acceleration.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   I was surprised to find out that talking to the folks at Sling, that the reason why they were having such problems moving the Sling Player software to the iPhone wasn't that Apple was blocking it for bandwidth issues, but because they wouldn't allow the company to have access to
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   hard work, graphics acceleration, they had to basically develop their own routines to really exploit the full potential of the iPhone.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   So that's going to be a really uphill battle, just an uphill technical problem for Adobe if they don't have active involvement from Apple.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   So in other words, we shouldn't get all excited.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   I know.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   This is not really a...
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   It's not news until Apple says it.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   It's not news until I see an official joint press release from the two companies.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   We heard, I mean, I was covering this story back when I was doing the Apple phone show and nothing's changed.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   All right.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Well, never mind.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   I thought that was the big story of the day, but apparently I'm happy to poo poo that for you.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I was just sad.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Next.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   How about this Apple planning, dual and quad core iMacs according to CNET?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   This is actually, they're quoting an analyst, Sean Woo of Kauffman Brothers.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   He believes in iMac refresh is just around the corner.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I think Apple has resolved his dilemma over using quad or dual core processors by creating two tiers.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   A high-end, I think a high-end iMacs a great idea.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I know.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I know.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   You'd buy, yeah.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   I buy one.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Frederick, you do like the idea.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I've been holding out for an iMac forever.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   We have this thing streamed when I wanted it.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   That's what I wanted.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   It's really nice.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   But it's dual.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Be nice to have the quad.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   We have four tools and we would get more.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Are they fast enough for encoding and editing and the stuff that you do?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   We don't push that.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   I think we have four of the dual iMacs and then we have five Mac Pros, eight-proc Mac Pros.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   We do the heavy work on the Mac Pros because they have 10 gigs of RAM and a RAID 0 built into
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   them.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   The heavy work is done there but a lot of the editing, just the day-to-day editing stuff,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.800]   once it's been compressed, once it's been keyed and ready to be edited, these machines are
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.800]   right.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.800]   Who needs the desktop machines right now?
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.800]   Who are those four?
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.800]   Well, if you can do all this stuff.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.080]   Well, that's, I think why they haven't done this to now is that you still need to have
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.800]   a Mac Pro market and if you put the quad, I guess...
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.800]   No, I mean, the thing is we would still be buying Mac Pros.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.800]   What would you get with a...
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.800]   We get car...
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.800]   But we get car...
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.800]   So number one is like a...
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.800]   It's a big fast RAIDs, big channel.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.800]   But you're a bit of a car...
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.800]   You're a bit of a top edge though.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   But that's what those are...
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   I mean, that's what they're for.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.800]   It's Firewire 800 not enough.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.800]   You need SAS or something like that too.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   I mean, we're now starting to move to E-SATA for a lot of our stuff.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.800]   E-SATA is still a fiber channel.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.800]   Fiber channels are built into a bunch of the machines and then we're kind of moving to
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.560]   E-SATA as a four channel, E-SATA for a lot of machines.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.280]   Some people want display options that you obviously can't have if you're going to use
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.280]   an iMac.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.280]   That's true.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.280]   That's my point.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.280]   External displays and all that.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.280]   But for me, that's the holy grail right now.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.280]   It's only neat.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.560]   I had a 30 inch display and the Mac Pro under the table.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.280]   It was just a little too big and it's 24 inch with...
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.280]   It's just a nice thing.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.600]   I think I'm more concerned about it as a Pro user.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.080]   I'm more concerned about the specter of having less than...
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.480]   Apple not spending less and less energy on those Mac Pros.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.520]   Well, that's right.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.760]   That's the thing I'm concerned about because we do need them.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   We need them for what we do.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.240]   Well, this isn't confirmed.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.960]   Although Apple apparently did send out a note to resellers that shipments of the existing
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.120]   24 inch iMacs will slow down in coming weeks, which is usually...
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.920]   I think Apple's big goal is to keep the price point of the iMac exactly the same year after
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:49.920]   year.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.120]   That's always going to be a case of if the more expensive processor suddenly becomes
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.280]   cheap enough that you can continue to sell a $1,500 iMac by putting a quad core in there,
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.280]   that's what they're going to do.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.880]   It's never going to be about performance.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.880]   It's going to be about...
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.600]   Well, I know that we can do a $1,000 iMac now, but we really would rather have the extra
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.600]   500 bucks.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.600]   Isn't that true?
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.600]   Anyone?
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.600]   Bueller?
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.600]   I'm right.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.600]   Yes, I win.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.800]   It's their cricket sound here.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.120]   I could do that, but I won't.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.680]   People are...
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.800]   The pro customers are so persnickety that they're not going to put up with an iMac that doesn't
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.560]   have the seven.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.760]   They don't want eight firewire 800 points.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.160]   They want seven of them because they know there's a case for how you get more performance
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.720]   out of seven than out of eight.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.240]   There's going to be nothing but a big storm about how Apple really, really just booted
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.160]   this entire thing by only giving them seven instead of eight.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:51.400]   I would speak for, hopefully, photographers and me as a photographer, that is pretty much
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.200]   what I need, whether you're running Aputure or Lightroom or Bridge or whatever.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.000]   Is it monitor good enough to gamut and everything?
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   It's good enough.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.240]   It's good enough.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.240]   I'm running it.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:06.160]   We have every Mac computer platform pretty much ever made here, and I use the iMac 24-inch
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.400]   top of the line machine as my day-to-day computer.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.400]   Yeah, me too.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   I love it.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.400]   I really love it.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.440]   It's a picture on it, and it performs quite well.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:19.320]   Of course, I do have the maximum RAM upgrade on it, which is four gigs instead of two.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:24.240]   But otherwise, it's a standard top of the line iMac, and I love it.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.920]   I love the way it works, and it doesn't take up a lot of room.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.880]   Right now, we just had to buy a whole new desk because we expanded our office, and we
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.200]   had to buy a whole new desk to handle the Mac Pros that we do use for it.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.280]   You need a desk like this.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.120]   I have the world's largest desk.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.120]   You do.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.120]   I've been a massive.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.120]   It's the U-1.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.120]   I love it.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.120]   It's like the Starship Enterprise.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.120]   I was going to say that.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.120]   It looks like the Enterprise.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.120]   That's what you need.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.520]   Yeah, if you've got a lot of Mac Pros, that's what you need.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.480]   If you've got an iMac 24, you need the smallest computer desk you can buy at Office Depot.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.480]   Right.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:02.680]   Tom Krazit, who writes the Apple column for CNET, points out that in the quarterly results,
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:07.680]   25% decline in shipments on the desktops, 31% decline in revenue.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.280]   So the desktops have not been doing well.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.120]   I presume that includes the iMac.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.520]   Well, they need to do something to refresh that line.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.160]   Let's also mention, though, that Tom isn't always right on the ball there because he's
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.440]   not mentioning the equivalent fall in Windows desktops.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.680]   Yeah, but Apple laptops were up.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.600]   Well, that's what I was about to say.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.960]   Laptops in general is a category are up.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.960]   I see.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.960]   I don't think it's not.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.760]   It's not that Apple needs to do anything to address it.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.240]   It's just the way it is.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.160]   It's the desktop market is dwindling.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.760]   Whether you insert the name Apple Dell or whoever, it's the laptop.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.440]   It's sold two and a half million max.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:51.040]   Well, and I think that the issue is that for 95% of the population or 90 to 95% of the
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.360]   population, laptop will do just about everything you needed to do.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.600]   Portables are 71% of Apple's sales.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.080]   Especially the new portables are so powerful.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.080]   Yeah, I really like that.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.600]   I mean, if you look, you know, Leo, look back at anything you bought, your top of the
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.400]   line desktop machine three years ago.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.400]   Oh, yeah, you're right.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.400]   They're better.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.000]   They're a merit to a mid to top range laptop.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.480]   It's not even close.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.160]   No, you're right.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:21.000]   Apple also succeeding in the iPhone world just clobbering RIM and the BlackBerry.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.040]   The latest stats in Verizon's first quarter of selling the touchscreen BlackBerry storm,
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.680]   the iPhone killer.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.880]   It was OK.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.880]   Not great.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.640]   They sold half a million compared to 1.9 million iPhones.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.320]   Remember the 1.9 million wasn't during the launch for the iPhone.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.120]   It was just it's just.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.720]   And this is this is a hundred million dollar ad campaign from Verizon saying we've got
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.880]   the BlackBerry killer.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.920]   Now, RIM says we are cranking out, you know, half a million storms a week.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.120]   So I don't know what they're doing with all of them.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.960]   And I'm sending them to my mother.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.960]   Put them in the basement.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.800]   Yeah, and it is sometimes a slow.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.800]   The other phones.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.200]   I have to say having used this storm, it is in an iPhone killer.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.360]   It's in fact, a lot of people use the storm complain about it.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.240]   That's so totally unfair.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:11.840]   My new policy is that I'm not going to judge a phone as an iPhone killer unless the company
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.160]   that makes it actually says, oh my God, you're going to want to laser a braid that Apple
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.760]   tattoo right off your, right off your, your bicep because this is the thing that's going
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.120]   to kill all iPhones.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:26.960]   I really do think that the storm's purpose was just to give happy BlackBerry users a better
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.280]   media experience.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.440]   People who like the BlackBerry software and like the email service but want to be able
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.320]   to view photos and have a better web experience and have a better movie experience.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.320]   Okay.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.480]   I love her when yes.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.920]   Flaw is victory.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:46.760]   I think there were a lot of people and I don't know whether it was BlackBerry but I
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.200]   mean, I don't know if it's RIM but it seemed like a lot of people were.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.320]   I thought that RIM was really selling this or, you know, as a, as a iPhone killer.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.720]   You know, they were talking about it being this is going to be their answer to the iPhone
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.400]   and this was supposed to be the thing.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.280]   It was going to, you know, and, you know, I don't know.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.280]   But again, it didn't turn out.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.320]   I think a lot of them are missing the point though.
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:10.800]   I mean, the iPhone, the iPhone isn't just a phone that's got rearranged buttons.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   It's a life.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   It's an experience.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.800]   It's a whole, it's a platform.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.800]   It's a platform.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.880]   It's a device that could be anything based on the software that's in it and the, you
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:25.320]   know, the app store, frankly, is, you know, unbeatable right now in a lot of ways with
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.800]   these apps that keep coming up on there and make you want to buy them for 99 cents a
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.280]   pop, you know, who's going to beat that right now?
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.880]   You know, hopefully, you know, there'll be some competition, but overall, I'm like,
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.920]   you know, what everything I need to do is write in this little thing right now.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.400]   What about AT&T's 3G speed?
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:46.320]   Two more lawsuits today claiming that the speed and infrastructure of HSDPA on the AT&T
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.960]   network are insufficient.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.520]   They're filed in Florida and Texas.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:56.320]   I will say that after being in Japan, the 3G in the United States is closer to edge than
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.080]   it is to the 3G that I experienced in Japan.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.280]   Tasted real speed, have you?
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.880]   Yeah, I've tasted the real juice.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.960]   And it's really fast in Japan.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.200]   AT&T's is the slowest of the 3G network.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.760]   Well, no, T-Mobile's the slowest, but they barely have 3G.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:13.760]   Right.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.120]   Then AT&T, Sprint and Verizon have it, or eat them up.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.160]   I mean, the EVDO, I have a Verizon EVDO modem.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.160]   It's much faster.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.160]   My laptop.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.160]   And that's what I'd say.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.160]   That would make a big difference.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.160]   So I'm getting 100.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.680]   I'll get 250K per second.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.440]   A lot of times 150 is what I expect.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.520]   250 is what I get on a good day.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.680]   What do you need a lit speed on your phone for?
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.680]   No, that's on my laptop.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.680]   On the laptop.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.680]   I mean, on my phone.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.840]   But on the phone, what are you using high speed for?
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:38.840]   Streamy video.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.680]   Well, even just, I mean look.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.680]   We're using to--
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.680]   We're spoiled.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.680]   We want the web to pop up now.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.680]   But I also make--
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.680]   I just want my email to come down faster.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.680]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.680]   You're a little low.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.680]   That's why everybody's talking all over you.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.320]   Oh, I'll give myself a little bit more presence.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.320]   Holy cow.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.120]   The voice of God, Andy.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.920]   Right in your ear, though.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.720]   It actually fits the jingle quite nicely.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.720]   I think it's--
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.720]   Andy, a nautical.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.720]   Ha, ha.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.360]   Hey, you know, by the way, before we go on, I want to ask Jeff
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.920]   to make an entire song based on that, please.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.520]   It really is.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.520]   It does beg.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.520]   It begs to have more.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.520]   I have to not go.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.520]   He's the man to go, Andy, a nautical.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.520]   Andy, a nautical.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.520]   Record us.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.720]   It's going to be a techno song, I know.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.680]   No, Scott, we don't understand is that because you
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.680]   sung that song.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.920]   Right now, people are putting that into Microsoft songs.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.280]   But actually, the time that show is over with--
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.280]   They'll be a clip software.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.040]   --we will have a fully orchestrated clip.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.680]   I'm going to mail Andy some glow sticks.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.280]   And they're not--
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.280]   Oh, he's the man.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.920]   Actually, what will happen is they'll take my voice, sample it,
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:49.280]   and it will turn out to be Sting singing a reggae song.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.520]   Did you see that Gmail has optimized?
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:58.400]   It's Google Tasks for iPhone now?
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.800]   I have to say, I'm really impressed.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.000]   The data the tasks in the Google Labs in December,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.440]   if you haven't used Gmail with Tasks,
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.000]   it's you have to go to the Labs section and add the tasks.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.720]   And now they've optimized it to the iPhone, which
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.920]   is one way of getting to do this on the iPhone.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.360]   I have to say, Google's been very responsive to the iPhone.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.320]   I remember talking when I was waiting in line for the first
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.520]   iPhone to two guys who'd spent--
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.080]   from Google, who'd stayed up all night getting Google Reader
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.720]   to work best on the iPhone interface.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.880]   They really care about that.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.480]   I did notice that a lot of the stuff they're
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.600]   doing in their web is not necessarily iPhone-specific.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.320]   They're being even more clever than that.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.280]   They're producing really good mobile experiences
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.320]   that they can then deploy to BlackBerry people,
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.280]   to G1 users, to just spot everybody.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.240]   I noticed that when I test out these new phones
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.040]   with Google services, it's a very consistent experience
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.680]   from one to the other.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.400]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.600]   Good on you, Google.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.960]   I still-- my biggest problem is that most of the time
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.680]   when I'm dealing with all that stuff, I'm not connected.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.680]   That's why I'm working on it.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.320]   The whole Google thing right now, until they start building apps,
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.760]   I want things that will pull stuff down.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.280]   I want them to be active and be online when they're--
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.560]   when I'm online.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.280]   That's why you need good 3G.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.600]   I mean, that's why you need the speed,
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.400]   because you're doing stuff like that.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.480]   Well, that's what I was going to say.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.440]   When you have that-- you don't notice that speed
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.000]   when you don't have it available to you.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.720]   You can get along just fine, because most of the stuff
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.800]   you're pushing and downloading with the iPhone
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.960]   is just text anyway.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.240]   But once you have a really good connection like that,
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.560]   suddenly using a service like box.net
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.280]   and keeping so much of your media and so many of your files
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.320]   off-- excuse me-- on a central network thing
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.880]   becomes so much more plausible, because I myself
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.320]   have a big, big 15 gigabyte folder of movies and movies
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.720]   and music and all kinds of stuff that I don't necessarily
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.760]   want to waste some of my 16 gigs of internal memory on.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.880]   But I certainly want to have every single episode
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.080]   of the bugle available to me if I suddenly
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.440]   decide that I want to see-- I want to hear issue number three
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.960]   again.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.800]   And along with this, remember Apple was--
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.200]   when they announced-- I guess it's at WWDC,
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.880]   they announced that they were not going to allow background
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.320]   processing, but we'll have this push feature.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.520]   So if you're an IM client and you get shut down,
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.880]   because you can't be running while the phone rings,
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.560]   we'll keep track of what's happening,
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.040]   and then we'll push that data out to you when you come back.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.880]   Never ever was released, as far as I know.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.800]   I'm trying to think of one single instance, which I see
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.640]   that's actually working.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.080]   No.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.040]   And according to Arnold Kim running today in Mac Rumors,
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.400]   he says, "It's clear something's holding up
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.400]   the push notification service.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.320]   While we aren't sure what the specific issues are,
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.520]   we've heard that as an alternative,
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.800]   Apple's considering allowing apps to run as user-selectable
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.640]   background processes."
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.840]   Steve Jobs did say it's, quote, "running a bit late,"
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.200]   and it's not working.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.160]   He couldn't get mobile me.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.800]   He worked-- I think it's probably a little much--
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.360]   First get email working.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.120]   It's on the core fundamentals.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.760]   So the rumor that Arnold's spreading here says that--
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.240]   and Arnold, by the way, as you know,
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.920]   he's been on the show several times,
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.680]   and he really is careful not to stay
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.040]   safe stuff that isn't fairly well substantiated,
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.880]   is that in 3.0, there'll be some background processing,
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.080]   but limited to one or two on the current hardware,
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.840]   and the next generation iPhone could then do more, perhaps.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.840]   I think that's something I would love to see on the iPhone.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:25.600]   That would be another surprising gimme from Jobs.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.200]   Well, it seems like we just keep on-- we know where it's going,
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.440]   and you just wait for it to happen,
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.600]   and then when it happens, of course, it explodes.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.120]   Once you're given that piece.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.600]   But I do think that it'll have a surprising effect
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.120]   on people's battery performance.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.040]   I think that's the issue, is that people will suddenly
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.520]   realize that they're getting half the performance.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.880]   They just forget in terms of performance.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.560]   The performance on 2.2 has been stellar.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.080]   They've really much better--
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.280]   They fixed it.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.480]   So maybe if they do the same thing they did with location
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.720]   services and 3G, if I have the ability
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.200]   to turn off background processes to extend better life,
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.200]   as long as I have control--
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:56.920]   There you go.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.360]   Give us a switch.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.800]   And also, that would take care of my fear
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.520]   that it would make my iPhone experience a lot less stable.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.280]   PCs have done this for years, where you get to choose the power.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.800]   Crashing?
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:10.840]   Huh?
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.440]   Crashing, yeah.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.440]   Crashing, yes.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.560]   Stable.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.800]   That's a process.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.800]   One of their signature features, as a matter of fact.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.800]   Where you get to choose-- hey, I'm on battery.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.080]   I want it to be this way.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:22.760]   Max do it too.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.840]   But I mean, it's power profiles.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.760]   There's no reason why you couldn't do that on a phone.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.040]   That's how you save battery life.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:34.160]   Top social brands of 2008, according to Vitru.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.360]   We've been advertising social.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.960]   V-I-T-R-U-E.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.520]   They couldn't get virtue, so they said we're Vitru.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.520]   We've got no real--
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.040]   It's already actual.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.960]   The reason why I don't want any of my RRA funds invested
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.800]   in this kind of--
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.800]   Vitru.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.520]   Social advertising.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.880]   So the number one social brand-- this is the first ever list.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.360]   But I'm just trying to see-- oh, methodology.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.520]   OK.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.000]   The virtue-- I'm sorry.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.040]   The Vertrue 100 is the result of Vertrue's daily analysis
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.360]   of over 2,000 popular brands.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.600]   Every day, Vertrue analyzes the online conversations
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.680]   on a variety of social networking, blogging, microblogging,
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.680]   photo, and video sharing sites.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.440]   Then our amazing patented calculator
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.560]   scores about-- figures scores about the brand's social
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.280]   conversations.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.160]   We apply a series of algorithms to reflect the frequency
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.440]   of usage, the size of the social media environment,
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.880]   and the magnitude of the conversation.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.800]   The result--
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.300]   Next.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.760]   Next.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.120]   What is it?
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.240]   They need their own jingle.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.040]   They do.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:34.560]   Vertrue.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.960]   So impressive.

[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.320]   You're a funny little girl, though.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.320]   You're a funny little girl, though.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.340]   You're a funny little weird.
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:15.220]   No, it's all weird.
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.060]   In fact, there's two of them.
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.620]   There's like a serious one and then there's a happy one.
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.860]   And then you spread the chia paste on his hair,
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.080]   on his head, where his hair would be,
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.920]   and he grows green hair.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.120]   Is that a little weird?
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.360]   Apparently some companies have not had talks
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.260]   with their lawyers about a little thing called
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.060]   the right of publicity.
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:31.900]   I don't know.
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.560]   For the president, you can't you make anything you want?
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.400]   I think you feel happy.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.240]   Absolutely not.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.160]   No, you gotta be fair, Gary.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.060]   Absolutely not.
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:40.560]   The right of publicity, every human being in the United States
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.740]   has the right of publicity,
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.700]   have the right to control your own likeness
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.000]   used for commercial purposes.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:45.840]   Period.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.740]   Now there's a little bit of leeway on the president,
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.340]   but not much.
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.720]   Well, if anybody wants to make a Leo Chia pet,
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.920]   I promise not to sue.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.460]   In fact, if anybody wants to,
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.220]   I will help you do it.
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.420]   (laughing)
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.220]   We have poses for the model, okay?
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.060]   I'm ready.
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.160]   Yeah, here you go.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.660]   We have a 3D Leo up there.
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.900]   Actually, this is kind of interesting.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:05.940]   This is a-- Oh, yeah, look at that.
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.900]   Yeah, they use software to make a 3D model there.
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:10.740]   The bustle Leo.
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.580]   And then they--
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.420]   It's a pretty printer.
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.260]   And they print it.
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.100]   Yeah.
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:14.940]   You know what that is?
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:15.780]   It's kind of weird.
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.620]   I can't remember the name of the company.
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.700]   It prints it out of some sort of resin.
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:18.700]   It's out of resin.
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:19.540]   Yeah.
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.380]   You can do it out of a cornstarch or resin.
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.260]   They start tattooing your name on their arm.
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.380]   We're really gonna get upset.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.620]   Oh, we got two people with twit tattoos.
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.700]   Okay.
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.540]   There you go.
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.620]   East Coast Girl has a twit tattoo.
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:29.780]   And I think Jammerby,
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:31.140]   I can't remember who the other one is,
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.140]   has a twit tattoo.
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:37.220]   Anyway, okay, finally, on March 17th, St. Patrick's Day.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.940]   So you can all start doing your Irish Lucky Charms
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:42.820]   had accents here.
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:46.420]   The following items will officially be deemed vintage

[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.140]   All Vintage.
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.140]   I think I have all those.
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:06.980]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:07.820]   See?
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:08.660]   I'm getting very vintage.
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:10.220]   You remember that pretty Quicksilver?
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:11.660]   That was the one, that was the first one
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.420]   that had that door that would open on the side
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.260]   that really looked like.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.100]   You were like, oh.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.540]   (groaning)
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:17.380]   Shiny.
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.740]   Oh, that was the first one that did that.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.060]   Maybe it was.
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.740]   You keep all your old gear, Alex?
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:25.180]   We run it, they become like key servers.
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.300]   I mean, they go until they die.
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.740]   They literally, they'll just go in and die.
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.980]   Good, 'cause I have a dual G5 upstairs, Mac Pro.
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:32.820]   I don't know what to do with it,
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:33.660]   so you can maybe help me.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.420]   We take the G5s, we actually send to Africa.
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:37.260]   So we have--
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.100]   I'll send to Africa.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:38.940]   Yeah.
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.100]   Yeah, we send your next batch.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.700]   There's a church in Hooraras and Broadway.
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:42.540]   It's fantastic.
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.380]   I'd love to do that.
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:44.220]   But we send them to.
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.060]   We'll send the next batch out.
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:45.900]   Okay.
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:46.900]   They could find the first 24 minutes.
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.740]   Well, they have training.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.420]   They had, they had, here's what happened was,
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.340]   is we got to the church.
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:53.180]   And it was, we were just touring locations
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.180]   that are doing training in Harari.
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.900]   And they had three PCs there that they were doing training on.
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.540]   So people can come in and learn how to do web design
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:00.380]   and everything else.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.620]   And I said, where's the Macs?
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.180]   And they said, well, we don't have any Mac and Tasha's.
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.300]   And so we actually partnered with the--
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.380]   That's awesome.
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:12.140]   Solution Center, which is the Mac dealer in Harari.
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:15.660]   So we send them, we send Solution Center our G5s,
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.940]   and then they make sure that they're working well.
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.220]   And like, the three G5s, I think, ended up
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.820]   with two working G5s.
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.660]   And then they give them to the church.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:27.060]   And the church is then able to do more graphics related stuff.
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.020]   So--
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:28.780]   Fantastic.
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:29.780]   That's what we do with G5s.
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.300]   Now we know the Mac mini.
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.220]   Yes.
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.100]   Let me in.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:33.620]   Yeah.
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.380]   This is going to become the-- suddenly, your office here
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.380]   is going to be full of G5s.
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:38.140]   Full of all Macs.
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:39.220]   And you just get a palette?
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:39.700]   What do you do?
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.420]   Do you get a planner?
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.460]   We send them to Atlanta and then Solution Center is--
[00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.540]   The shipping is expensive.
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:47.580]   Well, Solution Center has other shipments going in.
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.020]   OK, so you put in the container.
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.780]   So it's just part of a larger shipment.
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:54.300]   But we only have to get it to Atlanta.
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.980]   I always think of a Yule Brenner.
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:56.980]   So I just need to get my--
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:16.420]   It's a Billy Crystal doing Yule
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.420]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.420]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.420]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.420]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.060]   Nobody should make it like an audible dream
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:27.500]   with my voice in it.
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:28.140]   Well, we did.
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.820]   Jason Calicanis.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.180]   It's time for our Audible thing of the week.
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.460]   I love Jeff Smith.
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.980]   Jeff Smith is a god.
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:40.740]   And I think his site is the G-E-O-F-F Smith.com.
[00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.220]   Hey, Jeff, guess what, man?
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.820]   You just won yourself a free copy of "Crain's and the Fire."
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:45.140]   Missed it.
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.060]   Oh, you're kidding.
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:46.700]   Thank you.
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:47.540]   I'm going to send him one.
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.900]   Oh, that is really nice.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.460]   Make sure you get in touch with me, Jeff.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:51.340]   You deserve it, buddy.
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.780]   Oh, that is really nice.
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:55.380]   We'll make sure that-- I'll send Jeff an email to say,
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:56.580]   get your freebie.
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.620]   That is the most beautiful print, by the way.
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.740]   There's only eight of them left, so it's a sacrifice.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:01.540]   But he deserves it.
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:02.860]   Oh, you're very nice.
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:03.340]   Thank you, Scott.
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.020]   Well, that's the guy's done so much for us.
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:05.980]   I know.
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:06.260]   I know.
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:06.860]   He's wonderful.
[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:07.340]   And he's--
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.340]   And it's clear to me that he makes his living,
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.500]   or at least could, from this.
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.500]   He owns a bar.
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.620]   Oh, well, he could make his living.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:15.540]   No, he does make his--
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.900]   I don't know if he makes his living from jingles,
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:17.900]   but he does do jingles.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.260]   He plays lots of jingles.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:20.540]   It's a piano bar.
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.020]   He has his own piano bar.
[00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.660]   It's the dream of every Billy Joel to have your own--
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:25.580]   Where's the piano bar?
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:26.700]   It's in Nashville.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:27.380]   We should all go there.
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.740]   He does concerts on the--
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.260]   We should do a live Mac break weekly there.
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:31.780]   All right.
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:33.340]   Everybody in Nashville, we'll bring the G4s.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.820]   We can show up with Atlanta while we're down there.
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.500]   Be great.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.900]   Anyway, audible.com/macbreak.
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:40.940]   I've got two deals for you.
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:42.580]   First of all, if you're already an audible member,
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.660]   that Twit Habits deal is still good,
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:45.900]   but only through the 15th.
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.740]   So if you want to get these seven habits of highly
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.700]   affected people, this is for people who are already
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.100]   audible members, although you could join today and get it.
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:57.980]   Go to audible.com/twithabits, T-W-I-T-H-A-B-I-T-S,
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:59.060]   and you can download it.
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.940]   You'll notice the cost, zero.
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.100]   It's just-- Audible does this a lot.
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.820]   I really admire them.
[00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.580]   They give away books, but they also
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.700]   will do pro bono stuff.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.620]   You can get, for instance, the President Obama's inaugural
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:15.900]   address for free, stuff like that.
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.900]   It's one of the reasons to join Audible.
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.660]   Just to fill up your iPhone or your iPod, or your Zoom,
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:27.060]   should you choose with great material.
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.100]   That was to been born.
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.460]   They're doing a free Kurt Vonnegut short story right now,
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.220]   too, which is kind of neat.
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.580]   It's short story month.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:38.620]   You know where Kurt Vonnegut went to high school?
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.620]   No.
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:42.660]   At Arsenal Technical High School in Indianapolis, Indiana.
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:46.980]   And he went to high school with the same guy that's my dad.
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:47.740]   Wow.
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:48.940]   The same guy that's your dad.
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:49.300]   Wait a minute.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.140]   I'm trying to figure out--
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:52.060]   Is that the same as your dad?
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:52.940]   Yeah, I was just joking.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:56.220]   Yeah, he went to school with my dad as did.
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:58.060]   Derwood Kirby.
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.620]   Who nobody remembers.
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:00.380]   You and I remember.
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.300]   I remember Derwood Kirby.
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.100]   From candid camera.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.700]   So can you imagine a classroom with a guy who became a lawyer,
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.420]   a guy who became a television host,
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:12.060]   and a guy who was a twisted writer?
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:16.020]   Let's-- I'm just thinking, we should do a Mac break weekly road.
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.100]   Uh-oh, did you crash your Mac?
[00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.140]   I did.
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.100]   Alex was doing the one finger salute,
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.700]   where you press and hold the off button.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.140]   I haven't seen that in ages.
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.380]   Yeah.
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.220]   I was playing with the app that I'm going to recommend,
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.580]   and it's still unstable.
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:29.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.460]   I'm like, oh, I'm fucking new one.
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:32.620]   No, I'm still going to recommend it.
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:33.420]   It's still a good app.
[00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:34.980]   It just had to treat it nicely.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:35.580]   It's beta.
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:36.060]   It's beta.
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:37.780]   I'm just getting people excited about the beta.
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:41.820]   So Andy, do you have a recommendation for Audible
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:42.660]   today?
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:43.660]   Anything?
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.700]   I always have a recommendation for Audible, but you're amazing.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:46.980]   But if you've got something else
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.700]   that you want to put in the queue, I'll defer.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.580]   Well, let me give you one that--
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:53.540]   somebody reminded me that we should really plug this.
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:57.300]   Jeff Jarvis, who is a really brilliant observer.
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.220]   He's been around and media observer.
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.220]   He's been around in media for a long time.
[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:05.220]   I just think he's one of the best writers on the subject.
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.340]   I wrote a book, which I think just came out,
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.140]   but it is now available on Audible.
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:13.380]   What would Google do that I highly recommend?
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.820]   This is the sequel to, What Would Brian Botano Do?
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:16.740]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:20.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.060]   My brain had to search for that.
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:26.060]   Well, we were talking about seven habits of highly--
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:28.940]   you know, that was South Park.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.740]   The seven habits of highly effective people.
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.220]   Well, this is kind of the same idea.
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:37.780]   40 rules to manage and live by based on the success of Google.
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.540]   Jeff is a really acute observer.
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.020]   I think he is just a really smart guy.
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.580]   He's been writing about media for a long time and knows his stuff.
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.540]   And I would-- I think he reads it.
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:49.260]   This is next on my list.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:50.260]   I haven't listened to it yet.
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:51.940]   Let me play a little bit just so we can just
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:52.940]   hear a little bit of Jeff.
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.980]   He shares its own philosophy on its website,
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:58.900]   setting out the 10 things Google has found to be true.
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.540]   They are smart but obvious PowerPoint lines
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.300]   helpful in employee indoctrination, especially
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:08.460]   necessary when your head count explodes by 50% in a year
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:12.220]   to 16,000 at the end of 2007 and to 20,000
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.700]   before the end of the following year.
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:14.660]   What would Google do?
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.220]   Jeff Jarvis, it's our pick of the week.
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.620]   Now, you can get this absolutely free.
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.980]   You just go to audible.com/macbreak and sign up
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.660]   for a gold account with audible.com.
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.260]   And they'll give you a credit-- your first credit free.
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.260]   So you can see if the idea is-- try before you buy.
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:29.460]   See if this is something you'd like.
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.060]   I have a feeling it is.
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:32.700]   Audible saves my life every day.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:36.540]   Every time I have to get in the car or walk the dog or go to the gym,
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:37.540]   I listen to audible books.
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.140]   And I get so much reading done that way.
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:40.620]   I'm listening to Andy's recommendation
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:43.900]   from a few months ago, a team of rivals and just loving it.
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:44.100]   It's red.
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.580]   I didn't realize-- I thought this voice is familiar.
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.700]   And then I realized it's John Boy reading it.
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:52.500]   Which is a little weird.
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.660]   Your eyes are taking a nap.
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:54.660]   --and everything.
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:55.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.220]   That's an ex-residence.
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.540]   Richard Thomas, right?
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.060]   Is that his name?
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.500]   Something like that.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.980]   Anyway, what would Google do?
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:01.980]   He does a good job of it, though.
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.580]   And it's really fascinating to hear the parallels
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:09.020]   between the Lincoln-- 1860s Lincoln election
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.980]   and this one we just went through in many, many ways.
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.260]   Just fascinating.
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.500]   And boy, the trials of tribulations Lincoln
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.100]   and his team went through in the Civil War.
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:18.100]   Dramatic.
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:19.740]   But that would be another one.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.060]   But this is our recommendation today.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:21.540]   What would Google do?
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:24.220]   Get it free by going to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.140]   Now, once you've signed up, once you're an audible member,
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.340]   you can also get the Kurt Vonnegut short story,
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:31.220]   the seven habits of highly effective people,
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:32.220]   and more.
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.620]   Lots of great free content.
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:38.660]   Audible.com/macbreak to sign up, audible.com/twithabits.
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.380]   If you'd like to get that seven habits of highly effective
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.620]   people, absolutely free.
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:46.420]   Needless to say, none of us were involved in the highly
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:47.420]   effective people.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.820]   We're the seven habits of highly dysfunctional podcasters,
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:52.540]   I think, is the name of our show, our book.
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:53.860]   We should write that something.
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:55.660]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:39:09.980]   Credit where credit's due.
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.980]   I said a couple of episodes ago that that was Jeff.
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:13.740]   Also, that's not.
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.740]   It's Paul Minshall.
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:17.500]   Another guy's done a bunch of really good jingles for us
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.180]   at pollywood.com.
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.100]   Time for--
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.620]   Please come up and give about those jingles.
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:24.820]   All of them that we've heard so far is that as soon as the
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:28.540]   music ends, I just hear in my head, my head, member F. G. I.C.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:31.020]   They're that good.
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:31.620]   I'll point it out.
[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.740]   They're that good.
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:34.500]   All right, tell me--
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.940]   Don't let's my free hats.
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.940]   Time for our pick.
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.780]   Let's get the man with the free hat, Mr. Andy Anotko.
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:44.380]   By the way, if we ever do a tour, not just Nashville, we've
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.460]   got to go to the MIT flea market and do a show.
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:51.700]   Yes, as a matter of fact, I'm considering that the first
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:55.100]   MIT flea market of the season is going to be in April.
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:58.300]   And I'm considering doing a big tweet up afterwards.
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:01.820]   Oh, because I think that anybody who is anywhere near New
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.940]   England on the third Sunday of the month during the nice
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.860]   weather that we have here in New England needs to visit the
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.980]   MIT flea market.
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.620]   Because you may not ever want to come back because it is sort
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.180]   of an experience, it's sort of a scene, man.
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.100]   Like Woodstock, you're happy that you have seen it once.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.620]   There are people not everyone who want to see it twice.
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:23.940]   But for the rest of your life, you will have that thing in
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.740]   your office or your home that other people say, where the
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:27.860]   hell did you get that?
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:30.500]   And then you'll say, oh, there's this flea market at MIT.
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:36.180]   And yeah, after Obama came in, they killed the funding for
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.300]   the Head Explodeau Death Ray Project.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.140]   And so apparently this was the collector and miter array
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:42.140]   from it, I got a break.
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:49.020]   So it sounds like a fantasy, but I do think that--
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:51.820]   why watch what Dignation does with their live tours?
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.300]   And they draw 1,000 people.
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:55.540]   We've done a couple of them.
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:56.740]   We used to do Twitch.
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.380]   We did Twitch live for a while.
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:40:59.340]   And it was a while.
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:40:59.860]   It nearly killed us.
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.340]   Nearly killed us.
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:02.900]   Killed Pixel Quark because you're the guys who had to
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.700]   shoot it in the head of it.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.780]   Learned a little since then.
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.460]   And then we did some in San Francisco at the ZM, and
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.020]   that was cool.
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:12.860]   I'd like to do that.
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:13.860]   I really would like to do that.
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:14.460]   You should warn.
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:17.460]   Yeah, well, let's think about the MIT flea market and how we
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:18.860]   could all get out there.
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:21.260]   We could be one of those remotes they do on
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.660]   readers and Kathy Lee, where they build them a little stage.
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:26.380]   And we'll have our little directors chair and our
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.900]   lots of coffee, blue cards.
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:28.980]   We'll have a mug.
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.820]   People pretend that it's not terribly awkward.
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:33.780]   We're doing a show right in the middle of their event.
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:36.020]   We'll do it just like that.
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.100]   That sounds like great fun.
[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.900]   Andy, what's your pick this week?
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.660]   My pick is-- next or 10 minutes, please, because I had
[00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:46.900]   something that actually kind of went curfoldow on me.
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.700]   That sounds familiar.
[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.340]   It was one of those things where it's something that I
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:53.020]   started using like four days ago.
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.060]   And then while setting it up, it did something rather
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.580]   unexpected that made me think, maybe there's a reason why I
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:01.220]   tried not to recommend things I just found four days ago.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.220]   So come back to me, sir.
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.220]   I'll have something else for you.
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.300]   I do it all the time.
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.300]   I don't see why you shoot.
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:07.860]   I've got one that crashed.
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:08.860]   OK.
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:12.900]   And now with another product that you don't ever want to use,
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.700]   Mr. Alex Lazy.
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.580]   So this is just-- if people haven't downloaded it, you
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:19.380]   don't have to download the newest version, the one that I'm
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:20.500]   playing with right now.
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.300]   But it just-- because the new beta's out, it was, I think,
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.460]   it was a good opportunity to remind people that you really
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.020]   should download Google Earth.
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.700]   Have you guys told me one?
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:32.380]   You know, they had an event without Gore yesterday at the
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.380]   Hall of Science, the new Science Museum in San Francisco.
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:36.700]   And I was invited.
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.380]   Now I'm really credit.gov.
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.500]   No, I was lazy.
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:40.300]   It was my day off.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.300]   I thought, eh.
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:42.700]   But you know, it sounds really--
[00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:43.900]   I mean, they add--
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.580]   It's got bars in it.
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:46.980]   I don't even want the bars to get rid.
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:48.100]   But it's got underwater stuff now.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.300]   It's got a history.
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.340]   And it's got historical stuff built into it.
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.100]   And it's just one of those things that if you don't have
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:56.180]   Google Earth on there, you have to go out and get it,
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:58.220]   because you just have-- this experience just keeps on
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:59.660]   growing.
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.620]   What they're doing here is so revolutionary.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:04.580]   This used to be an application called Keyhole.
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:08.140]   And now at Google bot it a long time ago, and they just
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:09.220]   keep on adding to it.
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:12.940]   And especially when you start looking at--
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:14.300]   the new stuff is great.
[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.900]   When you start looking at what happens when you get to
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:19.980]   New York and some of the really high res 3D buildings and
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:22.140]   everything else, you're really starting to get a sense of
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.860]   how big this could really get.
[00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:27.100]   And especially when I'm traveling, I use it a lot to
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:28.140]   figure out where I'm going to go.
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.820]   And you can see photos from all over the world.
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:34.980]   It's just a great way to experience stuff around you
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.500]   and to plan stuff, because it's got lots of
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.180]   measurement tools.
[00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:39.060]   So a lot of times I can figure out how far
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:41.980]   something is from something else and do a lot of--
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:43.780]   it's not just gazing.
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:44.780]   I mean, you can get a lot out of it.
[00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:46.780]   Like for photographers as well, scouting out locations
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:47.820]   before you go.
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:48.300]   Exactly.
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.300]   You can zoom in and say, OK, this is where I'm going to
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:50.940]   try to shoot from.
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:52.740]   That might be the perfect vantage point.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:53.500]   Exactly.
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:54.900]   It's also a great toy.
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:55.460]   I mean, let's face it.
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:56.700]   Oh, it's a lot of fun.
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.700]   That's really a lot of it.
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.620]   I don't have any real use for it, but it's a wonderful toy.
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:01.380]   It is free.
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:02.620]   Now there's a pro version.
[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:04.500]   What's the difference, Ally?
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:06.700]   The pro version is going to let you--
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:08.540]   we've had it, and I've been looking actually getting it
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:09.820]   for what we do.
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:13.540]   But the pro version will let you do a lot of more of the tours
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:14.260]   and export stuff.
[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.060]   A lot of the stuff that you would see if you really want
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.060]   to use it commercially.
[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:21.820]   So if you want to do fly-ins and stuff for presentations
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:24.660]   and that type of thing, that's, I think, primarily what
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.300]   the pro version gives you.
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.500]   And it's something that we've tested, and it wasn't quite
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:30.260]   enough in the past.
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.300]   How much is it expensive?
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.100]   It's like $400.
[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.260]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.380]   But it does give you a lot of those extra tools.
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.660]   If you're just gazing, it's fine to use what you're using.
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:39.380]   If you're going to get serious about it and use it in your
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:42.500]   presentations or on TV or all those other things.
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:43.740]   It'll generate a little movie file.
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:47.780]   You can say, I want to go from here to here, and it'll run
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:49.820]   that movie out for you.
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.220]   And that's what--
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:52.940]   I don't know whether it's the pro version or the enterprise
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:55.140]   version, but that's a lot of what you see when you see
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:55.780]   newscasts.
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:58.340]   You always see that Google Earth on the bottom.
[00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:00.620]   So they're using that higher-end version to do those kind
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.940]   of fly-ins and so on and so forth.
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:04.340]   That's me.
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:04.700]   Sorry.
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:05.300]   I like that.
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:05.740]   That's good.
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:06.820]   That's better than a jingle.
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:07.340]   That's good.
[00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:09.220]   You should get them into your jingle for you.
[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:10.980]   Yes, thank you very much.
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.620]   Google Earth, the brand new--
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:13.420]   It's seven one, says--
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.100]   Five point-o, ready?
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.100]   With show.
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:15.620]   Yeah.
[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:16.460]   Is that 5.0?
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:17.260]   It's 5.0.
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:17.700]   Wow.
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.300]   That's the new one.
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:22.020]   The older version, I think, was 4.3, and it's not quite
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:22.660]   stable.
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:23.260]   Yeah.
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:24.660]   But the 5-- the 5.0.
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.780]   So go get 4.3 of you to don't have anything.
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.780]   But if you're feeling adventurous, if you're feeling
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:29.660]   lucky--
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.300]   So you're saying it's crashing a little bit?
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:32.060]   Oh, I crashed it.
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.580]   I'm not sure what I was--
[00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:35.140]   I'm really good at crashing programs.
[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:39.180]   So I'm very good at it.
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:39.740]   So--
[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:40.420]   What were you doing?
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.420]   Just so we know, what were you doing when I--
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:47.220]   I was playing around in a big underwater area
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:48.500]   outside of Australia.
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.540]   I was moving around and clicking on things.
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.940]   And I was trying to see how the underwater stuff looked.
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:54.460]   Underwater's really cool.
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:55.580]   But underwater, what could--
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.100]   I mean, it's just like what you would see--
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.180]   It was just showing trenches.
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:01.740]   It was identifying the trenches and showing a lot of those
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:02.100]   pieces.
[00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:04.220]   But using navel data under there, right?
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:04.740]   Yeah.
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:05.740]   Yeah.
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:08.020]   So give me something to search for.
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:09.980]   Well, I mean, the thing to really see what--
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:13.740]   I mean, beyond the new stuff, go to New York City.
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.580]   And make sure that the photo--
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:19.020]   make sure that the 3D buildings are set to photoreal.
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.580]   I want to see the history, though.
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:21.500]   How do you do the history?
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:24.100]   I haven't figured that out yet.
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:26.620]   That's just pretty amazing stuff.
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:27.340]   Just pretty amazing.
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:30.460]   3D buildings, street view, global awareness.
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:32.380]   What's global awareness?
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:33.860]   There's a global awareness layer.
[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:34.360]   Yeah, I know.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.100]   You can see stuff like-- I mean, if you're in Africa
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:38.940]   and you turn some of that on, you'll see the--
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:39.860]   really go into New York.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:41.660]   So look at this, Leo.
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:43.020]   I know people can't hear it.
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.020]   But see how--
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:44.940]   Oh, that's really cool.
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:46.420]   Now, are those texture map buildings--
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:47.260]   Are those done?
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:48.620]   Now, these are all built-- yeah.
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:49.780]   I've picked this before.
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:53.300]   All the buildings here are being built by Google SketchUp.
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.060]   And the two go very close together.
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:57.420]   Google SketchUp, by the way, is free.
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.860]   And it's-- so what you can do is you can build these buildings.
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:01.860]   And literally, you can be on a map and say,
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:04.620]   I want to send this section out to Google SketchUp,
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:06.700]   build out a building, texture it,
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:08.460]   and bring it right back into Google here.
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.860]   And those aren't loaded in yet.
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:12.420]   Yeah, some showing it on the screen
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:14.220]   for those who are watching our live video.
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.660]   But the texture maps haven't come in yet.
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:18.900]   Yeah, but as the textures come in,
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:22.100]   I mean, you really get a sense of where you are.
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.740]   You can see that, yeah, they're kind of progressive--
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:24.580]   Wow, look at that.
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:28.140]   And it's figuring out-- you can see it's doing drop shadows.
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:29.980]   And there's even cars on the street.
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.500]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:32.500]   But they're not moving.
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:33.340]   So look at that.
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:34.180]   I mean, that is--
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.860]   But of course, you can always click--
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:37.340]   and there's a little photo icons.
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:40.500]   And so they incorporate pictures from people's collection.
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:43.500]   So you can also click a picture and see an actual picture
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.020]   from that location.
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.540]   Now, you can also look up, right?
[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:48.100]   And look at the solar system.
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.980]   You can look at the sky or the moon and all that stuff, right?
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:52.740]   So it's not just Google Earth anymore.
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:54.300]   It's Google Uverse.
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:55.780]   They should change it to Google Uverse.
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:56.900]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:59.460]   But it's just--
[00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.660]   This is one of those must-have applications
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:02.940]   that you just should have on your app.
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:03.420]   But like I said--
[00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:04.420]   You can complain with it.
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:05.420]   It's a working progress.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:06.420]   It's a great toy.
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:07.420]   It is a great toy.
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:08.420]   But if you don't have to have a purpose for it--
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:09.900]   No, no, you don't have to have a purpose.
[00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:12.020]   But it's one of those things that you
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:15.060]   want to keep on paying attention to it.
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.060]   Because you use it as a toy now.
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:20.620]   But I use it a lot to figure out where I'm going to go
[00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:23.180]   and what it's going to look like when I get there.
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:28.180]   And I become very integral part of what I'm doing.
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:29.180]   And it'll have maps.
[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:31.100]   I mean, I can go to Harari's and Bob way and get maps.
[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:32.700]   And there's some 3D buildings there.
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:34.100]   And so on and so forth.
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:35.100]   It's pretty beautiful.
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.340]   I particularly use it when I'm trying to book a hotel
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:39.260]   and I'm trying to decide what kind of neighborhood it is.
[00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:40.180]   That's a good idea.
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:42.220]   What's going to be like to take a walk in that neighborhood
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:42.940]   and that sort of stuff?
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:43.500]   Yeah.
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.460]   That's a great idea.
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:46.540]   It really does dials you.
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:48.180]   It dials you when you think about what happens.
[00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:51.340]   What is this going to be like in five years when--
[00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:54.220]   It's not going to be a project where some company gets
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:57.780]   together and decides to build up models of the entire planet.
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.860]   It's going to be one guy decides, you know what?
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:01.340]   I want my office building models.
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:03.460]   So I'm going to spend 20 minutes doing that.
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:06.220]   But when you multiply that times, millions and millions
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:08.820]   of users, this is going to be an awesome thing in five years'
[00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:09.100]   time.
[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:09.940]   Well, and I think that's what you're
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:11.940]   seeing with New York because obviously it's
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:14.460]   a very densely populated area.
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:16.940]   So there is a lot of that already done.
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:19.980]   In 10 years, I would love to see something like second life
[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:22.620]   type technology overlaid into this where you can actually
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:24.060]   live in this virtual world.
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:24.460]   Yeah.
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:25.700]   Well, I think it's going to be important.
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:26.780]   There's going to be some breaking point
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:27.980]   where it's important for businesses
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:30.500]   to have their representation in Google Earth.
[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.940]   I think that's the idea there, too.
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.380]   That if you don't have your building there--
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:35.220]   because imagine being able to go there, click on the building
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:36.820]   and then get the information about the hotel
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:39.300]   or get the information about the store, what's there,
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:40.020]   so on, so forth.
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:41.660]   I think there's going to be some turning point
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:42.700]   when that actually happens.
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:44.780]   And I think it's going to be exciting.
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:47.100]   I'm going to fly into a spherical panorama now.
[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.580]   So I'll be back later.
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:51.780]   Mr. Scott Borne, you got to pick for us?
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:52.220]   I do.
[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:56.740]   And after all the hate mail I got last week about my new pick
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:59.180]   level of a Scott's or super seating in Alex.
[00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:02.820]   The most expensive pick ever.
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:04.100]   I decided to go back now.
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:05.100]   You didn't get hate mail.
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:06.060]   Come on.
[00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:07.780]   I get hate mail every week, but it's half the reason
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:09.820]   I come on the show, but it gives me something to last.
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:11.620]   Scott gets envy mail, not hate mail.
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:12.180]   OK.
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.500]   It's tongue and cheek, right?
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:14.100]   I mean, it's not.
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:15.180]   They don't really hate it.
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.420]   No, they want to kill me.
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:17.260]   They do.
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.620]   They want to kill me.
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:20.660]   No, Scott, don't miss me.
[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:21.900]   Yes, because you're paranoid.
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:23.740]   Doesn't mean everyone's not out.
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:24.860]   They don't want to kill you.
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:27.420]   They just want to incapacitate you and take the stuff
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:28.140]   that you've got on you.
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:28.940]   That's really it.
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:30.140]   They just want to kill you.
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:31.700]   They just want to give you a hug.
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:32.700]   Really are.
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:38.860]   What they do understand is I've learned to live for that crap.
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:40.100]   So it's OK with me.
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:44.060]   Anyway, the Topaz Simplify filter is my new pick.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.860]   The Topaz Simplify filter.
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:48.460]   That's correct.
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:53.780]   Now, this only works on Photoshop, which it almost kept me
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:56.180]   from picking it because I would like for it to work on aperture.
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:58.020]   I'm assuming they're going to have it work on aperture,
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:59.980]   but Photoshop on a Mac.
[00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:01.220]   Oh, boy, howdy.
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:05.460]   For $40 bucks, and that's all this thing cost,
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:09.500]   you can get to one touch simplification of your photos
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.700]   that makes them look literally like works of art.
[00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:15.740]   And I'm not talking about no offense to Adobe,
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:18.700]   the kind of Clue G artistic filters that
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:19.980]   are built into Photoshop.
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:21.580]   You can say the bad things about Adobe now.
[00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:22.580]   Frederick doesn't hear.
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:23.020]   That's right.
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:23.860]   Fred doesn't work there.
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:25.900]   So you know, I still care.
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:26.900]   I still--
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:29.020]   You could have said whatever you wanted before.
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:30.420]   It's got like I had stopped you.
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.340]   That's true.
[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:32.180]   That's true.
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:34.020]   I mean, those filters are fine, but you know,
[00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:35.620]   you got to know how to use them.
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:39.820]   They're slow, and they really aren't nearly as sophisticated
[00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:41.500]   as what this product provides.
[00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:45.420]   And a very reasonable price point of $40 bucks.
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:48.180]   TopazLabs.com is the place.
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:50.260]   They have other filters, which I'll probably end up
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:50.980]   recommending later.
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:53.300]   But this is the one I've played with the most.
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:55.060]   But the art stuff that you can do,
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:57.780]   where you can make the colors really vivid,
[00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:00.260]   and you can change things to everything
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:03.580]   from line drawings to watercolor pictures.
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.420]   And they really look good.
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:08.660]   And I've not had the same experience out of the box
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:11.260]   with some of the built-in filters in Photoshop.
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:13.660]   I did have that experience out of the box here.
[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:16.660]   And many of the things I recommend
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:20.300]   that relate to photography might be a step ahead or so
[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:22.140]   of some of the audience, because they haven't,
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:25.140]   you know, the experience that some of the pros have
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:26.420]   to make that stuff work.
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:28.940]   Here, anybody can make this work.
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.380]   You hit a button that looks cool when you go, wow.
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:32.740]   It's very fun.
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:35.260]   And I mean, $39.99, come on.
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:37.300]   All right, cheap.
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.900]   I went cheap this week, but don't count on it next week.
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:41.500]   How many Alexes is that Alex?
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.540]   This is like even a fraction of an Alex.
[00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:44.540]   Yeah, it's just a small fraction.
[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:45.380]   With an Alex, like $200.
[00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:46.220]   $700.
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:46.900]   $700.
[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:48.300]   And what's a born?
[00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.260]   We decided 15 grand.
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:50.940]   15 grand.
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:51.420]   Was it born?
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:51.900]   Was it born?
[00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:53.420]   No, wait, it was $75,000.
[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.500]   $7500 in two--
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:55.260]   That's a Scott.
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:58.260]   And then a great Scott is 15 grand.
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:52:59.900]   A great Scott is 15, kid.
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:00.860]   I'm going to keep it.
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:01.300]   No, no, no, no.
[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:02.980]   Great Scott was 70,000.
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:03.460]   Oh, that's right.
[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:04.740]   It's 10 Scott's.
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:05.980]   10 Scott's is a great Scott.
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:07.860]   So maybe a Scott born is two.
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:09.380]   Oh, so we're still decimal.
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:11.300]   So an Alex is $700.
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.140]   10 Alexes is a Scott.
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:15.140]   And 10 Scott's is a great Scott.
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:16.220]   I want to be a buck.
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:17.260]   Frederick, you can be easy.
[00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:18.260]   Frederick, you can be a buck.
[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:20.020]   You're a buck.
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:21.100]   99 cents.
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:23.540]   Well, that's you, you got a 99 cents.
[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:23.980]   99 cents.
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:24.740]   What are the whole thing?
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:25.180]   It's free.
[00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:26.740]   I just want to add one other quick thing.
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:29.060]   You can download a 30 day free trial.
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:30.100]   There you go.
[00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:31.460]   I think anybody doesn't do that.
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:32.980]   It's just missing the boat.
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:35.380]   You might as well try all these things we recommend,
[00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:38.100]   because most of them have some sort of trial,
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:39.780]   and you may or may not agree with us,
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:40.980]   but at least you can find out.
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:41.500]   Yeah.
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.420]   Yeah, we should almost only recommend stuff
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:44.540]   that has trials.
[00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:45.260]   I like that.
[00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:46.460]   It's broadening.
[00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:47.700]   Wow.
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:49.380]   And of course, if it's something that Andy recommends,
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:51.940]   you definitely want to try it first.
[00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:52.980]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.460]   Oh, no, CTE.
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.620]   On my scale, it's like Zimbabwean dollars,
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.420]   because remember, I'm a freelance journalist.
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:01.700]   So it's more like, I thought an Andy was 5,000 Zimbabwean
[00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:02.060]   dollars.
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:03.060]   Well, inflation.
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:04.420]   Now it's 20 million.
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:06.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:09.620]   Actually, didn't Alex-- didn't they cut eight zeros off
[00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:11.060]   the Zimbabwean currency?
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:12.580]   Well, they've done that a couple times.
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:13.260]   They're so poor.
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:13.780]   They're running on the thing.
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:14.780]   I think they're in trillions now,
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:16.900]   but now they've allowed people to start using US dollars.
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:18.380]   So that'll probably--
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:19.540]   Oh, that'll solve the problem.
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:20.420]   That'll solve a lot of it.
[00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:20.860]   Yeah.
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:21.700]   Yeah.
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:23.020]   Because it makes a lot easier for me.
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:23.980]   It took too long to go cash.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:24.500]   No, no, cash.
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:25.300]   Yeah.
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:27.420]   Yeah.
[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:28.740]   No, that's right.
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:32.940]   Let's move to Frederick V. Johnson, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:35.740]   You know, I have a very interesting pick here.
[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:37.420]   And it's actually a two part, because there's
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:39.420]   two pieces of the same thing.
[00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:41.100]   And it's not new, I don't think.
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.660]   So you may have heard of Grand Central from Google.
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:44.340]   Have you heard of that?
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:45.100]   Yeah, I've heard of them.
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:46.220]   In fact, I love Grand Central.
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:47.220]   I love Grand Central.
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:48.620]   And I was able to get in on the beta early.
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:49.300]   And now it's over.
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:49.780]   You can't get it--
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:50.580]   Well, it's closed.
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:51.580]   You have to get in.
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:53.020]   I don't know if it's completely over, but--
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:53.660]   There's no invites.
[00:54:53.660 --> 00:54:55.140]   I think they're putting a thing out of business.
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:56.180]   I really didn't want it.
[00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:57.580]   I'm on a business card.
[00:54:57.580 --> 00:54:59.580]   Oh.
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:02.620]   By the way, the best business cards ever.
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:03.860]   Uh-oh.
[00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:04.860]   Show the business card.
[00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:05.860]   Come on.
[00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:11.180]   If you want to bankrupt Frederick, ask for his business card,
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:13.300]   because they're only costing me about a dollar.
[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:14.740]   Because we won Frederick each.
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:15.180]   They're Frederick.
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:16.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:19.100]   But they're so thick.
[00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:20.140]   I never heard of 100 pounds.
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:21.540]   I think I got to pick a lock with this.
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:23.020]   It looks like you're on the bottom of the bottom.
[00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:24.460]   And you're going to make up sponge out of it.
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:25.460]   Yeah, no.
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:27.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:28.100]   It's 100 pounds.
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:29.820]   I do a great idea of both cards.
[00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:32.300]   And so it's almost like phone cords, so thick.
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:34.740]   And it's a beautiful-- I mean, this is a classy letter
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:36.860]   pressed-- I mean, this is a classy business card.
[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:40.540]   Yeah, that was inspired by a friend of mine, Gustavo,
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:44.700]   and encouraged by a friend of mine, Scott Born, who
[00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:48.740]   said, you know if you're going to do it, do it expensive.
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:50.620]   Those are really expensive cards.
[00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:51.620]   And you listen to him.
[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:53.620]   Well, for the branding, come on.
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:55.660]   You can't be cheap on your brand.
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:57.420]   It's the expensive Frederick V, John.
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:58.340]   You can't be cheap.
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:00.380]   If you want to be perceived as expensive, you got it.
[00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:01.380]   So on the card, it's--
[00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:02.260]   I got the opposite.
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:04.660]   Photography by Frederick Van.
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:06.080]   Frederick Van Johnson photographer,
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:09.220]   www.frederickvan.com.
[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:10.980]   And then it gives you Google.
[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:14.100]   That is my grand central phone number.
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:14.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.580]   I love grand central.
[00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:15.980]   I love it.
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:17.260]   They better not put it out of business.
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:18.900]   Luckily, I only have a couple of these cards.
[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:19.900]   So I think too.
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:21.900]   Yeah, they could only afford six of them.
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:24.100]   You could only afford like what at a time.
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.420]   But my pick is grand central, but they've also--
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:28.180]   there's an independent developer that came out
[00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:32.740]   with this application for the iPhone called Grand Dialer.
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:35.340]   So the problem with grand central, at least that I've had,
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:37.900]   is people call-- the way folks that
[00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:39.500]   don't know what grand central is,
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:42.020]   they basically give you a phone number, which they say
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:45.980]   is for life, that you can have ring any number of other phones.
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:48.580]   And whichever phone you pick up is the one that
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:49.180]   takes the call.
[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:50.660]   And it's got voice man.
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:51.500]   It's all the time.
[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:52.500]   It's actually three.
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:55.420]   It's three of the voice man, all this crazy stuff.
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:56.700]   It's really cool.
[00:56:56.700 --> 00:57:00.180]   But the problem is if someone calls you on your line
[00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:01.780]   and it reroutes to your cell number
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:04.980]   and you want to return the call, if they have caller ID
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:07.380]   and you haven't blocked it, they get your cell number,
[00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:09.220]   which is not so good, right?
[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:12.260]   So Grand Dialer on the iPhone basically looks just
[00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:14.020]   like the Dialer on the regular iPhone.
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:15.620]   Only it's shaded and green.
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:17.620]   You put in your Grand Central account number
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:21.420]   or account information and it accesses the iPhone address
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:22.380]   books just like regular.
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:25.380]   You dial a number, it calls Grand Central,
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:27.420]   and immediately calls you back and connects the call
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:28.620]   to your--
[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:30.020]   So it's not even costing you anything?
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:31.020]   It's a cross central call.
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:33.140]   And the caller ID that your caller sees
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:34.020]   is your Grand Central.
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:35.500]   How many Fredericks is that?
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:36.700]   It's 99 cents.
[00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:36.980]   It's--
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:38.060]   That's worth $1.
[00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:38.820]   Yeah, it's $1.
[00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:40.700]   I think every application in the iPhone store
[00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:42.700]   is quickly becoming a buck.
[00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:43.900]   Yeah, I like the buck.
[00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:44.980]   I like the buck.
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:47.540]   If I made applications, they'd be a buck.
[00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:48.940]   But you don't make any money on it.
[00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.580]   Did you see that there's now a crayon physics deluxe?
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:53.300]   No.
[00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:55.420]   Oh!
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:56.380]   It's really good.
[00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:57.180]   We've opened up.
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:58.260]   It's really good.
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:57:59.860]   What was it a pick, crayon physics?
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:02.380]   Yeah, well, the pick was not crayon physics.
[00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:03.300]   No, no, it was the other one.
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:06.300]   It was the one that I started playing.
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:08.500]   It was, of course, it took me hours and hours
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:09.500]   and my--
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:10.340]   Touch physics.
[00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:12.060]   Yeah, I showed it to my son over the weekend.
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:12.580]   Touch physics.
[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:15.300]   And he got through all the levels in like an hour.
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:17.740]   See, kids don't have those same pre-kits even notions.
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:18.180]   I was--
[00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:19.340]   So I don't know how many levels are
[00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:22.140]   on this crayon physics deluxe, but it just goes on and on and on.
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:24.180]   I'm addicted to I shoot right now.
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:24.620]   On the--
[00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:25.620]   What do you shoot, Moose?
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:28.060]   It's just this little tank game where you--
[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:28.580]   Oh, yeah, my son loves it.
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.580]   You shoot up in the air and it drops bombs on other tanks
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:31.300]   and you got hit up.
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:31.860]   Yeah, my son loves that game.
[00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:32.620]   I can't stop playing it.
[00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:33.380]   It's beautiful, too.
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:34.580]   They really did a nice job on it.
[00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:35.060]   I never--
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:35.060]   Shoot.
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:38.820]   I never have cannon games.
[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:40.140]   I guess it's my turn.
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:40.660]   It should turn.
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:42.140]   OK.
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:42.940]   I actually--
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:44.060]   No, I was going to do an iPhone.
[00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:46.260]   I'll do an iPhone pick.
[00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:47.340]   There are a lot--
[00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:47.700]   Go ahead.
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:48.540]   Anybody want to answer that phone?
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:51.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:54.300]   I'm just-- I'm working here.
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:54.820]   It's OK.
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:56.540]   Go ahead, Scott.
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:57.740]   Oh.
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:59.020]   You were very late, gentlemen.
[00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:01.100]   Do not have a cell phone during a performance,
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:03.180]   but the seat of the Vara is on stage.
[00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:04.260]   Oh, wait.
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:04.900]   Go ahead.
[00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:05.980]   Take your call.
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:08.460]   I'll do the song and dance after you're done.
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:09.100]   We'd like to know--
[00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:10.740]   This is actually a call for you, Leo.
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:11.660]   Is it really?
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:12.420]   It's a call for you.
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:14.780]   It's somebody wanting to know why is it
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:17.500]   that there's no Mac stuff on Mac break weekly?
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:20.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:22.420]   Actually, Jeff Smith is in the stick-amp chat
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:24.020]   and wants to thank you.
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:24.820]   Oh, well, thank you.
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:25.700]   You're kind offer.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:29.580]   And thank you, Jeff, for those great jingles.
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:31.540]   There are a lot of Twitter apps on the iPhone.
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:33.500]   There are a lot of them.
[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:35.060]   And more all the time.
[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:36.580]   And I've tried every one of them.
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:39.780]   I've probably spent $100 on Twitter apps on the iPhone
[00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:41.580]   just to see which one is the best.
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:42.740]   For a long time, I use Twitterific.
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:44.020]   And I actually bought the pro version.
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:44.660]   I like a lot.
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:47.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:47.460]   That's good.
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:48.100]   Is that yours?
[00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:48.860]   I don't think so.
[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:50.180]   Maybe it's mine.
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:54.820]   And then I like Twitter later from--
[00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:55.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:56.380]   That's not me.
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:57.380]   It's you.
[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:59.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:02.340]   Do we all-- we all whip out our iPhones at the same time.
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:03.340]   Yeah, that's--
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:04.300]   Immediately you get all Nsans.
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.380]   Who's Tricorder, is it?
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:10.380]   [GROWLING]
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:12.580]   And Twitter later is really, really very nice.
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:15.740]   But I've got to say that the consensus seems to be from all
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.060]   sides tweet-y.
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:18.020]   That's what I use.
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:19.460]   T-W-E-E-E-T-I-E.
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:20.900]   Very clean, very simple.
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.980]   But it has also some really nice features
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:26.060]   including a trends button, which Twitter later also had.
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:28.540]   I really like the idea of seeing what are people
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:30.300]   talking about right now.
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:33.380]   For instance, Denny's happens to be number one on Twitter
[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:33.740]   right now.
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:34.060]   Why?
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:36.620]   Because Denny's was giving away breakfast this morning.
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.500]   It's standing live for two hours to get like a $5 breakfast.
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.220]   You know, I realized that, Scott, because my son said,
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:42.460]   oh, great, free breakfast.
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:43.460]   Let's all do that.
[01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:44.980]   And I thought that's exactly what I thought.
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:47.500]   It's going to be the worst day possible to go to Denny's.
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.100]   So I said to him, I'll take you Saturday,
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:50.420]   and I'll pay the $3.99.
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:51.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:53.420]   It's a great time to bring you to the judge's--
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:54.420]   I appreciate the judge's here.
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:55.460]   --of seven days.
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.180]   So let me just check these Denny's tweets
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:58.300]   and see what people are saying.
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:00.220]   See, this is the kind of thing before you went to Denny's.
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:06.660]   You'd see what's going on, and that doesn't look
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:07.900]   like people were complaining.
[01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:09.100]   In fact, mostly people were talking about it.
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:11.580]   I don't think actually anybody did it.
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:12.460]   I didn't know the background.
[01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:13.020]   They could.
[01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:14.060]   The fact they could was enough.
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:14.900]   Makes them pull.
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.420]   That fills them up enough in this economy.
[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:18.540]   And then after Denny's Christian Bale--
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:20.380]   so you look at the trends and you'll know immediately
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:21.460]   that something's going on--
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:22.380]   --snowing the plates.
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:23.380]   --about Christian Bale.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:24.980]   I don't know why.
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:28.380]   But people are actually mad at him for something.
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.060]   That's because he went on some tirade
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:31.780]   against his director of photography
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:33.140]   for stepping into a shot.
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:34.140]   Ooh, I love it.
[01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:36.780]   See, this is how you keep up on stuff.
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:37.860]   You've got to be careful.
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:38.460]   So it's got that.
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.140]   It's got searches, save searches, too.
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:42.380]   So you could save your vanity searches
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:45.460]   and go back and use them again in the future.
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:47.340]   It allows you-- and this is one of the reasons I use it--
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:48.460]   to have multiple accounts.
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:49.740]   This is kind of fundamental for me
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.700]   because I have several Twitter accounts.
[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:53.820]   One for Twit Live that we update people on when we're
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:55.220]   going to do broadcasting.
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.020]   And one of my personal accounts, so forth.
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.780]   And when we've got an inside Twitter account,
[01:01:58.780 --> 01:01:59.780]   we have a TwitPix account.
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:02.260]   We're using-- Twitter is-- I tell you--
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:06.540]   more and more becoming the tool of choice for a lot of stuff.
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:10.340]   I'm very easy to post, reply, find out more about somebody,
[01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:12.020]   follow the timeline.
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:14.180]   So I am a fan now of Tweety.
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.420]   I have gone through several of these.
[01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:21.260]   But I think the consensus seems to finally reached
[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:22.340]   critical mass at Tweety.
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:23.020]   We all agree?
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:23.780]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:26.380]   I just found out that you could actually swipe on the name.
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:27.100]   Is that cool?
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:29.380]   To show options about what you could do within a person.
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:30.580]   Isn't that cool?
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.020]   I didn't know that.
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:33.460]   There's some hit and use interface stuff.
[01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:34.140]   Actually, we talked--
[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:35.500]   It's a missing manual.
[01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.380]   We talked-- maybe we've already made this as a pick.
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:38.660]   I can't remember because we talked about the fact
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:41.500]   that the button at the top was hard to find.
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:42.060]   Was that you?
[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:42.700]   No, no.
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:43.700]   That was a manly thing.
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:44.700]   I might have made you a thing.
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:47.580]   Maybe this has been a pick, and I apologize if it has.
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:49.420]   I do also apologize for my pick of last week.
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:51.220]   We talked about Bloggo.
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:53.780]   And I actually sent a note to the Bloggo folks
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:55.380]   because it's a great program.
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:57.500]   But I tried to install another machine and said, no, sorry.
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:00.060]   You've already installed it on one machine.
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:03.700]   And while I kind of understand that,
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.100]   I don't think they're quite Adobe Photoshop yet.
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:07.580]   I think that probably it would be good.
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:10.620]   Every other share of a program, including Mars, at its competitor,
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.020]   will let you install it on multiple machines.
[01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.380]   I'm not using it in multiple ways.
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:14.860]   I just want it on every machine, right?
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:15.340]   Right.
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:16.140]   You're blogging.
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.380]   I'd like to be able to sit down and do it for many machines.
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:20.820]   And it wants me to spend $25 on every machine
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.140]   that I need to put it on.
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:23.060]   I think not.
[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:23.940]   So I like Bloggo.
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:26.340]   And I apologize to those of you who tried it and liked it.
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:27.900]   I just a word of warning.
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:30.100]   It requires license for every machine.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.220]   In fact, you can't try it on another machine.
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:35.500]   If you say you're sorry, dude, you can't have it.
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:39.220]   So I would urge the Bloggo folks to reconsider that policy.
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:40.980]   And if they do, we'll let you know.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:44.980]   And we should point out that Adobe took like 15 years
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:46.220]   before they tightened it up.
[01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:48.660]   Well, and they don't do it on Lightroom.
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:50.580]   One of the reasons I really like Lightroom
[01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:52.340]   is because I can install it on all my machines.
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:55.580]   I'm not using multiple copies at the same time.
[01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.340]   It bugs me Adobe Audition.
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:58.660]   I can only install on one machine.
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:03:59.460]   I'm kind of curious.
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:00.540]   One thing we haven't tested.
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:03.060]   We just bought the family pack of the--
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:03.980]   It doesn't know.
[01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:04.500]   I work.
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.380]   It doesn't know work here.
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:07.980]   I work when we bought the family pack of I work.
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:09.140]   And I wonder if you went over five,
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:10.740]   whether it would tell you there's five copies.
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:12.140]   Well, the best way to do that is to buy the disk.
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:13.460]   Because then you don't need to see it.
[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:14.660]   We bought the desk.
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:17.340]   I mean, but it could still be looking to see if there's
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:19.340]   five I work on the network.
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:22.100]   But because we just installed it on--
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:23.020]   I guess we don't have it.
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:25.180]   We never have more than five copies running at a time.
[01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:26.220]   So we just never know.
[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:28.260]   I bought the family pack of I work and I life.
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.980]   And by the way, I life on nine should probably also be a pick.
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:33.420]   And we'll make that your pick.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:34.660]   Absolutely.
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:36.100]   Org used the pick that I was planning.
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:36.740]   That's OK.
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:37.240]   OK.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.940]   I thought you didn't want to because it was crashing.
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:39.580]   Oh, no.
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:42.260]   I just needed-- I need some time to regroup.
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.700]   I just need to collect myself, get myself a nationally
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.940]   advertised Colab average.
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:48.300]   You can talk of my life.
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:52.060]   By the way, with sugar or fructose?
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:54.260]   Sugar.
[01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:56.420]   See, he's a special Coke drinker.
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:59.100]   You're getting the special kosher version.
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:00.940]   For now, yes.
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:02.620]   You think they won't do that anymore?
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:04.260]   Be sugar, not cane sugar, though.
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:04.900]   Oh, see.
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:05.900]   Cane sugar is what you want.
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:06.660]   Yeah.
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:07.460]   Cane sugar is what I want.
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:09.980]   Unfortunately, I want to drink it in Central America.
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:10.900]   Because--
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:13.380]   That's the only place you can get it.
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.540]   Andy and--
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:15.040]   OK.
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.700]   Andy and Ico, your pick of the week,
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:18.940]   sir.
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:21.500]   Well, actually, there are times that I'm wondering,
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:22.620]   what am I going to pick this week?
[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:24.380]   And I'm just sort of racking my brains.
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:26.180]   And then I just have to hit myself in the head hard,
[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:29.540]   because there are things that I use them so much,
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:31.580]   and I rely on them so much that I kind of forget
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:33.580]   that they're actually like Mac products that
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.540]   have to go out and be acquired.
[01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:41.540]   So one of these things is the new update to Elgato's ITV.
[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:43.820]   Just last month, they upgraded the software to 3.1.
[01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:47.420]   They upgraded the hardware, too, giving it a little bit--
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:48.420]   I'm sorry.
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:53.260]   The ITV is what looks like an oversized USB key drive,
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:55.980]   but it is actually a full digital HD TV tuner.
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:57.500]   And I love it.
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:57.860]   Yeah.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:02.180]   And it plugs into any USB port and USB 2.0 port.
[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:06.060]   And it gives you every single TV feature
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:09.220]   you would pretty much want on the Macintosh.
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:11.460]   Let's not leave the size of the thing.
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:13.940]   It is so compact that I typically toss it in my bag
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:14.940]   when I travel.
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:17.340]   And so if I'm out giving a talk, one of my Macs
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.820]   is back at the hotel room recording, whatever TV shows
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:22.020]   I missed, so that I can watch them on the planet
[01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.020]   on the way back home.
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.180]   And that dovetails nicely.
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:26.100]   And the next really great thing about it,
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:29.540]   the ITV software makes it really, really easy
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:32.780]   to do whatever the hell you want to do with the TV shows
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:34.180]   that you've recorded.
[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:37.620]   It is trivially easy to turn any TV show
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:40.740]   you can get off a satellite, off a cable TV, off of a just
[01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:43.140]   direct air broadcast, and essentially turn it
[01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:44.820]   into a video podcast.
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:48.060]   Every single morning, when I scamper downstairs
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:50.940]   and make myself my bowl of rice checks
[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.060]   or whatever the hell it is I'm eating when I pretend
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:55.340]   to say that I have a breakfast instead of just last night's
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:57.620]   Diet Dr. Pepper and a piece of fudge.
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:03.380]   But by the time I wake up in the morning,
[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:05.260]   ITV has not only recorded last night's
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:08.860]   Letterman and last night's Craig Kilburn and everything else.
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:12.540]   It's also converted it into a proper iPhone format,
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:14.580]   added it to my iTunes library, and it's
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:16.540]   available for syncing directly on the next time
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.700]   that I sync my iPhone or my iPhone.
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:20.980]   It's also available on my Apple TV immediately
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:24.300]   because everything is synced to a central iTunes library.
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:27.820]   So essentially, you spend $150 for this trivial little device.
[01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:30.460]   You plug in somewhere on one of your Macintosh
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:32.620]   is somewhere on your home network
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:34.380]   and run the ITV desktop software.
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:37.460]   And suddenly every TV show you're even marginally interested
[01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:40.340]   in becomes available to every device in the house.
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:41.620]   It really is that simple.
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:44.020]   They've added a whole bunch of improvements in the tuner.
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:46.180]   One of the things-- I've been using these things
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:48.020]   since version one point something.
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:49.660]   We're now up to 3.1.
[01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:52.540]   When I thought of the week link was the online tuner,
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:55.460]   the online programming guide where you actually
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:57.300]   select programs to record.
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.460]   And it's getting better and better and better.
[01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:02.380]   And right now, 3.1, I think, brings it exactly where
[01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:03.260]   you would like it to be.
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:07.060]   It's not quite Tivo-esque because nothing but a Tivo-esque.
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:08.380]   But it's very, very simple to say,
[01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:10.380]   please give me every episode of house.
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:12.700]   Do this with it as soon as you're done with it.
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:15.460]   And be smart enough not to record the repeats.
[01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:17.260]   Be smart enough not to record stuff
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.180]   when it conflicts with other stuff.
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:21.580]   And they've also added support for the TV guide
[01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:23.860]   online programming guide, which is a lot better
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:27.580]   than the Titan TV guide that they used to use before that.
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:29.580]   So very, very good, very, very powerful upgrade.
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:31.780]   If you already have an ITV, I believe it's--
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:33.900]   if you already have 3.0, it's a free upgrade.
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:37.460]   If you have ITV 2.0, it's a $40 upgrade.
[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:40.940]   But it's really is if you give--
[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:43.420]   are one of those few people who enjoys getting entertainment
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:45.380]   through the television medium.
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:46.980]   And you have 150 bucks.
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:49.060]   And especially if you have more than one device
[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:51.900]   you like to watch TV on, that's a really good way
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:52.900]   to spend 150 bucks.
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:54.420]   I'm very, very happy with this update.
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:57.740]   Andy, do you have a digital cable?
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:58.220]   Yes.
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:00.140]   And it works fine with the digital cable?
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:02.260]   You have to have the box, the digital cable box.
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:03.260]   Right.
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:05.980]   It doesn't have a cable card slot or anything like that.
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:08.260]   No, but you can hook it to your digital cable box that would
[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:10.060]   go to normally or to your TV.
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:12.820]   Anything that's not scrambled will work fine.
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:13.700]   Yeah.
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:15.780]   So it has coax in-- what does it have?
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:18.180]   It has--
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:19.780]   It has coax.
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:21.740]   It also has an on-air--
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:24.100]   a jack for an on-air antenna.
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:24.740]   OK.
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:25.700]   OK.
[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:29.700]   Yeah, I use it with my cable coax.
[01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:31.420]   I'm not using the cable box.
[01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:34.180]   Although you'd be surprised if you scan your cable with it
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:36.900]   that are a lot of high-def channels on the cable,
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:39.220]   even without the scrambled box, not HBO,
[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:42.180]   but most of the locals are on high-def, at least in our area.
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:43.180]   Right.
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:45.340]   It will depend on your cable system.
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:48.780]   I should backtrack a little bit that I've had Comcast Digital
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:50.260]   and I've had Fios Digital.
[01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:55.260]   And they've all told me this is pure cable transmission.
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:57.860]   And you have all these different devices
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.300]   for tuning in broadcast.
[01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:01.740]   I've had devices that work just fine with some systems
[01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:02.500]   and not with others.
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.340]   When they say there's others where they say, yes,
[01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:07.420]   it's pure digital, but yes, you can use older style components
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:07.940]   with it.
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:09.500]   But all you get for the older style components
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.540]   is a little graphic that says, oh, by the way,
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.780]   we're not broadcasting on this channel anymore.
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:17.580]   So if your plan is to plug it into a digital tuner,
[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:20.340]   be aware that you might have a little bit of fine-tuning
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:23.940]   to do and a lot of yelling to do to get the broadcast you want.
[01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:28.580]   I'm using it-- actually, because I don't have cable
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.820]   in the office where I have all this hardware set up,
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:32.820]   I'm actually using it on ATSC.
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:35.460]   I'm using it on just broadcast high def.
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:37.660]   And I've got those special antenna for it and everything.
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:39.860]   But I know that that has been an issue with all kinds
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:41.820]   of devices like this.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.260]   This has both ATSC and QAM.
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:45.220]   It has clear QAM.
[01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:47.300]   So that's pretty much everything you'd expect
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:48.500]   or could you expect to get a--
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:49.860]   but the thing that blows me away, Andy,
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:52.980]   is how good the quality of the video is through USB.
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:53.860]   It's amazing.
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:56.020]   I mean, I actually have--
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:58.820]   the first time I hooked up one of these ITVs,
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:02.220]   when they first updated to HD, and it's
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:05.780]   able to grab full like 1080 screen captures.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:09.380]   And I just had to take a screen capture just of the quick time
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:12.260]   that it builds of the first letterman that I watched in HD.
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:16.060]   And it absolutely filled this entire screen much.
[01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:17.940]   Even-- I would even say that it was--
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.780]   it seemed to be even clearer this screenshot than anything
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:22.820]   I've seen on a real high-def set.
[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:24.740]   I don't know whether that's just something I'm perceiving
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:27.140]   or that should give you an idea of--
[01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:28.820]   I get a blue tearing in the corner.
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:31.060]   There's no technical reason why I couldn't do that.
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:32.980]   I mean, if you look at a blue ray--
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:39.620]   A blue ray is 40 megabits a second or 45 megabits a second,
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:42.260]   I believe, somewhere in that range.
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:43.540]   USB is capable of--
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:44.700]   Yes, 10 times that.
[01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:47.020]   Yeah, so USB should be able to pull that data.
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:49.860]   And your drive generally should be plenty fast to get
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:52.340]   as good as blue ray recorded.
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:54.980]   It's not-- it's pretty heavily compressed even blue ray.
[01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:58.460]   This is what you really need to make your Mac Mini be the really
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:02.180]   the definitive TV device, home theater device.
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:03.820]   And also, I mean, that is a good point.
[01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:06.660]   I mean, it's the only-- we're just so used in the old World
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:09.820]   of Enlong TV to take anything that we're watching on our TV
[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:10.780]   screen we can keep.
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:12.060]   We can burn it onto a DVD.
[01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:12.620]   We can rip it.
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:13.860]   We can do whatever you want with it.
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:16.100]   But that all changed with high-def broadcast.
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:18.340]   If you want it at that sort of maximum quality,
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:20.780]   this takes back a lot of that power.
[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:23.980]   Any program that I want to keep, instead of simply letting
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.820]   the ITV delete it to save some space,
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:30.660]   I will just simply copy it onto my network mass storage device,
[01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:32.300]   put it into my iTunes library.
[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:35.580]   And so I get to have this 1080 high-def broadcast
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:36.780]   as long as I want it.
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:38.020]   Well, and I know that that's the thing
[01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.620]   that I get frustrated with with my DVR.
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:41.540]   I mean, I have the Comcast built-in DVR,
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:42.900]   whatever that came with it.
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.980]   And it's fine, except I'm constantly juggling shows.
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:46.900]   Oh, if I want to record this one, I got to delete that one.
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:49.060]   And if I want to record this one, I got to delete that one.
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:50.180]   And I don't want to do that.
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:51.620]   I just want to keep the ones that I got.
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:53.180]   And throw them away eventually.
[01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:54.860]   But I want more time.
[01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:56.020]   I need more time.
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:58.300]   I mean, I got so many things I just burn.
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:00.180]   I'll even-- if it's not necessarily
[01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:04.060]   that I want this 81 gigabyte four-hour Super Bowl broadcast,
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:08.420]   it's easy enough for me to burn an iPod iPhone screen-sized
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:10.580]   version of the Oscars.
[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:11.700]   Yeah.
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:15.460]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:16.060]   How much is it?
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:17.140]   It's not cheap, right?
[01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:18.180]   It's a couple hundred--
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:19.020]   It's 149.
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.740]   It's cheap enough.
[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:23.580]   I recorded--
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:25.820]   Oh, the other thing I love is that I have it on all the time.
[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:27.580]   And I could press rewind.
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:28.060]   Yeah.
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:30.620]   Just like a Tivo, it's recording always in the background.
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:31.740]   It's got a buffer.
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.300]   So it's a pretty big buffer.
[01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:34.980]   I can go back usually a couple hours, right?
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:38.580]   I'll tell you the coolest story is that a friend of mine
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:42.540]   was unexpectedly wound up on a national TV show,
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:44.140]   where it was a talk show.
[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:45.980]   They sort of pulled them in.
[01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:49.220]   And he couldn't call his family in time to, hey,
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:50.340]   please record this.
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:55.060]   And by just-- I wasn't actually watching it, but the ITV--
[01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:58.700]   but I happen to have had the tuner on that station all along.
[01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:01.100]   So I was able to rewind it 45 minutes,
[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:03.140]   catch his appearance, do a selection.
[01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:04.180]   It's just a call.
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:08.060]   Select that six minutes of video, compress it.
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:10.260]   Put it on.mac.
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:12.940]   And about 10 minutes after that, I
[01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:15.740]   was one of the 40 people who got the CC'd on the email,
[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:17.060]   including all of his friends and family.
[01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:18.260]   It's like, I was on TV.
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:19.060]   I was on TV.
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:19.540]   You missed it.
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:20.380]   Here is the video.
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:21.260]   Here's the video.
[01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:24.100]   Well, it's like you were smart enough to record it.
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:24.940]   Exactly.
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:26.620]   It's pretty clever.
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:29.220]   So Andy, do you think that that would--
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:32.300]   or the ITV would fit into a home theater set up?
[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:34.500]   Or is it mainly for folks that are like,
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:36.540]   I want to watch TV while I'm working in my office
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:37.780]   and I have an extra Mac?
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:41.500]   Or I want to run it on the screen on my main Mac?
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.620]   The biggest-- now, I do use it to watch TV in a window
[01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:47.580]   on my Mac when I'm supposed to be doing other things.
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:49.420]   Again, there's a reason why I don't have cable
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:50.420]   inside my office.
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:55.140]   But to me, the biggest contribution that the ITV makes
[01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:57.060]   is simply that it's invisible.
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:01.060]   And these shows just keep dropping into my iTunes library.
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:03.740]   And because I have one big massive iTunes library that
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:05.580]   served to everything in the house,
[01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:08.700]   including the Apple TV that's plugged into the big TV
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:11.260]   in the living room, that just means that I don't even
[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:13.100]   think to go to the cable--
[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:17.140]   to Verizon's DVR when I want to see last night's house,
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:18.820]   or the Simpsons, or something like that.
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:21.340]   Because I know that I've recorded it in high def.
[01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:24.260]   Plus, it'll also give me that ability to say, oh, well,
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:26.620]   unfortunately, I've only been watching the Oscars
[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:28.700]   for three and a half hours, so it's still about 90 minutes
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:29.940]   until best picture.
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:31.900]   I know that if I just sync up my iPhone,
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:35.780]   then I'll be able to resume play exactly where I left off
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:37.220]   when I get to the beach or wherever.
[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:42.220]   And get ready for this from one of our chatters, JAWR0405.
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:45.340]   There's a program called ETVcom Skip.
[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:49.180]   It's on Google code that automatically skips commercials
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:50.940]   in your ITV recordings.
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:51.940]   Oh, really?
[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:53.140]   I shouldn't really be telling you.
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:54.740]   Yeah, how long until that gets?
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:55.740]   I didn't reschedule--
[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:57.340]   I wrote it now.
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:58.340]   Everything.
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:15:59.340]   That doesn't work on it.
[01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:00.420]   We act frequently.
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:03.780]   Leo, what this is, is this is a special exclusive offer
[01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:06.500]   just to people watching live on Twitter TV.
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.700]   Yeah, we'll edit it out of the final recorded--
[01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:10.580]   No, no, because in '90s--
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:12.740]   By the time it comes out, it would have been pulled out.
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:14.340]   Didn't Tivo have that feature initially?
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:15.940]   It still does have a 30-second skip.
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:19.140]   But they had a commercial skip that was smart enough to know
[01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:20.140]   they never even--
[01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:21.140]   It went in again.
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:22.140]   Where's it replay?
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:23.140]   It does.
[01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:24.140]   It replay did that.
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:24.940]   It replay did that.
[01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:26.820]   And by the way, notice what happened to replay?
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:28.180]   They're not around anymore.
[01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:31.940]   Tivo had a secret hack that you could put to a 30-second skip,
[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:32.620]   which was good enough.
[01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:34.140]   You'd press it four times in your through.
[01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:35.420]   And I think that's still in there.
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:38.340]   But that's the key is you've got to keep it a little on the low down.
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:41.940]   They also have a cool deal with a lot of different advertisers
[01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:44.220]   where the Tivo was smart enough to know that, OK,
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:47.020]   this guy is fast forwarding through the commercial.
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:50.140]   But the good folks at Polydent have a deal that say that,
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:52.420]   if I'm being fast forwarded through just superimposed
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:55.140]   this little bug on the corner of the screen that says four more
[01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:56.740]   through information about Paul Mulliv.
[01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:58.580]   They don't use it a lot, but sometimes it shows up
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:00.620]   and it just throws me for just a second.
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:03.380]   As if Tivo's saying, I know what you're doing,
[01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:05.660]   we're going to advertise that to you anyway.
[01:17:05.660 --> 01:17:06.260]   There are--
[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:07.820]   Somebody's asking in the chat room,
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:09.700]   is there a Windows compatible thing?
[01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:12.740]   The ITV stuff is an OEM version that you can get from other
[01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:15.620]   critical systems and other makes basically the same stuff.
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:18.900]   The company called Halpidge makes a product--
[01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:19.900]   Halphog.
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:21.620]   Halphog, I think you're supposed to pronounce it.
[01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:23.820]   The worst thing for a company in history.
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:26.820]   You can always tell-- you can always tell you, oh, man.
[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:27.820]   Halpog?
[01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:29.940]   Yes.
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:30.580]   Yes.
[01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:32.060]   And it's pretty much--
[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:33.020]   I don't know if it's the generation.
[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.340]   This software is not as good.
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:34.740]   Yeah.
[01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:35.740]   The software is not as good.
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:39.060]   You'll find that the hardware looks the same.
[01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:41.460]   I can't tell you side by side what is the exact same thing.
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:43.060]   Because I do know that this was a brand--
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:44.780]   this particular one is a brand new one.
[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:46.860]   I don't know if it's made into the channel yet.
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:48.940]   But yeah, I mean, I did have to write about all that stuff
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:50.460]   for the iPhone book.
[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:53.900]   And that the Halpog was the one that I'd rather like.
[01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:57.460]   I'm going to do a review of this ETV Coms Skip.
[01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:00.180]   It works with Pi TV, P-Y-E TV, which
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:03.540]   is a leopard front row plug-in for ITV.
[01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:06.100]   So it allows you basically to turn this into a real home
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:07.740]   theater using front row.
[01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:11.220]   Although I'd probably rather use the Xbox Media Center
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:12.220]   at the Xbox Media Center.
[01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:13.220]   I like front row.
[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:14.220]   Or boxy.
[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:16.740]   But if you like front row, then you can use your ITV
[01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:18.780]   with front row, which is awesome.
[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:21.140]   You even get a little thumbnails
[01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:22.380]   in set of the videos.
[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:22.860]   It's live.
[01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:23.660]   Is it showing live?
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:24.780]   Yeah.
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:25.940]   It looks like it is.
[01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:27.660]   I don't see why it wouldn't be.
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:31.620]   So you add an ITV entry to your front row.
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:34.100]   And then you can see what you've gotten.
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:35.420]   And it works with--
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:39.340]   Now it looks like the Coms Skip program.
[01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:42.020]   It turns commercial skipping on and off from within front row
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.020]   as well as starting a commercial search for recordings,
[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:45.780]   which did not have commercial markers already.
[01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:49.420]   So it sounds like this is post production where it goes
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:52.780]   through and automatically edits out the commercials.
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:54.340]   This is such a bad idea.
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:55.820]   We like it.
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:56.340]   Thumbs up.
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:58.500]   It'll be a short-lived idea.
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.220]   I'm downloading it.
[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:00.540]   Well, it's hard for a couple of years.
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:01.140]   The thing is--
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:04.220]   Yeah, by next week, we'll be talking about how they went away.
[01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:06.180]   Well, the thing is, is that it's really hard to block
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:07.500]   that kind of-- well, that's why everyone listening
[01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:08.860]   should go get it right now.
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:11.020]   Because it's very hard to reverse engineer that,
[01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:12.380]   because a lot of that stuff is automatic.
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.460]   The change in volume, there's a subtle click.
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:15.940]   I mean, there are things that identify.
[01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:18.900]   And the reason is, is because when the cable feed is coming
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:21.260]   through for it to auto-pick up the--
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:22.620]   it has to have something there.
[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:24.540]   And that's what they're looking for.
[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:26.020]   Pretty amazing.
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:28.700]   I'm downloading it right now.
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:30.020]   This is very cool.
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:33.020]   I see them just too simplistic, because I'm happy right now
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:33.980]   with just the TiVo.
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:34.540]   That's the best part.
[01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:35.140]   What I love about--
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:35.940]   Just the TiVo.
[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:40.060]   What I love about 24 is that it's really easy to fast forward
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:40.820]   through the commercials.
[01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:41.540]   You said they're--
[01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:42.140]   Just wait for the numbers.
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:43.540]   Super fast, like, sushi, sushi, never do you like--
[01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:44.540]   Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:47.660]   Yeah, they'll never do that again.
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:49.980]   Do you use a software to take stuff off your TiVo
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:52.420]   and put it into iTunes or put it on your iPhone?
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:53.460]   No, I don't.
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:53.980]   I just--
[01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:54.780]   Is it only to do that?
[01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:56.780]   Once I watch it, I'm done with it.
[01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:57.580]   I'm fickle that way.
[01:19:57.580 --> 01:20:00.620]   So that's one of the nice things about using a Mac Mini and ITVs.
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:02.620]   It's already in a format you could play on the eye.
[01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:03.380]   I mean, it's just there.
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:04.900]   I don't know if there's an end-peg force.
[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:05.900]   Keep, though.
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:06.900]   Was it a--
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:07.900]   No, no.
[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:10.620]   What turned me around-- when I got my first DVD recorder,
[01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:13.420]   I just got in the habit of always having like a six hour
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:14.780]   blank DVD in there.
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:16.860]   And whenever I was watching something on TiVo
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:19.540]   that I knew that I would just like, like a junkyard wars
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:21.100]   or dirty jobs or something like that,
[01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:23.580]   I just would happen to just press that record button, which
[01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:27.020]   means that I've got like three huge spindles of burned DVDs
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:29.840]   of nothing but the coolest stuff that I was watching on TiVo
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.140]   three years ago.
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:32.900]   And they're actually-- they're literally
[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:36.620]   labeled random TV and then just a date with no other label on it.
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:39.540]   It's just so cool whenever I'm about to abort a plane
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:40.060]   or something.
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:42.220]   And the last thing I do is grab just one of these random disks
[01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:43.620]   because I-- oh my god.
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:44.540]   It's singing in the rain.
[01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:45.860]   The extended-- oh my god.
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:46.220]   Great one.
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:46.220]   Great one.
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:47.220]   Great one.
[01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:48.220]   Great one.
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:50.940]   The best one was when I knew that I was going to be like spending
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:53.740]   like two hours on a couch at the Red Cross donating platelets.
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:56.380]   And they have a DVD player like on screen at the end of the bed
[01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:57.260]   or the end of the couch.
[01:20:57.260 --> 01:21:00.620]   And it just so happened that I'd grab the disk that had like a six
[01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:02.900]   hour house marathon on it.
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:06.380]   So I spent two hours bleeding into this machine,
[01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:08.420]   watching all these horrific things happen
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:11.540]   to a series of patients.
[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:16.620]   I was mopping the floor and I had a small cell aneurysm.
[01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:18.820]   Oh goodness.
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:20.780]   Anyway, it's a trip man.
[01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:21.900]   It's a trip man.
[01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:23.260]   It's kind of-- you're going to love it.
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:26.220]   So Andy, so the ITV, did you-- were you saying earlier
[01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:29.140]   that it will drop episodes of a particular program
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:32.460]   into an iTunes and into a--
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:34.540]   will it create a playlist automatically for you?
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:36.500]   Because I've got an iTunes server set up
[01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.460]   that I can access through Apple TV.
[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:41.220]   When I'd be able to say, oh, here's my NipTuck channel,
[01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:42.460]   that kind of thing?
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:42.780]   Exactly.
[01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:44.180]   It'll drop it in.
[01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:45.220]   Do you have to transcode it?
[01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:47.020]   It isn't an MPEG-2 recording?
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:49.100]   Well, it'll put into iTunes.
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:51.900]   It'll tell you I want this prepared for use on the iPhone
[01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:52.780]   or the iPod.
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:54.460]   It will also give you a--
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:56.220]   let you establish a destination.
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:58.620]   I want you to please add it to this playlist in addition
[01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:00.180]   to adding it to the iTunes library.
[01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:02.180]   So I've got like playlists.
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:04.140]   I usually manage this with smart playlists
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:08.740]   because usually I have the ITV tag a little bit
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:11.100]   so I can find it later on with a smart playlist saying,
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:15.860]   please just show me the most recent three gigabytes worth
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:18.060]   of video that have been recorded on the ITV
[01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:22.180]   or just give me the freshest three Ferguson--
[01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:23.340]   or that sort of thing.
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:26.860]   What I would love is if it had the ability to say,
[01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:29.820]   yes, I'll have the whole episode, but also create me a set--
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:31.860]   that converse has the first 15 minutes.
[01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:35.500]   I can do that with AppleScript, but I'm still
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:40.500]   waiting for a DVR app for Windows Macintosh, anything
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:43.620]   that absolutely exploited the hell out of the fact
[01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:45.660]   that this is a living, breathing, thinking
[01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:48.620]   computer during the recording and not just some sort
[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:51.740]   of like turnkey system running Windows CE.
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:53.260]   Yeah.
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:54.020]   Very cool.
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:55.900]   Some great recommendations, everybody.
[01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:58.020]   Thank you all very much for joining us.
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:00.260]   And we want to invite you to watch us live.
[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:05.100]   We do this show live every Tuesday at 2 p.m.
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:07.100]   Eastern Time, that's 11 a.m.

[01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:16.340]   for Mac Break Weekly, still one of the top.
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:18.740]   I think it's maybe the number two tech show,
[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:22.380]   not in current, not in the best of list
[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:25.020]   because it's based on this most recent.
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:26.060]   Based on lies.
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:28.380]   It's based on lies, that's it.
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:29.100]   Thank you.
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:30.580]   Thank you for clarifying that.
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:31.580]   Absolutely.
[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:32.940]   I want that sound like--
[01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:34.900]   It's based on the most recent subscriptions,
[01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:36.660]   but we are-- we easily in downloads,
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:38.820]   we're certainly the top Mac show out there.
[01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:41.020]   I don't think we've ever been out of the top 25.
[01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:41.620]   Yeah.
[01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:42.900]   But that's-- but see, those lists
[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:44.340]   are based on this week.
[01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:45.380]   New subscribers this week.
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:46.220]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:46.980]   I know.
[01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:47.780]   The top 25.
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:48.340]   It is pretty amazing.
[01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:48.780]   Ever.
[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:49.300]   Yeah.
[01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:54.980]   So just go to the iTunes Store and click the podcast link.
[01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:56.140]   And search for Mac Break Weekly.
[01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:59.900]   And you can listen to us every week automatically.
[01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:02.420]   And we thank everybody for joining us.
