[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Jason and Ian Alex are here. We'll talk about Apple's plans to move
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.200]   out of China. It's going to take a little longer than you might think. What happened at the Atlanta
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.200]   Store and the St. Louis Store with unionization efforts to completely different outcomes?
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.000]   And then we're all going to sing as Apple adds karaoke to Apple music. Yes, it's going to be
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.480]   great. Stay tuned. Mac Break Weekly is next. Podcasts you love from people you trust. This is

[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.280]   Twitch studios. Happy holidays, everybody, and joining us for Mac Break Weekly, Mr. Jason Snell
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.400]   from Six Colors. I didn't hang any tinsel on. I don't have any lights on. I didn't get the memo,
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.000]   Leo. Geez, you're showing us up here. Until next week, a Festivus poll. Boy, oh, my God,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.400]   it's my lava lamp and my Stanford axe. You got a green lava lamp. You'd be done. That's all you need.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.720]   Oh, and I just realized you have a Eddie award behind you, don't you?
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.200]   I do. I do. I do have an Eddie award behind there, a Mac world. Eddie award.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.760]   They're zooming. John Ashley doesn't know where to zoom in. It's right. Yeah, it's the gold thing.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.360]   Yeah, it looks like an Oscar. Yeah, looks like an Eddie. I had to guess. I had to guess.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:51.040]   When I left, we used to make, we made extras because we didn't know the order time for an Oscar-style
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.920]   statuette, believe it or not, is a long order. We didn't always have the exact same number of
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.120]   winners every year, so we would have extras. There was a period there where we put the year on the
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.120]   statuette, which we stopped doing because it meant that if you got the number wrong, you had an
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.880]   extra expensive statuette. And what are you going to do with it? I don't know.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.160]   What are you going to do with it? Maybe eventually one of the editors will take it home.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.720]   You know, it's funny is I searched for Eddie awards. And ever since you guys gave up
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.280]   the ghost on the Eddie awards, all these people, the Eddie Awards is an annual event to celebrate
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.640]   Duval County's leading teachers. The Eddie Awards at the Eddie Awards.com
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:34.720]   for the independent artists biggest night, but there's more. I mean, it goes on and on and on.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.320]   Yeah, I'm not sure we ever had for a trademark on it.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.160]   Apparently not. For pensions and investments, there's an Eddie. Don't forget the Eddie.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.120]   Yeah, but none of them are an Oscar-esque figure holding a Mac SE above their head.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.600]   No, no. Shot-putting a NSE running system seven and crashing for the end time during
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.440]   an close to deadline. You know, it was originally the original Mac. And when they had to, for some
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.920]   reason, they had to redraw the statuette. I wonder if maybe Oscars called them and said,
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.320]   you need to make slight changes. But they did it. I think it's an SE or maybe it's a classic,
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.400]   but they did actually re-update the Mac. The little man instead of holding a sword,
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   as in the Academy Awards, he's holding a Mac, which is really cool like this.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.480]   Yeah, that's great. Or is he over his head? It's over his head. Like Atlas.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.760]   Right. So he may die if he drops it, but he's very strong.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.080]   Don't drop the Mac. Annie and I was also here from WG, Baye Chamboste.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:38.160]   Like Larry Bird at the three point line. Just shoot that Mac classic. Just shoot it. Nothing but net.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.360]   Last thing I do before I switch to Windows, damn it. I want real multitasking, not just
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.960]   switcher. Damn it. And my friends, Mr. Alex Lindsey from office hours. global and 090.media.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.440]   Hello, Alex. Hello, hello, hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. So,
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.960]   a lot of little bits. I guess the biggest story is, of course, China. We've talked about it for
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.840]   the last couple of weeks. The unrest in China is lighting a fire under Apple to get production
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.800]   moved out Wall Street channel. Go ahead. I think it's all the things are getting Apple a bit.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.640]   Yeah, I'll take it. It's not in Taiwan. I think it's the unrest.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.080]   Yeah, there's a whole bunch of reasons. And I think this is a good time for Apple because
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.600]   they're not picking it randomly. They're like, well, you've got all these other issues. And
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.320]   it's really shown a problem with why we shouldn't be here. We shouldn't be completely leaning on it.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.360]   But I think Apple, I think everyone's thinking about it.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:39.360]   Also, also, Tim Cook today is with President Biden and a couple other people at the new
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:47.440]   TSMC plant in Arizona. I think when the first really big, it was like a $40 billion plant.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.760]   Like when the first, I think one report was saying was with the largest foreign investment
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.560]   in US manufacturing. It wasn't initial. Initially, it was $12 billion. When we
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.840]   reported, they just upped it to 40. Yeah.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.000]   Our just foreign direct investment in the history of the United States or at least one of them.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.240]   And it's not as it can't make like Apple's latest chips. I think it's
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.640]   the originally that they announced was going to be five nanometer process. But then they said,
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.240]   actually, we're going to be doing four nanometer chips there too. But Apple has already said that
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.640]   we're going to have a lot of some of our production, some of our silicon produced there. Obviously,
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:28.480]   not the thing that goes into like the silicon Mac Pro. But this is what happens when the
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.320]   government says we're making it a national issue that we want to have more manufacturing
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.800]   in the United States. And that's to say nothing about like the Wall Street Journal had news about
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.560]   Apple trying to get more iPad production in India. And like we've been talking about week after week
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.000]   Apple's, the Alts is right. Apple has so many reasons to want it to spread its bets around right now.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.400]   And now there's opportunity to do so because there's so much competition or so much desire to scoop up
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.800]   all the people who are leaving or trying to take some of their business out of China right now.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:07.440]   Of course, Foxconn's a junk joke plan is called iPhone City 300,000 workers. And due to
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:13.360]   revolts, but partly against the one the zero COVID policy partly against the
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.120]   lack of bonuses promised to new workers, they're losing 40% of the production according to Apple.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.680]   This is a big that that journal story is really interesting. I am not a believer. I know that some
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.000]   people are believers in like Apple doing tactical leaks to the press. And I don't believe that that
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.720]   happens very often. However, the Saturday before Joe Biden is going to be at the TSMC plant and
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.640]   Wall Street Journal on a Saturday, which is you know, not your best day for the Wall Street Journal,
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.480]   honestly, does a story where Apple kind of inches away from China. It that feels a little more
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:50.000]   planted to me. But as we've been saying here for weeks and months and years, you know, how Apple
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.440]   does need to diversify, but when does it do it? And the journal story basically says that they seem
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.720]   to be in denial for a long time. But this last, I think the one two punch of that Mac shut down
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.640]   in Shanghai. And then this new issue with the iPhone has engaged them a little bit more and also
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.440]   given them, as we've said, more of an excuse to start the process going on. The journal story,
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.840]   it's funny that journal story, I'm a, you know, not everybody has read it, right? Because the
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.160]   journals behind a paywall, I'm a news plus subscriber. So as part of the Apple bundle,
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.040]   so I can read Wall Street Journal articles inside the Apple News app. And having read that article
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:31.040]   and then seeing how some blogs sort of restate it, I think they lost some nuance. Because like,
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.760]   I've seen stories that are like Apple is moving out of China. And it's like, Apple is going to begin
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:42.560]   to think about the process of starting to ponder how they might move some production or assembly
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:49.520]   out of China a little bit. But it is the first step in a process. And it's them specifically saying
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.800]   Vietnam and India. But even then the journal articles like, you know, this is not easy.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.720]   Easier said than done, Vietnam's population is so small that to get the size of the factories
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.920]   that Apple has in China, you kind of have to find like a large part of the population, which is not
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.240]   going to happen. And then in India, they've got the size in terms of the population. But
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.760]   India is a democracy with a lot of different states that all have their own regulations.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.400]   So they can't just make a deal with Modi and shake hands and then be done. They have to go to
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.280]   every individual state that they want to potentially locate in. So like the journal article feels
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:30.400]   really tactical to me. But at the same time, I think a lot of people have re reported it as
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.600]   way more definitive than it is. It really is like Apple doing a little bit of a head nod and say,
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.960]   yeah, we know.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:43.440]   It's a giant ship to turn. You know, and so it just doesn't have the trim that you would have
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.960]   with a little cigarette. You know, and so it's just like, you know, you're talking about a huge
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.360]   barge that needs to get turned and it's going to take five or 10 years for them to really,
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.320]   you know, do what they need to do. But they do need to start some at some point in time, you have to
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.760]   stay. We're going to start building something somewhere else. And they've already done that a
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:07.280]   little bit in India, Vietnam, Brazil, some somewhat because of other regulations. But they have to
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.160]   diversify it because, you know, we've seen this one thing we saw in COVID was the problem with being
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.680]   tied into one thing, like a lot of the stuff that we see sitting on the sidelines right now,
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.480]   especially in the AV world, but also in cars and everything else, was one fire in Japan. The
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:28.560]   AKM fire basically stopped all analog to digital conversions. And we've seen this in the past,
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:34.400]   you know, Tony, you know, the big, how they taped all the TV shows ended during the earthquake,
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:40.800]   because the only place to make those was, you know, was destroyed, you know, and then we had hard
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.200]   drive issues in Thailand. This idea that we can centralize, we've kind of almost gone the opposite
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.720]   way where we've centralized certain things where you build entire communities or cities around
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.520]   a product and may not be in our country, but it's not diversified. It's not really a global
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:03.520]   supply chain. It's a very local supply chain, just not in the United States. And so I think that
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:09.440]   there, I think everyone is getting clearer. And I think, again, China is you're going to be the
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.840]   epicenter when moving away because of mostly, I think it actually is going to mostly be, they'll
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:20.240]   use COVID as cover, but it's really Taiwan. Like China, all this saber rattling has everybody
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.520]   shaken up over what might happen next.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.960]   Yeah. And now the big difference is that we're seeing a lot of analysts are posting numbers on how
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:36.240]   many iPhone 14s they think Apple is going to be short this quarter. I think I've seen numbers as
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.280]   low as 2 million and as high as 6 million that they just not. And it's one thing to have this
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.720]   sort of abstract thing of, well, well, gosh, we're going to have a hard time making capacity. We're
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:50.720]   going to might have to prioritize once one channel over another. But no, it's like, no,
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:56.080]   there are 6 million upwards of 6 million phones that should have been available to the market
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.120]   this quarter that are not going to be there. And that's going to be affected right in the
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.800]   balance sheet. And that's where the conversations get a lot tougher.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:08.160]   The headline is Apple makes plans to this is the journal headline. And when you read it,
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:14.400]   you see that it's just, I agree with you, Jason, very good analysis. It's Apple. Just almost feel
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:19.280]   Tim Cook behind the scenes, the puppet master, you know, pulling the strings with China,
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.600]   pulling the strings with Biden, pulling the strings with the journal. Just he's amazing.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:29.120]   His diplomatic skills are amazing. This is the headline. Apple makes plans to move production
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:34.480]   out of China. That's probably not a revelation. The I and then the subtitle, the iPhone maker
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:41.520]   is looking looking to further diversify the supply chain. So it's very, it is much softer than anybody
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:47.680]   might assume if you read the blog post. Three, the, to me, the thing that stood out was this
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.880]   number, which I'd never seen before, that iPhone City has 300,000 workers. Where do you build a
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:58.320]   factory? Where in the world, maybe you're right, India, maybe, but that where you could get 300,000
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:03.040]   people in one place. And you don't want them in one place. For low paying jobs. That's another
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:08.400]   problem. Yeah. But can you, but can you, I don't know, that's an interesting question.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:14.800]   You have such efficiencies of scale in China, because you have all the suppliers. They do just
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:19.840]   in time delivery to one spot, one plant, right? Where you have everybody there who can assemble
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.320]   a thing. Yeah. It's kind of hard to imagine, Oh, we're going to have 15 plants. What does that
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:29.120]   mean? You're going to drop ship these all over the world. It's not, I could see why Tim Cook's going,
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:34.800]   and he's a supply Jane guru. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's, and part of it is just the machinery.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.040]   And I'm not just talking about the actual machines in China assembling products, but
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.920]   the ability to put in a change in the hardware or change in the workflow, or we need this to be
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.000]   flashed at this step instead of this other step, the ability to make that to make that change
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.280]   in without having to say, okay, we're going to have to stop everything. We need four days to
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:57.440]   retool to re change everything. They are so good at those factories at not keeping that line going
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.760]   and adapting to the needs of specifically for Apple, because let's not forget that a lot of the
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.920]   machinery that is in a lot of those factories are doing the hottest chips and the hottest fab
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.640]   are machinery that Apple essentially bought and paid for by saying, we need, you need, we need a
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:17.280]   factory that can that can assemble a glass to this tolerance. And then Fox policy, great, we will
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.400]   build one to that specification because if if you were if you guys want it today, then Samsung and
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.000]   everyone else is going to want it two years from now, we're good. You can also see why this number
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.560]   precludes doing it in America, right? I think there are a lot of people. I'm sure President Biden
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:38.000]   included the chips act was a huge $200 billion, a congressional funding for building chip plants
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.360]   in the in the US. That's why TSMC is doing that. By the way, that TSMC plant they say is
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.760]   eventually going to do the three nanometer process. They're not ruling it out. Just won't be doing
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:53.680]   it right away. But if you're, I mean, I can imagine that the Congress and the administration would
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.800]   love to have iPhones made in the US, that's that's completely out of the picture. Isn't it?
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.440]   It's not if you want to not if you want to just pay what you're paying right now for an iPhone.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.480]   Most people, which would cost. Yeah, exactly. I don't I don't think would necessarily be
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:14.160]   prohibitive, but it would be significant. And the thing is that we have a much, much, much stronger
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.720]   labor movement as as weakened as it has become in the past 20 or 30 years, we have a very,
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:24.480]   very good labor movement in the United States. And we would not we would not tolerate being able to
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:31.040]   have to pay $130 for a four pack of underwear. Yeah. And because that's what this is.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:37.280]   Ultimately, in Zhengzhou is a labor movement. Workers are striking. They're unofficially,
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.400]   they're saying, stand up for your rights, you know, there there's there they're saying specifically
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.320]   that number one, they were put into hazardous situations where people who tested, they're saying
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.400]   people on campus who in the factory campus that have tested positive for COVID are not being
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:55.840]   isolated. They're also saying that the people who were being recruited in to travel to take these
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.160]   jobs were promised bonuses on the specific schedule. They show up and say, Oh, by the way,
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.480]   we won't be paying you on this schedule. You'll have to work longer and later and take less money.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.640]   And they said, go to help. We're going to nice, nice, nice set of gates. Wonder what would look
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:13.040]   like for smashing laying on the ground. And those are the people who got beaten by being with sticks
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.240]   by cops. That's not a good that's not a good look. It's also the the we should say also in America,
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:23.440]   you can't flip that switch, right? You it takes time. Like this is you put the you put the chip
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:29.600]   plant in, you put other parts of the equation in, and then what happens is very slowly, right?
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.320]   Because because TSMC's concern was they also have to have people to run the plant and they've got to
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.680]   get the materials from the outside. And like, and this is a thing where at this the US hasn't done
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:46.400]   some of this stuff in a while. And so you need to have not only is it like the universities and
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.840]   all of that, but it's the infrastructure that builds up around it. So what you do is you put
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.320]   something in, you pay that premium, you pay a lot more than it's actually, right? I think the
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:02.160]   the president of TSMC said 50% more per chip, basically, out of this factory. So it's a huge
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:07.680]   premium. But you know, the US says we're willing to pay it to have this in the US. And what you want
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:13.920]   to see is very slowly an ecosystem grow around it where everybody says, Oh, well, we want to be
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.560]   next to the TSMC plant, or we want to be able to hire away some of the people who are working at
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:23.280]   TSMC to work at Intel or whatever. And so we're going to be in Phoenix. And then like you look back
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:30.880]   in 10 years maybe, and in that area in Phoenix, suddenly a burgeoning kind of chip and manufacturing
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:36.320]   ecosystem has grown. But right now it's like it was dropped down from space. That's how you start.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:42.080]   It's never going to happen. And what are the odds? Do you think? Well, we have China will
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:48.400]   put it'll get a lid on these protests, because they'll roll tanks and that and that it'll go away.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:54.000]   And in six months, back to business as usual, because it's the best way to do it.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.080]   Yeah, I don't think it's I just don't think it's about I think it's about Taiwan. Like everyone's
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:03.280]   afraid of Taiwan. Everyone's afraid that at some point China is going to go into Taiwan. And then
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:08.960]   they can't politically continue to manufacture in China. Like the way that when you saw in Russia,
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:14.640]   any country that held out even for a week was basically a traitor. And so the even people just
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.240]   wanted a moment to think that wasn't it weren't that you weren't allowed to do that. And that's
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:24.160]   going to be way worse because we're much more attached to Taiwan than we were to the Ukraine.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.320]   And so it's not going to be defendable. Like Apple will have to shut down the
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:34.880]   factories in China if they go into Taiwan. And then they'll be left with whatever they got
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:40.160]   done between now and then. So there's a it probably won't be perfect. But it's all about I believe
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:45.040]   that it's all about Taiwan. And and China fades Taiwan. The least of our worries are going to be
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.800]   where we're going to make our iPhones. Well, it's going to be a big worry for Apple. I mean, you know,
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:54.800]   I guess let me tell you that's World War three. That's not nice. We'll just roll over and say,
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:59.920]   go ahead, Biden keeps saying no, no, we're going to defend Taiwan. Yeah, I mean, the thing is,
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.520]   is that that you know, China's got a lot of problems internally. And so we want to keep on
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:08.400]   applying that pressure. If everyone did stop doing work in China, the economy would become
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:14.160]   pretty unhinged pretty quickly in China as well. So so you know, and they have their own China
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:20.240]   has a growing number of problems inside of internally that that they have to kind of manage.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:26.880]   There's the they peaked, right? China's peaked. Yeah, like so, so it's now putting out it's going
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:32.320]   to be putting out fires pretty fast. And so, and we but the point is, is that regardless of what
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.800]   would happen, going into Taiwan would be a big deal for everyone. And I think everyone's trying
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:41.840]   to figure that out. Also, you know, Foxconn has been working on fully automated, you know, warehouses
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:47.200]   and not succeeding yet. But they have been working on that for a decade. You know, so they've been,
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.960]   they've been building, you know, pieces of these and they keep on adding more and more automation.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:55.360]   So if it comes to the United States, it's not going to be 300,000 people. It's going to be 30,000,
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.960]   you know, like it's going to be, you know, they're going to cost more, but there'll be a lot less of
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:04.320]   the robots. Yeah, robots, you know, that's what Foxconn spends a lot of money. And the reason that
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.880]   they haven't had to accelerate that is because the wages are so low. You know, so it doesn't. So,
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.840]   a lot of times when wages are low, there's a lot of automation that's available at a certain price.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:17.680]   It's kind of like with drilling oil, like we can get cheap oil and then we get expensive oil. And
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.800]   once you get to a certain point, you'll just start putting them putting the machines in to do it.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:26.160]   And that's what we did the Mac Pro, you know, for the trash cans, the Mac Pros were built in
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:32.240]   mostly by robots. Like, yeah, not very well, right? Well, I don't know if it, well,
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.520]   they didn't work, but I don't think those morbid design issues are going to assemble the issue.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:40.000]   I don't know. I got, I got, I traded one in. I the first one I got had all sorts of
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.200]   mechanical issues. But as we, I mean, a lot of the problems that machines aren't very good at,
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.560]   they're not good. It's looking at something complex and then trying to figure out how to
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.880]   nudge it once we're the other to make it work. AI is going to make that better and better and
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:58.000]   better where it can, it can figure that stuff out relatively quickly. And so, you know, a lot of the,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.160]   you know, anything that's a rote-resa-assembly has got maybe 10 or 15 years left before it's
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:08.000]   almost all a machine. I wanted to say something about just the idea of, you know, we were talking
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   about Taiwan and contingencies and all that. I think the truth is we may look back on this on
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.240]   five or 10 years in the future and say, well, it didn't happen. So this was all not worth it.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.920]   And the day, right, they didn't need to diversify from China. It all worked out. They put all that
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:29.600]   money into India and into Vietnam and into building ship factories here in the US. And,
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.320]   and we didn't actually need to do any of that. But I also think that part of it is they're playing
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:40.640]   the game here, right, which is if it doesn't happen, one of the reasons it doesn't happen maybe because
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:45.680]   of the diversification, right? That you want to take the pressure off a little bit and say,
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:51.920]   look, China, not all of our stuff is in, is in your country anymore. And that that is part of the,
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.400]   the larger picture here. I don't know. It is, you know, fundamentally, if I'm Tim Cook,
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:04.800]   I, I am looking at, uh, severing ties with China, like so much of the Western world did with Russia
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:11.440]   as an extinction level event. And so for me, it's just like, I need to have a, a fallback site,
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:17.440]   even if it is more expensive and lower production and not something that's a long-term solution,
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.600]   it's better than no knowledge, right? Like literally like, we don't even know how to start.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.640]   That's, they're doing that part now, even if, uh, it's not very realistic, uh, in the near term.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:32.800]   And the, the, the, the equation that I use for risk is the chances of something happening multiplied
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.880]   by the consequences. Yeah. It's like an asteroid. Very small. Yeah. The chances are very small,
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.800]   but the consequences are very big and that means the risk is high. Yeah. And also keep,
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:45.360]   keep in, keep in mind that the, as, as Jason, as Jason points out every single quarter with his
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.160]   scripts, the biggest chunk of Apple's profit pie is still hard, hard work by a long stretch.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:56.160]   They're doing a great job of getting money from services. But if, if, if anything, if anything
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.320]   causes iPhone sales to tank, that's going to hurt a lot. That's going to, that's going to be when you,
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.200]   when you, when you hear like people say, oh, well, they're, they're turning down the heat on the
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.160]   Apple car project, where they're turning out, turning down the heat on these other projects that,
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.320]   they don't know if it's going to be a, it's going to be a business yet. And for, but fortunately,
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.480]   Apple, they'd have to have five really bad years before they even change the, the, the
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:23.680]   grade of coffee and the cafeteria. Yeah. I mean, I think that this is also gets into like where,
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.920]   where should Apple keep its, its cash position? Because a lot of times it's giving away a lot of
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:32.480]   that money back to individends. It's doing lots of buybacks. At some point, it may want to build up a
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.120]   little bit of cash. For a while, Apple had a problem that their cash position was so high that it was,
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:43.120]   it became complicated for them because they have too much cash for their, for their market cap.
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:48.160]   But the market cap now is so high, they could, they could afford to increase that cash position to,
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.760]   you know, buffer themselves a little bit more in case something happened.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:58.480]   According to CNBC, Apple's looking at making the iPad in India. This is,
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.920]   CNBC sources are close to the Indian government, which so it may just be the Indian wishful thinking
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.800]   from the Indian government. The problem, of course, lack of manufacturing expertise.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:16.880]   This, you know, this, it's funny how this was a cascade of problems starting with supply chain
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:22.640]   issues. And now zero COVID and riots in the factory. I mean, it really has been coming on for a year.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:27.760]   Well, and I think as Jason said, talked about last week, I think with the, it's not just that
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.400]   it's zero COVID, it's that China still could not manage a COVID outbreak. The reason they have zero
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.560]   COVID is if it actually gets out, right, there's going to be all kinds of trouble, you know, and,
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:41.600]   and they'll have a whole new set of problems of just incredible mortality rates, because they just
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.960]   don't, they don't have an effective vaccine and they don't have the hospitals to manage.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.880]   That's why they're doing all of that, of course. And so it's, you know, so there's still, that's
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:53.200]   still looming over them. Yeah, there's a reason why they had zero COVID. It wasn't just present.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.840]   She's good idea. And they haven't gotten any further ahead. They're not reaching any version
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:02.720]   of herd immunity. So all that that that COVID just keeps, you know,
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:08.320]   we've kind of seen this, haven't we? We've seen this play out that that, you know,
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.160]   there is a certain advantage. There is a certain advantage to letting people get sick.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:17.200]   Or just or getting them vaccinated, but between vaccination and getting sick,
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:23.920]   the United States now has a fair amount of herd immunity between infection and vaccination.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:29.360]   22% of all US Americans have gotten COVID and half of them lie about it.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:38.800]   Say they haven't. You guys, I'm on to you. I fully admit it. You've gotten it. I know Alex.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:44.480]   Yeah. I got it on the show. Yeah. You actually got it on the show. I actually had it.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:50.960]   I got it. It was on set on the show. I'm tempted in the family. Thank God we're on Zoom.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.200]   He's right now. It's very, very loyal. That's one of the things we love about him.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.320]   I mean, if you're going to get COVID, do it for hashtag content.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:02.800]   Exactly. Exactly. By the way, a big thanks to Zoom ISO, Andy, Carl,
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:08.560]   Uchio and the Zoom folks and our engineers who we've, we're using a little bit of a different
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.560]   kind of Zoom today on the show. And I don't know if you noticed, but it's a lot better for the host
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:17.840]   because they're all in a single call, which means they can see and talk to each other and so forth.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.480]   Yeah. So much better. Cool. Yeah. Do you have, you don't have John Ashley,
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:27.760]   a picture of what they see that you could pull up? Oh, um, like what they're, because they're
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.120]   seeing something different from what you're seeing at home. Well, if I want to get, let me,
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.760]   let me do a little ratting. This might be a little complicated. Well, it's not complicated.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:41.520]   He's got to do some routing magic. I've now figured out that this did say no well, but they've
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:49.120]   black taped the N in the no well, hidden it behind some trees. And now it says sort of backwards letter
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:54.960]   Leo, which is, I guess good. There's a bunch of Easter eggs. Oh, there we go. So this is what you
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:01.600]   guys see, which is much more like a Zoom call that everybody's familiar with. In the past,
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.200]   all they've seen is what we're streaming, you know, what the, or putting out on the podcast,
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:09.040]   which is the, the current shot, you have a fifth screen, which we're not showing,
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:14.800]   that shows you what the current shot is, the program. This is me like cutting it right now.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.800]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. No, it's, it's big because it was like two second delay,
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.480]   and now it's less than a second. And everybody's like, why do we interrupt each other? And it's like,
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:28.240]   not only can we hear what's going on, not delayed, but I can also see when, when Andy is leaning forward
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:33.520]   and getting ready to talk. And so I know, you know, not to, that Andy's got it. Yeah, it's big.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.200]   We're doing it on all our shows. This is the first time we've done on Mac Brick Weekly that's
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.400]   worked. And it's really great. So thank you, John Ashley, for being the answer. I've done it without
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:46.000]   help of Jammer Bee. I know Jammer Bee's out for hip surgery. He's the, he was the only one who knew
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.240]   how to do it. He's slowly got, you know, passed knowledge. So what's funny is we were actually
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.560]   going to, she was going to try to train all of us do it. However, the times you try to do it,
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:59.440]   there was some small issues that popped up. We were trying to do it before. On the show and stuff
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:04.480]   and things like that. So now almost everybody knows how to do it, which is good. And we're slowly,
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.320]   slowly. It's a big improvement, I think. I probably shouldn't mention it though, right?
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:12.960]   Because it's going to break the soon, as soon as I mention. No, it's not. It's not going to break.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:17.520]   All right, let's take a little break. Speaking of breaks and come back, there is more to talk
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:23.120]   about lots more, lots of little stories and one more big story, speaking of unions. But first a word
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:30.000]   from our sponsor, Zip Recruiter. There are great jobs out there in the world, you know, and there's
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   great employees. Zip Recruiter's mission is to bring the two together. Right now, a great time,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.760]   a lot of businesses hiring for the festive jobs, Turkey catcher, bilingual Santa Claus,
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:51.840]   nut gift basket assembler, reindeer wrangler. Believe it or not, I am not making any of those
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:58.880]   jobs up. They are listed on Zip Recruiter. So wow, any kind of job, a lot of good seasonal jobs out
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:04.240]   there. If Zip Recruiter can find a nut gift basket assembler, they can fill any role I can guarantee
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:09.440]   you. We've used Zip Recruiter for years as the way, you know, and the thing about hiring is you're
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:16.080]   always doing it, you know, kind of with some urgency, at least we are somebody because we have such
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:21.280]   a great staff. When somebody leaves, goes to another job or, you know, whatever decides not to work here.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:28.480]   I can't take working with that Leo anymore. Then we are down a person and we have 15 people,
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:33.200]   down a person is a big deal. So it's important that we fill that job fast. When we go to Zip Recruiter,
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.600]   it works so well. It works so well for a number of reasons. First thing, of course,
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:43.280]   when you post a job opening on Zip Recruiter, it goes out to all the job boards, like 100 plus
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.840]   job boards and social media, it goes out to the cast the widest possible net. But don't worry,
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:54.720]   because those applicants aren't going to jam your phone lines or fill your email. Every applicant
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:59.680]   goes into the Zip Recruiter interface and the Zip Recruiter interface is so great. It makes it easy
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:03.680]   to rank everybody, eliminate people you don't want, hire the right person fast,
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:09.600]   it reformats all the resumes so it's easy to scan them. It gives you screening questions so you can,
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.840]   you know, screen out people who are just not right for the job. And then there's the secret sauce that
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:20.880]   Zip Recruiter does. That's so cool. Their technology finds the right candidate for your job. It actually
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:25.760]   scans through all the applicants they've got on file, finds the people who are perfect,
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:31.840]   and then sends you their names and says these guys might be great. You invite the ones you like to
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.720]   apply and I have to say our experience has been and I think this is really true globally. When you
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.400]   invite somebody to apply for a job say, Hey, I saw your resume, you look like you'd be great for this
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:46.800]   job. They are so much more likely to, you know, go through the process. They tend to be the best
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:52.160]   candidates. It's all handled from that easy to use dashboard where you can filter review,
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:58.240]   rate your candidates. And I can tell you this, when we post on Zip Recruiter at breakfast, we have,
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:03.120]   I always amazed Lisa will say before lunch, Hey, oh, here's a good one. Oh, here's another good one.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:09.680]   Put another one for out of five employers. We're not alone who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:15.680]   candidate within the first day. Zip Recruiter helps you find qualified candidates fast. Try it
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:23.600]   at phrase ziprecruiter.com/makbreak. Ziprecruiter.com/makbreak.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.800]   M-A-C-B-R-E-A-K. We thank you so much, Zip Recruiter, for your support all these years,
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:35.280]   for helping us hire the best people fast. And we thank you, dear Mac Break listener and viewer,
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:42.400]   for using that address. So that way, they know you sign here. Ziprecruiter.com/makbreak.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:48.640]   Thank you, Ziprecruiter. All right, we have recaffeinated and are ready for round two.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:53.760]   You know, it's funny when I was in real radio.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:32:03.120]   Often, I was told, and this is true in TV too, don't do stories about unions, about labor.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:06.960]   They're the kiss of death. People just tune them right out. Nobody's interested.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:13.760]   But I'm going to do it anyway, because I think it's a pretty big story. The NLRB is now weighing
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:21.440]   in saying Apple's anti-union tactics in Atlanta were illegal. But by the way, there's more to this
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:29.040]   story. But that's the first bit of this. US Labor Board prosecutors have determined that
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:33.920]   Apple has violated federal law. What do they do? They're interrogated and coerced employees in
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:40.000]   Atlanta. They also concluded Apple held mandatory anti-union meetings during which management made
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:47.360]   coercive statements. Now Apple's turn to settle. Otherwise, a complaint will be issued. Apple did
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:53.040]   not have a response. This is from Bloomberg today. Communication workers of America have been trying
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:57.600]   to unionize at the Atlanta store. Now, the second part of this story is kind of interesting though.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:09.440]   In St. Louis, this is from nine to five Mac, Apple store employees called or the union called off a
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:16.640]   union vote. Apple employees at the St. Louis Galleria store were the latest to move toward
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:21.200]   unionization last month, one week after submitting interest, the group abandoned the plan.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:30.000]   The union cited increased hostility from Apple. But the employees now say, "No,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.520]   we did a straw poll and nobody wanted it, so we can't solve it." Those were two different
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:43.680]   unions though. This is weird. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.560]   That's a different union than the communication workers.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:55.920]   It's particularly scummy because when the IAM withdrew the vote, they basically said, "Oh,
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:00.960]   well, there's too much intimidation and there's too much this and that." Then, basically, the 60
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:06.240]   of the 80 employees in St. Louis basically said, "Yeah, we're going to sign this document that
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:11.760]   starts with we are not being coerced or dictated to an Apple in both ways." Anyway, what they're
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:16.720]   saying is, "BS, we're not going to vote for it anyway." So apparently, they wanted to get some
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:21.360]   sort of victory. Rather than let us vote them down, they decided to withdraw the election.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.080]   Yeah. I think that that happens all the time.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:29.280]   By the way, if you propose a union election and realize, "You're not going to win it,
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:36.720]   why even go forward?" It depends on what employees are involved. A lot of this comes down to
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:42.000]   management. The quality of the management, even at the individual store and how the employees
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.480]   feel, if employees think that they have upward mobility, they don't want to touch the union.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:52.640]   They don't want to be tarnished with the union as they look at the potential of going into
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:58.400]   management or going into people who work at Apple stores, sometimes think that someday,
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:03.360]   they'll end up at Cupertino. If you work at a store that's unionized, you'll never be in Cupertino.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.240]   That's a zero. They don't want the intersection to spread.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.560]   Well, no, no, no. Exactly. No, no, no. They won't put the...
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.040]   The Apple's not... This is zero union policy.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:19.840]   This is not Apple. This is every company. Every company, once you're in the union,
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:26.160]   when you join the union, you're saying, "I don't think it's going to get any better here,
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.120]   so I would like to do something to ensure that I get what I need."
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:35.040]   That's a management problem, because if they don't feel like there's an opportunity upward,
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.920]   they're going to take the ground that they have now. If they feel like it's going upward,
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.200]   then they don't want to be in the union because they know that they'll never get there.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:43.840]   So...
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:48.960]   It's basically... Unionizing is basically, "I give up. I'm not going to go any further than here,
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:54.720]   and I want to ensure that I have the rights that I have right here." That's when management fails,
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:59.920]   to give them the feeling that it's worth being there.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:04.080]   Or fails. Or let's face it, let it fails to take care of them properly.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:04.560]   Exactly.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:09.040]   Does things like saying, "Hey, we're not going to pay you for the hour you spend in line getting
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:14.640]   searched as you go home." Things like that. That's when you get a union. That's appropriate.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:19.760]   And it comes down to... It will come down to a store-by-store, too.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.120]   Well, that's what I'm saying. It's very interesting, because what happened in St. Louis is very
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.280]   different than what happened in Atlanta, right? The St. Louis people said, "No, no, we just
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:33.200]   decided we didn't want it." In Atlanta, it sounds like, according to the NLRB,
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:38.240]   that some pretty serious anti-union tactics were employed by Apple.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:42.880]   This was an actual finding by the NLRB. It means nothing when you see, "Oh, well, gosh,
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:47.600]   you can go on the NLRB site and see what complaints have been lodged against which companies."
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:51.200]   That doesn't mean anything. It means something if they actually take action.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:56.480]   And that was pretty obvious that was going to happen here, because those are really simple,
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:03.440]   clear rules that a company has to allow people to communicate and organize
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:09.520]   about possibly forming a union. You can't interfere with that. And there are specific ways that you're
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:13.600]   outlining saying, "You can't do this. You can't do this. You can't do this." And at least at that
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:19.600]   Apple store, they did this, that and that of the thing, too. So two different stories. But it is
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:25.200]   weird that all these very, very weird unions are trying to get more membership by claiming that,
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:30.720]   "Okay, well, are they information workers? Are they atsy? Are they truckers? Are they whatever?"
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:36.720]   It's going to be hard. But it does show that a lot of the complaints that they're consistently
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.880]   being made by these individual stores are the same as complaints that are being made
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:46.400]   pretty much all across retail, where it's like you're basically treating us not as valued employees,
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:51.200]   not as people who have experience and do our jobs very, very well, but as essentially sacks
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.880]   of rice that you can buy more, you can buy less, so you don't really care what happens to the
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:00.400]   sacks of rice. You can schedule them regularly, you can schedule them irregularly. They basically,
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:07.840]   they're asking for, as I think Alex put it very, very well, that it is sad that if you do try to
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:14.240]   work with a union, that it does put a ceiling on you in terms of further advancement with a lot of
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:20.320]   organizations. However, if you're saying that, "Look, I am not under the delusion that this is a
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:26.880]   ground floor towards having a line on the apple org chart that answers directly to Tim Cook,
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:32.320]   I just want a really good retail job within my immediate community that I enjoy, and I want
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.000]   these conditions to be better than they are right now. If Apple is holding themselves to be
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.920]   this green company, this human company, this human rights company, I should be treated better
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.000]   than much better than someone who works at Walmart, and I'm not getting that.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:52.320]   Yeah, and I doubt that there's this mass desire to move to Cupertino when you get a job at the
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:56.080]   Apple Store. I wonder though, how often does that happen?
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.000]   How often does that happen? I don't know. I actually know folks that started the Apple Store and
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.320]   ended up in Cupertino. It's not that it's not an unknown, definitely not unheard of. I've actually
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:12.960]   know multiple people that have done that. The ones that we worked with in the San Francisco store,
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:19.920]   so anyway, but I think that the, and there's also a chance to move up within the retail area,
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.640]   Apple isn't the, Cupertino's not the only place Apple has offices. So there's lots of things that
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:29.040]   are available, even just moving up within that rank. And if you're in the top, in any place that
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:35.760]   wants to unionize, if you feel like you're one of the top 25%, 20% performers, the union's not good
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:40.800]   for you. They're not for you, they're for everybody else. And so you're going to be held back by
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:46.160]   being caught up in the group. And so folks that are on that front edge,
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:49.920]   always want to, I mean, if they generally always don't want to be part of a union,
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:55.760]   and obviously a bunch of people in San Luis felt like they were, and that mostly has to do with
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:02.000]   their manager. They're taken care of, they feel like they're... I have to assume that corporate,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.760]   the benefits are the same at all stores, right? It's not, you don't get a different salary or
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:11.520]   different benefits if you're working in Atlanta than St. Louis, or do you?
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:17.680]   It's more like how you're treated. It's probably how you're treated. And it's little things that
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:22.720]   Andy talked about. It's how you're scheduled and are you getting paid for it and how, and just
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.600]   really how you're supposed to be the manager. And that's up to the manager. But, but,
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:29.760]   and whether you're moving up, so forth, they're probably the same across the board, I would manage.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:34.160]   Yeah, more or less. Yeah. And they do actually pay better than this. It's not as though they're
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:38.800]   paying minimum wage, state or federal minimum wage per state. They actually pay very well.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.680]   As a retail job goes, it's very good. But that doesn't mean that it sucks to have to be on call
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:47.040]   for several days in which you're not being paid and you're expected that well, we put you on the
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.800]   schedule for Thursday, even though even though you told us that you can't possibly do Thursday
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:56.000]   afternoon, but we're pretty on the schedule anyway. Tough, tough, tough to hand in your car if you
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:03.200]   don't want to do that. So, so apparently Tim Cook is right now speaking at the TSMC ground breaking
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:12.320]   in Arizona. And he says apparently in his speech, this is Tim. I'm the CEO of Apple.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:19.840]   Cook, Tim Cook is my name. No, good morning. Here's good morning. He said, we've already made a
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:25.920]   decision to be buying out of a plant in Arizona. This plant in Arizona starts up in 24. So,
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:30.880]   we've got about two years ahead of us on that one, maybe a little less. And in Europe, I'm sure
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:35.120]   this is Tim is such a diplomat. And in Europe, I'm sure we'll also source from Europe as those
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:39.920]   plans become more apparent. He said this at the meeting which included Apple Services Chief
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:45.920]   Eddy Q and head of retail and human resources, Deirdre O'Brien talking to the employees at the new
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:52.320]   plant, or no, maybe he's talking to Apple employees. Yeah, it was an eternal meeting in Germany with
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:58.000]   local engineering and retail employees. Okay. So, this is not, this is not speaking at the plant,
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:04.720]   this was in Germany. Yeah. Still, will the age, you know, one of the Apple blogs in the nine to five
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:10.720]   said it, the A chips will never be made at TSMC. But the Wall Street Journal story did say, in fact,
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:14.800]   that the plan was at some point to get those three nanometer processes working there. I don't
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:20.480]   know how hard that is. What I do know is that they can't get it in China, because that is technology
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:26.960]   blocked. Yeah. Bye bye. So much, so much of what's going on in the world today, especially and in
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:33.440]   China has to do with that with that block. The fact that the fact that China can't even buy the really
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:38.080]   good vaccines, even if they were inclined to do so and sort of admit that their own vaccines were
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:42.960]   not very good, they're not allowed no no American companies allowed to sell like American vaccines
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:50.320]   in China. And that's the blowback from all the espionage, industrial espionage has been going on,
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:55.520]   the assurance that look, if we if this if we allow anything to be manufactured in China,
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:59.520]   they will steal that process and they will start basically making their own knockoffs of whatever
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:04.400]   that is. It really is biting them in the butt, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. And I'm sorry that people
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.920]   are dying about it. That's so much that we're better, that there's a lot of that's but that's a
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:18.880]   complicated problem. We have pretty much avoided the Elon subject. Have we maybe not? Last week,
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:23.680]   of course, Elon declared war against Apple literally said I'm declaring war against Apple.
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:30.000]   Then Tim Cook said, come on down, come to the campus. Let's talk. Elon posts, you know,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.120]   Twitter photos of the beautiful lake at the campus and said, Oh, Tim said, we never considered
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:44.080]   banning the Twitter app. We love you. Now, Elon says, Apple has fully resumed advertising on the
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:50.720]   platform. I don't believe anything. Elon says, but clearly, when he said when he put that picture,
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:57.120]   I was like, Oh, he took him to the thinking pool. He did. He said, let's walk. Let's go for a walk.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:00.880]   Yeah. The pool is like this little space, right? The very middle of the thing. And it's just all
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:05.760]   surrounded and it's just like, it's like, you don't even know you're there. So it's that's such a
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:10.720]   powerful place. Like even even Elon Musk, I think he's still is he still like the richest man in the
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:16.800]   world. He could not help but like tweet from his Twitter account. Like like, like every like,
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:23.200]   every like every journalist, the first time they get here, I am at the Apple campus. I have a
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:32.960]   private conversation with Tim Cook. So I mean, it's unclear what's going on with Apple's ad
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:37.760]   spendings. I don't I'm not spending any time on Twitter to look for Apple ads. So I'll just have to,
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:45.600]   you know, we'll just have to defer to whatever. There was there was one. There was, I think we
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:52.320]   talked last week about about a report about how one of Apple's like corporate ad advisors that
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.840]   advises a lot of different companies were advising their clients to pull out, right,
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:00.960]   but put the brakes on another actually there was another set of like, ex-apple employees that were
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:05.920]   saying that that they think that the reason why that the Apple might have pulled ads temporarily was
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:13.200]   because of the the nightclub shooting. They didn't want to take the risk that an Apple ad would appear
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:17.680]   next to look at tweet that's related to that. So I mean, if you have if you ever hear,
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:24.640]   hear me come within a mile of complaining about about Tim Cook being a diplomat of like, I've
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:28.560]   slapped me down hard. I don't think I ever have. But if I ever do, because you see the you see the
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:33.760]   opposite of that where no, I'm just going to blower my mouth every anytime and anywhere on any subject
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:38.560]   without without making any claim that I simply seem to know what I'm talking about. And the fact
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:43.360]   that I was amazed that he even got invited to the campus because that's it seemed it seemed as though
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:48.160]   the answer would have been we're just going to let where someone's going to give Elon a cookie
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:54.960]   and we'll send him to the nap. Yeah, he had the cookie. Yeah, isn't that hysterical?
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:46:00.240]   Yeah, calm down. We're going to use the juice box. Here's a cookie. It's going to be okay. We'll
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:06.000]   get over to Apple Park. According to some Elon jumped the gun that it was the nightclub shooting.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.760]   Apple all and all advertisers do this. You know, you never I remember in radio if a plane crashed
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:15.840]   with thank God planes don't crash much anymore. Boy, if a plane crash, you'd pull all the
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:22.160]   airline advertising. Of course, that's you know, and then it comes back and Elon is so kind of out
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:26.960]   of touch with with how this stuff works. And I don't blame him. It's not his job. But he doesn't
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:32.560]   have anybody else to do it. So he's got to do it. Elon said, Oh my God, they're pulling it. And
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:37.920]   and I'm sure that's exactly what Tim said. You know, this is normal. There are ups and downs.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:42.800]   We're back. And so he lends now saying they're back. But you know, well, and the other thing is,
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:46.640]   I think Tim Cook, probably more than almost any other CEO out there is really good at
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:50.320]   understanding like he just looks at it coldly like I got to keep the company going and I got to
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:55.360]   keep things moving forward. And he definitely has some lines in the sand that he won't cross.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:59.840]   But outside of that, he's like, Well, we're just going to like, what can I give you that doesn't
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:03.520]   damage what I'm doing? And isn't that what you want CEO? I mean, isn't that
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:09.840]   perfect CEO? Yeah. And he's not emotional about it. He's not, you know, he doesn't have he has the
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.760]   things that he won't do. And then outside of that, he's just kind of like, you know, you can't get
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:21.200]   into the iPhone. Everybody has to have integrity. And so that would be no good if you were squishy.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:26.960]   But he's really good. He's what a CEO should be somebody who manages internally and externally.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:31.040]   And I think to some degree, a CEO is mostly about external, right, Jason.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:38.080]   And he has the unique position and the and a reputation and that he's one of the few people
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:42.640]   who can kind of deprogram Elon Musk a little bit, right? Like, most of us will be like, Elon,
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:46.240]   you don't understand how it works. He's like, ah, you're just you're just blue chick elites.
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:51.760]   You don't know. And Tim Cook could be like, okay, I know what your pals, I know what DHH is telling
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:56.480]   you about app store rejections and all that. Let me explain to you what our policy actually is
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:00.880]   about it and why parlor wasn't on. And then and then they came on and like, here's what we're
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:05.760]   looking for. And it's not we're trying to moderate your site for you. But there is a basic level,
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:10.960]   a standard of moderation that we want every social media site to offer. And if you stay on
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.960]   that side of it, we're not going to have a problem. And he probably said, let me tell you about our
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:18.880]   in app purchase thing. And it's we're going to take a percentage, but it's real convenient. But you
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:23.360]   can also offer it on your website if you want to. And it's fine. Like, and just kind of talk
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:29.520]   him out of the frenzy. Because you know, most of what Elon is listening to these days is people
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:36.080]   who've got conspiracy theories about how well everything is every they're out to get you men.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:40.480]   And then Tim Cook's like, listen, chill out man. He's surrounded by yourself. He's seren himself
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:46.560]   with those people. So it is detriment. And it was going to tell him, no, when it's and Tim Cook might
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:51.200]   be one of the few people who could say, that's not reality. Don't listen to that. And Elon,
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:57.200]   I think we're starting to understand as a kind of this deeply narcissistic, you know, he's got
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:03.360]   this narcissistic injury. No, somebody like Tim Cook reaches out to him. Elon is so flattered.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:09.840]   And it's, you know, that to be treated as an equal, Elon was a lot like Trump, where he felt
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:14.800]   like he'd been, you know, the people he really cared about were leaving him out. You know,
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:19.440]   that the kid in high school who wants to be in the in the cool kids and the cool kids are mean and
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:23.520]   where he sees them as mean. And they're not he's not in the group. When the cool kid reaches out
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:29.200]   and says, no, come on, man, we love you. You're cool. Take that's just like gold. And I think Elon
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:34.560]   probably went to bed that night feeling pretty darn good. Yeah, plus the juice box.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:40.800]   And the cook especially built hotel rooms in the Twitter conference rooms. Did you see that?
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:46.720]   Twitter employees came in to Twitter and without word or warning or a memo or anything,
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:53.760]   the conference rooms have been turned into kind of motel 60 hotel rooms. You're expected to sleep
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:58.960]   here now. Did we do we mention that? Think of it as Twitter city. Think of it as working from home.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:05.520]   Oh, you're home. This is now your home. This is your home. Apple introduces. I am so excited.
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:13.600]   Karaoke, Apple music sing. You know what, Andy? You and I can do those songs from company together.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:17.920]   That'll be so surprised. They took this long. Like just just bonus content for members.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:26.320]   Oh, I can't wait. They've they've added a variety of ways of doing the karaoke. Of course,
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:31.440]   the lyrics show up on the screen, but you can do adjustable vocals. Now this is good for people
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:36.400]   who can't sing, not like you and me, Andy. We would like to get rid of all the other people's
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:41.840]   vocals and no, no, no. I you know what? I think this is a wonderful thing because not everybody is
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:49.520]   blessed by God with a rich lush baritone. Or or or or a or a lilting tenor such as you.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:55.440]   And finally, these great unwashed feel as though they're not for once users now have control
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:51:00.320]   over songs, vocal levels they can sing with with the original artist vocals. They get this. I love
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:05.440]   this. They could take the lead or mix it up on millions of songs in the Apple music catalog.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:09.600]   I wonder if this is that thing you were talking about, Alex, a few weeks ago, stems,
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:13.600]   stems. Similar. I mean, I don't know whether but I don't know whether they've licensed it to do
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:18.720]   it specifically with certain tracks or whether they have. I think they're not doing anything like
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:22.160]   with post-processing, which they could do. But I don't think that's what they're doing. I think
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:26.560]   what they did is they went to these to EMI and to Sony and to one else. They got them to give them
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:31.440]   mixes. No, maybe not. They probably had a way to process the vocals out of them, but just said,
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:35.200]   can we do it and here's some here's some money. We're gonna do this thing and
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:39.760]   that keeps everybody out of here. Pure speculation. But my guess is that this is
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:44.880]   related tangentially perhaps, but related to the whole workflow that they put together for Dolby
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:51.920]   Atmos and for multi channel and spatial audio because this is essentially multi channel because
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:58.240]   you've got you're changing the volume mix to drop the vocals or raise the vocals. Right? It's
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:02.480]   multiple channels. They've got the voice channel and the music channel. And then there's a little
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:07.120]   adjustment where you can take the voice and make it louder or quieter or drop it out altogether.
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:12.160]   And although that's not quite the same as a spatial audio mix, it feels like of a kind. Like they
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:19.200]   put in this technology to allow on device interpretation of a multi channel audio track. And then it's
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:24.160]   got a few different ways that it pops out. It pops out of spatial audio. It pops out as this
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:30.400]   adjustable voice track for Apple music. And I think some stuff has been actually programmed.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:36.800]   I mean, so a lot of the atmos stuff when it says atmos on it, it has it has been remixed from the
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:41.200]   original. So that's when when they say atmos on it, that means it's been done from the original.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:45.840]   But everything sounds a little bit better. And and even the stereo stuff sounds a little
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:50.560]   better and stereo stuff sounds a little bit spatialized. And the reason is they are processing all of
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:54.080]   those, not in real time, but they're processing them and re uploading them into the library. So
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:59.040]   they're slightly different for Apple than they are for everybody else. And then, but I think that
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:04.560]   exactly what Jason said is that processing capability has allowed them to say, well, we can just reprocess
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:08.800]   all of these files. And we happen to know like some don't work as well. Like if you're the way
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:14.240]   their processing works, if someone, if their voice is over to one side or the other, or there's a lot
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:17.600]   of other things that they may not process as well. So they may not be trying to do all the tracks
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:22.960]   willy-nilly. They may be trying to figure out which ones work, but it's it's pretty exciting. I think
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:26.400]   a lot of people will have a great time with it. You know, I think a lot of people love singing
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:32.240]   along to the song. You know, it does say on millions of songs. So it's not all the songs.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:36.160]   And so I'm coupled with a couple with an ever expanding catalog that features tens of millions
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:39.520]   of the world's most singable songs. Exactly. And well, obviously some songs.
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:45.440]   Even that's a long two. But I wonder, Alex, when you when you at most size, when you
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:52.480]   spatialize a song, are those tracks somehow visible to Apple? In other words, can Apple know?
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:58.400]   So they don't have not really. So yeah, so the way at most works, they are. I mean, the metadata is
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:02.960]   there about where everything's going. You could theoretically grab. I mean, it is saying that this
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:09.520]   is this track is going through there. So it's not you. There is metadata that says where all the
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:15.920]   instruments are. So you could theoretically take it. And you know, some an utmost mix. I've never
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:20.960]   tried to do that. But you could theoretically use it to grab onto some of the some of the
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:24.320]   instruments because those things are objects and they have metadata and they have positioning and
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:29.600]   so on and so forth within the within the file. So but I think that a lot of that by the time,
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:34.240]   I believe that a lot of that by the time it gets to the to the Apple music and I could be wrong
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:40.240]   about this because I don't know how Apple does it. But that may be folded down into something that's
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:48.080]   that's not necessarily providing all of that explicit information. So it's you know, but I'm not
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:52.560]   100% certain. The whole goal of that most is is that you have all these objects and it just
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:56.240]   tells you where those instruments are. And that way it has infinite resolution. If it needs to get
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:03.200]   folded down to stereo or 51 or 514 714, the atmos stays separate from that where it doesn't
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.720]   you know, the objects are sitting in there in their own space. So theoretically, it would all be
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:10.160]   there. I don't know whether the voice would necessarily what they're doing here. You can't
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:13.680]   promise this. There would be voices a separate channel in Dolby atmos. It's good.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:18.240]   Good example is to be clear. This is only some tracks. Right. So it may be very well be that
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:23.600]   these are the tracks tracks that have either a karaoke track or they just have an isolated voice
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:30.000]   set of metadata in the music industry knows or Apple knows and wants to DM any of us. Please,
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.160]   please do. We'd love to know how this is working. It's going to be cool. I hope it is
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:39.120]   as cool. It's not out yet. So we can't tell. I do I do Andy. I'll tell you this though.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:47.520]   The 1970 Broadway soundtrack of company with Elaine Stritch is Dolby spatialized. Right. It is
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:52.960]   spatial. So cross your fingers, Andy, you and me next week, maybe you can you can hear the wine
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:59.200]   bottle skitter from her hand down to the studio for all the ladies. That's on. I found that
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.880]   documentary, by the way, it's a D.A. Penny Baker documentary. That I did not know.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:08.800]   And it is on criteria on the criterion channel. So it is you you got to see it. Also,
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:14.880]   a documentary now did a parody of it like two years ago. That is amazingly good. Okay. Either
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:18.960]   one of them is a very strong work. You also get real time lyrics users can sing along to their
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:24.880]   favorite songs with animated lyrics that dance dance, I say, to the rhythm of the vocals.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:31.520]   Now I am not a big karaoke guy. So I don't know what is the state of the
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:35.520]   art. I'm not a karaoke per se. But the music, the lyrics dance.
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:41.760]   Now usually the bouncing ball dances the the the the sparkle that goes from left to right
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:47.440]   as they highlight the the just the basic lyric solution inside of the iPhone though is just
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:54.480]   amazing. Like it is, you know, if you just you get to and it really is well timed and set up there.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:58.640]   And so I think it's I think people will have I think this will be something that a lot of people
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:06.240]   will enjoy a lot, especially because it's also included. Mac people are out, but Apple TV is in.
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:09.680]   So that's how you would do it. That's how you would do it, right?
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:13.920]   It's hard to it's hard to hand hold the phone and cool while you're doing it.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:17.200]   You want to see the TV? David Bowie would not sing.
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:20.720]   I'm just saying, I hope they get this out.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:25.680]   Better day for Christmas. I think I will do this. Yeah, the biggest danger is people are going to
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:30.640]   put their phone on their holder and their car and do karaoke. Well, they're all.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:34.960]   No, we're that's worth that. We're in the shower. We'll see. We'll or in the shower.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:38.000]   We'll see how waterproof those iPhone 14s are, how water resistant they are.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:46.080]   Background vocals, vocal lines sung simultaneously can animate independently
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:51.520]   from the main vocals. So you can have your background singers and you could say you take the,
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:55.840]   you know, the blue sparkle, you take the rest of how that works. Well, we'll have to see.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:01.920]   This is not out till Apple says later this month. And all those people who've been
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:06.160]   waiting a year for the Apple Music Classical Service to launch it like what are you doing?
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:10.080]   They've gone up. They've gone up. It's two different teams. It's two different teams.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:13.360]   Like these. Yeah, yeah, I know it's just funny because it's another Apple Music
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:16.400]   announcement before the end of the year. And they originally when they bought Prime
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:20.000]   Phonics said that that would be coming. The classical service would be coming by the end of the year.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.480]   It still might. I mean, this is one of those things we say Apple only
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:27.440]   is ever six. Yeah. Exactly right. They might be there already to go on vacation and they're like,
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:31.200]   no, no, you got to launch your service before that. Well, by the way, as long as we're saying
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:36.400]   that, didn't they say the Mac Pro would be out by this year? Yeah, but they've already they already
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:41.120]   backed out of that, right? I think that yeah, I think with all the production issues that they've
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:44.080]   had everything got pushed back a little bit. They have a little excuse. The dog. Yeah, I think
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:48.880]   it's a pretty good excuse. The Covidie. The dog was in Shanghai and it ate their homework and
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:54.320]   shut down the whole factory. It was a while. It's just a shit. Hey, if the if the play date got
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:59:00.720]   delayed for one chip, imagine what happens to the Mac Pro. Exactly. Do ed view multiple vocalists
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:07.280]   show on opposite sides of the screen to make duets or multiple singer tracks easy to sing along to.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:11.840]   I don't I don't know exactly know what that means. So imagine if you want to sing one part of a
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:16.400]   duet, you can lower the audio track for that singer and the lyrics will be like, oh, instead of one
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:23.680]   lyric sheet, they'll they push like singer A to the left and you don't send me flowers. Yeah, exactly.
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:28.320]   Exactly. You can you can pretend to be one. Can I do both? And now you're do wedding with your
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:34.320]   favorite singer used to say you need me. Now when you need me.
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:44.080]   We did it. So good. Let me feel all right. Sorry. Andy's going to use this a whole lot.
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:48.880]   That's what we're saying. Like like why did why did Andrew Andy just go to iPhone 100%
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:53.040]   he was channeling Neil Diamond. Very there, which I really enjoy. Love on the rocks.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:57.840]   You see the surprise. There's another great do it with Barbara Streisand. Did you see the
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:02.560]   Neil himself? Neil Diamond actually that's confusing if I see Neil himself. Neil Diamond
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:08.640]   was in the balcony at the Neil Diamond Broadway show and stand up and let the whole cast and
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:14.160]   audience sing along a sweet Caroline. Yep. And he hasn't performed for five years because he's got
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:18.320]   Parkinson's and he retired from performing but he sang at his own show. Isn't that nice? If you
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:23.200]   get your own Broadway show if you can sing us all. Yeah. Go do it. Do it. Should I play a little bit of
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:29.040]   it? The show. This is good. This is take down city but I'm going to do it. Just take it out of
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:34.960]   the YouTube. Okay, John Ashley. Just take it out of the YouTube. Come on. This is the Neil Diamond
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:40.480]   musical. Beautiful noise. Good times. Never. Seems so good. There's Neil.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:46.320]   He's up in the balcony. Oh, look at the audience. This is a crowd, please.
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:51.040]   Yeah. Yeah. Just what a moment that is, right?
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:55.440]   He's still pretty good. He's 6'5".
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:07.760]   For some reason there's something about this song that really gets people singing along.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:13.280]   The whole college is with singing. Yeah. That's the Red Sox. That's why. I was in the
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:19.760]   caribbean on the New Year's Eve with a bunch of strangers. We all sang this and people got up on
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:26.560]   the table. Here we go. Everybody sing along now. This is the sing along I want.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:45.600]   I don't care how much you yell. Everybody says that it's so good. It's so good. All right.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.320]   You want to hear it? John Ashley's cutting me off now because he says,
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:53.680]   "You will be taken down and spanked by YouTube." I don't know about spanked, but...
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.800]   Well, they'll definitely take that. We know that. They'll take that down too for adult content.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:09.200]   Show me what a mention he is. I think this happened right after the marathon bombing in Boston
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:18.240]   2013, I think it was 2014. He wanted to the first Socks game after that. Obviously,
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.720]   it was a bad time and there's a lot of healing that needs to be gone. He just decided, he just
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:32.480]   up and decided to fly from California to Boston. No advanced, no planning, no nothing. Just show up,
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:37.040]   make some phone calls, say, "Hi, I'm Neil Diamond. I would love to sing Sweet
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:41.200]   Caroline during the... As you do during the seventh night's stretch to lead the
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:46.560]   cure." And he was just... Nobody knew about it until he showed up. And again, not even the park
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:51.520]   knew about it until he just got a phone call from a hotel. Isn't it cool though that you could
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:57.840]   be Neil Diamond? And it doesn't matter wherever you are, if you stand up and start singing that song,
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:04.720]   the whole audience is going to go crazy. It's pretty cool. It's great when a songwriter or a
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:12.720]   performer, they get the hit and then they'll probably almost automatically have 10 years of
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:17.840]   resentment. And then they realize, "You know, it's really cool that I walked into a restaurant
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:23.360]   with my kids, my grandkids." And the band just started gently playing the song that I'm very
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:28.240]   famous for. And now, "Wow, people like that song. This is going to be my legacy beyond my kids and
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:34.800]   my grandkids." I'm so bad being Lieutenant Savic, right? There's a certain something going there.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:42.400]   Kirstie Allie, of course, will... A sad story will miss you. Jason Stell, you remember probably when
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:50.240]   Steve Perry of Journey showed up at the Giants games and would lead the singing along. And of
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:54.400]   course, he's less than... Don't stop believing. Yeah, I mean, that's why he doesn't do it. But he
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:04:00.160]   well, Steve Perry is a fanatical Giants fan, his mind is understanding. So yeah, he would show up in
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:06.480]   his Giants gear and they play, "Don't Stop Believing" and during the series runs and all of that.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:11.600]   So that was quite... And Journey, one of those very rare bands, although not as rare as you'd think,
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:16.640]   that replaced its lead singer with somebody who used to be the lead singer in a tribute band
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:23.520]   for that band. It happens more often than you'd think, but yeah, it's true.
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:30.800]   We do have... Rod Pirate Roberts. Yeah, that's right. He never dies. We do have a tribute band called...
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:39.760]   Oh, what is the name of it for Neil Diamond's music in town? So maybe you never know.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:46.320]   Oh wow. We have one for the Eagles in town. They're good. I've seen the E-Legals. Yeah, they're really good.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:51.360]   They're fantastic. We're doing concert tests. We brought them in for our test stage and, oh my gosh,
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:56.480]   it was so good. I know the bass player pretty well and they're a great band. They're really fun to
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:02.960]   watch. Joey? Joey. Yeah, you know Joey? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Apple Music will also be launching a suite
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:09.440]   of more than 50 dedicated companion playlists. So your karaoke party is pre-planned and ready to go.
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:14.160]   Featuring all the epic songs, duets, choruses, and anthems that have been compelling people
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:20.720]   all around the world is sing badly. Fully optimized for the Apple Music Sing experience. So I hope
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:24.400]   that comes out before the end of the year because that's perfect for your holiday. Yeah, they say
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.840]   it's this month. So let's hope they, yeah, they can beat the holiday parties out of it. Yeah,
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:33.040]   we'll be really sad if they put it out like December 28th. New Year's party. Get it in there.
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:39.120]   Well, yes. So all they've got in time for Orthodox Christmas. It's fine. Andy always gets this
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:44.480]   little, you know, what is it? It's like the time added in soccer. He gets this little extra
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:50.320]   few days. Exactly. Extra time. When is Orthodox Christmas this year? Do you know?
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:56.480]   I actually have to look it up. It's usually like 10 days afterward. You know, I hate it when Christmas
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.640]   goes to penalty kicks. Oh, that's the worst. I don't want to solve it for that. Oh, I hate it.
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:07.120]   You know, December, January, January 6th. January, January 6th. Sorry, this year is January 7th,
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:13.680]   2023 Saturday, January 7th. Actually, I believe in Ukraine, that's where they that's what they
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:17.200]   celebrate more than that. Right. Yeah. That's what Russian Orthodox mother of Russian side,
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:23.040]   my the slovox side of my family used to do. We used to we used to do like the big Italian Christmas
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:28.240]   and the big Italian Christmas. And then a couple of weeks later, it would be just a nice dinner
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:34.160]   with with the family, you know, Portuguese sausage. You get two Christmases this year.
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.320]   That's really good. And and and an excuse. Like if there's someone I didn't get a gift for and
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.240]   they really, really over did it with the good like, Oh, well, of course, I give up my gifts on
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:48.080]   Orthodox Christmas. So yeah, sorry, I can't give it to you until after until after the
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:53.040]   the open Orthodox Christmas. That's when you open the aunt and uncle gift. Yeah.
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:59.200]   Saturday, by the way, is a Canadian Christmas. So happy Canadian Christmas to our Canadian friends.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:07.040]   You're really. Let's like they do break. We know it's we know it's early, but they're
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:10.160]   they're sorry about it. You're good. You're really good. Sorry. I'm sorry. It's early.
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:16.000]   But we will have Turkey and stockings just, you know, our show today.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:23.680]   It made me laugh, Jason. Our show today brought to you by rocket money. I love this. I've been a
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:29.360]   true bill subscriber for years. Rocket acquired them. They've turned it into rocket money. They've
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:33.760]   made it even better. It's a great app you could put on your phone that will tell you what your
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:38.320]   net worth is, what your budgets are, where your money's going. But here's the feature that
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:46.400]   is makes this beyond awesome. It finds your recurring subscriptions and lets you cancel them.
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:53.520]   No, I think almost everybody. We lie to ourselves about it, but 80% of people
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:57.920]   have subscriptions they've forgotten about. They just forgot they're just paying them every month.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:01.760]   Money going out. You know, it's five bucks, three bucks, seven bucks, whatever. A little bit blue
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:09.040]   check, eight bucks, no big deal. You forget about it, right? Here's the thing. Most when they survey
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.720]   them, most Americans thought, yeah, I'm probably spent about 80 bucks a month on subscriptions. But
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:19.520]   then when they looked, it's it's the total is closer to $200 or more for me a lot more.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:27.040]   That's why I love rocket money. You can go to a tab that says all shows all your subscriptions in
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:32.560]   one place. You see a subscription and you say, well, wait a minute, I'm still paying for that.
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:39.040]   All you have to do in without leaving the app is press cancel and rocket money takes care of
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:43.280]   the rest. That's one of the reasons we have all those subscriptions, right? Oh, how do I figure
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:49.200]   out where do I go? What do I do to cancel it? But we all have, you know, for me, it was a campaign
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:55.440]   contribution. I've mentioned this before that I forgot to turn off in 2020 and had been paying for
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:09:02.800]   for years. For you, it might be, I don't know, a magazine you never read that you still subscribe
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:07.520]   to or an app you bought and you forgot that. I think that's a big one to apps you forgot about.
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:14.640]   Now, this is such a good solution. Everybody's got to get it right now. On your phone, go to
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:21.040]   rocket money.com/macbreak. I know you're smart. You could go to the Google Play Store, the iOS
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:29.200]   app store and just download it. But please do me a favor. Go to rocket money.com/macbreak.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:33.360]   You get rid of useless subscriptions with rocket money. If you haven't done this yet,
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:39.760]   trust me, this is the best way to save. It could be hundreds of dollars a year.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:46.960]   rocketmoney.com/macbreak. Cancel those unnecessary subscriptions right now and there are a lot of
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:53.920]   other great things it does. But the subscriptions alone make it worthwhile. RocketMoney.com/macbreak.
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:59.600]   We thank Rocket Money so much for taking what was already a fantastic product, making it better.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:05.520]   I'm just so happy and then buying an ad on the show. And when Lisa said, "Do you know
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:09.680]   anything about Rocket Money?" I said, "Do I?" I know all about it. She said, "They want to
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:13.200]   advertise." I said, "Please let me tell people about it. It's the best."
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:20.160]   Yeah. I spent... I got a very nice confirmation that my subscription, my annual subscription to
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:26.400]   the New Yorker online had been renewed for $110 the other day. I'm like, "Oh, I haven't actually read
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:31.680]   that in a long time and I forgot that I subscribed to it. I'm in a period this week where I'm going
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.360]   to be traveling and I'm not buying burritos for myself. I'm like, "Okay, good. I'm glad the
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:41.520]   New Yorker has $110 my money." And then you go and then you go and figure it out and then
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:46.080]   subscribe. But yeah, that's... When it was a pile of magazines, one every week,
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:49.840]   it was easy to remember you subscribed to it. But now there's no visible...
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.520]   By the way, did you just win an Eddie award and not tell us?
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:11:01.120]   Actually, I did. I don't like to flaunt it, but if we're showing off our Eddie hardware here,
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:10.480]   yeah. What'd you get that for? I won this for being an awesome columnist who was holding up
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:16.000]   the traditions and the and the courteuses of such an August publication. They were just so
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.920]   damn proud of me that they just said, "You know what? We're leaving that car unlocked
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:24.480]   intentionally with the hopes that Andy on the way out of the award ceremony will see that
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:30.000]   unlock car." You know that the show is over? Yeah, actually, I got this on eBay.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.640]   No. Yeah, if somebody else is who won a... By the way, I'd like to also thank the Academy
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:38.240]   for the whole... Exactly. Alex, where's your Eddie? Editing me.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:42.720]   I don't really have to ask. I've got the '89. Which one do you have, Jason?
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:47.360]   This is the unlabeled undated, although I also have a '97, so I have two.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.840]   Well, that's hysterical, Andy. Those are the two who bought it on eBay.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:54.080]   Did you peel the plaque off or no? The plaque is still on it. The plaque is still on it.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:59.520]   I'm not going to reveal the name of the winner. See, it is... Unfortunately, it is a trapezoid,
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:04.080]   so I keep wanting to have a plaque made that looks... You know, it's hysterical.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:10.480]   Just convincing enough to make people think that no, I didn't buy this on eBay.
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:15.040]   I would just put some blue painter's tape on it and just use a marker to put your name on it.
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:21.040]   Why not? Who cares? The funny thing is, the sad thing is, somebody hits such hard times
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:26.960]   that they sold their Eddie. I've heard of Oscar runners doing that, but...
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:31.200]   Or maybe they... It was a state sale or something like that.
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:35.200]   What are we going to do with this thing? Or in this case, I won't say who it is,
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.640]   but you would recognize the name of the company because they had a very significant and very,
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:44.560]   very flashy product in 1989. It's possible that when the company was acquired and they closed up the
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:49.840]   office... All this crap. Yeah, exactly. And basically, someone just took it home because,
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:55.200]   "Hey, look, it's a nice..." And I will say, with no joking, this was the one
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:02.800]   souvenir I wanted from my Mac user/Macworld days because it is. This is not... This is a real
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:07.920]   Oscar level... Yeah, it weighs a ton. If this is an episode of Colombo, I could murder someone with
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:12.480]   this. This is... And it's a beautiful piece of stuff. You guys did a good job.
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:17.520]   It's classy. I was... Yeah, and when we came over from Mac user to Macworld, it was one of the things
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:22.160]   that they kept from Mac user was they kept the statue in the name and the whole awards kind of thing.
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:26.880]   They should. Because it was... Yeah, it's good stuff. And like I said, it's like a Mac classic or a Mac
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:31.840]   SE in there. But it's... Mine is an SE, right? The '89 is an SE. I think you went back to the
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:39.520]   generic classic. Oh, that's kind of cool. That's kind of cool. I need to get a rotating platform a
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:47.440]   little light. So back in the day, when Vic Gundotro was at Google, he was the champion of Google+,
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:52.160]   Google+, their social network, which they're wishing they still had, by the way, right about now,
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:58.800]   was championed by Gundotro, became a big push for Google. They even tied employees' bonuses
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:06.640]   to their successes social. Gundotro left and Google+ died. Suddenly. He left very quickly. Like he
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.480]   announced it on Tuesday, I'm not going to be here on Friday. Like it was not... But he went to a
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:17.280]   company called a LiveCore, which makes a very important and wonderful product that detects AFib
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:24.240]   and other heart issues with a $99 thing. I have the one where you just put your thumbs on it and
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:32.480]   it ties to the iPhone. However, and now it's like a credit card you can keep in your wallet,
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:40.240]   which is cool. Apple and a LiveCore are kind of in a little tussle, a little tussle over the whole
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:51.040]   thing. I think a LiveCore sued first, saying that it had created this technology and Apple put in
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:59.680]   the watch. Then Apple counters, it's just countersued over the Cardia Band, which is a watch strap
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:08.240]   that you could put in the Apple watch that will kind of do more. So there's an ITC complaint,
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:15.840]   an AD trust battle, and then a patent lawsuit over the Apple watch. And Apple's response is,
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:27.040]   "Well, no, we invented it. And so, this is an action about innovation and the opportunism and
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:33.440]   profiteering that threatens it," says Apple. Apple introduced cutting edge life-changing
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:38.400]   advancements in electronic healthcare that are relied upon by millions in daily basis to do
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:44.480]   their, to better their life. Vic Condotra needs a pond so he can invite Tim over and just
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:52.000]   give him a cookie and a juice box. I don't know. I mean, I have no idea who's here. We got a
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000]   bumper pool table last year. Here. Let's take a stroller on the bumper pool table. You want to
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:04.960]   smell Denny's? No. Yeah. Apple says a live core used technology Apple created before declaring that
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:12.560]   a live core has not been commercially successful and has been propped up by funding from private
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:16.000]   investors. I don't know what that has to do with anything. It's just kind of twisting the knife.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:25.840]   A live core's complaint says Apple is an opportunistic assertion of its patents against Apple.
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:33.600]   Because it's not doing well. So an attempt to siphon from the success of Apple Technologies,
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:38.880]   it did not event all the while selling products that rely on foundational ECG innovations that
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:43.920]   Apple patented years before a live core came to be. Oh, who are we going to say?
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:50.800]   Si company. Come on. That makes no sense. The thing is, this is life-changing technology.
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:55.520]   It's great that it's in the Apple Watch. It's also great that you could get it in a credit
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:03.200]   card size thing. If you don't have an Apple Watch for 99 bucks, I just wish these guys would just
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:09.440]   figure it out. I didn't see it in this story, but did somebody go to a live core from Apple?
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:12.320]   Did that like somebody leave Apple and found a live core? Because that's what it sort of
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:18.640]   sounds like to me is that somebody who knew about Apple stuff just kind of left. I think that
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:23.200]   what I think might have happened is that Apple thought that a live core was doing something
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.240]   different than they were. Then a live core said, "No, you're doing the same thing."
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.520]   Then Apple's lawyers looked back and did research to defend themselves and was like,
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:38.080]   "What the what?" Then they're upset. Usually the way I come from a family of lawyers,
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:42.400]   and usually you look at something and go, "Oh, okay. You don't think about it." Then they
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:46.400]   attack you. As you defend that you suddenly realize they missed something really big,
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:54.480]   and then your lawyers just go, "You will kill them now." It just goes into death ray really fast
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:58.320]   because they picked the fight first. If they hadn't picked the fight, Apple probably wouldn't
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:02.960]   have paid it. If a live core gets buried by this patent, it's because they picked a fight with
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:08.800]   Apple over something that they didn't need. Apple wasn't adjudicating. Suddenly they flipped the
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:12.240]   switch and the Apple eye looked at them and looked down at their own patents and then looked over
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:19.760]   at them and hit the selfie. Back in June, a judge ruled that the Apple Watch did infringe a live
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:30.240]   course patent. Then today, this has just happened, Apple went to the USPTO. Today, the US Patent
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:35.600]   and Trademark Office's patent trial and appeal board, PTAB, ruled that three live core patents
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:41.520]   covering heart monitoring technologies for wearable devices were unpatentable. Not that they-
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:42.520]   Now they're-
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:49.520]   Not that they were preceded by earlier inventions by Apple, but that they couldn't be patented.
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:54.240]   A live core alleged federal court and before the ITC that Apple had copied the technologies.
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:19:04.320]   This is one way to go with this is appeal to the PTO about the patent rather than going to
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:08.960]   court and sue. Now that they've ruled that it's unpatentable, I think a live core is going to be
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:15.440]   in a difficult position. Again, you have to remember the counter suit is also just hanging
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:19.520]   that over their head going, "We can stop this anytime you want. We just have only a few
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:26.240]   things." So here is the smoking, perhaps the smoking gun. During development, a live core
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:30.880]   founder and chief medical officer Dave Albert demonstrated the technologies to Apple executives.
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:36.640]   This is back in 2017. A year later, Apple released very similar technologies. So maybe that's the
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:43.360]   smoking gun, but it looks like Apple's going to win this one because of the patent, the PTAB
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:53.920]   ruling that those patents are not patentable. Wow. You know, I don't know who's more brazen.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:59.520]   You know, a lot of times you'll acknowledge this too, Alex. These are defensive countersuits,
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:04.000]   right? Yeah, because you want to give them a reason that right now they have all
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:09.520]   upside and no downside. Apple just gave them downside. Like this could get much worse really fast.
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:15.040]   And so that it can be negotiation. It can also be, and I think that they definitely,
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:19.520]   I think where their business has been definitely negatively affected by Apple's
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:24.000]   improvements of the watch. The watch isn't as good as what they're doing, but is it good enough to
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:29.200]   eat into any of the sales that they thought that they were going to have is probably likely.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:34.480]   So, you know, and they may be in a position where they're starting to pick these fights because they
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:39.120]   Apple may be correct. They have investors trying to say, well, what else can we make money at
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:44.160]   because we're not making money at this hardware? You know, and I do think that the sales of that
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:50.320]   of Apple watches has definitely affected a live core. You know, like it's, you know, because it's
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:55.040]   a lot of what they, there's more accurate, and it's more precise and it's more medically driven,
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:59.760]   but I'll hang a lot of people that would have gotten a live core. You know, so I think that
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:05.040]   they're having, I think they may be thrashing a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Apple says, well, now
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:11.280]   you're losing money because of us becoming after us. Yeah. It's a, you know, everyone,
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:16.560]   say again, as someone who grew up in, you know, it's been the weekend talking about lawsuits.
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:23.600]   I was my dad. I was home. Like, I can't say anything about it, but all families express love
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:26.720]   in their own special way. No, one way, no less than others.
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:30.320]   Where you love sitting around talking about stupid things people do in court.
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:34.480]   And like, it's just like, you know, stupid suits and stupid things. And like one that,
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:39.520]   and the thing is, is that we just, I think people think that they can just sue people, but it's,
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:43.520]   it's, it's thermo nuclear war. Like, you know, and as soon as you, as soon as you,
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:46.240]   I've only been one last night, I'm going to. And I deeply regret it.
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:51.920]   Yeah. And so you just, we lost or anything, but just because it was, it's just, the process is
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:55.520]   just awful. Yeah. Almost any good lawyer will tell you don't do it.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:59.200]   Don't do it if you don't have to. Yeah. But, but once you're in it, you know,
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:03.360]   so you just got to be very careful about what do I really want to peel that open?
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:08.320]   Because you never know when you, when you peel open a lawsuit, you never know exactly where it's
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:11.920]   going to go. No matter how certain you, you think it is. Yeah, that's right. And what you
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:16.560]   don't know whether, even if your case is perfect, is this, is the other side is going to make it
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:20.880]   unpleasant. Yeah. Even if you know you're going to win in the long run, the other side is going
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:26.400]   to make it as awful as possible for you with depositions and requests for documents and
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:31.360]   no, no, no, no, it's just, it's not a pleasant, it's such an awful thing. So let's speak about
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:39.520]   something jolly for the holiday, Apple TV plus and spirited, which I could only watch about for
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:44.880]   10 minutes before my diabetic shocks kicked in. It's the most sugary thing ever, but it's fun.
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:52.080]   Who, who doesn't love Will Ferrell? And what's his name from Ryan Seeker? Ryan Reynolds. Ryan Reynolds.
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:59.520]   Yeah. Selena Gomez, I haven't seen my mind in me. Apple TV's trailer talks about all of the new
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:03.440]   things. They're going to have a little bit of a problem with emancipation. The Will Smith
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:10.080]   movie, although Will Smith is now going out on the apology tour, trying to save that film.
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:15.440]   A new season of Little America comes out that same day, December 9th.
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:22.480]   A new holiday short film, The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and The Horse will be for Christmas Day.
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:28.640]   All I know is if you see a change in the size or coloration of that mole, you should see it,
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:33.920]   Dr. Of course, Ted Lillabro, Christmas is free. Yeah. But Charlie Brown Christmas is free on Apple
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:40.160]   TV. Yes. I watched it. Lisa and I watched about five minutes of it just for good old time's sake.
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.920]   And it's just as cute as ever. It's curbing your enthusiasm for children.
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:51.520]   Yeah, it is. Well, because it's the strip. So they set piece, they do the thing, they do the joke,
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:57.600]   and then it's another set piece. It is a thing that is like, it's very weird. But, you know,
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:04.400]   hey, we love it. The sci-fi series, Will, I don't know if that's going to be a bad belief.
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:10.720]   That's Hugh Howie's. It was like a self published and then it got turned into an actual published
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:14.720]   thing. It's like a post apocalyptic thing where people live in silos in the ground.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:20.400]   And the smell of Lanolin pervades the air. I am very excited about Masters of the Air,
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:23.840]   which they've teased quite a bit sequel to The Band of Brothers in the Pacific. It's about,
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:29.040]   of course, the Air Force in World War II, Billy Crudup's comedy Hello Tomorrow
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:39.440]   and a new Ridley Scott movie, Napoleon. Oh, Napoleon. Wow. Typical tiny personal movie from
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:46.480]   us. Those little low budget, minimal crew. Yeah, the polo shots on the city.
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:53.600]   Just a little thing in the, you know, in a little battle, no big deal. I knew Jason Segal and Harrison
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:59.680]   Ford comedy called Shrinking. Why are there so many? I presume it's about a psychiatrist.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:06.000]   Why are there so many TV shows and movies about psychotherapy? I don't understand it.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:11.600]   Is it in the early? I think, you know, my, my theory is that it's psychotherapy is about two
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:16.160]   people talking to each other. So it's nothing but dialogue. And a lot of it can be, let's build
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:20.640]   one set in which they sit and talk. Yeah. You don't have to. It's not, it's, it's not about
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:25.840]   an international daring do hit man who occasionally goes into space. It's like, okay, we'll just do
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:32.800]   with somewhat rundown from be looking office park office. We're good. So the pitch, the elevator
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:38.400]   pitch for shrinking. It's Brett Goldstein, Roy Ken from Todlasso. He's the writer and executive
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:43.440]   producer of that show. And the idea there is that it's a therapist who decides to basically
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:49.920]   be unflinchingly honest with everybody and the terrible results of that, I believe, is how it goes.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:55.840]   So it actually sounds like kind of a funny premise. And it's part of the, you know, what's Brett
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:59.360]   Goldstein's next thing after being discovered in Todlasso. And the answer is another
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:02.480]   Apple TV show. Oh, he's the Ted Lasso. One of the writers on the show too.
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:07.520]   Oh, okay. There you go. So yeah. Roy Ken from Ted Lasso. Oh, it's Roy Ken. Oh, nice.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:12.160]   I'm not a Roy Ken. Is he British? He is. So he's going to have the same accent or is he going
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:16.320]   to be American? I don't think he's in it. I think he's just a showrunner. I think he's just
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:20.240]   the showrunner for it because he is a comedy writer. They hired him to be one on the writing
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:24.480]   staff and bring his sort of like Britishness to it, understanding how soccer works and things
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:28.480]   like that. And then it cast him on top of that. But originally he was hired just to be a writer
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:34.640]   on the show. And so they obviously his agents have now gotten him a deal for his own show.
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:39.120]   So pretty good. And of course there's that Netflix movie Jonah Hill did with his own personal
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:45.040]   psychiatrist, his actual psychiatrist, which is actually not too bad. I kind of liked it. It was
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:51.040]   called Stutz. It's on Netflix. It's a little weird. At first I thought, is this a send up? Is he
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:56.320]   but no, it's his I always I always get a little bit worried because it's not the first time you
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:01.440]   have like something a very, very wealthy, very, very famous celebrity wants to do a documentary
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:07.040]   about his mentor or psychiatrist. It's like, Oh, where did this idea come from? And he's been
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:13.600]   talking to Elon. Anyway, so it looks like I have to say when you look at the teaser, which I can't
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:19.360]   play because Apple will take us down even if I'm giving them a plug. It looks like Apple's TV
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:26.000]   plus has not my early complaints were, you know, scant content, a lot of not very good content.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.760]   They have their fire and all cylinders. Jugri Alex, they hired two show two executives from Sony.
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:35.840]   They seem to really be putting together a great slate. They seem to put together. I don't find
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:40.320]   myself watching very much of it. I mean, I really, you know, I don't, you know, I have it there,
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:46.640]   but I don't find myself going to it very often. And, and, you know, I really liked watch the sound
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:51.760]   with Mark Ronson, right, which, you know, and I really love that I feel like some of those are
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:57.040]   more interesting to me. I think that you like documentaries. Well, I like documentaries. I also,
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:03.200]   I think that I don't know, I always feel like the Apple stuff has too much too much of vegetables.
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:07.120]   What? It's just it's always. Yeah, no, I agree in the early days. I'm just like more, you know,
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:10.960]   it's always telling me something about how I totally agree with you. Even even the post
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:14.800]   of a block of blood to stuff, I'm sure will teach me something that I needed to know about the way
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:18.800]   we should have done things. And I just, I'm kind of like, I can't just watch a show. Like, you know,
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:25.280]   I just watch, I got a show for you. Gary Oldman is amazing. Slow horses. I've heard about that.
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:30.960]   Night. I think the second season just came out. Watch the first season. The first episode of
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:35.840]   the second season, Gary Oldman is at a Chinese noodle house or maybe oh my God, it's so disgusting.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:40.880]   It's amazing. And the guy is co-worker comes in and says, you're eating like a dead horse and
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:46.880]   you could tell Gary Oldman is getting so much pleasure out of slurping the noodles. It's just
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:51.680]   the best scene. It is it is an amazing show. I think the other things for all the things that
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:56.080]   people said before Apple TV came out was that it would be, you know, it's going to be very PG
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:59.280]   and it's going to be, you know, all these other things. And the problem is, is that I watch
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:03.520]   almost any TV that I watch. I only watch TV about one hour a day. You know, it's it's not like I
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:07.680]   watch with my kids. Yeah. Well, I also know, but I also watch it. My family sits down. We it's like
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:11.200]   the end of the day thing. We have dinner and then we sit down and watch something. So anything my
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:15.920]   kids are at the age that anything that says MA, we want to watch it. Like I'm just not going to
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:20.240]   see it because I don't have any other time in the day to watch it. And so yeah, so you may not see
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:25.680]   slow horses. It's not for kids. Spirit it is for kids for sure. You might not. Yeah, I don't know if
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:30.160]   I can watch any more Scrooge. Like it does have really good ratings. I mean, Apple's pretty excited
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:35.200]   about that one. So yeah, it's pretty sugary audience. The audience response on that I heard was pretty
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:41.280]   good. And and did you like the workplace comedy? What was the name of it? Where they're in the basement?
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:48.640]   Severance severance. That was a great. That might be that might actually be my favorite TV show of the
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:52.960]   whole year. And there are there are a bunch that are that were very good this year. But when I think
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:59.200]   back, I think maybe severance is the is the answer there. It's so very good. Yeah.
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:03.520]   Then there's the other psychiatrist show with Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd, the shrink next door,
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:08.240]   didn't watch that one. I don't know. Steve Carell's got a psychiatrist show. There seem to be quite a
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:13.200]   few of them. Yeah, because we're all great. Yeah, right. Maybe that's a build one set.
[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:18.560]   Higher two actors. You're good. Well, I realized after watching the expanse for a while that sci-fi
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:23.520]   is actually cheap to make. Same thing, right? Alex, it's in a set sci-fi is not cheap to make. It's not.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:28.400]   Well, if you have a lot of CGI, but the expanse doesn't have a lot of space battles, it's mostly just
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:33.280]   people want rattling around inside a can. Yeah, I mean, some of those things, I don't think Apple
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:38.560]   really looks at things based on expense. No, obviously not. I think that they don't have to save any
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:43.520]   money anywhere. I think that they are like, I mean, that's more of a if you were talking about
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:47.920]   like YouTube originals or Facebook originals, they're like, how do we do this in a can? Right.
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:52.080]   But I think that Apple is kind of like, it's just a story and they don't really, I mean, they can't.
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:55.040]   Whatever you want, spend 100 million an episode. It's okay. We got more.
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:59.120]   Yeah, it's it's so I think that Apple's not because that's there. That's the stick that they're
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:03.760]   going after. But again, I think that it has, I think right now my high watermark at the moment,
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:06.400]   I'm trying to think of those trying to think when Jason said, you liked a little bugs one,
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:12.720]   that was the first step. The first season was great. The second season was okay. Like it was,
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:15.840]   what happened was the first season that they spent years working on it. The production company
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:22.480]   had worked on it before Apple even existed. And so it was it looked amazing. The first
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:25.840]   that then you could tell in the second season that they had run out of things to talk about.
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:30.160]   And so that was, you know, and so I watched a couple episodes and I was like, you know,
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:36.080]   and yeah, but I think the problem is is that we are so overwhelmed with so much good content now
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:41.440]   that that a lot of us are just super picky, you know, like it's I we have gotten caught up in
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:46.640]   peripheral, which is a little bit close to M.A. and there's some. But but peripherals really good.
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:52.480]   I loved here. My problem with peripherals, I loved the book, which I read before the show,
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:55.760]   because I wanted to read the book. Yeah, because I know it's going to TV show,
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:58.960]   but they couldn't use the plot of the book because they wanted more seasons.
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:04.720]   So, and I don't know if you've seen the last episode yet. I haven't. Don't tell me. No,
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:08.080]   no, boy looks. I don't know anything about it yet. Let me just put this way. It's turning into
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:12.720]   Westworld, which and I have the same problem I have with it as Westworld. And I loved the book.
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:17.200]   The book is brilliant. And if they just made the book, the problem is they wouldn't have a season
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:21.600]   two and they really want a season two. Yeah, I think if they just made the book, they wouldn't have
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:27.360]   the book starts so slow that I don't I think they needed to cut to the chase with the TV show,
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:33.920]   but now they are kind of like retrofitting the rest of the world building. It's not on to it. Yeah,
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:38.560]   it's turned into Westworld. And I hated Westworld. So don't say the same. Same.
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:45.760]   Same producers. Yeah, same producers. Apple is being sued by two women over air tank stocking.
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:53.040]   I hope this gets thrown out of court. Because it's no different than buying a $25,
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:59.040]   you know, GPS devices, glue it in the car or or using GPS would actually better be better than
[01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:05.040]   the air tank. And I think Apple's done a very little bias, but I think Apple's done a very good job of
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:12.000]   making the air tag it as as unusable for that as possible. The first one to file the lawsuit
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:17.040]   stocked by her ex boyfriend put the air tag in the wheel, well, ever car and found out where she
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:22.160]   had moved to avoid his harassment. I'm sorry. That's a horrible thing. But there are many ways
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:25.680]   you could have done that. According to the other woman in the case, her husband plays an air tag
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:34.000]   in her child's backpack to track her. Okay. I mean, that's, you know, it's men behaving badly.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:40.160]   There's a lot of it. Nice picture, by the way, from phone arena of some guy sneaking an air tag
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:45.280]   into some woman's purse. They must have been in the offices there because they have a water cooler.
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:54.880]   Then also going on a grandmother, Colorado grandma, is suing a police detective following a
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:34:00.080]   SWAT raid. Get this based on false. Find my iPhone information.
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:06.960]   Yeah, this this this was kind of in this was pretty much incompetent. What happened was that a guy
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:13.600]   had his van stolen and it had his iPhone in it and some guns. And so he basically gave the detective,
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:18.640]   Hey, look, I've got find my iPhone. And here's the map and I circled the area and this definitely
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:23.920]   right here and based simply on this screenshot of find my iPhone saying here's where here's a
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:30.000]   pinpoint where I fit where if you misread the map, here's where it must be within one within one
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.640]   millimeter, they got a warrant to have and because they thought there might be guns there, a SWAT
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:40.240]   team came in basically pulled the grandma out. It was a military operation. It was a military
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:48.000]   and these things often end in mayhem. Thank God it didn't this time. But come on, stop using
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:54.480]   find my iPhone to track down your lost stuff. Yeah, Apple Apple himself says this is not this is
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:35:00.720]   not for like police use. This is not sensitive like that can be off by houses if not if not many,
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:06.160]   many yards. And this just not and that's that's assuming that it gets the basic location correct
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:12.080]   that we were there are there are the old stories about how certain tracking systems when they don't
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:16.080]   know when they can't find a place they default to this one house where everybody thinks that
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:20.000]   they're right there phones they're stolen phone wound up. So yeah, this is this is why this one
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.720]   detective is being is being targeted because like he should have known that this is not something
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:29.200]   you can get what you should be able to get a warrant on. And it's right there in black and white
[01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:33.520]   that Apple tells everybody about this. So yeah, that's this pretty sickening Denver police chief
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:40.320]   Ron Thomas is ordered an internal investigation. You know, this this stuff is it's dangerous to do
[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:47.520]   this stuff and to do it based on that evidence is a terrible idea. Hey, if you like carrot weather
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:54.480]   and I know you do the snarkiest weather app in the world. It's getting better mini games live
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:36:00.240]   activities support for all precipitation layout redesign and more hello carrot.
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:06.960]   Um, big update 20 lock screen widgets. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to get this. It's
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:11.680]   not free, but boy, it would be fun to have snark on my lock screen. 10 new custom layout sections,
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:16.240]   all sorts of stuff. iPad, Apple weather kit support. You know, that's the real benefit is
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:21.840]   Apple bought dark sky and now weather kit really is as good as dark sky, right? Yeah,
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:26.880]   basically it is dark sky. Yeah. So you can really get a great weather app and then you can, you know,
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:34.080]   on top of it. Yeah, I have to say, someone who use dark sky for a long time. The weather one is the
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:39.040]   way you get to information on the weather one is a little frustrating. Like I just, it's a lot of
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:44.320]   times it's obscured in the way that you use new where to go and it and it gets into modes and
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:48.160]   stuff like that. I don't, I feel like Apple, I don't know, does that the weather app, the weather app,
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:54.480]   the dark weather kit is what was the dark sky API and it feeds Apple's weather app, but you can
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:57.840]   also use it and care it along with a bunch of other different. Oh, many, many of the things about
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:02.080]   carrot that I really like is you can actually look up like find the weather source that's most
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:06.080]   accurate for where you live and use that inside carrot, which is how I use it. It's great.
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:19.520]   Um, let's see. Apple is like, congratulations Europe. Now you can have a hundred pounds of
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:25.600]   Apple gear mailed to your home in the self repair program. Apple announced it's, it's extending it
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:31.360]   now outside the US for the first time. Uh, I refer you to Michael Sargent's excellent piece
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:38.320]   on what happened when he ordered the Apple self repair kit. It came, but the parts didn't and then
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:43.760]   the kid had to go back before anyway. Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden,
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:50.640]   and the UK, you can now enjoy a similar experience. I think Apple probably should be the only ones
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:56.320]   to suffer. Yeah. Yeah. Why should we be the only ones to suffer? Also, congratulations, Scandinavia.
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:04.480]   Two years after it was shipped in the US, Apple is now sending the HomePod Mini to Finland, Norway,
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:08.480]   South Africa, and Sweden. I don't know what's that one of these things is not like the other.
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:16.800]   Uh, but yes, now you can get colorful sound like never before. Or as they say in Norwegian,
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:24.240]   far Greek lead some I'll refer. Uh, I hope I did that right. Uh, pretty good, huh? Yeah. Yeah.
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:29.200]   John Ashley, you speak Norwegian? No, but I sound right. Okay. Thank you. I just did add the,
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:33.520]   I added the Swedish chef lilt to it. And I think that's probably all you need to do.
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:38.080]   Speak. It's like speaking Italian. You just add the vowel. Uh, this is, I mean, we didn't do this
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:43.280]   story last week, but I guess we should probably mention it. Do not buy 300 iPhones at the Apple
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:49.680]   store and then walk out the door. Cause you know, people notice, people notice that's flashy.
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:52.480]   That's what we're in many, many, we call that we call it flashy,
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:58.880]   conspicuous consumption conspicuous, a man carrying 300 iPhones. How do you even carry 300 iPhones?
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:04.160]   I think it was the wheelbarrow that gave him away. It was, he was punched in the face and robbed
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:10.400]   near Apple's fifth Avenue store, 27 year old victim targeted moments after he left the store
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:17.200]   at one 45 AM. See, here's the problem. This is an Apple store. What? What? What?
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:23.600]   Is that Apple store that's open 24 hours? Uh, the victim, according to police regularly makes
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:28.240]   it large purchase of purchases from Apple in the middle of the night. As he resells the phones
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:34.720]   through his small business, the Kirk, the clerk put the 300 iPhone thirteens in three large bags,
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:40.960]   uh, quarter to two in the morning. It's a quarter to two. There's no, it was a heist. It was a heist.
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:45.440]   As the guy does this regularly. Oh, yeah, they saw him as he was walking to a car,
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:50.560]   another car pulled up. Two men jumped out, demanded the bags, the victim put up a fight,
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:55.040]   sparking a struggle in which he was punched in the nose. He said, make it look good. Punch me,
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:58.960]   right in the nose, make it look good. Thieves managed to snatch one of the bags before taking
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:05.520]   off in the car worth $95,000. So I wonder if he's like a gray marketeer or something where he's
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:09.600]   buying a baron New York and they hit for his business and his clients and then is shipping him
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:15.040]   to various places. I think probably you shouldn't buy 300 iPhones at two in the morning. Yeah,
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:19.840]   I got this. This is the avenue in Manhattan. Just seems like this is not the sort of heist
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:24.640]   for which you need a cockney safe cracker and a Chinese acrobat to pull off. I think it's too.
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:29.040]   It's going to be snatched too. It's going to be very exciting. Get in the car. Um,
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:34.000]   Oh, well, punch on the nose. Might get a little good. Um,
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:38.560]   we need to put together crew of real villains for this shop.
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:48.320]   Best wheel man in Brighton. They've got a nosepuncha. He's the nosepuncha. He's good. All right,
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:54.480]   let's take a break and your picks of the week will be next. Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Lindsey,
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:41:00.960]   Andy and I coat Jason Snell and cash fly. That's who brings you the show. Not just this show,
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:08.800]   but every show every week for the last 10, 12, 15 years cash fly is our content delivery network.
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:13.280]   So when you download a show from the website or you subscribe in your podcast player, that app
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:20.000]   is actually going to cash fly and getting the podcast, the audio or the video. And the miracle
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.480]   of all this is that we never get complaints like, Oh, the show stopped downloading halfway
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:30.080]   through or I couldn't get the show or it took four hours to know because cash fly is awesome.
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:34.960]   Look, the whole world, I want to just put in a plug form right now. The whole world is moving
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:41.200]   to digital traffic patterns across the internet are spiking. And I got to tell you, viewers are
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:46.800]   not going to hang around for videos that buffer. Shoppers will abandon carts on e-commerce sites
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:52.720]   that are slow. Gamers leave bad reviews if the latency is high. But none of that will happen
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:42:00.640]   if you use cash fly. Cash fly, a leader in CDN technology since 2002, they hold the track record

[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:19.040]   which now others are starting to build on. But that started a cash fly. Quality of experience

[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:11.440]   Break Weekly is brought to you by cash fly at CACHEFLY.com. Thank you, cash. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:18.000]   Ah, I think Jason Snell might have a pick of the week for us this week.
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.640]   I do. I mean, I always do, right? Like that's what we do here.
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:25.760]   That's your job. I was told that we had to do this requirement.
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:30.000]   I've only been here a few months. I'm going to run out soon.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.600]   But if I don't hold on to our liquor license, we got to, you know, I do have one. It is broadcast.
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:44.240]   New version 3.0. This is Steve Troughton Smith. It is a Mac and iPad and iPhone and Apple TV and
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:50.320]   Apple Watch app. It does them all. It's free with a $5 in at purchase. If you like listening to
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:56.000]   internet radio, it is a great internet radio streaming app. And also I use it to listen to live
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:02.880]   podcasts. So the Relay FM podcast, the accidental podcast I suspect it works with Twit2.
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:08.480]   If you have an audio stream, a live audio stream, you can put it in there. A bunch of new features,
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:14.320]   better interface this time, support for a URL scheme so you can put a little badge on your website
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:18.320]   that says click here to listen live and then it will automatically kick people into broadcast.
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:22.080]   And one of the things, I talked about the cross platform nature of this. That's actually one
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:28.640]   of the things I like the most about it. For a while, I was running at the same time as one of my
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:33.520]   favorite podcasts was streaming live. And I was able to listen to it live with just my cellular
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:38.800]   Apple watch and a pair of AirPods. Because broadcast runs on the Apple Watch and you can listen to live
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:44.160]   streams on the Apple Watch or your phone. This is what I do when I'm listening to live streams,
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:48.240]   when I'm taking a walk or taking a shower or whatever, if they're live, I can listen live.
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:52.640]   And then yeah, it's also got literally all the internet radio on it as well that you can tune in.
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:59.920]   So I'm a big fan. Steve Trensmith is an incredibly diligent, careful, brilliant developer of hand,
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:05.360]   you know, handcrafted Apple platform apps basically. And this app was already great. And then the
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:12.000]   new version, you know, better look, better search, shazam integration with the, with URL schemes.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:12.720]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:13.760]   It's all there.
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:14.320]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:14.800]   It's all there.
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:19.680]   So could I like say, I'm hearing this song, where can I hear it somewhere else kind of thing?
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:24.960]   I don't know. I think maybe in it, and it's basically anything that's like, what is it,
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:28.800]   RTSP, like basically audio streams, you can pour it in there.
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:33.520]   Because you know, it's got a directory, but radio stations being the monopolists that they are
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:38.880]   basically all have their own apps and pull their, you know, streams off the public internet.
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:41.600]   But there's, there's radio stations all over the world.
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:46.720]   Yeah. And you'd be surprised at how many, even in America, they have their own app,
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:50.880]   but they also keep their stream up because they know that third party stream apps exist,
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:56.720]   and they want to have them available too. So like, I was able to listen to local stations here
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:02.240]   in, in the Bay area that are parts of big chains, but I don't know. I searched for them in
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:07.120]   broadcast and there was a link that's good. And I tapped it and it played. So I guess it works.
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:08.240]   Yeah. Good app.
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:12.640]   It's a big issue for, at least in me in the NFL, because TuneIn will block.
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:16.720]   Well, that's, that's different, right? Like I've had that happen where like the giants were on
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:20.080]   and I tried to stream K&B on there like, no, no, no, no, no, you need to go to the end. They'll be
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:25.360]   out because they don't have the rights to do that now with NFL plus. It's very frustrating.
[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:31.040]   Yeah. But sometimes so, so like that stuff is less so, but, but if you want to tune in your local
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:35.440]   news station, you may be able to do that. And certainly there's so many, this is Steve Transpitz,
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:40.720]   an Irish developer. So, you know, he's, he's got a very international directory of radio stations
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:44.480]   that he's tied into here. And it's just, again, if you've heard of other apps that do this,
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:48.160]   yeah, there are lots of apps that do this. It's a dime a dozen. I've been to TuneIn subscriber
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:52.320]   forever and ever and ever. But this is a really well-written app. And if you're in the Apple
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:58.640]   ecosystem, you can get it on all of your devices and it syncs using iCloud. 5,095 stations in the
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:05.280]   US. So yes, you can probably get your local. That's cool. And if Apple won't do a classical music,
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:14.240]   I know I get KLUX in 89.5 HD. Mr. Andy Inako, your pick of the week.
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:19.760]   My pick of the week is one of my beloved holiday traditions for decades and decades. It is Patrick
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:25.520]   Stewart's one man production performance reading of a Christmas Carol because it's because, and
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:30.320]   people thank me for having heard about this. So Patrick Stewart, like, I think starting in the 80s,
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:35.120]   like definitely when he was on the next generation, he basically would book a book of theater and
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:39.920]   just do a one man presentation of a Christmas Carol, not standing there and reading the book,
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:44.400]   but basically performing all the characters. No sound effects, no lighting, no whatever. It's
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:50.160]   just like, yes, you do. He'll do the cochlear accent and then he'll do the little child singing
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:56.640]   to singing, Gailie. And he's done this for years and years and years and years. And at some point,
[01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:03.440]   he did a recording of an hour and 47 minute long recording of this. And I've been, this has been
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:08.000]   one of my traditions for so long. The first time I bought a copy of this, it was on two cassettes.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:12.720]   And I would listen to it in the car and I bought it on CD and now I have it on Audible.
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:18.400]   And it is just one of the most beautiful things, one of the most beautiful, most beautiful pieces
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:23.280]   of performance you will experience. And it is slightly bridged from the, from the original
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:28.800]   Christmas Carol, but not that you would notice. And he get, not only is it just beautifully performed,
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:32.880]   remember it all Dickens got paid by the word. Let's just prove it at that.
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:41.840]   Yes. He did exactly. And but everybody as, as, as Jason will attest, there's even even the
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:48.880]   greatest genius could use the kind, the kind, stilling hand of an editor to basically keep the drink
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:53.840]   from, keep the drink from being stirred too, too rapidly, I think. But yeah, no, it's, it's,
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:50:01.200]   it's just that he gets to the heart of a Christmas Carol for me, which is that like, to me, a version
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:05.200]   of the Christmas of a Christmas Carol does not work unless the production understands that
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:09.680]   Scrooge is not the villain. He's the hero. He is the, is a redemption arc. It's not like he's
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:14.720]   being scared straight. He realizes that he's made a whole bunch of bad decisions because of,
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:21.280]   he's reacted badly to hardships in his life and has reg, it has left him being a lonely man who
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:26.880]   doesn't like himself very much. And one night these ghosts come and teach him to the error of his
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:31.280]   ways how to like himself and that is possible to be a better person. And that completely comes,
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:36.560]   there is a, it's probably my favorite, like, you know, the, the big scenes at the very end where,
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:40.240]   you know, he wakes up at the, in the morning, it's Christmas morning. It's one of the most
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:45.840]   beautiful, almost like, eye-watering, the emotional scenes and the, you know, Patrick Stewart,
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:51.920]   he's one hell of an actor. And all you need is him and a microphone and, and, and a Christmas
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:57.440]   carol and an editor. And you, and you get something like this. I, I, I swear that if you, if you buy
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:02.080]   this, you will have it on your phone and it will be there for next year. And then at some point,
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:05.920]   you'll remember it and it will become one of your traditions just like it became one of mine.
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:10.400]   When I bought mine at Building 19 for on a discount, this, I've been full audio books,
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:14.640]   just because, Hey, it's that guy from Star Trek. I wonder what he, I wonder what this is going
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:19.520]   to be like. And I wind up like crying as, as a grown adult, like, this is beautiful, you know,
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:24.640]   and he really, he's, you know, but you know, maybe he will love again and he could be a good person
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:30.240]   again. Thank you, Captain Picard. You taught me to love again. By the way, that is the actual plot
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:38.720]   of that new Will Ferrell and Ryan Seacrest movie, um, spirited Reynolds, Reynolds, I know, I like
[01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:42.880]   to, I just like to rip him a little bit, you know, he hates it when I say that.
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:47.760]   Uh, as Will Ferrell get nude in this one too, I understand he likes to get nude as in his movies.
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:52.800]   I don't believe he gets nude like we want to see his butt. I turned out, I tuned out long before
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:57.840]   any of that way of happening, but it is the whole premise is, okay, we did it, you know,
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:01.760]   we did it with the, with Scrooge, let's, and then we're going to do with other people.
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:06.960]   And then they, and of course, Ryan Reynolds is, is the ultimate modern, uh, Scrooge and, uh,
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:17.440]   and hilarity ensues and sous, uh, of 2090 ratings of this audible book, a 4.9 star
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:21.200]   rating. I've never seen such a good rating on any book, even the best.
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:24.560]   It's shocking. You see some 4.5s when you look at the ratings.
[01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:28.080]   What the hell? It's just perfect. It's, it's, it's kind of a perfect thing.
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:31.600]   Perfect. Turns out it turns out that just keeps seeing Ebenezer show up every once in a while.
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:36.000]   Yeah. Here's, uh, Christina says, it's not Christmas without this audio book.
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.960]   Captain Picard saves the day perfection. Oh, you know, that's why it got
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:45.600]   downgraded a little bit, because it's a little bit, uh, abridged.
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:50.240]   The original has settled ties that are skipped. Uh,
[01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:52.720]   perfection. Excellent.
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:56.400]   Practical steward is brilliant. Outstanding. Excellent.
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:53:03.200]   Not the entire story. Yeah, exactly. God. Dang it. Thank you.
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:09.360]   Everyone at least, yeah, but see, this is, this is why like, if, if I ever were doing like a, a,
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:15.040]   a store with, with, with user rankings, as soon as anybody puts in a one star review,
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:19.120]   one star review of anything, they're immediately banned. So see that, that's when you read, not
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:23.520]   the entire story, story incomplete, non unbridged story and stop before any of the ghosts appear,
[01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:28.320]   appear terrible. Maybe, maybe he got a defective copy, but like, usually when it's one star, it's
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:33.920]   like one star, it's not the, it's a, it's a, he left out the scene in which they show like the
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:39.280]   scraggly little kids who are, who are starvation and want like, so basically one star out of five.
[01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:44.480]   So you're saying that if, if Patrick Stewart for an hour and a half just read, you Thomas
[01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:50.720]   Eagleton on idiot, you're a moron. Everybody hates you. You're ugly on you smell. You could not
[01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:54.720]   have given it a lower rating than this. Just the fact that they cut that one scene that you like
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:54:00.960]   one star. No, thank you. Anyway, Alex Lindsey, do you have a pick of the week?
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:06.640]   I one quick one. And then, and then I have a pick. It is the season and someone in our, in our
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:15.120]   office hours. So this is, is great. So Greg Swag in, in our office hours is a Santa Claus. It's
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:23.600]   this, if you go to Santa Kringle LLC, he does Santa over zoom and it is, and he started during,
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:28.560]   and he's, I mean, it's funny. I just had dinner with him in Pittsburgh and he's just like, he just
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:33.920]   emits Santa. So anyway, so, so anyway, so the, so you've got, he has gone crazy with this. It's
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:38.480]   worth checking out, even if you're not going to be so lucky today, they can actually meet Santa.
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:44.880]   Yeah. On zoom. He's got Unreal Engine going on and he's got green screen and he feeds,
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:49.120]   of course, like Santa. I mean, he can do anything. He feeds, he feeds the, he feeds the rain deer and
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:53.920]   he's got like all kinds of physical things that he's figured out and he works on it. Oh, nice.
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:57.920]   Where he works on. There he is. Santa is doing his thing and he's got, you know,
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:04.080]   off. Yeah. And so he's a force perspective or is that? No, it's, it's a, it's a, it's a, it is.
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:08.880]   Okay. Green screen, green screen over over that. Yeah. And so he, he gets into all of these,
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:13.760]   and the, and kids really love it. And this is, Claus makes it, or no, that's an elf,
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:18.960]   the cookie baking elf. Yeah. Nice. So anyway, it's a lot of fun. You should check it out. Oh,
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:23.520]   and you should be Santa. Wow. Yeah, it's worth, it's worth checking out. He's, he's, he's constantly
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:26.080]   working on it. He's, he's in our after hours all the time figuring out. Santa,
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:27.080]   like how to do it. How to do it.
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:36.000]   Cringle LLC.com. S-A-N-T-N-K-R-I-N-G-L-E-L-L-C.com. And you've, you've spoiled it now,
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.160]   but that's what we're going to do for our, our holiday party this year. We're going to get you
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:46.160]   all a zoom. Yeah. And they will, we'll hang out with, with Pringle. So they, yeah. So the,
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:51.680]   I should have him come on the holiday show. You should, you should have him come on.
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:54.960]   Absolutely. Hey, would you hook us up? Because that'd be fun. We've got to do our holiday show
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:59.200]   December 15th. Yeah. And be fun if we just have an appearance from Santa would make it so much.
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:03.200]   We, we'll, we'll, we'll get, we'll get Santa on there. So, so let's, we'll, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:05.760]   Nice. And then what's your other pick of the week?
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:10.960]   So what was released? I've been beta testing this for almost, I guess, six or seven months.
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:16.640]   This, and it just, it just got released, Epic released reality scans. So Epic bought a company
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:22.720]   called RealityCapture. And, and so they, and, and what they did is then built an iPhone app,
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:27.440]   and it's iOS only. And it's called RealityScan. And it had been in private beta. They said,
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:31.360]   first 10,000 people got to beta. And I was one of the first 10,000, which means I was there for
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:34.560]   the first like four minutes. You know, I saw the announcement immediately. I knew that this was
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:37.680]   going to last like 10 seconds. And so I jumped in. So I've been playing with it for a while.
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:44.480]   And what it does, what it does really well. Is it, it's got a great way to guide you through
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:50.560]   capturing an object and turning into a 3D model. And it, it uses AR to kind of show you where the
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:55.840]   photos were that you shot. You get this little highlight of, of, you know,
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:59.840]   has these little green dots where it says, okay, I have plenty information for this area. I don't
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:03.920]   have enough information for that area. It all runs into the cloud. So you just sit there and,
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:09.680]   you know, you just, you, it pushes all these images up. You can put up to, yeah, up to a,
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:17.840]   200 images in. And it's just really well guided. And I think that, you know, this and poly cam
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:22.240]   are the two that I play with the most on the phone. So if you're on the phone, these are the two,
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:26.080]   and this one's free. Poly can't cost a little bit of money a month. And, and so
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:30.640]   this is going to be a big deal as we go into next year. I know we didn't talk about it much
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:35.760]   today, but you know, VR and AR and M and XR are all going to be, you know, something you're going
[01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:41.360]   to want to be able to figure out how to get geometry into what you're doing. And this is a pretty,
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:46.400]   it's pretty cool to see where Epic's taking this. And so, so anyway, it's reality scan. I,
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:50.880]   I actually did a walkthrough of it as our second hour in office hours this morning.
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:54.240]   So if you want to see more information, you can go to office hours and check it out. It's a,
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:58:00.720]   it is so I, we spend an hour, people asking questions and us talking about it in detail and,
[01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:05.440]   and everything else. And so, but we break it down and, and kind of show how it actually works, but
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:11.520]   it's pretty slick. It's pretty, it's pretty slick, I think. So, but it's, I mean, you've
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:16.800]   mentioned a few apps that do this. Is this the one? It's this and poly camera, both the, the two that I
[01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:21.280]   would, these are the two and it's free. So it just downloaded and play it. Yeah. Yeah. And then
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:26.960]   poly cam is the other one that I use. And I use both of them, probably equal parts. Poly cam, I find
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:31.840]   a little easier in if I'm trying to capture a room. And this one is a little bit more guided.
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:36.880]   And I find it to this one generates, I find a little slightly better geometry than poly cam. So,
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:43.200]   because it's more guide in that area. It will, it can generate basically what it does is it
[01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:47.280]   uploads the file to when it finishes it, uploads it to Sketchfab. So you have to have an
[01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:51.600]   a Sketchfab account, which is free. And it'll, it'll put it up on Sketchfab. In fact, if you go to
[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:56.960]   Alex B. Lindsey, I believe in Sketchfab, you'll see some of the rough ones that I've done. I just
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:59:01.440]   put them up there. I'm like, okay, here's, here's something. And some of them are pretty hard to do.
[01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:08.400]   Like if the ones that have a lot of detail that are not mechanical are pretty difficult to,
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:13.520]   to build 3D models of, and it does a pretty good job of it. So anyway, I think it's going to be,
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:19.520]   these are the two that I've seen that are kind of are the on the leaderboard of what's, but what
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:25.200]   I really think they've done right in Sketch in reality scan is the interface of showing you
[01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:29.440]   how to shoot the photo. It's, you know, for someone like me, I've been doing photogrammetry for
[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:36.160]   over 25 years. And so I kind of know what I'm looking for. So, but if you're not having
[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:39.680]   something that kind of guides you through that, that shooting process is pretty important.
[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:46.960]   So very good. It's cool. Very good. It's a free in the app store reality scan from Unreal.
[01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:50.240]   So it's something we want to see you. If you want to see me talk about it for an hour,
[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:53.120]   you can go to office hours. That's why I did this morning.
[01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:56.400]   I'm going to mention this now because it's only a matter of time before it gets taken down.
[01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:01.920]   Search all Apple keynotes by entering a word or phrase.
[02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:08.160]   This is something actually I've needed for a long time because we're often talking about,
[02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:14.480]   when do they announce, you know, the iPhone 3GS? And now you can just search for it
[02:00:14.480 --> 02:00:22.560]   and pull up the keynote where it's mentioned in orders, in order. So this is a kind of a cool
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:30.400]   little thing. I guess it won't get taken down because it doesn't. It just links back to the Apple
[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:38.320]   page, right? So it's probably okay. I don't know. It just seems like this is the kind of thing Apple
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:47.040]   hates. It's a add context dot x y z. And it's a way to search for any phrase in any Apple keynote
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:53.760]   case you need it. They don't even give you the time code. So you know exactly, you know, where
[02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:59.840]   the first appearance is and all of that. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now ready to conclude
[02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:06.320]   our holiday episode, our first of many holiday episode Andy and I go, when are you going to be
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:14.720]   on GBH next? Next Friday at 1230 in the afternoon, go to wgphnews.org to stream the audio live or
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:22.640]   later go to wgphnews channel on YouTube to watch it live or later. Nice. By the way, don't search
[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:28.240]   for 5g on that Apple keynotes thing because you just go crazy. It just breaks. Everybody should
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:33.360]   go to office hours.global because that's where the fun is every morning. In fact, all day long.
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:39.440]   Thanks to this guy right here, Alex, Lindsay. Today, reality scan was the topic.
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:44.960]   Yep. Yeah. And it's just the second hours keep getting better. So we just have lots of, you know,
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:50.720]   we're yesterday was talking about business structure. So it jumps from all from the business
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:55.040]   end of things to the infrastructure things to graphics and sound Wednesdays typically. I think
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:59.520]   we're talking about I can't believe phase and polarity is going to be like a whole hour.
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:04.720]   Whole hour on phase and polarity. Like that's if you want to get your geek on when it comes to
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:12.960]   audio and video. That's very deep. It's free. It's open to all. You can get an invitation to the
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:16.640]   Zoom if you want to ask questions or you could just watch on YouTube. Best thing to do is go to
[02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:23.280]   office hours.global. And if you want to hire the best team in the world for producing live
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:31.360]   internet events, go to 090 media and say ask for Alex. Tell him Leo.
[02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:38.800]   The best. If you want to look as good as Alex does on this show, that's the place to go.
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:46.320]   Jason Snell is at six colors.com. He has many, many podcasts, but he also writes all about Apple
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:51.360]   at six colors.com with Dan Moore. What is it? Well, give plug a podcast. You got so many. I never know.
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:58.640]   Yeah, let's plug downstream because we just did an episode last week about the mini-bobs of Disney
[02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:05.040]   Bob's coming and going. Bob and Bob. CEO Bob's old Bob's all of that. And Julia Alexander is
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:11.120]   about the best person possible on the internet to talk about the details of what's going on with
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:16.560]   Disney and Maven. She's on the She's on the Niele Patel's podcast today talking about it.
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:22.640]   And I'll just say she's kind of just refining her points that she made last week on my podcast
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:26.800]   with her. So lately, anyway, it's a if you care about like the business of streaming, we were
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:30.960]   talking about Apple TV earlier and about what's going on with Disney and all the other stuff that's
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:35.120]   in the world of streaming, the business side of streaming. That is she is so smart. And I'm just
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:40.560]   happy to be there as a as a conduit to get her intelligence out on the internet. Nice to get
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:46.560]   somebody who's an expert. She's the director of strategy at Parrot. Yeah, yeah, she's running
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:51.760]   for for puck and she's like she's all over the place now because she is a a real specialist in
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:56.640]   this. She goes to work at the Verge. She gets she gets our people but she also like really gets the
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:04:03.120]   the streaming business which is I think one of the most interesting stories in technology right now
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:07.920]   is like the how technology has eaten the entertainment industry and turned into this new streaming
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:14.480]   business. Yeah, I pay a hundred bucks a year to read her stuff on puck news is along with
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:19.600]   Baratunde and all the others. Yeah, that's good. Good stuff. I love puck. It's an expensive,
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:22.640]   but it's a it is it's a treat. It is but it's very good. Yeah.
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:27.760]   Thank you so much. All three of you. We do Mac break. Thanks to you for watching. We do Mac
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:33.920]   break weekly. We record it every Tuesday 11 am Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time 1900 UTC
[02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:39.360]   and because we have a live stream running as we record it, you can watch us record it live
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:47.120]   wonder what these things are in front of me. We do this every year and it's antlers but you just
[02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:53.360]   if you don't see the deer's head, it looks like I'm roasting in silver flames of hell. I don't know
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:57.600]   what it is. It's just very. It looks it looks like you're driving a Cadillac and that's one of your
[02:04:57.600 --> 02:05:03.520]   custom hood over it like a big Texan like 1971 Elvis Cadillac. We can't really figure out what to do
[02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:09.360]   with this, but I think it's perfect right here. It leads the way. So that's the kind of thing you
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:15.120]   get when you watch live live.twit.tv. There's live audio and video there. There's if you're watching
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:22.640]   live chat live at irc.twit.tv and if you I put it a little plug, you can also chat with us
[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:28.240]   in our discord. If you're not yet a member of club twit, it's not the only reason to join club
[02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:34.480]   twit, but to get the ad free versions of all the shows to get the access to the discord plus the
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:40.080]   twit plus feed with hands-on Macintosh with mica sergeant, which we don't put out as a public
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:46.160]   podcast and or just occasionally put out publicly. Yeah, but there's many more episodes hands-on
[02:05:46.160 --> 02:05:50.400]   windows with Paul Therrot, the entitled Linux show and Jonathan Bennett and all lots of great
[02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:57.440]   stuff in the twit plus feed. And frankly, you know, I don't want to get all PBS about this,
[02:05:57.440 --> 02:06:02.080]   but the members who support us through club twit really are doing important work. It really
[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:10.080]   makes us happy, but it also keeps us going. It pays the light bill twit.tv/club twit. If you're
[02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:14.640]   not in a member, please, please consider it. And it would be a wonderful holiday gift if you've
[02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:21.200]   got a geek in your life. There's a yearly plan. Just give me years worth. It's a nice thing to do
[02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:29.920]   for us and for them. Twit.tv/club twit plus you get all the animated gifts. At least it's not
[02:06:29.920 --> 02:06:36.400]   scrappy do. That's all we ask. That's all we ask. Have some taste. If you don't get here for the
[02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:41.840]   live show, you can download a copy at twit.tv/mbw. Of course, there's a YouTube channel dedicated
[02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:47.440]   to Mac break weekly and best thing to do probably subscribe in your favorite podcast client.
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:55.520]   That way we, you know, you get it automatically. It also supports free and open RSS podcasting
[02:06:55.520 --> 02:07:04.160]   as opposed to the silos of Spotify and iHeart and Amazon and so forth and so on. So we like that too.
[02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:10.400]   So get Pocketcaster, Apple's Podcast or Google Podcast and subscribe. It will make everybody happy.
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:14.240]   Thanks everybody. Have a great week. Now get back to work cause
[02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:21.920]   time is over. Bye bye. I'm Jason Howell. What do you get your favorite geek who already has
[02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:26.560]   everything? Well, I know just the thing. It's a club twit gift subscription, of course.
[02:07:26.560 --> 02:07:31.680]   Twit podcasts keep them informed and entertained with the most relevant tech news and podcasts
[02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:35.760]   available. And with a club twit subscription, they get even more. They get access to all of our
