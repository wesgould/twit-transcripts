[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. It's gonna be an interesting show. There's not a lot of Mac news.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:12.680]   Well, there's one Mac story. Mostly we'll be talking about Apple. Have they lost the war of words against Samsung?

[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.880]   and Apple news every week so that's why we call it Mac Break Weekly. Here he is Andy Enocho, the Chicago
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.880]   Sun Times and the Verge. I saw you 60 minutes 60 seconds on the Verge.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.880]   90 seconds. 90 when they had an extra 30 seconds.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.880]   They gave you much information. So was that just a one-time dealer or the new host? What's going on?
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.880]   I stopped by to visit their new offices and soil their bean bag chairs which are comfortable and lovely.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.880]   I had the company sell some things in the future.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:19.880]   Wow. That's great. It was so impressive to see a company that's still building out,
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.880]   still on the way up, still moving in where you see just everybody working, everybody frenetic,
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.880]   all kinds of equipment that is being put to use. It's not yet at the point where people are just sort of
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.880]   wondering, "Oh, how much work do I have to do before I can go to the break room and have another free bag of
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.880]   peanuts?" It's just, I also visited Comixology which is the exact same process right now.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.880]   The font place that you love so very much. Oh no, they're the digital comic book.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.880]   The comic book. The iTunes of Digital Comics.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.880]   And so they're also in the process of like they moved to a bigger office last year.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.880]   They're moving to another bigger office soon. And it's like, "Okay, so this is what excitement and development looks like.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.880]   This is good." Yeah. You should come out to visit Twit sometime.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.880]   Also here, and he's not going anywhere because he's snowed in in Montreal.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.880]   Renee Ritchie from iMore.com. You took off your snow suit.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.880]   He was all bundled up when he joined us.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.880]   I was being made fun of so I relented to peer pressure.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.880]   No, we're snowed in. That almost never happens. Montreal State is famous for staying open no matter what.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.880]   But apparently buses were getting stuck and trucks couldn't get up hills.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.880]   So the schools have closed. Everything is closed. And we may never make it out alive.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.880]   Yikes! Yikes!
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.880]   Snowpocalypse.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.880]   Snowpocalypse. Yeah, you wouldn't think Montreal would ever have trouble with snow.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.880]   They have the trucks out, but it's still snowing.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.880]   It's supposed to snow for a couple days. So it's either the threat of the giant plows.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.880]   And I unfortunately was in front of the plow, not behind it. That's not where you want to be.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.880]   It's got to be.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.880]   And also, good to have you. I'm glad you made it. I guess really with Skype, you can't leave.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.880]   So really, this is the only place you could be.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.880]   Absolutely.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.880]   It's not so hard to get here by a Skype.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.880]   But look who is here, Mr. Alex Lindsey of the Pixelcore.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.880]   I always make a video when you're here. And you've been here a lot lately, so I should stop making such a big video.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.880]   Well, you know, I'll just go back into the travel schedule.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.880]   So, but right now, no, I'm trying to...
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.880]   We actually are adding more people to the Pixelcore, and I'm able to not be everywhere.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.880]   Yay!
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.880]   Well, we've been working on...
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.880]   More good love having you.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.880]   Slow progress.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.880]   Big story, breaking news. 10.8.3 is out.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.880]   Ground close.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.880]   Ted doesn't know because he hides updates.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.880]   I actually updated my computer yesterday.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.880]   Okay, all right, all right.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.880]   Apple buries the lead, by the way, on this one. The 10.8.3 update recommended for all mountain line users.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.880]   Includes features and fixes that improve the stability.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:50.880]   The number one item Apple says 10.8.3 does is the ability to redeem iTunes gift cards in the Mac App Store using your Mac's built-in camera.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.880]   Then bootcamp support for Windows 8.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.880]   I guess taking pictures of gift cards with your camera is a cool feature.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.880]   Well, it's fun.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.880]   One is work.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.880]   It's a good...
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.880]   I guess it should be in the operating system.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.880]   I think more people will use that than the bootcamp.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.880]   Yeah, you're probably right.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.880]   Also bootcamp support for Mac's with a 3TB hard drive.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.880]   I'm guessing that means your fusion, we fusion users can use it, but I'll have to check.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.880]   A fix for an issue that could cause a file URL to quit apps unexpectedly.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.880]   That might have been the number one feature.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.880]   That was the file colon.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.880]   That was great.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.880]   That was awesome.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.880]   So they fixed that.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.880]   Logic Pro Fix.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.880]   Stuttering Audio in 2011 iMacs.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.880]   And an update to Safari.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.880]   As usual, they kind of don't mention the security updates, but I would guess there's a few security updates built into this one.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.880]   Anyway, just a word of warning.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.880]   Note, you might want to...
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.880]   I'm going to update now even though it's going to require a restart.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.880]   Let's see here.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.880]   Let's see.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.880]   What else is going on?
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.880]   Oh, maybe we should...
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.880]   I think we'll save this apple losing the war of words.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.880]   Very interesting couple of articles this week from John Louis Gesset in his Monday note yesterday.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.880]   John Gruber, a couple of days earlier.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.880]   The perception, especially with the Galaxy S4 event on Thursday, as weird as it was.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.880]   And it really was.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.880]   You went to that, Andy, right?
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.880]   Yeah, it was just...
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.880]   I'll put it this way.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:36.880]   While I was waiting in line around the first hour, someone replied to me on Twitter correcting me for misspelling a...
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.880]   I said that I described it as a "buster clock" and they corrected myself.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.880]   Thank you very much for that.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.880]   Hey, but you know what took advantage of the "buster clock"?
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.880]   HTC, apparently they were going around giving...
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.880]   Did you try the one?
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.880]   They had water, they had little like snack-sized Pringles.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.880]   They were going through the line with HTC.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.880]   I knew that everybody is in line.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.880]   Everybody is in the tech press there.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.880]   On top of everything else, it wasn't terribly well organized like an apple event is.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.880]   Where you know that at some point, here's where you stand in line.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.880]   What time you get in, and you're going to get a seat when you get in.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.880]   This was showing up, in my case, showing up an hour before the doors open,
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.880]   being told to stand over there at the end of a long, long line,
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.880]   35 minutes later being told, "Oh, you're in the wrong lines now."
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.880]   This line over there, "Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk."
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.880]   Meanwhile, this is a Radio City Music Hall.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.880]   By my estimate, the maximum capacity of Radio City Music Hall is 6,000.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.880]   They had the entire orchestra section full, and I think part of the mezzanine.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.880]   So at least a thousand people, I'm going to guess closer to 1500 to 1750.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.880]   This was not exactly a laser-focused event designed to deliver technical information
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.880]   to extremely savvy business and technology reporters.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.880]   It was a very big tent, and so therefore they gave us a stage show with actors and dancers
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:08.880]   and lots of odd things that didn't really, never once showed us anything actually working.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.880]   That was the most amazing thing.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.880]   Every time they'd show off a feature, it would be, again, the actors showing off
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.880]   how people would conceivably use that feature in the real world.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.880]   Then on the big Jumbo Trons screens, here is a screen image that is a static image of,
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.880]   like a PR image of what that feature looks like on the screen.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.880]   Honestly, the only thing that was really of use to a tech reporter was at the very, very,
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.880]   very, very, very end when they said goodbye and said, "The demo area is now open."
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.880]   Then on the big Jumbo Trons, they had spec sheets.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.880]   That's we found out, "Okay, so it runs Android 4.2.2.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.880]   It has these..."
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.880]   You could have done that in five seconds.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.880]   In fact, they could have put it outside in the line, given you a piece of paper, and you could have gone home.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.880]   But you would have missed the 50s housewives, ogling the pool boy, and why their nails dry.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.880]   That, I think, was worth the price of admission.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:09.880]   To be honest, I was so busy taking notes, and because my radar is insufficiently tuned into sort of stuff,
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.880]   I did see that it was weird and silly.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:18.880]   I didn't really, until I watched the video later on, notice that, "Oh my goodness, they really wanted to do it that way."
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.880]   It was really quite tone-defing.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:28.880]   I just remember thinking that if I had flown out to the opposite coast and spin all that money for this,
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.880]   I would steam be.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.880]   In Samsung's defense, though, they had press briefings in the morning.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.880]   They did the one-on-one briefings where the press went in, and they let them do hands-on on the devices,
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.880]   and they sent out press releases earlier with all the features.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.880]   This was entirely a show.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.880]   But who was it for?
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.880]   Yeah, because the journalists who cover Android, Day in and Day out had all their stuff they needed.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.880]   They could have left at lunchtime.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.880]   There was no need for the event.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.880]   And then they also had Times Square showing the live feed, plus with dancers, jugglers.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.880]   I think the gist of some of the answers.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.880]   It looked really cold.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.880]   I don't mean to speak selfishly.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.880]   I go to these events.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.880]   They're times when I get the one-on-one.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.880]   They're times when I don't get the one-on-one.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.880]   Even when I don't get the one-on-one, I don't get, "Oh, here's a little Broadway show.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.880]   We're going to give you because you're stupid and we don't really think you're going to be riding the series."
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:23.880]   The people in line with me, as far as I can tell, most of the people who got the substantive briefing
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.880]   were the people who are in the direct Android press.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:32.880]   But I was with people who have 20 years' experience in tech journalism and are now executives
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:41.880]   in a major name brand, like online and print news outlets, that reaches into the millions per month.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.880]   And they were pulling their heels for an hour and a half and they got our long dog and pony show.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.880]   We did get a sack lunch at the end of it.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.880]   How was that lunch?
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.880]   Was that good?
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:57.880]   I had the steak, so it was sort of a steak salad, a brownie, a cookie with the Samsung logo on it.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:02.880]   And a 64 gigabyte SD card.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.880]   Oh, that's not bad. I'd take that.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.880]   Which wasn't bad upon it.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.880]   Does it say not to be taken internally?
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.880]   I mean, do you think some of the hungry press might have eaten it?
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.880]   We know that you're silly and you probably think this is paste and therefore edible, but we're telling you,
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.880]   please don't eat the card.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.880]   All I can think as I'm watching it is Apple would have, I would just, Apple, Apple, Apple, because really,
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:29.880]   I guess Apple has kind of the brand name for this kind of event.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.880]   And I just, I kept thinking, oh my God, Apple would never do anything.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:39.880]   Well, I think that sometimes people will say that you're either your parents or not your parents.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:44.880]   In this case, I think a lot of people have gone towards being like Apple for a long time or something.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.880]   And Sam comes to consciously, did the opposite.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.880]   Let's try to do something that is not, we're going to do something that's better than what Apple does.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.880]   We're going to make it, you know, it was definitely different.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.880]   I mean, it was definitely, you know, imaginative.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.880]   It was a cry for attention.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.880]   It's funny because Sam's on the topic.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.880]   We are talking about it.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.880]   Sam's on copy so much Apple does, even down to now, you know, Apple made everything the "I".
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.880]   Sam's on everything is the "S".
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:08.880]   Right.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.880]   And so this is like a direct, it's like such a copy.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.880]   So why not just copy everything?
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.880]   Why pick this one fairly important thing to be, you know, contrarian on?
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.880]   And it didn't work.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.880]   It didn't work.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:30.880]   I mean, the other part of it is they have a lot of really smart people at Samsung who seemed to know before the show went on that this was completely the wrong thing.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.880]   I don't know if it's Samsung executives not listening or if there's some sort of transatlantic problem, but...
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.880]   Was there a message like a drum beat that you heard before the show that this is the wrong thing?
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:46.880]   I was in the same line as Andy and there were, as much as there was HTC executives sneaking around there, there was a lot of Samsung people around there.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.880]   I'm just so sorry.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.880]   We're so sorry for what you're about to see.
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.880]   It didn't look like they were happy.
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.880]   Oh, dear.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.880]   And it was, it was a very...
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:00.880]   It was like a '50s musical that was really mistimed and misdirected and they had smart people.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:08.880]   Ryan Biden, the chief product, the head of product marketing for Samsung was there with the actor during the presentation and Ryan is phenomenal.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.880]   He did the playbook for Blackberry previously.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.880]   Very good at explaining that stuff, but he's being surrounded by skits.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:14.880]   Right.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.880]   And they broke the fourth wall, so they kept telling you, "This is our fake family."
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.880]   Uh-huh.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.880]   Yeah, so it was good.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.880]   But it was a completely mistimed, Lincoln nudge.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.880]   Yeah, well, it wasn't.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.880]   There was an awful lot of it.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.880]   I like a little Lincoln nudge, but it was like non-stop, Lincoln nudge.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.880]   He's not really Chinese.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.880]   Look, see, he's speaking English now.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.880]   Why, you were Veronica earlier.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.880]   Now you're mad.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:37.880]   It was just like...
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.880]   Even if the phone decisions are all like Samsung still uses the cheaper feeling.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.880]   After you hold it in...
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.880]   That was a disappointment to me.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.880]   They're deliberate about it.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.880]   They seem to think that that appeals to the demographic that they want to go through.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.880]   They use two different chipsets instead of one because carriers have to approve chipsets.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.880]   So it's an interesting fall, and I think it's a miracle of engineering that they can put
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:04.380]   a five-inch 1080p display in a casing as small as the Galaxy S3, but a lot of it seem just
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.380]   unfocused.
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.520]   And I think that's the challenge that they have, is to sort of stop throwing things against
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.880]   the wall and pick their battles better.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.880]   This isn't the Samsung show, but I think it's appropriate to talk a little bit about the S4,
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.880]   because when we come back and talk about the iPhone 5S, it's somewhat...
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.880]   Apple, I think...
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.880]   Look, Phil Schiller was giving interviews the day before, clearly defensive interviews.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.880]   Phil can talk about it.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.880]   We can.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.880]   Well, it's something rarely done at Apple.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.880]   I mean, I think that they are starting to distinguish themselves.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.880]   I think...
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.880]   But while Samsung might have copied Apple in the early days, I think that Samsung is definitely
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.880]   going after saying yes to everything.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.880]   You know, we wanted to have the highest resolution and we wanted to be fastest.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.880]   And Apple is known for saying no to lots of things.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.380]   And I think you're going to find that...
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:51.360]   I think that Samsung phones are going to have faster processors and bigger screens, and
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.680]   they are going to be more complex.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.000]   You know, and I think that there's a certain population that wants it.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.480]   I'm going to probably have one.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.880]   Well, it's interesting because I don't know about it on my day-to-day.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.880]   I mean, that's my issue.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:07.880]   The response to retina display is retina plus, I mean, 1920 by 1080 on a 5-inch display is
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.880]   mind-boggling.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.880]   Yeah, 440...
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:10.880]   It's something...
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.880]   But it's...
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.480]   Looking at it in person, it certainly looked wonderful.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.880]   And when you display a webpage and you sort of scroll it down so you see the whole width
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.840]   of like a desktop screen page inside there.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.280]   I feel as though I could see more detail in there than before, but realize that when
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.880]   the first time that people started shipping these retina displays, they're telling you
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.520]   that this is actually higher than the human eye can perceive.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.080]   So it seems as though you have to really sell the point of, no, no, no, we are...
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.120]   We promise you that there is more detail and does improve the experience because otherwise
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.960]   you're just making the device more expensive and you're burning out battery life much more
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:47.960]   quickly.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.360]   Yeah, and require much higher CPU power to put all those pixels to.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.640]   This phone is twice as fast as the iPhone 5 according to Geekbench.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.040]   It's also still OLED, which is, I think, pure stubbornness at this point.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.040]   Oh, interesting.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.040]   Because it's...
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.000]   I know Tim Cook said it, but it's invoked for how we will say it.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.560]   But independent people who are very good at measuring screens are saying, "Oh, that is
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.560]   not a great technology.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.920]   They oversaturated, try and overcome the problems with the blue color."
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.080]   And at the end of the day, just doesn't make as good a picture as the LCD that Apple and
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.080]   HTC and others are...
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.040]   You're going to have a hard time convincing consumers of that.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:26.320]   And for the same reason that they buy TVs and leave them on the dynamic display setting
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.720]   that was at the Kmart, people like bright, saturated colors.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.960]   You're going to have a hard time convincing them to just so understand.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.960]   It's not accurate.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.960]   Who cares?
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.960]   It's gorgeous.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.320]   There's a point to be made that there's a difference between the correct saturation level
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:45.280]   for a TV where it's always showing nothing but real people and real events and real things.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.160]   Whereas a phone is mostly going to show you be showing you a user interface.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:55.800]   So if that is a conscious decision, I don't really think it is, that making brighter, sharper,
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.960]   more saturated colors is going to be making applications look more pleasing, that is an
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.120]   argument that can be made.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.120]   But I agree with Renee.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:07.520]   It's like the biggest disadvantage of OLED is that in bright sunlight, the iPhone 5 works
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.960]   great in bright sunlight on an OLED display.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.120]   You really do need to crank up the brightness.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.120]   You can still maintain readability.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.640]   What really surprised me though is that they're going...
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.480]   So now they're going for a 13 megapixel camera.
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.480]   Yeah, that's surprising.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.480]   13 megapixel camera when everybody is...
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.480]   Yeah, versus 4.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.480]   Yeah, versus 4.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.480]   Yeah, versus 4.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.480]   Exactly.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.720]   Every other manufacturer is saying we're going to give you less fewer megapixels, but we're
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.120]   going to make sure we explain to you that this will result in better pictures.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.800]   And of course, they didn't...
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.560]   Renee, did they actually release any photos from that camera because I couldn't find
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.560]   any?
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.960]   No, and the nor of the units gone out to let people test them yet.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:47.680]   Yeah, so I'm so completely skeptical of this will in any way be an upgrade over the previous
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.680]   camera.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.680]   I believe...
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.280]   I'm sort of suspicious that it's going to be worse than any other camera because great
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.720]   more megapixel, but probably more noise, probably less...
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.360]   Yeah, when I think it's smaller, my phone...
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.600]   If you put them in front of a focus chart, well lit, I think you'll probably find that
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.600]   it is sharper.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.600]   But if you look at it...
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.880]   Well lit being the underscored phrase there.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.600]   Yeah, exactly, because it'll be...
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.880]   But the problem is as soon as you put in a real world setting, you're going to find that
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.880]   it's much grainier.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:20.720]   I mean, I'm quite happy with a 6 megapixel camera that was really good in low light,
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.840]   which I don't think any of these phone cameras are.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.840]   How is it...
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.480]   Apple, I would say Apple, and tell me if I'm wrong, but the iPhone still is the best
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.240]   camera phone on the market.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.240]   Right?
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.240]   I mean, not even close.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:35.800]   And it's using, as I understand, the same Sony sensor as the Galaxy S3.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.800]   So what is...
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.800]   Apple must...
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.800]   It must be software.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.200]   It must be software.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.760]   I'm not sure.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.760]   Software could be lenses, could be...
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.760]   Oh, it could be other stuff.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.760]   The purple glass.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.760]   Yeah, the carotl...
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.760]   They put it in the camera.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.960]   There's some secret stuff that nobody...
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.640]   Why has nobody been able to duplicate this?
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.640]   Certainly.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.440]   Some cameras are better at individual aspects.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.000]   Like the optical image stabilization might help in low light.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   I think overall, Andy's exactly right.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.120]   The linear station in low light.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.320]   The Lumia is great in low light.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.680]   The Lumia 920 absolutely humiliates the iPhone in low light.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.040]   I mean, it's not even close.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.160]   It's just absolute humiliation.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.400]   But as we say, when you take those numbers off of the image sensor, what do you do with
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.400]   the next?
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.640]   What frustrates me about that camera when I was testing it was that if you give it even
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:22.240]   just an average scene which is perfectly good lighting, I mean, nothing particularly great,
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.640]   not particularly bad about it, it's like, why is there so much noise in the branches of
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.920]   those trees?
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.200]   Why is the color of the sky just a little bit off?
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:37.360]   And you know that you just get the impression that this camera is one software update away
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.640]   from being the best camera on the entire market, but it's just not there yet.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.120]   Let me posit this, and you guys tell me if I'm right or wrong.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.120]   And it seems to me from the presentation that Samsung has decided it's going to become
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:55.960]   the phone of the people and is willing to see something that Apple has historically had,
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:03.800]   which is the phone for the smart people, the people who really care and are willing to
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.800]   describe that.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.560]   You see the oddest term Leo, when the poster came up, "JK Shin" was there to introduce
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:14.120]   the phone, President of Samsung, and it was called a lifestyle companion.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.120]   Yeah, that's their new tag phrase.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.040]   Most of us in the media, because it's really an empty term.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.040]   It doesn't really mean anything.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.840]   And yes, they had health features.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:25.040]   Yes, they had, and Samsung's an interesting company, they make scales, they make brains.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.720]   They can do all these great things.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.760]   But lifestyle companion didn't really mean anything.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.520]   It was almost a symbol of trying to be good at a lot of things, but great at it.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.160]   I'll tell you what it means, and I'll tell you where they're going with that.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.600]   They're saying you don't need a computer.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:42.000]   For instance, all of the camera, I mean, look, they have so much Samsung crap software on
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   this thing.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.040]   This thing, and most of the presentation was not about the phone at all, but about the
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.320]   crap software Samsung was putting on it.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:54.120]   Things like it scrolls as you look up and follows your eyes and picture in picture so
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.800]   that the forward facing camera takes a picture of you while you're taking a picture of your
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:03.480]   kids so you can, for the truly narcissistic, you can see your reaction to the kids tap dancing.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:09.640]   All of this, but to me, it seems like Samsung is trying to do everything you would do in
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.640]   a computer.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.640]   You don't need a computer.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.640]   This is your companion.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.640]   This is your lifestyle companion.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.840]   This is everything you need to do for your busy, active life.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.840]   No?
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.880]   I think it was just empty marketing.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.320]   You need to have a phrase up there that gives the impression that this is a very coherent
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.480]   tie together device, even though it really wasn't.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.600]   I think what surprised me the most is that I could really see how they could have showed
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.680]   off some of these features to make them look really, really good.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:39.400]   It has actual motion sensors on the front of the device.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:44.560]   They're using it to say, "Oh, look, you can turn pages just by waving your hand in front
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.880]   of it," which is a silly way to demonstrate that.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:51.520]   A great way to demonstrate that is that it doesn't matter if you happen to be in a
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:56.440]   landlocked, snowbound Canadian city and you're wearing thick ski gloves standing outside,
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.240]   that you will still be able to scroll through the book that you're reading.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:03.080]   That's a good feature, but no, they have to say, "Oh, look, I can wear it with my cotton.
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.280]   I don't want to touch my screen because my nails are still wet."
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.280]   I'm holding a drink.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.280]   Huge promise to be in the morning.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:14.720]   But to answer my question, isn't Samsung going after normal people and saying, "Okay,
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.580]   Apple, you're happy to..." and this is going to lead into this conversation about the
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:18.580]   war.
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.320]   We're happy for you to take the high end.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.320]   Well, I don't...
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:27.560]   So, I think one thing is, I think that the kind of marketing that I saw in that area,
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:32.560]   or that hyperbole is, I find, more common when I was working in Japan.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.440]   It's a much more common language.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.080]   Technology being part of your life.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.080]   I want more accepted.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:41.040]   Well, because many Japanese don't have, there's no room in there, I'm told, in their
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.920]   apartments for a desktop computer that their phone is so complex that it's into their
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.920]   computer.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.960]   What I do in Japan anyway is outrageous.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.400]   And people really do do most of their communication.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.760]   That may be a stereotype, but that's what I've heard.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.680]   Even this was years ago, when the iPhone was first coming out when I was there, and even
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.120]   then the phones were pretty advanced.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.200]   So people really do spend a lot of time there more than probably...
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.280]   I couldn't say more than Americans now, with the smartphone revolution.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.720]   But I still think that what you're looking at is...
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.520]   I think Android has always been going this direction, and I think that Samsung is running
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.520]   this direction, which is the...
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.800]   If you're really looking for the fastest cheaper...
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.040]   I mean, sorry, the fastest...
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:34.200]   The biggest feature set, the lowest price, those two areas, I think, is something that
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.240]   Samsung and Android are going to always...
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.680]   And Apple doesn't care about.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.880]   I think Apple is looking for...
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.320]   I still think it's always...
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.520]   I think Apple's going to argue that it's not just the high end, it's the people who just
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.520]   want it to work.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.720]   They don't want to know about it, they don't want to think about it, they don't want it
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.720]   to be complicated.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.000]   Well, Samsung quite cleverly positioned that as your parents.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.680]   It is, but the thing is, is that...
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:58.160]   I still will argue that that market is the largest market.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.160]   People...
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.160]   They don't...
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.040]   We live in this geek world where we think that everything has to do everything.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:07.000]   And I have an Android phone, so I can do all the other things that I don't do on my iPhone.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.320]   So I get that.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.320]   But...
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.720]   Doc Rock is saying that, Charlie, it's also the long train commutes that mean people
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.000]   need more powerful phones.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   They spend more time in a train.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.880]   So it's a smaller living space.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.520]   One thing that confused me though is that Samsung is going to spend maybe a billion dollars
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.520]   on marketing this phone.
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.640]   They were close to half a billion last year.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.400]   And when I went down and played with it, and it was pre-release software, but the interface
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.400]   hasn't really changed.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.800]   They haven't done anything.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:34.120]   The icons are still oddly sized, there's no cohesiveness, there's no overall design
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.120]   language.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.920]   When they showed off some of those Samsung proprietary apps, they sort of looked like
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.480]   the Sony apps, or the apps that are made by a hardware engineering team that really
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.560]   doesn't care about the way that they look.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.160]   And I think that's the stumbling block for mainstream users.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.280]   And that's why maybe you don't see as big usage statistics for these kinds of phones,
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.920]   because they're not as intuitive or as friendly or as engaging to use.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.080]   And I would hope they would take that money and give some of it to the icon factor.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.240]   Your Pacific helmet or something like that.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.240]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.440]   I hear Lauren Richter.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:06.680]   One question I have is, as Samsung continues to fork the Android platform, does it get
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:11.760]   to a point where it's such a big player in that it actually damages the platform?
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.080]   Like, when does it become a Samsung platform?
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.080]   Not an Android.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:21.760]   I think that if you read the tea leaves at Google and Andy Rubin leaving Android and
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.560]   being handed over to Sundar Pichai, who's basically a company guy has been running Chrome and
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.760]   Chrome OS, I think Google's saying that Google's saying we lost control of Android.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.080]   We got control of Chrome and Chrome OS.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.280]   We've lost control of Android.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.840]   It is right now.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.840]   It's a two horse race.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.680]   It's Apple and Samsung.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:43.800]   HTC, BlackBerry, Nokia, all also rants, not even close.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.120]   They're way behind in the pack.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.120]   It's Apple and Samsung.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.120]   Especially Profits.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:55.880]   I think it's because they both have two very, very smart and non-overlapping strategies.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.160]   Where Apple's plan is, we're going to figure out exactly the most profitable sector of
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.040]   the market and we're going to build a device that is specifically targeted to appeal to
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.040]   those people.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.800]   Whereas Samsung has said, we will build any phone for anybody.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.680]   We don't care about making a plastic phone that we can sell for $8 in an international
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.040]   market where that is the most sensitive to price.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.040]   We'll build it.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.080]   We don't care about building four different sizes of screens just to make sure we're covering
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.400]   our bets and making sure that we can sell a phone to anybody who wants any size device.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:30.040]   It's not an elegant solution to the problem of how to become a successful phone company,
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:34.120]   but it turns out to be a very successful solution to becoming a successful phone company.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:39.120]   I think that the challenge is if it forks too far to the point where it's not really an
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:44.800]   Android phone anymore and there's a lot of compatibility issues, then Samsung is really
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.360]   in their own ecosystem, which maybe they want.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.360]   That's what Amazon does.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.360]   But Samsung is doing 4.2.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.960]   I mean, it is Android.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.920]   It's the latest version of Android.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:53.920]   It's not much modified.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.920]   It's Samsung has their own app store.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.920]   Already.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.920]   They're the same as Amazon.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:57.920]   They have their own app store.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.920]   They talk to developers individually.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.400]   They want you to submit your apps to them.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.120]   They give you very detailed reports on your apps.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.640]   And you never use the Samsung app store.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.640]   It's just not.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.640]   It's the crap store.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.520]   Whether the developer or user never use it.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.760]   I don't think there's the problem of forking Android.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:18.120]   I think it's a subtler point because Google has to be happy so long as there's lots of
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.440]   phones that are sending traffic into the Google Play Store.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:26.000]   Because the problem is that you can start your own Samsung store, but if it has nothing
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.920]   on it, and that's the state of the Samsung store right now, I mean, no one's going to
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.920]   actually use it.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:35.600]   I'm going to be buying apps and music and videos through Android.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.840]   Although I do know that going back to a year and a half, two years ago, there was a lot
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:44.680]   of priority inside Google of saying, look, we tried this idea.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.880]   We're just going to give away this for free and we're going to let people do whatever
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.880]   they want with it.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.600]   That's not working out for us because there's a lot of people who are doing terrible, terrible
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.600]   software.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.440]   There's no consistency from experience to experience.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.920]   We're putting out wonderful stuff that nobody is using because they don't think it's important
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.920]   to use it.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:03.160]   I know that there was an active movement to say, we're going to have to take a little
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.640]   bit of control back.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.840]   Part of it was doing the first set of really comprehensive user interface guidelines to
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:13.640]   teach developers that this is what an Android app is supposed to look like.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:17.640]   Which, by the way, we're just completely ignored by almost everybody.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:25.160]   Well, I think that's kind of true across the board because things are moving away from...
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:30.200]   I can't remember the last time that I tried a new iOS app and it really stuck to the classic
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.680]   interface that I expect with iOS.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.400]   Which is a big problem because you don't know how to use any of these apps.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.400]   Everything's different.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:40.400]   Well, but maybe not because remember that the classic iOS interface is here is a list
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.680]   of things you can drill down until you get to the content that you want.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.720]   You can have a couple of bars that have buttons with the tools that you want.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:51.600]   I'm kind of glad to see developers breaking free of that and saying, this is a tiny screen.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.560]   It's not always going to be the Apple solution, it's not always going to be the best solution
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.360]   for the sort of task the user is going to be at right now.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.880]   So we're going to sort of break out of there.
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:04.280]   And also now that Android is...
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.320]   Now that the tools are there for developers to create great Android apps and the users
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:11.040]   are there, the money's not there yet, but the users are there for Android users, there
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.960]   is more of an idea that if we're going to be putting lots of money into this app, we're
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:19.200]   going to have to think across platform and make sure that if we develop an app that we'd
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.760]   rather than create two separate teams with two separate interfaces, we create one sort
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.240]   of agnostic interface that works great for whatever device you want to place the plaster
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.240]   this on.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.160]   What's interesting is that I think Android has become like the new embedded operating
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:36.280]   system and it's true what Andy's saying, but we interviewed pocket casts last night
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.960]   and they famously just made pocket casts first for Android instead of doing it for iOS.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.360]   And it's the same story when you talk to someone like Sebastian Dewitt who does double twist
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.960]   is that it's still...
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:49.600]   You have to really care and you have to work really hard to make a good looking app on
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.600]   Android.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:55.520]   You have to do the more 1x, 1.5x, 2x, the next is 7 is 1.33x.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.440]   Google says ignore it.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.720]   Google says please don't make TV DPI apps.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.720]   Just use fragments.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.440]   So it's not as complicated, but I think it's telling that really good designers are starting
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.080]   to put in the effort to do it.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.080]   But they do have to put in the effort and that's the point.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.400]   We're going to take a break, come back.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.800]   I didn't mean to turn this in the Samsung show.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.720]   We've got Apple news to promise you.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.000]   You know we're going to do a thing on know-how.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.560]   I propose this to I as any said okay because I have the most recent Mac Pro which is mid
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:28.560]   2010.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:33.680]   It's almost three years old now and I've given up on any update to that.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:38.440]   So I'm looking at what you can do to update it and there's not a whole lot, but I'm going
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:42.680]   to put a fusion drive on it or well now we'll talk about it because you say don't do that.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.520]   Anyway I'll show you what I bought and you tell me.
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:49.320]   And I would love input from the chat room because it looks like nobody's selling Mac
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.760]   sales isn't other world computing better video cards this thing.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:57.680]   They're selling the same video cards Apple sold two and a half years ago.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.680]   Depressing depressing.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.040]   I'll pass through.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:07.240]   And I got a Thunderbolt display and there's no way to use it.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.240]   Yup.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.080]   Come on Apple please.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:18.080]   There were a lot to do.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.080]   I'm going to cry.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.880]   Don't make me cry.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:26.080]   Show brought you today by legal zoom.com.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:32.440]   I am I'll tell you what legal zoom took a lot of the pain out of forming an LLC for me.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.600]   And I this is a great company to it's not a law firm understand.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:41.680]   You know white shoe lawyer to write up the paperwork for me, but I tell you this is the
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:42.680]   way to do it.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:48.480]   There's a lot of legal documents you can do yourself with the right you know Q&A and
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.200]   that's what legal zoom does.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.680]   Incorporate your business or form an LLC either one.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:32:00.800]   You know you could be a ink or a look starting at ninety nine dollars.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.760]   Really makes you a big difference forming your business the right way.
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.040]   Not merely to protect yourself and your liability but also for tax reasons and so forth.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.560]   They can also do trademarks if you're a blogger or you've got a you know an Instagram brand.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.840]   You might really want to think about protecting your brand.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:18.080]   You know it's funny both of us have been slowly growing up together.
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:22.520]   You know two different companies and you know you get to a certain point where you wish
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.360]   you had paper paper to everything up.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.120]   You know like you know and it's one of those things.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.120]   It's kind of hard to do it after the fact.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.240]   It's hard because when you're small you know you're thinking five hundred dollars an hour
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.320]   three hundred dollars an hour and I don't have time to do that but it does definitely
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.720]   make sense to look at what you can do.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.880]   I just want to I can highly endorse this.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.400]   I really can.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:47.120]   They also do copyrights, NDAs, patents and for your family if you don't have a will the
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:52.760]   government and the courts decide what happens to your assets and your kids sixty nine dollars
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.360]   to do a legal zoom will.
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:59.320]   And this is a I mean it's not this is a real will that has you know absolutely legally
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.320]   binding will.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.320]   You could do a living trust there.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:07.120]   Twelve years legal zoom's been doing this over two million Americans have used them for
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:11.320]   LLCs, wills, trusts and trademarks many other things.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:14.680]   They have a very simple actually it's really a lot easier even now than it was when I did
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.680]   it.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.240]   I did it in 2005 almost it's eight years ago.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.240]   Wow.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.200]   Step by step questionnaire boom boom boom and this is something else that I really like
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.880]   that they've added since I used it.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.680]   There you know there comes a point sometimes in these questioners we go I don't know.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:35.040]   The one for me was well should I incorporate in California or Delaware and I and I went
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:38.960]   on the internet and I'm looking and I don't I didn't know would have been great if I could
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.120]   have called a lawyer and said just this one question but now legal zoom is set up this
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:47.760]   legal zoom legal plan where they have pre negotiated fees very affordable get your questions

[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.200]   So it's interesting that we have just spent half an hour talking about Samsung because
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.640]   that's really what the obviously they were completely ineffective with their presentation.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:52.040]   Yeah we talked a little bit about how stupid it was but you know they did so some very
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:35:00.000]   interesting conversations around this in fact you've got one yourself Renee Apple losing
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:10.840]   the war of words asks John Louis Gessay Apple seeds the crown mocks John Gruber and Apple
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:19.480]   bites man and writes Renee Richie Renee you know you state it perfectly clearly what
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.600]   is the issue.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:28.120]   For me it's a twofold issue it's that there's this old journalism cliche that after a while
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:32.240]   dog bites man becomes boring so you write man bites dog and all of a sudden that's a
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:37.280]   very popular line you sell it and you sell lots of papers and the thing with Apple is
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:42.040]   that while they're unpredictable they do tend to follow patterns and so this year everyone's
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:46.000]   just assuming there'll be an iPhone 5s and you know basically you fill in the blanks in
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.640]   your mind better camera better ZPU right and that story is not that interesting and there's
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:55.760]   been so many stories for so long about how successful Apple is that's not that interesting
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:01.560]   either so you start to reverse that dynamic and competitors have been very smart going
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:06.360]   back to the HTC Nexus one they learned when Apple would launch their products usually between
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:11.440]   July and September and so now we have the HTC one in the spring we have the Z10 in the
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:15.880]   spring we have the Galaxy S4 in the spring and part of the reason we just spent 30 minutes
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:20.480]   talking about it is because there's no Apple event nowhere near us the old iPhones six months
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:25.880]   old the next iPhones three to six months away it's the perfect time for competitors to make
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:32.000]   these stories and to sell papers to get page views it's the perfect time to start Apple
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.400]   is doomed headlines because people are interested in that they'll click on that and it becomes
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:41.800]   almost like a self-fulfilling machine so really it's a flaw in in in the press although you
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:46.520]   said an interesting thing Apple is unpredictable but in fact it hasn't been in the last couple
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:52.280]   of years I saw very I've seen a lot of noise lately from Apple partisan people like MGC
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:56.680]   Gee Seagler and Gene Munster like they were on a panel and I saw another analyst say the
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:02.720]   same thing Apple's gonna do something exciting and wacky almost almost you know they don't
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.360]   know no one knows but almost as almost wishful thinking well I think that this is this is
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:13.560]   what you lose when you don't have such a singular leader like Steve Jobs that is you know the
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:17.120]   distortion field the people would talk about a lot but the point is I don't think I was
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:21.880]   moving much much lower than they ever moved I think that the real issue is is that they
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.360]   don't have someone that everyone is paying attention to every word he says and how he
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:29.240]   says it and everything else they don't I mean and there's nothing wrong with Tim Cook is
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:33.520]   just that he's not that and I think I'm a pedestrian yeah I mean you know what I mean
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.440]   the issue is the new this was a problem I would guarantee you jobs is thinking all that was
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.640]   thinking all the time and we're gonna lose we're gonna lose the light we're gonna lose
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.920]   the press let's keep this interesting let's keep the story let's manage the story he was
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:51.000]   brilliant at managing the story from everything from you know personal massages for Walt Mossberg
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.480]   I mean he was brilliant at managing the same show right last week right yeah and
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:59.080]   Schiller's not brilliant in fact Schiller put his foot in his mouth right and so I think
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:04.360]   that that's the issue is that they had such a brilliant leader and such a brilliant communicator
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:09.880]   that they were able to you know keep that that you know keep control of the press you know
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:17.080]   I mean like you know in a lot of ways and now they don't have any of that singular attention
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:22.040]   that and I think it makes it very hard for them to you know to manage the conversation
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.400]   isn't that interesting because all the things we've been talking about is what happens without
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:30.480]   the genius of jobs the product but really I've always thought this jobs was a brilliant
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:37.800]   marketer first and foremost with good taste like you know what's not everything he made
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:42.120]   was huge and wonderful and successful absolutely I still have a cube Johnny I've has a good taste
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:46.640]   Johnny I've has good taste and Steve was smart enough to hire him but ultimately what jobs
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:51.280]   was brilliant at and it from day one when he took Steve Wozniak's funky little wooden
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:58.520]   computer and got you know an injection molded box for it to make it look cool was marketing
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.280]   positioning right you know telling us don't and Apple did change it up they put out the
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.920]   iPad for it in fall which no one was expecting and now there's rumors that there might be
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.680]   additional iPhone not enough to use so no not yet not enough yeah well but part of the
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:17.560]   problem I think is that Apple has had such a regular drum date of completely new and
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:22.000]   very very easy to understand new features to existing products where you come up with
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.360]   they've come out with they've come out with traditional laptops now here's the MacBook
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.760]   here something completely different haven't seen before here's the phone you've never
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:34.880]   seen before here is a tablet you've never ever seen before and here is a twist on the
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:40.720]   desktop PC to make it slimmer and cooler and nicer and you never see that before I think
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.840]   I think that they're sort of running into the same problem that a lot of the traditional
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:50.200]   manufacturers are having which is that once you have a laptop and you can do very little
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:54.760]   to it at this point but put in a better processor make the screen a little bit bigger and affect
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:59.360]   the styling a little bit it's hard to make the next thing you do look as significant as
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:06.080]   the amount of effort that you put into it so I'm not sure if the press really has it in
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:11.600]   for Apple that much so much as they're looking for the next story and they're not and they're
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:15.240]   finding it as a traditional tech story and there are people who are definitely want to
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:20.480]   see Apple die there people who definitely want to see who want the want who is so hungry
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:25.360]   this is incredible they're so hungry to have the next oh here's the next miraculous device
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:30.520]   the galaxy S4 got the front page of the New York Post there you go not a little not a
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:35.960]   little box in the corner I'm talking about the entire page was a color photo of the of
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:42.640]   the S4 with eight inch high letters like man walks on moon size is calling it iPhone
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:48.280]   EY phone Merrick miraculous new phone you control just by looking at it well and there
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:53.360]   that's now you know by the way who that event was aimed at it was a New York Post yes no
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:58.240]   seriously and it's kind of somewhat down market readership it that's and it was successful
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:02.440]   they got the front page that's the millions of dollars they spent on that event are justified
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:06.800]   right there yep yep and the millions I mean one of the most viewed I mean I think it was
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.120]   I don't know what the number half a million people watched live right not some that's
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:15.920]   a real people that in tech journalists Phil Schiller says Android so he he went out oh
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:21.040]   Phil Phil Phil he went out and did interviews on the eve of the S4 announcement he called
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:26.360]   Android a free replacement for a feature phone and then really this is to the Wall Street
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:30.960]   Journal and then really put his foot in his mouth by saying the S4 is going to have a
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:37.920]   year old operating system wrong in fact it has the latest version of Android did he hurt
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:43.440]   his credibility by saying that I don't know if he hurt his credibility but I think that
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:49.840]   it's sort of in some intangible way diminishes the prestige of Apple when they start talking
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:55.040]   that way about other people's products it's not as though it's it's unprecedented for Apple
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.840]   and certainly not unprecedented for other companies to do but this is not the this is
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:03.400]   not what you what you commonly associate with the company that owns the entire market
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:09.000]   excuse me it owns the crown of where the we're the coolest most successful most innovative
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:15.120]   company the smart thing would be to use other channels to get that message out and not really
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:19.360]   stick your neck out quite that far I mean there is a there's a little bit of the spiro
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:24.080]   T agnew of Apple now you know how the vice president so is the attack dog yeah I mean
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:27.600]   there there there's ways to get that message out that a little that are a little bit more
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:32.400]   subtle and again doesn't really put the Apple logo quite so big on that statement but the
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:36.480]   other thing is that the thing that maybe surprised me a little bit more was that they now redid
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:42.440]   the Apple excuse me the iPhone product side to be very much here's here is why the iPhone
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:47.160]   is still great here's why it's still relevant and although it's it's perfectly true that
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:51.200]   I think they had four or five points three or four which were absolutely on the mark one
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:57.560]   was kind of questionable but but it's a it's a finer point it's I can't help I couldn't
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:02.120]   help but going through all my memories of all the ways that big companies to advertise
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:07.000]   it really looked like the sort of ads that like IBM used to take out when they started
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.440]   being challenged by the Macintosh when they started being challenged by like clone makers
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:15.600]   where they now we feel as though we have to put our case to the users that when you buy
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:20.160]   into IBM you're buying into the quality product you're buying into the network or support that
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:24.720]   doesn't exist anywhere else you're buying into the premium engineering that goes back for decades
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:30.320]   instead of some PC that just got taken off of some sort of boat from from from China or
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:36.000]   so other country and I can't say there's necessarily anything bad about it but it's not something
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:42.400]   I'm used to seeing coming out of Apple I mean one I think that for all this remember that
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:45.360]   this is the company that also did the high high of a piece right I was gonna say that
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:50.720]   didn't feel defensive that was offensive this is defensive right if look at this this is
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:56.480]   iPhone 5 loving it is easy that's why so many people do and then they step through you know
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:02.080]   all the thinner lighter design why you love an iPhone by the way all new design a year old
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:06.960]   all new design why you love the iPhone Leo that's where you have all the good stuff oh where where
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:11.120]   is that so the first one why this that go down a little bit why iPhone that one good
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:15.920]   out no yeah why iPhone why iPhone there's an iPhone then there's everything else what makes like
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:22.160]   JD power and associate 10 8 straight awards for customer satisfaction every day this is a
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.720]   good selling point they're really focusing on the hardware which does look superior to the
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:32.320]   plasticy Samsung phones although the HTC one looks just like this the HTC one looks phenomenal
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:38.560]   yeah retina display that's a mistake to point that out since they are now being beaten in DPI
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:42.080]   but almost everybody including HTC they have in cell but they don't make it clear they're
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:48.560]   talking about the technology and not the resolution in the yeah add yeah great battery life that's
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:54.240]   a point although the Samsung 4 is a removable battery which kind of obviates that issue I would
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:58.480]   say you get comparable battery life and then you can put a new battery in which you can't do
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:05.280]   powerful but not power hungry a six chip ultra-fast wireless and LTE again all of these things
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:09.920]   don't seem to be unique this is the one if you ask me is the camera
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:15.680]   what's interesting is that Apple will have me to Andy's point Apple does do this I mean
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:20.960]   Tim Cook and Steve Jobs all the time took shots at Android the lack of tablet apps
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:25.440]   the poor quality of their device is the lack of integration they have the you know buy a Mac
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:31.040]   campaign but to me the difference here is that in in mobile in PC industry they were always an
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:35.520]   underdog but in mobile they've never been the market share leader there was Nokia and Blackberry
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:39.280]   when they started and now there's Android but they've always been the mind share leader and they've
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.120]   always been the profit what least for a while they've been a profit share leader and Samsung is the
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:47.360]   first company that's threatening their mind share and their profit share and it looks to me like
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:52.720]   they're going back to the playbook that they used for they get a Mac and the little snarky comments
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:56.960]   that they would put in the keynotes and that's sort of what's driving these new pages but the
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.840]   the difference is that remember when when jobs and cooks and the rest cook when the rest would
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:06.800]   make those comments it was within a context where someone was asking them their opinion
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:13.600]   whereas shiller's comments seemed like okay we know that the the the subtext seem to be we know
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.760]   that's our competitor is going to be getting a lot of press today we want to make sure that we
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:22.960]   have the statement out that right exactly we what we want to be part of that scrum of conversation
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:28.960]   too whereas again it's so like it's a point at which the the king has to stay on the throne
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:35.920]   to have that same sort of regal authority when he jumps down from the throne to throttle the
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:41.600]   the fool with his bare hands he appears to be less of a king yeah very good nice analogy
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.880]   john kritian did that by the way we have we have a prime minister actually did that
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:49.520]   he throttled the jester i love uh john groover's obviously baseball fan he says
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:56.400]   phil shiller committed a unfor an unforced error uh by mentioning the fact incorrectly that the uh
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:59.680]   escrow it is an interesting point though though because by his time this phone ships there might
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:03.600]   be google i know there might be a new version of there will be given how much sam slong is paved
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:08.800]   over android to make this phone the likelihood of a speedy update for the next generation is nil
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:13.200]   but i don't think consumers care anymore no that i mean it's always been a selling point for apple
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:18.320]   but you're right i don't think now by the way they buried uh to me the things that you
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:26.960]   you want an iphone five four way down below starting with the camera then the apps then um uh
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:32.480]   theory um and and these are things that are real different differentiators i'm not sure i'd
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:38.000]   mention i cloud if i were apple but that's i like google now but if you use not my iphone all the
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.520]   apps they use all the time there are absolutely no equivalence yet because they're all made by
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:46.400]   small right independent developers like the the tweet box and the launch centers i wouldn't hold
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:50.480]   on to that too long because that's that's that that's gonna shift in mind here's the here's the
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:55.040]   here's the only my only argument against the fact that i still think developers for a long time are
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:48:00.000]   gonna be developing for the ios first um and the reason is is that i think there's a purely it's
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.080]   not purely financial a financial no no it is a small calculation someone i used to develop
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:08.000]   small developers are gonna like ios first always and that's where the most creative and interesting
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.640]   apps come from a big and we've got five million dollars in backing we're starting with staff of
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:18.160]   20 it's the two guys who have a really or i'm sorry two gendered neutral program
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.920]   who just have a great idea and they're building it for their own and halfway through it's they
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:26.240]   realize that wait a minute we've got something here and that witness real awesome stuff jessica
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:31.760]   will arrive on and which witness jessica lessons uh peace in the wall street journal in praise of
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:35.680]   loren britter the high priest of app design of course loren will not develop for and ready
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:40.000]   says specifically well and the thing is is that is that when you um when you make a decision as a
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.400]   developer so we we didn't use to develop for windows and and mac this is not the same but in
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:49.280]   in a lot of ways we stopped developing for windows because um it was more higher level of support
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:55.280]   harder to develop and uh in the and we had nitpick all the time we bought it nitpick is a lot more
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:00.640]   than on the mac side and so um and so we just decided you know and we looked at you didn't like
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:05.680]   the users is well here's the thing is that it was that is cold man it was like it was just like
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:11.760]   there were a thousand little things that you know it it really just it it drowned us every time a
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:15.520]   windows user the amount of time that we had to spend supporting them was so much higher than a mac
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:21.040]   and and you know it was just it just really we just decided it wasn't worth it and so the the
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:26.880]   issue that i bring to the android issue is that is that you know not all users are created equal
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:32.160]   and i don't mean this to say that mac users are better but they are but but iPhone users are people
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:36.640]   who they just wanted to work they're willing to pay for a little extra for it to work and that's a
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:41.680]   very valuable consumer you know is is that they that when it works that you know they're not they're
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:44.960]   not trying to hack it they're not trying i mean there are people to try to hack it but i'm saying
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.800]   is the average you know consumer is not trying to hack it they're not trying to push the you know
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:52.560]   the envelope at every moment of what the hardware can do they just want it to work and and they'll
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:55.440]   and they'll pay a little extra and they don't want everything for free and they don't want everything
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:50:00.160]   you know it'd be an old-fashioned point of view i i mean it's the same as you when it's in in the
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:03.600]   old days that might have been true but do you think that's really true now i think i just think
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:08.480]   that it's a different personality still i think that i i um i don't know the people that i know that have
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:13.600]   android phones tend to be the geekier or the ones that are that bought it cheaper cheaper it's not
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:16.800]   the middle of the road and that you know that it just that you know that it just kind of uses
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.720]   as a device and Andy the guys i shifted jelly we asked them this yesterday and they said that
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:24.800]   it's overall true but you can specifically target something for example they saw a
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:29.200]   a posity of podcast apps on android because google listen went away and there were no good ones
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:33.680]   and the people who are interested in podcasts are willing to spend money for a good podcast app
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:37.360]   so they specifically targeted and they think that there's several opportunities like that
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:40.480]   but when you look at ios and you look at like fantastical or like i said it was launched
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:45.680]   center pro there's a lot of areas like that and a lot of small developers who come from a design
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:49.920]   and mac background one of the biggest advantages apple had is that they had an existing platform
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:55.040]   that was beloved by really good independent developers and designers and those people
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:59.600]   just want to make apps for the phones that they use and they mostly still use iPhones that's a
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:04.400]   huge advantage britter says he stilled and this is a lesson writing in the wall street journal he
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:08.880]   still doesn't release apps for google's android operating system because he thinks the hardware
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:12.960]   and software aren't as good as apples there may be that's politically correct you don't want to
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:17.680]   say in public and their users suck only alexes will not say that i'm not saying the users are
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.880]   stuck because the thing is is that just different a different kind of user i mean the thing is is
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.840]   that is that they have users that you know you have users that really want to push it and they're
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:27.520]   upset when it's a closed environment and they're and they're just a different it's just a different
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:32.800]   personality that's all it's it's also there's it's it covers it covers so such a broad spectrum
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:37.600]   is so they're so hard to pin down there are people who want a little bit more flexibility a little bit
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:42.720]   more control but then there are those people who absolutely don't care in which they feel as though
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:50.240]   a your basic smartphone that you can get at the store no matter who makes it is like a really
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:58.080]   good uh call it a 16 ounce steak whereas the iphone is a 64 ounce really good steak
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:01.600]   meaning that that's still that's there's more there than they can really they really care about
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:05.040]   or really want to eat and so they're not going to appreciate the finer points of it that doesn't
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:09.200]   mean they're stupid it means that i'm here to take this out of my pocket to put something on
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:13.840]   facebook take a picture of whatever and then put it back my pocket and go away i'm never going to
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:18.080]   be so involved with this phone that i'm going to appreciate how much easier ios is to use how
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:23.680]   much more reliable it is how much coherent it is from app to app app and those people are more
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:27.040]   more pressed to think i would rather have something that's a little bit smaller i'd much rather
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:30.560]   have something that's a little bit bigger i'd much rather have something that has an actual physical
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:37.120]   keypad or or a flip out keyboard or or internationally i just want to save 75 dollars on this phone i
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:41.520]   don't i don't see that i'll get 75 dollars more worth of value out of an iphone versus an android
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:45.280]   phone so it's so hard to pin these people down that's why it's so hard to say that
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:49.520]   oh well the reason why that apple is selling out selling android in this market is because of
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:54.080]   this the reason why android is out selling apple this market is because of this it's just so random
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.840]   and i think i know the iphone or five s will be called the ribeye phone right that's actually
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:03.600]   exactly you know that i mean uh the um uh but i think that that when you look at the profit
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:07.040]   you know that apple's making versus sam sign which i think is now in you know three
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.480]   approaching you know two and a half x um i think that that points again to the type of
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:18.640]   consumer that that apple is pulling in and i think that that also informs the developers
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:22.640]   you know like of of who's spending money where and who's willing to spend that extra margin
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:27.120]   and i think that like you know we look at because we're looking at developing some apps right now
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:32.480]   we don't i mean we we definitely look at we would we would develop them for the ios and if they're
[00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:36.400]   if they're successful then we'll port them over but i i you know we're not or we do you know
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:41.520]   well i think i think it's fine really it there's there's something to be learned about what causes
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:46.080]   that person to buy that the an android phone instead of the iphone because i would have thought
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:49.360]   that it's about the app library or would have thought it's about what they expect to get out
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:54.480]   of the phone but surprise the heck out of me was um at the comixology uh had a uh
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:54:01.520]   a panel event at the eurokomicon and i asked the ceo the ceo's and executives like they would not
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:07.280]   they wouldn't break out what kind of what what how what how what their usership is by percentage
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:13.440]   by platform but they did say the interesting tidbit that uh the android market is just
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:18.720]   disproportionately larger than their iphone market in terms of the number of people who download
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:25.520]   that version of this comixology software but even though the iphone the ios market is so much smaller
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:30.800]   they they purchase a disproportionately larger amount of comics i don't know whether that's
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:35.360]   because so many of these devices are actually the ipads which are much better uh as a uh as a
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:40.400]   comic book reader but i i think that was sort of an indication that there is something about the
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:46.560]   decision to buy an iphone is matched with a decision to keep purchasing content for it so
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:51.600]   i wonder if nowadays people don't even make the decision to buy an iphone is just like well i'm
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:56.720]   an iphone person i just buy iphones i don't do you think people um how many people are really
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:02.800]   consciously going hmm they go to the store or the atent store or whatever and go hmm i phone or
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:07.440]   android i think you identify you self identify same as you did with american right anymore do they
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:10.720]   know android or they just want the samsung phone or the free phone yeah maybe maybe they don't even
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:15.120]   think android or i think that if you've got an iphone you've got to have an exquisite reason to
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:17.920]   switch away from it because the benefits of sticking with the decision you already have
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:22.320]   are just so you know it you've spent money on the apps or big deal i mean i i have i have
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:26.400]   no it i have like 500 apps or something so so the thing is that it's like being a democrat or
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:32.880]   republican people don't kind of randomly change they have to be convinced and i think at this point
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:37.600]   people have have to you know separate it into the two camps the thing is and we i think we pointed
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:41.840]   out this out last week there's a huge number of people who don't have smartphones like 45 percent
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:46.880]   of the market has not even gotten purchase a smartphone yet and that i would guess is the app is the
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:51.840]   is the market that samsung's going after with fifties housewives and and uh wet nail polish
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:56.720]   lower cost devices i like the rib iphone i think it would be really
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:00.240]   there's been saying the same thing that andy's been saying for a while about the different kinds
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:05.200]   of customers and he gets heat for it sometimes but i think he makes his case well not only in that
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:10.160]   article but in another recent article where there are people who are drawn to apples products who
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:15.280]   will spend in a way that is enticing to certain companies to support that was always the case
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:22.080]   with mac and tosh as well was you know the mac owners don't pirate as much they buy software
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:25.680]   they're a little more committed and they're also quality much pick here about the interface
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:30.480]   yeah but they don't call you apparently i will say no no well it wasn't the pc
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:34.560]   they don't like you no it would just be like i'm trying to fit this this they'd have some
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:38.640]   basic real machine they just have some wonky built machine that they couldn't get our software
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:42.240]   around and we were just like just go out and get a that is a good point because the mac and
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:45.920]   one of them is very homogeneous the thing is is it was like you know with a mac it was like six
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.200]   different ways that they could have had a configured with a pc it was yeah but go ahead and try
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:54.720]   and find an up-to-date video card for your mac pro i think it's excuse me i mean i'm a firm believer
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:59.120]   i mean my preference would be to add for all i want apple to do i mean so i don't i don't need apple
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:04.560]   to do a mac pro anymore i just want them to take away the you've given up the chip just stop looking
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:08.880]   for the whatever it is the efi chip or whatever it is and just let people just hackintosh yeah
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:13.040]   i'm having to hack it i'm so into i'm so tempted to hackintosh at this point because i just this
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:18.000]   machine is not powerful right they want you to buy an iMac leo and use the mac pro as a peripheral
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.080]   network attached i bought the iMac i mean i've already done that part yeah uh we're gonna take a
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:26.560]   break come back google now for ios perhaps maybe google even says hey i we'd rather develop for the
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:32.880]   ios platform who knows i don't know even google says yeah i know it's a better platform actually i
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:37.360]   think that is true there there are definitely people within google who carry i phones who want
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:41.600]   to develop for iphone who have no interest and i would say many of the google apps look much better
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:46.080]   on iphone than they do on a handride ios is a better sdk in a better set of frameworks than
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:51.680]   an androids and these developers would prefer to use it yeah um and if if you work at apple stores
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:56.480]   in france you might prefer to work there because you're not allowed to work late did you see that
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:02.080]   i saw that the government of france has banned apple from forcing employees to do those overnight
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:04.800]   shifts and late shifts if they don't want it wasn't overnight shifts they were late shifts
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:08.000]   late we can't work until 11 it's well that is due to our time
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:14.640]   stars are closed they're also no longer required to set down their glass of red wine
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:25.120]   uh right our show today brought to you by our friends at audible.com

[01:02:52.640 --> 01:03:00.800]   much for their support of mac break weekly do you think google will do google now or is that just a
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:07.200]   hoax video there was a video posted of google now for ios google now is perhaps the single most
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:12.320]   interesting thing on android it's fantastic yeah which makes me wonder why they would consider
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:17.360]   what do you give me in a way is uh no longer an advantage so i don't i don't know if they could
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:21.760]   technically do it on ios i don't think they'd have this anywhere near the system access i mean they
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.200]   could pull location they could pull a lot of stuff but what makes google now so interesting
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:30.160]   is a way that is integrated into android and the app store just doesn't i mean that's that's a
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.120]   problem for apple too it's a different it's a strange problem because syria doesn't work
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:38.800]   anywhere near as well as google now but apple doesn't own syria really they use nuance boxes
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:43.680]   and nuance is very anyone who knows anything about nuance knows that they're a very controlled
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:48.160]   company and app trust can't do local they can't do local voice the way google does they can't do
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:52.160]   a lot of the features that make google now so great is that why syria the app was more capable
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:59.440]   than syria by apple uh i i i i i i did all sorts of stuffs they've signed a lot more partnerships and
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:04.080]   apple has apple hasn't resigned a lot of the original syria part like open table and yeah
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:09.040]   but i i think also still i mean there's there it's syria sitting on nuance boxes it's not
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.440]   unless apple controls their own syria destiny i think we'll they'll be behind google now for a while
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:18.320]   they got to get going because that's uh i'm not even sure if it's a question of being behind they're
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:23.600]   just two very different services where i i guess i got to say that syria is one of the things that
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:28.960]   really miss uh about uh about my iphone because it really is there to be the person the the
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:32.480]   assistant in the next room that when you ask it to do something it will do it for you and figure
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:37.920]   out exactly what you want it to do google now is more like the assistant who when you take your
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:41.920]   jacket off of the chair you find that the tickets to the concert you're going to tonight are already
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:46.240]   in your pocket yeah you know it's it's they're they're both really really powerful both really
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:51.440]   really wonderful in their own ways but they don't really intersect i think a lot i think the only
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:55.600]   thing i meant by that was that like syria's absolutely it's a pixel character my little five
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.840]   year old godson was texting me today using syria because to him it's his friend he's like yeah
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:04.560]   you know text my godfather say this but google now can for example if i want to change a calendar
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:09.600]   setting or an alarm setting something local to my phone my iphone or ipad i still have to go to the
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:14.880]   network which creates a point of failure where google has put a lot of the voice recognition local
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:21.040]   on the the device and apple as far as i know can't do that i mean nuance bot vylingo they're basically
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:25.520]   the only name in this kind of technology now google very smartly hired somebody who made a
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:30.800]   lot of the key patents in this technology so they can walk around the guy who founded nuance in fact
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:36.560]   yeah and apple doesn't have that privilege and that's unusual for apple apple often suffers the
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:40.960]   most when they people make fun of apple for be controlled for being controlling but like atnt
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:45.760]   or ups deliveries or nuance boxes they get in a lot of trouble for the things that they don't control
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:53.120]   right weave is going to jail uh this is the guy we remember we talked about this the ipad security
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:06:00.080]   flaw and uh now this is what he did and and i'm wondering if 41 months in jail is is the right
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:12.880]   sentence for this guy um he uh figured out that you could query um the apple uh servers and get
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:18.320]   let's see how does this work um it was it it was it actually a flaw in atnt's ipad database
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:26.560]   so uh when you entered into the web panel an iccidd the number that authenticates the sim card
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:31.600]   um it would give you if you entered the right number it would give you email addresses
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:38.640]   so he wrote a script that just would query atnt's website with these id's and collected hundreds of
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:45.200]   thousands of addresses uh they apparently according to the court records chatted
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:52.480]   about using this script for a phishing operation or lols but then they decided to give the information
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:07:00.080]   uh to gocker uh and that database was revealed the hole was fixed by atnt he was prosecuted
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:04.320]   aggressively by the feds they've lately taken these computer crime lately they've always taken
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:09.360]   these computer crimes very seriously perhaps more seriously than they take real world crimes that's
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:14.640]   one of the arguments people make um and was found guilty on one count of identity fraud one count
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:20.720]   of conspiracy to access a computer without authorization and he has been ordered to pay
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:24.240]   seventy three thousand dollars in restitution along with his co-defendant daniel spittler
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:29.040]   uh and they're he's going to jail for 41 months
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:37.920]   um as a son of a lawyer i'm just going to say that i think his number one issue is hubris you do
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:43.840]   the crime you got no no no no hubris well he did already get his books he looked at the day before
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:48.160]   if you look at the quotes if you look at the quotes i'm just telling you that i can't even
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:52.480]   imagine what his deposition sounded like you know and the thing is is that you have to understand
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:57.120]   don't be too bad there's a lot of people who uh you know end up doing a lot more time than they
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:02.400]   need to because they just can't keep their mouth shut yeah i don't think i always tell
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:06.000]   me to keep my mouth shut you're right absolutely you know you wish but when you're in a court case
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.320]   you just have to understand that that you know being arrogant at that point is not usually your
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:15.040]   best bet in january he told the verge he wanted to get the maximum sentence possible and there he
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.760]   got it so the people would rise up and storm the decks he probably won't anybody rising up that's
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:28.720]   the issue hubris hubris um he uh he did an a m a the day before sentencing and uh in the sentencing
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:36.320]   hearing the prosecution quoted as a m a right as i am from uh read it three times in their
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:42.480]   justification for sentencing oh well i mean i just think that i think i don't think this is
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:47.120]   necessarily but you got to acknowledge the fact that the feds are absolutely hardass on this stuff
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:51.600]   i think that cyber security is something that keeps everybody in washington dc up at night i mean
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:55.760]   the amount of damage that can be done right now yeah defacing a website which is not i would argue
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:00.960]   much worse than defacing the front of a building is getting ten times the sense i i don't agree
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:04.720]   with the sentencing i think that everyone's worried about it but i think that the length of his sentence
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:09.280]   has much less to do with what he did and more have to do with all the stuff he did between the time
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:14.320]   he was arrested and the time he was sentenced there's just a long string of you shouldn't really shouldn't
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:19.600]   do that yeah but you also you also have to think about exactly how he executed this there's
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:25.120]   there's ways to prove that this idea that you have works and then once you've said okay i've
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:29.920]   demonstrated that this works now if i try to harvest hundreds of thousands of email addresses
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.520]   this is a totally separate thing these ten email addresses that i have right now
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.520]   prove that this at this thing works that would have been sufficient wouldn't have yeah i mean this
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:42.640]   it's it's the same reason why there are times when i have to i feel as i feel as though i have a
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:48.800]   responsibility to test certain paralegal so shall we say software mostly for like acquiring you know
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:55.120]   movies and stuff like that uh but it's like i've tested the software i've downloaded one one
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:00.000]   ancient episode of something that i think is about 30 years old anyway i've proven how easy it is to
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.960]   get this i've proven how well the software works now if i try to get all every episode of Game of
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:09.600]   Thrones i'm just doing it because i want free Game of Thrones not because i need to prove anything
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:13.360]   right and the thing is is that you know when you get pulled over for speeding if you start yelling
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:17.680]   at the cop it's going to get a lot worse than it was just pulling over for speeding and i think
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:22.720]   i've learned that i thank the officer i said i appreciate that i realized i was not driving
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:27.040]   perfectly and thank you sir for saving my life once you're in that spin and he said okay move on
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:30.800]   i think he knew who i was you know my license place is twit tv i gave him the license he didn't
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:36.400]   look at it right he was looking at me so i think he i think he was a fan that's happened before i
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.720]   been pulled over the cops before we're fans scared the hell out of me right that is a
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:46.160]   you kind of forget that law enforcement are actual like real human normal humans like
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:51.600]   yeah because there was two things that are i'm gonna say because they're very very useful where
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.440]   i was at some sort of some sort of a wedding or something where someone they found out that the
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:59.440]   person at our one person our table is a state trooper of course someone asks not me well how do
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:04.160]   i get out of a speeding ticket haha and he said let me be honest with you if when i flash my lights
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:08.240]   you pull them over immediately to a safe part of the of the highway i did that roll down your
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:12.560]   driver's side window you put your right hand your left hand right here in the middle yeah put your
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:17.360]   other hand right on the top of the steering wheel that as i'm walking towards you i see both of your
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:20.960]   hands that you don't have a gun in either one of them this leaves me in a very very positive
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:26.240]   frame of mind to listen to what i do exactly that i i roll down the window i put my license
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:29.440]   out the window put my hand on the way i did exactly that because you know what i feel for these guys
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.440]   that's gonna be a terrifying thing for them you don't know what you're gonna see some clown in a
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.960]   red must have been the phrase been around all but i mean you know you got to remember the 30
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:41.280]   percent of all police officers killed in the line of duty are routine traffic so they are
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:46.720]   exactly they are the phrase that's the phrase that stuck with me all these years was i i i will
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:52.800]   be rest assured that you're not willing to kill me and make my children orphans and my and my wife
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:57.760]   a widow because you for you skipped out on a fifty dollar right payment you don't want to go back
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:01.360]   to jail for 30 days but then and to get back to this case i have deep respect for these guys they
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:05.200]   weren't hard and i was very actually was grateful because apparently i've been going over the shoulder
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:09.840]   a little bit and i was grateful that he pulled me over i drove very carefully after that and just
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:15.920]   to bring it back to the story i mean i i think that the uh that the issue is is that once you know he
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:20.560]   really just did not i don't know if he didn't think he was gonna get it or he really did want to be
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:24.880]   a martyr and and get this he really taught to people he wanted to go to jail when you when you
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:30.000]   say i want the maximum sentence let's talk to our lawyers remember that you know i think four years
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.480]   and see how he feels about that i remember kevin mittnick with a stack of tuna cans
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:39.440]   because that was all he would eat in prison because the food was so god awful right and uh you know if
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.800]   you're a hacker in fact i tried to get uh this phobia the god guy who was hacking matt hone and
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:48.880]   now turns out might have been hacking brian cribs uh to talk to kevin mittnick and mittick said no i'm
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:54.160]   not gonna talk to him because i i i kind of on i'm probation right now wouldn't be a good idea for me
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:58.480]   to talk to an active hacker but i you know i i wanted him to talk to mittick because mittick will say
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:05.360]   you go to jail do not be cocky this is right this is not a game these guys take this really
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:10.080]   really seriously whether rightly or wrongly they've got the power right now there's no point in
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:16.160]   challenging it right you know maybe we should uh consider and talk about the issue settled it once
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:20.240]   you settled it or or or it's all it's all ended then you can go back to you can go back to yelling
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.520]   screaming and doing whatever you want to do but when you're in the midst of making of the decision
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:27.440]   process it's not i don't like talking about court cases but we're gonna briefly mention that
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:34.000]   apple's being sued by t h x for uh using uh misusing patented speaker technology in the
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.120]   iphone the ipad and the mac george lukis's uh companies no longer with it but he founded the
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:46.160]   company the patent number 483 narrow profile speaker configurations and systems granted in 2008
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:53.520]   uh enhancing sound quality in a very small space coming for your i'm actually oh they're coming
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:59.280]   for your i'm not can't have it they can't have it they've got lights appers i don't i don't match
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:03.200]   these court cases because you know who knows what this means i mean i don't settle in the three
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:07.440]   days necessarily like this isn't the same as a as a this is not a patent role it's patent role
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:11.680]   this is something they're making so this is i mean i've been taught by the way we don't say patent
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:19.840]   roles we say npe jerky jerky jerky jerks stupid npe's non-practicing entities i.e. somebody who
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:26.880]   bought a patent not with the intent of making it but with the intent of enforcing it an npe
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:35.920]   aka patent role massively religious patent role um i'm not going to talk about apple and
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:47.760]   samsung in lawsuits who cares boring um i always update lg six point uh one place three one point
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:53.200]   three yeah just now map earlier today maps for japan and they fixed the passcode bypass
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:59.520]   ah they needed to do that that was uh that wasn't fixed in six one two no so uh yep so that's worth
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:06.240]   doing folks especially if you leave your iphone and bars you might want to update see i haven't
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:10.880]   it hasn't been pushed out to me yet i got it this morning i'm gonna run software update checking for
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:17.680]   update uh april is proposing on the go wireless charging via ipad smart cover with built-in battery
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:26.080]   other it is improvements and bug fixes download and install um that that q wireless charging is in
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:33.120]   the samsung galaxy s4 to so there's two two things i'd like to see in the next iphone nfc and wireless
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:40.240]   charging yes or no uh i don't think that use nfc it's a great feature i absolutely love it as
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:45.360]   matter of fact i just set up a new thing in my in the samsung so that when i put it on the nightstand
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:50.080]   just the act of placing it there sets an alarm four eight o'clock the next morning that's pretty
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:54.880]   sweet uh but that but that that really is a sort of thing that is kind of advanced i don't think it
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:59.760]   really is in that you know that that that that meaty part of the of the uh of the bell curve that
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:03.840]   people are going to use that wireless charging is something that they could really get into because
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:09.840]   it is such a user-facing feature you just drop it on this one thing and it will always be charging
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:13.920]   the question is would they be willing to compromise or excuse me would they meet
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:18.080]   be willing to make the engineering and adjustments and design adjustments they'd have to make in
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:23.040]   order to make wireless charging work they probably have to make it a little bit you would expect
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.720]   no i wouldn't say we probably but you would expect them to make a little bit thicker you would expect
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:32.400]   yes for is really thin i don't do you have big yeah but again yeah exactly it's a lot bigger
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:37.360]   than the phone but they're thinking about making right okay plus remember plus remember that this
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.760]   one of the one of the odd things that you don't really instantly know about the samsung is that
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:48.000]   guess where the nfc chip is on this it is actually on top of the battery i know so that if you use
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.440]   a third-party battery for instance that doesn't have the samsung logo on it you don't have nfc
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:56.400]   and the reason for that is because it has to be out and has to be exposed otherwise you know it's
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:01.680]   it's a very very they're not kidding when they say near field communication it's damn near uh in order
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:07.280]   and why the plastic uh back too because metal would yeah exactly yeah yeah i i'm not totally clear
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:12.000]   that nfc i mean the problem is you look at like what square does i walk into a coffee shop down
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.080]   down the street it knows that i'm there when i arrive i don't need to i don't need to put my
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:19.680]   phone down or anything i don't need to scan it yeah there's a problem with that though you can't have
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:26.320]   two two places next to each other yeah and also do do you really want to keep your radios there though
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:31.360]   do you really want to keep your radios open and active all the time for that one time every four
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:36.080]   days when you're going to use it the nfc doesn't really draw any power until it's actually activated
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:40.400]   yeah i just think i think that i think that as the geofencing gets better though i think the
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:45.200]   problem is that solves it right now square will not let you do it if your neighbor's doing it for that
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:51.280]   reason mm-hmm you have to be and it also brings up that uh people tend to discount nfc because they
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:55.680]   come to the argument will look how much better it works a past book works just by using actual uh
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:02.000]   actual barcodes which is very very true but nfc is about so much more than just uh payments so i
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.520]   so i think nfc is better solution i don't want to say it's it's not a better it's just that we see a
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:09.280]   lot of better solutions that don't make it just because other solutions are good enough and i think
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:14.240]   that's the challenge they're gonna have yeah and and people when i when i give people like an nfc magic
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:19.440]   show you know it's pretty i'm actually loaning uh a friend an android phone because he wants to try
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:24.320]   it out uh for a while and he's actually going to be at pax east and so i'm going to give him an nfc
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:29.920]   sticker they can put inside his his badge and so that anytime someone wants his website for his web
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:33.520]   comic he can just like hold out his badge and just tap his on android phone just tap it against
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:38.000]   this and you'll be your web browser will be taken to automatically uh because it's it's a great magic
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.960]   show people who know how to use that feature can get a lot out of it again so many things i do are
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:48.240]   so much simplified with nfc but it's not the sort of thing that i think a typical at iphone user is
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:54.640]   going to want to get into you uh you probably wondering what's happening to the ashton kutcher uh
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:59.680]   steve jobs movie i know i am apparently delayed i can't say they're feed myself with concern
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:07.120]   i think it's delayed because it's so god awful the clip we saw was just the worst i mean not only
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:13.440]   an historically inaccurate just bad weird all yank of it here at any point in his life but get this
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:19.520]   funnier die is made an hour and ten minute version of the steve jobs movie itself it's going to
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:27.680]   debut at april 15th it's called i steve and who better to star as steve jobs then i'm a mac just
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:34.560]   in long now that's good casting i guess great casting um it looks a bit more like the frugal gourmet
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:39.840]   in that it doesn't look like steve but remember you don't have to you know it's funnier die it's
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:44.960]   funnier but even not i mean i does uh uh do you have to look like the character you're portraying i
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:50.400]   mean i guess i guess uh what's his name daniel they lose kind of looks like lincoln but he's an actor
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:56.800]   it doesn't have to look exactly like um especially for comedy well i i guess this is going to be uh
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:02.240]   interesting uh because there are those who consider steve sacrosanct but of course that's
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:09.040]   what makes the best comedy yeah uh raine wilson has bill gates i will contribute 50 dollars towards
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:15.680]   that booking whether i now okay so the script was written in three days
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:22.160]   so there was a lot of drinking involved it could be you know sometimes the stuff that's written
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:27.200]   that fast is genius right i don't know i don't know if erin sorcan works quite so fast but uh
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:35.280]   anyway and was was the movie was made in five days nice so was roger korman involved in any of this
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:42.720]   um the guy who wrote uh the script says uh perez said uh we might not be the best but we will be the first
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:49.920]   well the the hard thing for the for the sorcan film of course is if it comes out and people start
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:55.680]   saying well that one was better well the sorcan film oh that would be bad for sorcan yeah so uh
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:21:02.800]   sony's making the sorcan film uh this um jobs the ashton kutcher film did get shown at sundance in
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:07.600]   january i don't know anybody who saw it it was supposed to come out april 19th and they're they're
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:12.240]   describing that plan that the the distributor said we didn't have enough time to mount a proper
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:17.760]   marketing campaign my guess is was that was not the excuse the spinal tap oh your
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:23.840]   can you travel to do lack of advertising funds going straight to history channel three i bet it's
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:27.760]   the worst movie you've ever seen what more hit the worst things are in kennel his or his
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:34.000]   mr channel oh my god i do want to see the funnier die version this is this is pretty ambitious
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:42.800]   uh it's the longest project funnier die has ever done ryan perez uh said in the the script writer
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:47.200]   in true internet fashion it's not not based on very thorough research but i
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:52.080]   essentially a cursory look at the steve juffs wickie paidie it wikipedia page
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:57.680]   i love this movie i already love it we support behind yeah already love it they should have
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:02.400]   done a kickstarter what were they thinking they could have made millions they probably would have
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:06.640]   of course they would have yeah they they said we had the exact marz could make three million
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:09.840]   dollars on that starter this one would have been ten million with going out without even
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:19.600]   ten million easy uh sam sunk says we're making a watch really okay fitu whatever whatever
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:23.360]   what ever i would really can you start a rumor that apples making a flying car because i'd really
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:28.880]   like to buy one from sam sunk ah that's a good idea we'll say that's apples doing a flying car and
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:33.920]   let sam sunk make it because they could make it right yes i'd be happy with just a car and he's
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:37.680]   raising his hand at this point he can't i'm sorry i was i was talking over ryanay i didn't want
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:42.240]   to run a so i was i was in the car and i realized i'm lathering on for people at home what are the
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:46.640]   difficulties because two of our hosts are in skype two are in studio it's always very difficult we i
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:51.040]   apologize for us talking over each other we i think we do a pretty good job of kind of managing that
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:54.400]   but it's sometimes difficult because of the late there's sometimes a cnn crossfire sort of
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:23:01.200]   fluy ker fluy no i say boogie gaboogee uh oh but that's it's it's exactly but it's not like
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:07.200]   i i think about exactly the sort of product that sam sunk would not possibly do well and
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:13.200]   watch is got to be really close to that because you can't just you can't just throw
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:18.640]   components together and put a strap on and say voila a watch and sell it you really have to you
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:23.200]   have to be like pebble you have to be like presumably a company like apple you have to have here is
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:28.160]   exactly what it's going to be used for here is a short list of features that we know for a fact
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:32.480]   we can deliver flawlessly and that's what we're going to deliver sam sunk is going to be well what's
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:36.800]   this thing on the side of it oh well that's if you just put this in the side of a can of cola you can
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:41.840]   actually open the top of it like it's a can opener that's right when it's not when it's not being a
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:48.720]   when it's not being an hd antenna for your your local tv set really but punter punter joe in the
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:53.840]   chat room actually has the reason why sam sunk should do a car because then we could call it the s
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:24:00.160]   car and you could say look at that s car go and the joke would come true do you remember the
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:03.920]   moto active that they put out last like moto rola put out when they were apple watch rumors i think
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:06.960]   if there's just if this rumor comes out every year every competitor will have a watch
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:13.200]   and so for those of you tuning in wondering where's the mac news where is the mac news we
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:19.280]   wonder the same thing by the way yes there is a good story apple is now offering i max with built
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:24.960]   in visa mounts for forty dollars whoo it's actually really important to me it's important to me too we
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:29.680]   bought these i'm actually thinking it had the high end had a visa mount doesn't because normally i
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:34.160]   have it on an arm that i can move around so now what because i bought one without apple release
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:39.840]   uleo thank you leo that's all that leo no this is why we actually one of the big reasons we don't
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:44.960]   buy um you want them to be able to so the v-man allows you to mount it on an arm it's a yes
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:50.720]   industry standard yes and you would like that uh absolutely i will actually consider actually with
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:54.880]   this thin design it really isn't much bigger than a cinematist play but it's got all the guts of a
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.440]   mac i mean it's not yeah that's really cool and i'm act is uh i mean we have lots of i max um both
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:05.120]   here and in roanda but the um but with no stand on the wall and a wireless keyboard and mouse
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:10.240]   and there's some companies that that make custom ones you know the monitors in motion make ones
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:13.840]   that fit into you know that fit with your i your i'm act but this is great to just be able to buy
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:20.400]   off the shelf so i suppose it's it's the case that uh this is not retro fitable
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:26.400]   but of course not exchangeable but the funny thing is that leo every time i hear a rumor about a new
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:31.680]   version of an iMac analyst put out a story about apple making a television i know i know so would
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:36.800]   you write another one would you um because you don't need any any source to say it's a rumor just
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:41.200]   say it's a rumor i'll start they just hear rumors they there's some wise components for an iMac and
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:46.720]   they just assume it's a television home who has a bet a hundred dollar bet i uh that gene monster
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:50.000]   gene monster has a hundred dollar bet there that he said there will be an apple tv by the end of the
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.680]   year who said there wouldn't be uh it was one of the it wasn't something to add yet
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:26:00.000]   oh it was or toposkey was it josh what toposkey made me oh no it was it was um it was tim stevens
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.920]   you're right yes tim stevens bet gene monster tim said no apple tv this year gene said oh i think
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:11.360]   there will be if you sit by the river long enough the body of your enemy will float by
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:18.400]   that's a long wait for that one that's a very japanese quote for canadian i like it
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:21.440]   i'm waiting for the bodies of my enemies to float by
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:28.480]   wait a long time let's see that i think there's there's kind of like a zone a comfort zone you
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:32.800]   can really sit in for these rumors that if you what you what you really should do is you should
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:36.720]   figure out when do you think an apple watch would be released i think it would be released in
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:43.200]   october in time for the for the holiday season so if i make really just start boasting my butt off
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:49.040]   of and sort of like make up lies about i can't tell talk about what i might have seen when i was in
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:54.560]   new york the other day when i had a meeting at a at a hotel suite with somewhere because i'm not
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:27:00.720]   supposed to talk about it but i think i i think i would not be terribly surprised to see if and so
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:05.680]   you gotta make sure there's enough distance between you're being so absolutely out there and confident
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:08.800]   and the time when people are going to be proving you're right or wrong to make sure that by the
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:12.880]   time that happens you've said a made made a lie in august or some time that's so big they'll
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:15.760]   forget all about what you were talking about in march i did like that don not
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:21.760]   suppression you just did though that was quick thank you i'm also working on an alan arcan
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:28.320]   all that calan arcan's very big this year no one used to do all it all can pull up a sudden
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:32.560]   money on one nice thing about alan arcan it turns into jacke mason very easily
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:44.800]   if you're an apple tv fan apples hobby just updated 5.2.1 at least one of the things changed a new hulu
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:53.600]   plus interface okay and abc is reportedly working on and this i find interesting and
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:28:05.760]   intriguing even and a live streaming tv app that would be huge for ios what imagine watching your
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:14.240]   abc shows like modern family and once and graze anatomy on your ipad in real time yeah see it's
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:18.640]   it's a lot of interesting movement cbs released a major rap for ios i hope this
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:23.760]   not been in spole anybody's pick of the week that's it's germane that gives you pretty much
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:27.760]   every show that they had any sort of a right to the really the only the only show that i could not
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:33.440]   spot inside that app was big bang theory which is owned by other folks but it's it really i
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:40.080]   between this and all the other different network shows i had i i was just working in the coffee
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:44.880]   shop the other day watching project runway which i missed off the dvr off the lifetime app and
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:49.520]   that's when i actually decided to like open up a little on the outliner to recreate here's everything
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:54.880]   that i'm recording on my dvr and there's almost nothing on that list that i can't get through
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:29:03.280]   streaming app on ios and most of those i can also airplay to my tv via apple tv and it's like man
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:08.880]   if i i keep saying that there's you need to uh before you cut cable it's it's not like a one-in-one
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:12.480]   decision it's like you it's a game you play over the course of a year and a half and when you get
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:18.720]   100 points you cut the cable and i think that got me from 93 points to 97 points i do think so that
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:23.840]   in every case you're gonna have to have a cable subscription right as you do with hbogo i cut
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:27.600]   mind we i got rid of my cable i use just the the canadian apps have been out for a while there's
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:33.840]   ctv can you watch live city tv no there's no live but yeah within a day and it is aggravating because
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:38.560]   one of the apps you can airplay the other one you can't right and the videos go down but the ads
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:42.320]   always work so you'll watch the ad and i'll say oh sorry we have a video issue yeah you back
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:48.560]   don't try the ad will work the video still by the way that's just a technical issue it's just a
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:53.440]   separate server there's yeah we're not doing that on purpose but i sit there and i watch arrow and i
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:59.520]   beam it to my apple tv and it's fantastic let's see that's it's the the really cool thing is if uh
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:05.760]   area they that really great like and absolutely gutsy uh streaming live the network television
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:11.120]   service that's available right now in new york and it's just expanded into like the metronuclear
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:16.480]   and i can get it in uh connect it in new jersey uh they have a really good app that runs on the
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:24.560]   roku box so now every roku is cost because it was ipad only for a while uh was yes uh but now it's uh
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:29.360]   it'll work on other things as well so they actually managed to get that going on the apple tv
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:34.320]   awesome like as as an app that i think is gonna it's gonna it's certainly gonna sell a lot of roku
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:40.160]   boxes it's gonna sell a lot of apple tv's who knows what's gonna happen once this actually rolls out
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:45.920]   uh they've they've announced uh something like 22 new cities uh and looks like those are gonna
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:51.280]   happen by the end of the spring and i cannot wait to see what kind of effect the service has because
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:55.840]   i've i've had press access to the to that for a couple of weeks that i can only get it for a week
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:31:01.520]   at a time when i have a legitimate journalistic reason to have it because it really is very much
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:06.160]   tied to your local broadcaster because that's what makes it legal doctor mom brought hers out
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:10.800]   and i played with it when she was out here and it's it reads area it's a silliest thing i think
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:16.160]   it's kind of cluji berry dillers company but a little tiny it works little dime-sized antennas
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:20.560]   uh so and the reason the courts have said that yeah it's okay is because you're not
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:23.760]   running you're not getting it's not like cable service you're just running this antenna
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:28.960]   in this array so really so what they need to listen to what they're doing is they're recording
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:34.480]   off the air broadcast using an antenna that only you have your antenna that's right right and so
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:39.280]   that's the reason why like if they if they offer the service in new york i can't i have to live in
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:44.720]   new york i have to physically be in new york to watch that tv and also to watch my dvr program so
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:50.960]   it's very there's there's a narrow bandwidth of of legality to hear but the the uh i looked into
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:56.160]   this when i wrote review of a couple months ago the really a hysterically funny part of this is that
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:01.840]   none of this would be legal if not for the fact that cable vision created a huge huge lawsuit to
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:07.520]   make to uh to uh establish that it's okay for them to have a remote dvr feature without having to pay
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:12.560]   uh pay the networks or pay the cable stations for rebroadcasting because that was the judgment
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:18.480]   that said that if you have a remote dvr feature it's not technically rebroadcasting because the
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:25.040]   user is creating at the user's own discretion a recording that is only available to that user
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:29.440]   and for that reason it's not rebroadcasting and that's exactly the argument that area of latch
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:33.840]   onto saying no we're not rebroadcasting it we're just something the user has an antenna
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:38.720]   the user's creating a recording on its own discretion and the user only has access to this and so
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:43.680]   therefore cable vision sorry you're upset about this sorry here here let me take you out to lunch
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:47.440]   have a triple scotch on me we're going to be continuing to roll out in 22 more cities after this thank
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:53.440]   you by the way we'll be reviewing today i'm before you buy the new roku uh three which i really really
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:33:03.360]   like look forward to new apple tv and uh i don't know how this happens so so um this is weird so
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:07.680]   remember at the beginning of the show right i said one of the things we're going to do on uh on a
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:11.360]   know-how episode in the future i'm going to make a fusion drive on my mac bro i want to get my mac
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:17.120]   pro up to date and uh and so the best thing i can do is put an ssd in there make me make a fusion
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:22.080]   drive maybe do nesst but it's a shame because nobody's offering higher end video cards for the mac
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:26.080]   pro the best you can get is basically the same card apple was offering two and a half years ago
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:32.240]   today sapphire launches the rate today during the show your timing is impeccable
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:40.160]   sapphire launches a radion hd 7950 for the mac pro so uh in two weeks we're going to do take your mac
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:44.720]   pro to the next level and this is going to be part of it and this is i just ordered it on new

[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:51.680]   supposed to buy the last one and then they announced it yeah well thing if you had bought it yesterday
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:57.600]   if you have the fact that i'm spending a thousand dollars on this mac pro to get it to like anywhere
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:04.160]   near modern speed guarantees that the announcement will be in about a month yes right as the just
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:09.920]   telling you a thousand dollars for it by the way the ssd i'm buying as a pc i express card so it's
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:17.280]   faster even than the sapphire bus right yeah leo is a bellwether customer yeah you just watch what i

[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:48.720]   talking about the fact there's a bunch of us talking about building a website about
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:53.760]   you know dealing with some of the issues related to visual effects that happen right now and
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:56.960]   people were talking about like where should we put it and everything else i was like oh
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:00.560]   just put it on squarespace i don't know if it's if they're gonna agree to that or not but all
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:04.160]   i was like it was just like it's so easy it's kind of a no brainer right yeah i was just like it's
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:08.400]   just why are we doing this like why why why should we make this any more harder than it has to be
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:12.880]   right just just if you're gonna build a website this is the way to get started you may
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:16.800]   decide someday that you want i don't know why but you may decide some day that you need to
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:21.200]   more custom or you have you know a bunch of developers that want to do well that's the beauty
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:26.480]   of that squarespace you can they have a developer platform with javascript exactly they have uh i
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:30.160]   mean it's and that's the thing to remember is is that is that you're not like a lot of our websites
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:35.680]   that are built on squarespace are not 100 was you know they're not just what squarespace provided
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:39.600]   there's there's custom code that you can inject into into what you're doing there so you're not
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:45.920]   limited to it but all the basic stuff can be quickly edited by someone who is not a coder yeah

[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:20.480]   it is cool i mean and what's funny i mean in a previous job i was a warehouse manager for a
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:25.600]   company that did online selling and it was a pain yeah we had to practically call another
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:30.960]   company to add products to our website yeah and this is so our first one was so grown like we
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:37.040]   actually wrote the e-commerce from scratches 12 years ago yeah we've we've like gone we've just
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:42.080]   slowly slowly progressed to the point where now we're not going to do any of it really awesome yeah
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:47.360]   it's awesome really awesome uh time for our picks of the weekend and naka let's kick it off with you
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:52.720]   sir i didn't ask you by the way and if there was an audible book you wanted to recommend
[01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:57.360]   uh that's okay i can say that for next week okay okay i've got stuff
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:03.920]   not my thing is all weird again but i'm not too worried about that um uh i i'm a big fan of uh
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:08.160]   the ipad as like the only really mobile computer that i really really need i do so much by writing
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:13.760]   on it my favorite keyboard for the ipad remains the plan jane apple wireless keyboard because i
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:19.040]   like the i like to have like the really good like full-sized books i like to have like the you know
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:24.080]   the full size like full stroke like bluetooth keyboard here uh but it's a pain in the butt to
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:29.040]   like carry it around uh you really don't you know you it's it doesn't really affect support ability
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:34.720]   so my eye is really clear open on every time there's a brand new kind of like ipad sized keyboard
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:40.960]   out there i really want to try it out uh logitech has this really cool new ultra thin cover for the
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:48.720]   ipad cover keyboard and this is what your ipad looks like when you have a keyboard attached to it
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:53.600]   and it's right inside there you go like that you mean right and it looks like sort of a macbook
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:58.880]   air exactly uh and you open it up now of course this does this no wait this will flop this not
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:03.520]   like a notebook but the thing is you detach it from here you click it magnetically click into there
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:10.320]   great and it becomes a stable type of thing uh and it has the usual drawbacks of of an ipad
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:16.480]   sized keyboard the keys are not quite the same size uh that's a good dollar it's a smaller deck
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:21.680]   the keys are are smaller too but they're really good high quality mechanical keys so they they
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:27.040]   feel very comfortable typing and although i can't type at my usual you know nuclear pace on this
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:33.040]   thing i can type very very fast and if i really did if size was really uh a thing that i really
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:37.440]   was concerned about uh this would be a very very nice uh a nice alternative it also has a couple
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:43.600]   features that i wish that apple would steal uh for the uh uh for their own keyboard uh which
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:48.800]   wireless keyboard which is this really incredibly high tech thing called a power switch that if you
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:53.840]   take this it's called a switch has two positions it's binary so if you slide from here to here
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:58.240]   amazing that means that the bluetooth keyboard is off it's very very unlikely that you'll be in the
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:02.000]   middle of a flight and then you'll hear like music coming from the overhead compartment
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:07.200]   i'd you because that has that ever happened to you yes there'll be a bump there'll be a bump on the
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:11.680]   on the flight something will bump against something inside the keyboard in my bag up over there and
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:16.720]   we'll start playing music and because there's no way to because they went for that really cool
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:20.800]   awesome styling but no we're gonna have a feather-lapped touch button on the side of it that will that
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:25.040]   will turn it on and off i want a mechanic i want a mechanical button i wish i didn't have to take
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:30.880]   the batteries out of it to prevent it from running down my ipads battery uh but it's this is a 99 bucks
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:36.080]   really really cool package they also now i don't know how to feel about this one they also have a
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:42.400]   version of it for the ipad mini oh interesting and if they if you imagine you have to adapt for a
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:48.720]   keyboard that's small enough for the uh to that's only as wide as a regular ipad imagine how much
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:54.560]   you have to adapt for a keyboard that is this skinny yeah that's kind of so i don't know how
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:58.480]   like i said i don't know how i feel about it it's the same sort of thing we've got a magnetic sort
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:04.320]   of slate stand uh the keys are also are just high quality nice quality key switches
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:10.560]   mechanical they're not like just uh like plastic membrane um i think that's i i did a couple of
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:18.640]   tests with it and i was able to type kind of fast using a few fingers but not the full thing uh so
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:25.600]   i think it's i think it's a nod to how popular the ipad mini is so how many people are kind of
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:31.280]   abandoning their full-sized ipads and signs everything i want my ipad to do i can make i can do with my
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:38.800]   ipad mini so it's sort of a nice compromise between those two uh but it's i'm i'm glad that they take
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:43.200]   a chance i'm glad that they don't simply decide that something is ridiculous i'm glad that logic
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:47.840]   take the side of show let's build it and then show everybody how ridiculous this is and maybe some
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:53.680]   people will think it's not ridiculous at all uh so and that's a 79.99 instead of 99.99
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:58.160]   both of these uh it's also available and they sent me the white one you can also i think they
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:03.680]   it's also available in black uh so you can get it to match the color of your device so cool stuff
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:09.120]   again it just it just it helps you a lot with that transition of of asking yourself why am i taking
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:13.920]   an entire notebook computer with me when really my ipad can handle almost everything i need now
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:19.120]   there's that added convenience of now it's just a nice slim package on top everything else and much
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:24.400]   less hassle than taking uh two really distinct devices with me think sandy's and he's planning
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:31.360]   more time on the amtrac oh i see i keep i keep i don't know why it's taking them so long for me

[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:42.560]   be like a hat grab bag meanwhile rene richy what's your pick of the week i have a quick tip and i
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:47.280]   have a pick there was this problem not a problem with the macbook retina was was aggravating me
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:52.320]   sometimes i noticed that when i was on skype here for example sometimes it would switch from do not
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:58.000]   disturb to active and when i would open it and try to log in i'd have to wait 10 seconds sometimes
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:03.840]   20 seconds before it actually give me a prompt and it turns out that with the new macbooks there's a
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:10.480]   difference between um the the sleep mode and the low power usage mode and it would go into that
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:16.880]   after a few seconds but uh chad colman on twitter sent me this link and you can actually there's a
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:21.440]   command you can do in the terminal a soodoo command that lets you change that so if you know that
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:26.400]   you're not going to be if you don't need maximum power saving you can adjust that to something far
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:31.520]   more human and then you don't have to worry about log in delays or skype suddenly coming to life
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:35.920]   just because power nap is checking all your connections that's been driving me crazy that is a great
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:41.360]   fix yeah i think this goes well with my nascent beard it goes well with the shirt and matches the
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:48.400]   shirt so obviously this was intended for sarah most of these hats all these hats i'm sure for
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:53.520]   ipad the day where we do a hat of the uh you know an app cap no we're getting a second one
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:58.560]   well this is a good hat that looks like a costume department for the scottish version of gilligan's
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:05.280]   island yeah i like i'm getting all the pain back here oh no that's a hat now we're ready to
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:10.160]   party now that's this i feel like i should go to the track and make a bet in this hat on the tv
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:14.560]   show vegas i'm ready somebody's gonna reminds me of uncle buck this is a great hat actually everyone
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:20.080]   has a little hat that's a french connection hat it's party hat it's a pop i hat it says uh
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:24.880]   knowledge wisdom truth in the in the liner it's superman's hat made in china
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:30.000]   i like yeah pop i you're right this is straight out of the french connection except for the band
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.800]   which is kind of checked for those of you listening at home you're not missing a thing and you
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:38.080]   let's start dressing up and now alex lindsey with his pick of the right
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:45.120]   not good on you sir just tilted forward you're not you know you gotta work it don't i don't know
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:56.800]   i don't know you pick your feet all right so so the um uh i we've gone through a lot of teleprompting
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:02.560]   software so for those of you listening teleprompting is uh of course um the ability to put text on the
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:06.720]   screen either below a camera but oftentimes we have telepromptors that put it right in front of the
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:10.800]   camera that way you look like you're talking to it um and uh we don't use a lot of them here at
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:15.680]   tWIT um but we don't like telepromptors but i use them a lot for the a lot of the streams and
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:19.360]   video stuff that we do we have i don't know 10 or 11 telepromptors at this point and so we're
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:24.320]   constantly using them for a lot of these things and um and finding the right software is uh is
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:29.360]   oftentimes a big challenge for us and um a lot of the stuff that's been on the max door on them so
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:34.000]   there's a company called autoq that makes incredible software and it's really expensive it only comes
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.200]   with their telepromptors and it's really annoying um and we've tried to use many of the teleprompter
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:43.280]   software for the mac and they're all buggy they don't they don't work very well and i've threatened
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:47.120]   to write my own for a long time like oh we're just gonna design something that's really built for a
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:50.240]   mac it's not they're not trying to make it for a mac and pc that it's gonna run well it's gonna
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:55.520]   use all of the you know the the um libraries that apple already provides for you to do it well
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:51:00.480]   um and no one seemed to do that until this software and this is called presentation
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:07.520]   prompter and um and i don't know who makes this it's written um it's ripewear and this is available
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:12.160]   on the mac store now this is expensive expensive from a mac app perspective how much 99 dollars
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:18.560]   yeah but for a prompter app that's actually not bad it's not not bad and here's the thing it actually
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:24.160]   works so um not that i'm bitter about many of the other ones that i that i've worked with will
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:29.280]   remain unnamed but they always you know we've had them crash have we can't control the playback we
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:33.520]   can't control the i mean there's just so many things that that we've had trouble with in this area and
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:39.680]   so far fingers crossed knock on wood um this one has been very solid um it's very easy to control
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:43.120]   the size of the text it's very easy to you know do all the little adjustments that we need to
[01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:47.440]   whether it's flipping it horizontally vertically using as a second display all of those things
[01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:52.400]   are you know adding timers putting a focus arrow in um you know all of these things are
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:56.880]   are things that um they've really gotten all the things right i mean there's probably little
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:00.720]   things that once we start using it more we'll request um you'll probably send them emails
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:06.720]   but uh but right now we're just we really enjoy using it and so if you're looking for that kind
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:11.840]   of thing i know that's not the you know not everyone needs a teleprompter um but if you're looking
[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:16.960]   for that kind of thing uh this is the best one we found um you know at that price point and stand
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:21.600]   alone um easy to run on your mac that kind of thing so presentation prompter available on the mac
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:26.080]   app store so during the entire show i've been refreshing tempo any of you guys know about tempo
[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:33.200]   the uh iphone app uh it's only sadly is it us only yeah i really like this idea so we were talking
[01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:38.800]   about google now and the and the idea of having software that's kind of smart uh and extracting
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:43.920]   bits and pieces from other parts of your system to give you smart information and tempo is one of
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:47.760]   several there's another one called grocker that looked really good but they're doing an invitation
[01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:51.600]   system and i got an email today i thought oh finally i can show this because i was like
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:58.720]   271 thousandth in line and they said you're in except that i'm not 923 in line and but every
[01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:02.720]   15 minutes it goes down by a couple hundred and i was hoping that by the end of the show i could
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:10.160]   show you tempo so i guess i won't it's tempo.ai i'll show you next week the idea being um it gets
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:15.440]   information from uh your email and other things to be smart for instance if you've gotten your
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:21.120]   calendar a conference call it dial the phone for you think things like that i don't know how you do
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:27.360]   it on the apple and apparently there's a hot teacher involved but uh i'm watching the video i'm not
[01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:33.360]   sure exactly what this has to do with the application and dropbox didn't buy them that's yeah oh hey i
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:38.160]   should we didn't even mention dropbox bought mailbox for a hundred million dollars just because
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:44.240]   it had the word box in the name just exactly really brilliant so mailbox is another great app that
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:49.200]   did the same thing this this must be the new trend with the waiting list um i did get in on that one
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:52.880]   and uh mailboxes are a certain multiplier to how many people are on the waiting list to
[01:53:52.880 --> 01:54:00.560]   how how what your market value is yeah maybe maybe hundred million dollars right for mailbox
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:05.600]   which is a great mail app the id inbox zero app i've showed that before where you swipe to uh
[01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:10.640]   handle the email uh you have four different swipe capabilities and it's really good it is a good
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:14.560]   way to handle mail i like it it's probably my favorite mailbox app on the iphone i don't know
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:18.800]   what dropbox is going to do with it it doesn't really fit their their business that they're going to
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:22.400]   keep it i mean there's there's some rumors going around that dropbox wants to be a cloud o s and
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:28.720]   that they'll need cloud apps to do that oh interesting so i swiped this partly other way to archive
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:33.680]   all the way to delete that's to the right whoops i accidentally deleted that will swipe to the left
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:39.120]   to this is my favorite thing to say hey i think i'll handle this later today this evening tomorrow
[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:43.360]   so you can set a time i'm gonna later today i'm gonna look at that email you swipe all the way to
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:48.880]   the right to add something to a list and you can create your own lists great app um i don't know
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:53.200]   if they're still doing a waiting list or not for mailbox but it's a great app with a terrible name
[01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:57.840]   you know why because go ahead and search for mailbox in the app store good luck finding it
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:02.400]   it's interesting that these products are all using server-side infrastructure to try and do a lot of
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:06.640]   the heavy lifting and sorting for you and i think that these are just the beginning because a lot of
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:10.560]   apps that are still in beta that are using very similar plans and it's it's interesting because
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:17.520]   they're offloading a lot of the local drudge robotic work to you know quasi intelligent clouds
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:23.680]   so Alex installed a tempo you know oh you're on the way i mean oh that's mailbox yeah so you i don't
[01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:28.160]   know you can't quite see it if you do mailbox now did you just do this so here's the worst part is
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:32.240]   right when it came out i downloaded i didn't realize i had to do something else oh yeah yeah and so i
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:38.800]   finally went and did that last week and i'm i moved 349 000 ahead of you 165 000 people behind you
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:42.640]   not that i'm bitter so tempo did exactly the same kind of reservation thing
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:46.160]   they were worried that their servers would go down if everybody here makes sense if it's
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:49.520]   server-side you know you don't want to kill the server like they keep on adding one one to the
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:54.080]   straw to the top and going okay yeah it didn't collapse yet okay but you have to give them your
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:57.680]   kind of login and let them that's the same thing with trippet and other services you have to give
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:01.520]   them your login and trust them with your data and if you're willing to do that they'll do magic for
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:06.400]   you i love trippet it'll go through my gmail and find uh reservations and stuff and adds them automatically
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:11.040]   creates that tenor news for me and it's been very helpful i agree you have to you have to trust them
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:16.400]   that's the uh that's the issue of it rene richy i trust you i'm more dot com everybody should be
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:21.840]   reading it regularly he is rapidly becoming the source not only for apple rumors but just
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:26.160]   insightful apple news i just love what you're doing with i'm more and we're so glad to have you
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:30.960]   part of uh mac break weekly i love being here thank you good we'll send you a hat
