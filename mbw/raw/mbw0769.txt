[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.600]   You did a big office hours last night to cover
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.520]   WWDC
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.000]   First we we had over the stream. Yeah, we had a great
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.080]   We had a great time. We had four developers
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.640]   You know that are kind of really in the mix of it as well as
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.920]   Renee and then I just seen join this as well
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.960]   So so we had a we had a good roundtable talking about and then nuts and bolts of the process is that on YouTube question driven
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.520]   It's on YouTube. It's on my on my YouTube channel youtube.com/Alex Lindsay
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.600]   and the WWDC edition two hours and 11 minutes of
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.400]   stuff
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.800]   so
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   Good, so I'll ask you to
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:31.240]   Fill me in also with his Andy Enaco from WGBH in Boston. Hello Andrew. Hello
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.880]   I've recovered from the morning heat stroke. Holy cow is it?
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.680]   It was really hot and I got up early so I could take my constitutional and do some errands
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.160]   And I didn't I got caught up and stuff and I wound up doing it in the middle of the middle of the morning
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.560]   It's like I was all cumin and the problem with having like a watch is that it will tell you oh by the way
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.080]   Here's what your body temperature is right now, and here's what your heart rate is and so
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.440]   But I'm fine. I gave an excuse to just like laying bed with a fan on and you know
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:10.400]   A split with a big tub for ice like I'm having an organ harvested tough. I'm fine. I'm fine 100 100 point two degrees
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.680]   But I'm fine now. I'm soon your Apple watch will tell you you're a bit wobbly today. You might want to stay in bed
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.680]   Exactly
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.960]   It just I'm looking forward to the feature where it just says hey dumbass you're dehydrated. It's hot
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   You just sit down just don't don't don't make any decisions on your plug your own behalf from now on
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.600]   For now on the watch is in charge at least until you're responsible for your own health
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.680]   I'm gonna think really the invisible third member of the show today
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:44.520]   Mike a sergeant who has made as you can see in the show's rundown a long list of all the features to iOS 15 and
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.520]   Mac OS Monterey that Apple talked about it was an iPad OS 15, which you really do have to start considering a separate
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:59.720]   Venture watch OS a there is a ton of stuff, but we should start with what Apple did not do which is announce any new hardware
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.840]   It's an interesting thing. I don't know if John Prost has already saved his eyebrows
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.160]   I don't know if there's anything else he could shave he's he said there would for sure be 16 and 24 inch MacBooks
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:15.320]   We thought there would be because of the leak from Quanta. Thanks to the are evil ransomware squad
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.720]   Apple, you know doesn't say
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.460]   At the day of love to dream another well-known
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:31.100]   Twitter based rumor monger said no new hardware and love to dream one so love dream gets to keep its eyebrows
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.000]   John that loses some other body part
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.720]   Why no hardware Andy?
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.000]   If well it feels unlikely that there would have shipped new hardware taken orders like on that day
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.360]   I think that the the the good betting would have been
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.720]   They're gonna show something off and just as a way of
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.920]   Demonstrating to developers that M1 is definitely working great. I was really surprised in the keynote
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.480]   They didn't talk about the uptake of M1. They didn't talk about the success of
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:04.200]   Mac sales, I think that you're probably talking about Apple wanted to make sure they got enough of these damn things before
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:15.360]   Supply shortage these days. Yeah. Yeah, I think you're right and I think that you know they don't need to I mean with virtual events
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.120]   That it's much the amount of work it takes to do another virtual event isn't nearly as hard
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.280]   And so they could easily do something in July or late June or August or so just wait till September
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.880]   But they don't the logistics of doing these events is much easier when you're not bringing all the press in all the time and
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.240]   Trying to figure that out. So so I think that that gives them the freedom to move it
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.840]   We did have a keynote that ran a little long
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:44.040]   So there's no reason why you couldn't bump it necessarily off into the into its own event rather than trying to squash too much
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.440]   Into it. We're kind of getting we used to have these two and a half hour three hour keynotes
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.960]   And now it's like oh when you get to an hour you're like, wow, this is really going a long time like yeah
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.400]   What's going on here? They're not kicking off by saying here's what the financials the company. Hey, here's this new the new
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.080]   Landmark Apple store that we're doing right now
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.240]   Here's here's and here's a short video from China. It's just making cut cut cut cut cut
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.740]   I mean if you if you if you blinked you kind of missed him cook because it was themed entirely the Craig Federighi
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:17.400]   It really was this is all because this is just all about operating systems operating systems and a little bit of developer stuff
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.560]   Attached to the end of it, but it would really was he's he whenever he paid for that shirt
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.840]   He can basically do the entire thing because it got a lot of your time
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.800]   And it keeps on getting I think that their their keynotes keep on getting better
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.960]   You know, they're just they've really figured out this model of of how to do them virtually or how to just make a show
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.720]   I mean, it's all one thing that I mean they jammed it was an hour and 45 minutes
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.480]   I think and they jammed a lot of stuff in there
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.920]   We'll have it'll be hard pressed to cover it all in two hours
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.160]   It was just so and I don't think they can again
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.440]   We say this every single time, but I don't think that they can go back you can't do that speed on stage
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.720]   And so I think that you know, you have to keep on thinking about this. There's these kinds of launches. Yeah
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.200]   I think it's fine and it's it's I mean I
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.960]   Guess it's interesting, you know, I've been thinking a lot about
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.000]   Not just this but in general for instance, we have employees who say we don't want to come back
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.680]   And I think that that you saw there was a big
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.760]   Letter at Apple that circulated and eventually leaked to the verge of the play saying we don't want to go back. I think
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.600]   it's we've created a different beast out here and
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:32.160]   So not just conferences, but everything is changing and I assumed oh
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:37.200]   Everybody'll just go back to normal. Maybe it'll be a little like giddy for a bit and then it'll go back to normal
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:43.520]   No, I don't think so. Yeah, and that's one of the changes is conferences also Alex might have might have another opinion on this
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.120]   But it seemed I think I remember I think I recall from the previous
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.280]   Keeneau the previous big event now. It seems as though the the cutaway
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.480]   of a
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.040]   Expensive condo is now a permanent set somewhere on the apple campus because I think I saw them
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.640]   During watch OS going the exact same places the exact same
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.760]   Oh, yeah, there was there's some there was a move there was a Jerry Lewis movie the ladies man that used the same sort of thing
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.480]   But this was this was a lot more professionally done
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.040]   The fact was a big event except that was a big innovation where Jerry Lewis did it
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.240]   So Alex do you have any insight is that standing set in the app? No idea?
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.880]   It couldn't no idea. It's gotta be a sound stage somewhere, right? It could be a sound stage
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.240]   And there are some sound stages that that are near apple stuff
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:34.080]   So so it definitely could be a sound stage that they're that they're using there, but it's permanent obviously they're not they didn't rebuild it
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:40.960]   Somebody said that those developers the health health researchers that use the air be a beaded brainstorm new
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.360]   Health stuff. They should have just stayed in the in the car
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.080]   There's no fourth wall, but you know it's comfy looking
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.760]   I got more room here on the set than the camper that i'm living in right now
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:58.960]   I'm kidding, but I think that we what we're seeing if you look at one after the other is you're definitely seeing this transition where the
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:05.200]   The transitions the handoffs the they're getting that that language of camera
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.360]   And how they're putting everything together in a way that that starts to really make more and more sense
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:15.760]   Yeah, it also gives them the freedom not to announce hardware just because they've got this keynote on jane on june 7th
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.000]   Uh because they could in a month and probably will and I would guess in a month or two
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.080]   But probably in months they'll have a july event. This is what they did last fall, right?
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.040]   They've even had this is the second event of 2021 already
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.720]   So I suspect that we're gonna see you know half a dozen events
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:36.240]   It's just way easier again when you're not bringing everybody in it's way easier to just just put up a put up a good video
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.720]   Real more and real effective too because it's it's basically an advertisement, you know, you could really
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:46.320]   Go for it my own literally my only complaint was it went so fast and there was so much
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.080]   It was hard to follow at all. I watched the state of the union that afternoon
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.200]   It was a little slower about of course a little more focused on the you know apis and tools, but
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.640]   uh still there's a lot of new material so
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.360]   Yeah, and not only that but there's a lot of stuff that
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:07.040]   Made me go what when I was watching that when I was watching the event that all these little they didn't thought
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.600]   They didn't dot eyes. It didn't cross tees until you got into like other
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.160]   Contacts and other pieces of information they have released later. There are a lot of details about
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:22.400]   Uh, there there are a lot of dts what universal control that I didn't I didn't think was were absolutely obvious
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:30.080]   Private relay there was I was 50/50 between is it encrypting the entire connection or is it just hiding your IP address
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.200]   And there are a lot of details of disorder. Oh, yes, exactly. I shall talk about later, but yeah, I mean, I know
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:40.160]   I could I could co mike has done this great job of putting it all in order. I'm going to screw up his rundown
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.800]   Because I want to I'm going to cherry pick a little bit because I think it's important for us to
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.200]   Say what we think the most important things are I mean there are
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.920]   Quite a few you might say
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:57.680]   FaceTime on android and windows is a big deal from apple's point of view. Um, yeah
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.160]   For apple however, again, that's another thing where okay, but okay
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.800]   You can't initiate from anything except for an iowice device and so now it's like, okay
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.200]   I mean that that's nice, but you still don't give all these other platforms parody and now
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.480]   It really was the zoom of your face time wasn't it?
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.320]   Yeah
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.200]   FaceTime and and messages they both got these little bump a lot of different features as a matter of fact
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.120]   I made a note like halfway through to myself about the the tone of the entire show
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:33.280]   Which was please please please don't use non apple products for anything and one of them was hey, don't
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.560]   Don't use a third party. Don't use signal. Don't use a third party
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:42.880]   Messaging app we've added so many features to we don't don't use zoom because we've made FaceTime more like zoom
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.320]   Don't use
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.680]   The cool messaging apps that you're using with your friends because we've had a cool messaging
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.760]   features to
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.960]   To iMessage even even the feature where you can have group a group feeling
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:01.200]   I'm blanking on the actual trademark they put into this but does hey now you can watch the Netflix together you can watch
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.920]   Yeah, but that's like okay
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:10.160]   But Netflix has that feature and these other apps have that feature already and they're kind of telling you don't use it through Netflix
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.160]   Use it through our service instead
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.640]   The the future that feature that feature is very poorly implemented by the by the individuals
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:22.080]   There's a company there's there's a net party Netflix party whatever that got changed to something else that's a crawl extension
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:29.440]   Or it's a chrome extension that does that but but they're but the actual implementations from disney and from hbo and from other ones is pretty poor
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:35.760]   You know as far as as far as how they do that and so I think that there is a lot of opportunity there that i've been playing with shareplay
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.600]   Uh or something that looks like share play since 2002
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:45.040]   Um and so we've been trying to do this for so long and it feels like we're almost there
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:50.560]   And they still haven't quite figured it out and and so apples is i'm excited to see apple do it
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:55.440]   Unfortunately still limited what I really want is of course to be able to just send out a url and everyone can like
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:00.800]   Thousands of people can watch i'm not interested in 30, you know or 15 or something like that, but that's fine
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:06.880]   Uh, but I think that apple is is making that more accessible and I think people will start to see what's possible
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:15.280]   When everyone can watch something at the same time because that is a really important part of the experiences experiencing with other people and but we don't necessarily
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.560]   Have to have that experience in the same place and I think that that's what apple
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.240]   Definitely showed us with a lot of what they were doing with mesh messages
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.400]   And with face time is the idea that we can experience the world together
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:31.840]   But geographically separated and so when you look at them being able to have a whiteboard and draw together
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.360]   When they're able to watch a movie and and and be together
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:40.720]   Those are things that you know, I think that are interesting. I think apple's taking baby steps in that area
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.800]   Um, but apple doesn't really think about large scale, you know, it's very personal
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:51.040]   It's very family small groups and so on so forth. So I think that's where they're not really going to compete with zoom
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.960]   Uh, which is doing, you know, I mean it's
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.760]   Large scale
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.320]   But I don't think apple is even interested in and I think they also
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.040]   I mean this is in a way
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:07.120]   This is the story of almost everything they announced they were adding features to apple products that are exist in other places
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.160]   But uh exist now within the apple
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:18.880]   System and presumably with apple security and privacy and I think that that's a interesting play for apple
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.320]   That's a sensible play for apple. I mean if you want to build service revenue
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.600]   One one cynical way of looking at it is that okay
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.400]   Well, obviously they're trying to lock you into the apple ecosystem instead of
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.200]   Letting you rely on other people's products are trying to get you to use your apples only way for doing things
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.800]   But on the other hand there are also when you're using apple products
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:42.720]   You're kind of in a very very safe zone as a par as opposed when uh, where privacy and security is is concerned
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:48.480]   So that is a point that they can absolutely make and that's at a point that's going to be very very attractive to a lot of people
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.800]   I just wish that
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.680]   Everybody in the pool meant that you don't you don't have to have an apple tattoo in order to join the party
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:01.280]   Especially if they're when they're talking about tools that help friends get together help families to get together
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.800]   I mean they're the people who just are never going to be buying an iPhone
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.800]   And those are the people who are always going to have the the the the bubble of shame
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:14.640]   In all the in the group in the group chat and they're not going to understand why is there another chat that doesn't involve me
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.360]   And if that's I'm pointing out you're so lonely
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.520]   They'll spend a thousand dollars for an iPhone 13
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:25.760]   Well, remember the emails we saw in the apple epic battle in which a number of apple employees said
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:32.560]   Well, we can't add that feature to android then parents would buy a cheap android phone. Yeah, and uh, yeah, and so
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:39.200]   This is that the version of that although that's why I started with this face time on android and windows
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.200]   Because it is such a departure for that
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.040]   But as you point out, it's not a it's not a parody feature on android and windows
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.240]   It's just a kind of a minimum feature that you can throw in
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:53.680]   Does your share work with the cross platform or is it only in uh in face time and messages?
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.520]   I think it's only
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.560]   Yeah, what are the things that it did do this kind of interesting
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:06.800]   As somebody mentioned in the irc the shazam kit api some of these apis are available to android developers
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:14.880]   So that's kind of interesting. I mean apple bot shazam. That's the program that listens to the music and tells you what you're what you're hearing
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.040]   Uh now that that's an api it can be built in the third party apps and available
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.600]   Yeah, those third party apps other platforms
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.040]   Also when you think about it
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:28.080]   It's absolute apples benefit to make sure that shazam is being used by as many different people as possible
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.280]   So that it gets smarter and smarter and it sees more and more kinds of music
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.840]   So you could say the same thing for siri and in fact siri is going to be in a lot more devices now
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.520]   That's part of the home kit api so uh one I think also the share
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.200]   Shareplay is also part of that as well. Is it that's what I was wondering so shareplay is
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.800]   There's apis for that as well and so that's going to really um allow you to do a lot of things as a developer
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.440]   That and I think that that's one of the things we were talking about last night
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.920]   Was that there's just so many things that apple's doing that are really cool
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:00.000]   But what they're also doing is it's not just apple secret sauce. It's being made available to the developers right to incorporate into what they're doing
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.640]   They call it the group activities api
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:09.760]   And developers can use it for movies tv music and other shared media from their own apps
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.240]   Uh
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.920]   Boy, that's really interesting. We're playing with this with the discord. We're gonna do
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:23.280]   Microsoft's doing a gaming event on sunday and we're gonna we thought it'd be kind of fun with a club twit discord
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.280]   We have a shared video
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.280]   Room is but it's limited 25 people that's I guess that's plenty
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.640]   And we're so we'll put the the microsoft stream in there i'll be in there
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:38.320]   And then uh, we'll invite viewers in there we can all chat about what the gaming with microsoft's doing with the gaming
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.200]   That's by the way sunday 10 am pacific 1 pm eastern little plug
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.760]   um, so
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:48.080]   There and one of the things is at first I thought oh, they're a little late on this just as microsoft
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:53.040]   Which announced a camera and a microphone there you're a little late on the work from home thing, but maybe not
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:57.920]   As I said people people may not be going back fully going back to normal
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.960]   Maybe we still do want to watch movies together in our uh
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:06.800]   Respectively, I think i think the two things that that are coming clear as you start to watch people start to analyze this
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.200]   Is number one is that open offices stink?
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.560]   You know and so people hate them and the idea of going back to them is you know, they were in that
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.000]   They were in that zone for a while they were just doing that thing and that that's what you had to do
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.880]   Now that now they were like, hey, I got as much done as I used to get done
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.000]   And I don't have to walk out of the building every time I want to take a phone call
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.280]   You know and so so I think that that is that's part of it
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.480]   And number two is a lot of people were sitting in the car for a long time
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:36.000]   You know and now they didn't and they learned how to not do it and they and this lasted long enough for them to adapt
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.920]   And figure out how to do it. I think that the one the folks that really want to not go back are people who have rooms that they
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.040]   Turned like me like I turned this room into a little
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:49.920]   Cove that I that I get in calls with I don't I don't do it from all over the house
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.000]   And so people who had enough space to do that or the priority to do that
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.840]   I think really don't want to go back. This is the only have their they have their corner office
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.160]   And they only and they can wear sweats all the time
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.480]   Tim cook sent a note out to employees last week saying they'd have to come back to work monday
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.760]   Tuesday and thursday, you know only three out of the five days
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:15.600]   But immediately a slack channel internal slack channel was created for people who didn't want to go back to work remote work advocates
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:21.920]   2,800 members a note written by about 80 people sent to cook and shared
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.480]   with the verge
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.480]   says for instance
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.760]   Messages like we know many of you are eager to reconnect in person with your colleagues back in the office
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.320]   Don't really speak to us. We felt if we feel that you're ignoring the fact that
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.480]   There are people with directly contradictory feelings among us
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:47.920]   It feels like there's a disconnect between how the executive team thinks about remote and location flexible work and the lived experiences of many apple employees
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.760]   well duh
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:55.600]   Yeah, I would say in general management has a different attitude towards work than employees always
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.160]   right and also I don't
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.240]   Work with a lot of programmers. I don't there's a handful of them that are really outgoing
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.080]   But for the most part most of the programs I work with prefer to have a lot of time
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.000]   It's not even their introverts, but they like to have a lot of time to themselves
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.080]   With meetings and coming over to the cubicle and saying hey, what's going on? I don't want to know
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.600]   I want to sit down and head down and type my stuff
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.000]   So here's the
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.960]   Here are the specific tasks according to the verge outlined by employees in the note
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:33.040]   We're formally requesting that apple considers remote and location flexible work decisions to be as autonomous for a team
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.600]   To decide to decide as our hiring decisions. So let the team
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.200]   Decide a company wide recurring short survey
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.000]   A question about employee churn due to remote work be added to exit interviews
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.160]   Did you leave because the commute was killing you?
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.280]   A transparent clear plan of action to accommodate disabilities. That's another good point
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.480]   You know if you know, I'm sure that the entire apple campus is wheelchair accessible
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.680]   But if you're here in a chair, you might want to just stay at home and do it
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:07.840]   We're formally requesting insight into the environmental impact interesting of returning to on-site in-person work
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.560]   Uh, that's a good point highways in the early part of the pandemic were blissfully
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.960]   Clear
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.680]   Which is by the way one way that way I'm way that reason the highway fatalities were the highest in 2007
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:23.440]   It's because people said I can drive fast
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.400]   Get them all run. Yeah
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:32.160]   I shouldn't laugh about that. That's a serious. No, but it's it's it's hard to unpack this though because
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:36.800]   Uh apple has to apple has a metronome that they can't stop it
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.280]   They can't slow it if they have to keep to that beat
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.320]   No matter what happens and they managed to keep it up during the pandemic more or less, but
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:51.840]   Maybe their worry is that we don't have time to rebuild our company based on our employees being outside the office two or three times
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.400]   Yeah, I mean we we can do it this campus
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:00.800]   But yeah, I mean please can we can we finish like pulling the rug out from under our entire mac platform with an entire
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:06.640]   CPU change and replace that rug before we consider like rebuilding every one of our processes
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.680]   Yeah, but I think the argument is that we got through a year of it
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.080]   I mean, I think a lot of people are making it, you know, they're yeah, look at apple had an incredible 2020
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:20.240]   Yeah, the hard part is that if you look at google apple facebook a lot of these companies that emptied out their matt headquarters
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.520]   It did not hurt the bottom line, you know, at least in the first year
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:29.360]   So so it's it's hard for them to you know, make some of those decisions and I know a lot of folks that work across many
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:35.040]   companies here in bay in the bay area and the the general sediment which I said before is that they said well
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:39.520]   I'm not gonna quit but I am gonna you know freshen up lincoln and start applying and like they
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.480]   They want they you know, they're they aren't doing anything suddenly these are good jobs
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:48.800]   But it's definitely making if people say they have to go back to the office they are
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.400]   Looking at options that have them not have to go back to the office
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.480]   And you're starting to see it
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:01.120]   In linked in you're starting to see lots and lots of these remote remote remote people have to put remote on the job thing because
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.760]   I was talking to somebody that was in recruiting
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:08.080]   They said oh if you don't put remote on it you get like one tenth the number of no one's applying for jobs
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:13.520]   So you have to go somewhere now and so they they all want and because because it means that now people don't have to move to the bay area
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.200]   They don't have to move to anywhere
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.120]   They can apply for this job from kansas
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:22.880]   They can have a big house and they can have a room that they can do their for their office because they're not stuck in some tiny little apartment
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.320]   And so so those are a lot of opportunities for folks to have
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:31.120]   Everything that they want if you're in this elite class of and this is a problem
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:36.640]   But if you're an elite class of worker that's working for these companies where where you are high level programmer
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.960]   Or someone else that can do those there's a lot of those jobs that just really doesn't matter where you're where you are
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.200]   That's certainly a consequence apple has to consider
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.400]   I mean, you know
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.920]   Everything the microsoft google and apple and facebook do is really about getting acquiring
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:57.760]   Attracting acquiring and this keeping employees who have are very valuable. Oh, it's it's it's a real problem for them
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.160]   I mean you look at google, you know, grow with google
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.640]   That is because the the colleges aren't producing enough people and so they're bypassing
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:08.720]   They're literally bypassing the colleges because they can't get enough people apples, you know
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.520]   Swift playgrounds that they're they're putting out for kids is trying to solve a perceived
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:19.280]   Supply problem, right, you know in the future and so so these are all things that they're they're desperate to have that
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.400]   And so really a lot of the leverage sits with the worker over time
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.440]   Uh the workers that get into that in the business
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:30.640]   Engineers are so valuable. They they do it says a little entitled to read this letter, but
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.960]   They know they're they're in the driver's seat on this and the apple needs them
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:39.680]   Uh there are two reasons a company wants employees to come into work one is a dumb one
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.040]   Which is this notion of we're gonna monitor you and make sure you're working hard
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.120]   Uh, you know, we don't trust that you when you're home in your jammies. You're doing as much work
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.880]   That's that's really
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.960]   Well and almost unnecessary coders because you either get the work down or you don't right
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.320]   But but also let's let's not overlook the ethical concern here
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.240]   That the thing to think of the conversation
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:01.600]   We've been having for the past few minutes here that there are people who are a certain elite
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.080]   That can afford to say hey, you know what?
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.600]   I don't want to live in san francisco
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:10.640]   I want to live in canos and because my my skills are so rare and so valued you're gonna cow tout to me
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.920]   However, the people who are being paid the least are the people who can least afford to live in san francisco
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.680]   And these are the people that are gonna be saying so what you can be replaced if you don't want to come into
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.600]   Come into the campus three or four days a week. Guess what? We'll find someone else to do it
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:28.160]   So that's it's it's a very complicated calculus. I think the second reason that
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.320]   companies do it and steve jobs is a big advocate of this remember steve
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.160]   On the original design of the apple campus had only
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.560]   One bathroom at one end and wanted everybody to walk all the way down
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:47.680]   If for a reason is that he felt like the conversation is the serendipitous conversations that happened within and also in between teams
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:53.120]   Was really valuable to the corporate culture but also to kind of in innovation
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.680]   That's a that is kind of
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.800]   More serious and you could put all the share point or whatever they call his shares plate into this stuff you want
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:05.200]   It's not the same as as having lunch together and talking about what you're working on
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:10.880]   I guess I would I would argue that what I do every morning and what we're starting to do all day in office hours is
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:15.360]   Is kind of a counter to that? I mean we've built quite a culture within what we're doing
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:21.520]   Uh without without being in the same place. It's global and and I think that that that is the
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.200]   The thing to kind of consider is just how you structure it
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.320]   We're now getting to a point where we leave the the post show open
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.040]   We're probably a month or two away from leaving the post show open 20
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:35.280]   You know from the end of one show to the beginning of the next one because there's people just walking
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.280]   I saw that kind of way I knew you were gonna do it yeah
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:42.080]   But there's 20 or 30 there's 20 or 30 or 40 people that are in there all the time
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.960]   Sure, you know if you leave it open we left it open yesterday because we had so many shows
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:50.240]   Every people are doing mystery science theater for the keynote and mystery science theater for what we thought was going to be a music event
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.640]   And then and then they just they literally closed it down to join the evening show
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:28:00.960]   And and so the the thing is is that they you're getting all of that stuff because we're having long
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.120]   Deep conversations except we're doing it with 50 people not with two people
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:10.960]   And so everyone is learning and and and discussing those things among 50 or 100 people at a time
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.560]   And and really thinking through that so it's actually it I don't know
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.600]   I feel like it
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.560]   We're producing as much of a culture as I see in any company that I've worked in
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.240]   You know that that I know that I that I've contracted for which I are a lot
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:27.200]   Let's uh take a break when we come back. We really do need to go through
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:32.560]   I don't we'll never get through all but we'll go through some of the highlights of the event from yesterday
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.560]   Andy and ako
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.640]   Alex lindsey rene richy has the day off
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.200]   He'll be on twit on sunday to talk about this and of course
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:45.040]   He'll be back next tuesday unless apples got so much to talk about they continue to brief him into the next week
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:51.360]   Completely possible completely possible at this point our show today brought to you by speaking of hiring
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.440]   Zipper cruder
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.360]   If you're a business owner who is hiring
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.920]   bully for you that's fantastic
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:04.240]   You know, we just did uh, I looked at zipper cruder for jobs in our area and it's there's like hundreds maybe a thousand or more
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.080]   But
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:12.160]   That doesn't mean it's easy especially for you as the as the hiring person you probably face a lot of challenges
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.560]   You know that that person you're gonna hire is gonna make or break your company in many ways
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.320]   It's a very very important position
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.960]   But it's it's challenging
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:27.200]   Uh, whether it's not enough applicants with the right skills or experience or or just the overwhelm of too many resumes
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.000]   to sort through too many
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.760]   Emails and calls and you got to get somebody hired as fast as possible
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:38.720]   Not knowing how to reach that person, you know, maybe you know that the right person is out there somewhere
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.280]   But how did but where are what job board are they on? Where are they?
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.520]   Really frankly hiring is like trying to find an needle in a haystack
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.320]   That's why I love zipper cruder

[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.360]   I thought actually
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:25.200]   And I did watch the state of the union later the developer tools apple is pitching and i'd be very curious because you had some developers
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.920]   On with you yesterday, Alex the developer tools apple is pitching sound very
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.960]   Interesting and very good
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:39.120]   The xcode cloud which is basically a cicd a continuous integration and and delivery
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:45.920]   System is something that a lot of teams use it's for big businesses for enterprises for big programs
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:50.880]   Um, I think that's a really you know people you try to cobble stuff together with
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:56.960]   You know github or jankins and things, but this is great to have this in the cloud. What are the developers you talk to?
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.360]   Think about it
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:05.920]   Oh, whoops, we've lost ellie's disappeared. Oh, I did see a glass of water. I was just
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:11.040]   Avoid that was very cool. That was kind of like, you know, uh, david copperfield moment
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:15.680]   He's like, oh, it's like it's like it was like shaking the magic baseball and now he now. I'll give us the answer
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:21.280]   So did you hear what I asked you your your earphones headphones weren't in I was just asking what the developers
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.720]   Last night on office hours thought about x cloud
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:32.800]   Xcode or cloud this new super excited cicd environment. Are they okay? Yeah, I mean they they're very excited about it
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.040]   It just it solves a ton of problems for them out
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:39.600]   One of the questions that came up was how much is it gonna cost because they said that the price was still
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:46.400]   Not outlined so it's not it's not free, but the ability to um that there was definitely a
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.800]   Fairly detailed discussion about the ability
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:55.280]   Uh to get that stuff up there and be able to process a lot of that and I think that it's also a precursor to being able to develop on the ipad
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.840]   You know, so well that was my thought as well
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:04.000]   They did announce swift playgrounds that let you develop on the ipad even shipped to the app store on the ipad
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.160]   Uh, again, we're gonna have to look at this
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:11.760]   It looks like it only is stuff that you can basically it's a swift ui interface and so very limited, you know
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.520]   It's a low code environment, but i'm wondering if you add this
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:21.120]   xcode cloud to that if suddenly because the way xcode cloud works your code is in the cloud
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:26.560]   It gets built in the cloud the tests run in the cloud you can have continuous tests continuous builds
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.040]   Uh and continuous delivery
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.440]   Uh, that's a that's for a lot of enter personalization and for virtualization
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:38.720]   You don't have to have all the devices or an emulator. It does it all for you. I think that's a really
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.240]   uh
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.360]   Well, I want to say attractive, but I think it was also in some
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.720]   Environments table stakes and the fact that apple didn't have this
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.960]   Was a was a problem
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.960]   And I think that uh with the purchase of github there
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:56.320]   Was microsoft's got it so yeah, so so I think that there's uh, uh,
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.520]   that
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.160]   There was it was brought up that this is probably eventually
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:06.080]   Not not immediately, but eventually a broad side of github from a from apple to for apple developers
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:13.040]   Yeah, but again, this is very apple centric and uh and github serves a much larger, uh, diverse audience
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.760]   No, absolutely no, it's not it's not going to affect github that much
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.880]   But it's giving apple developers a kind of a customized solution for
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.320]   It's more than github too because it's cicd so it's also
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:30.240]   Uh, I mean it's it's for enterprises is for team big teams. It's not for the the solo, uh person, uh, right in, uh,
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:36.480]   You know, i believe that but it's a lot of the beta stuff is is is going to be easier. Yeah through that as well. Yeah, yeah
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:41.360]   Um, so that's that's pretty exciting. Let's let me let's talk about this
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.720]   Did swift playgrounds feature because I think that that is
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:49.840]   It's kind of like putting face-down on android that is kind of, uh, a big
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.880]   Page turn a big, uh, watershed
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.920]   A big moment a lot of people have been
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:00.720]   Wondering when or when are people when are developers going to be able to develop native
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.040]   iOS apps on an iOS device
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:09.600]   And the ability to write us with write a swift app on the ipad and then not only just test it deploy it
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.920]   But also submit it to the app store and you're done. That's a pretty huge step
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:18.880]   It's not it's not as big as uh, if they brought actual xcode onto the ipad
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:24.320]   Which i'm wondering if isn't we're not going to see in the next year or so, but that's a pretty big deal
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.840]   It all it also turns every single kid who has an ipad
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.840]   Into
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:36.560]   And suddenly suddenly this this kid has everything that they need in order to actually put something under the app store and start making money from there
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.720]   So that's a big big move. Yeah
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.880]   What was the the developers you talked to?
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:49.040]   Um, probably are not the kind of people that would use swift playgrounds on ipad to develop
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:53.440]   No, they're doing heavy duty. This is the folks from ethics home. Yeah, uh, filmic
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:36:00.640]   Audio they're doing low levels audio toolkit. Yeah, uh, yeah, and so and yeah, and we don't and there's a lot of questions
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:05.360]   I don't know how what what apis if we'll be exposed to all apis some some apis
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:10.000]   It looks like it is a low code environment that you use swift ui to kind of create
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.360]   A look and maybe tie stuff together. It's not clear
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.240]   You certainly don't want to spend a lot of time on the ipad typing
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:21.520]   You know hundreds of lines of code in so i'm not sure exactly what that's gonna. Well, no, but it's a big
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:28.160]   Maybe get a keyboard touch. Yeah, but I think I think also though that you really are for people who are informally starting to get into this
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.600]   It does give them a lot of options
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:34.160]   I think that's for us for it's for some kid who's uh learned to code in swift playgrounds
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.680]   And it's then it's kind of the next step up you can get pretty far into playgrounds
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:43.280]   Now you have one more step to go again when you start thinking about building that smooth slope from learning how to code
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:47.040]   To being able to actually be a coder working for somebody like apple
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.680]   That uh, you know being able to
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:54.080]   Pump with an idea throw it together put it up on the app store make a little money make you know, I mean I
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.960]   I was excited about making five bucks an hour shoveling
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.680]   shoveling
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.440]   uh, people's
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.280]   Their driveways in the winter, you know, so you would have you been born now
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.360]   You would have been probably more likely to be coding
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:12.720]   I was coding back then. Yeah, but I didn't make any money doing it. Yeah, and so I would have absolutely been sure
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.960]   Coding for money. Sure. Okay. I was starting when I was 10 by the time I was 13 or 14 years old
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.760]   I was building usable apps and i'm right your app sir for 10 bucks
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:24.080]   Yeah, no, I would have been building yeah, yeah, absolutely
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.160]   um
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.720]   I'm sure you have some thoughts on reality kit too
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:31.520]   uh
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.920]   Oh
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:39.120]   Unfortunately, he's pulled a paper copperfield with his mic. I hit a button there. Yeah, so he was so excited
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.360]   He jumped on his mind. I was like I could do the
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.960]   Um, you know the object capture stuff is is really exciting
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:50.080]   This is this equivalent of what third-party apps have been doing though. I mean you've shown us abs to do this different
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:54.960]   Now, so it's it's a controlled environment. So what apple is done is they they they they're going down this path
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:59.280]   It is not replacing what things like poly cam do and other people have been building
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:04.080]   Because those can get objects, but they can also do captures of entire locations
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.600]   And I didn't really see that with the object capture that they very carefully say object capture
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.880]   And so it's a controlled environment. Okay. We're gonna take a picture of an object
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.800]   That object can be really totally big or small scale doesn't matter as much
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:20.720]   Um, and uh, and it's just making it nice and easy for you to turn real life objects
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.360]   relatively easily into
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.400]   uh into 3d objects that are usdz or obj
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.120]   And and so I think that there's a
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:32.560]   What apple's done is taken something that's taken a long time for people to figure out
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:38.000]   And just made it a lot more accessible. It doesn't even replace the 3d the the photogrammetry apps on the max
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.680]   So there's um, you know reality capture and there's meta shape
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.880]   Those do very complex things that I don't think that this does
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:50.640]   Currently, but what it does do is it gives developers who are who have not developers and individuals
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:56.720]   Who have not um done a lot of photogrammetry the ability to do it relatively easily gives them the libraries
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.680]   They need to not have to do something externally and now
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.520]   It will make it because it's a it's available to those developers
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:08.480]   It will make it available, you know, we could see it in a lot of other places that there's a lot of great
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.520]   Just they just released it today after yesterday's announcement
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:16.960]   Is the the command line tools to do that and that's exciting because that means that you can take a whole bunch of photos
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:22.960]   And have a command line just churn through those you can just build an automation where you take all the photos and you're not sitting there
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:26.160]   Throwing them in one at one set at a time to build them the models
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:32.240]   And so the command line stuff has been exposed. There's great overviews probably some of the best overviews of how to do photogrammetry
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.720]   Of course apple is really good at spending a lot of time on
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:38.960]   Here's why it matters. Here's what you do here are the instructions on how to do it
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.840]   What I haven't seen yet and I haven't been able I haven't had time to go through
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.280]   all the data the data that got posted this morning, but
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:51.680]   What I haven't seen is is the interaction between lidar structured light and the photogrammetry, which is the unstructured
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.560]   And so I think that there's a possibility of
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:58.320]   blending those two together to get a high accuracy of
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.800]   Because the big thing with photogrammetry is first
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.080]   You have to know where the camera was in relationship to the object
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:10.160]   That's the first thing you always do then every pixel makes sense if you know the focal length and you know the
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:15.680]   Where the camera relates to it and where it relates to the other cameras precisely you can now
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.280]   Get an incredibly detailed object out of it
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:25.520]   And so we saw it, you know, it's it's available. We did saw it's working with unity. There was no mention of unreal
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.640]   They didn't say unity a couple of times we were listening for that of course
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.680]   We didn't see it. We didn't see unity didn't get highlighted like they didn't get brought up
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.560]   But they were mentioned a couple times cinema 4d also, which is great
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.720]   And so I so I think that but I think we're gonna see a lot more development of it
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:43.200]   But we're we're definitely seeing this incredible low rollout again around AR
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:48.000]   I mean, I just think that this is the most epic rollout I have ever ever seen a company undertake
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.760]   Which is that we're slowly giving you the tools. We're slowly giving you the training
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.680]   We're slowly giving you a market
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:58.000]   You know and so the folks that are early into it are being able to take advantage of it and turn those objects
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   But I think for and now that it's so easy
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.680]   You're going to see more more of this in education more of it into
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:08.880]   Retail sales because it's a lot easier to do and so it's it's um, yeah
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.520]   one thing you can clarify for me because
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:16.080]   Is this is this designed to be a tool that developers can use to
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:23.040]   Create objects and ingest models for their projects or is this a tool that they can they can
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.480]   uh, they can
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.840]   enable and
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.520]   Grease the rails for 3d object creation for users of the absence they build
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.920]   I think both
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.920]   I'm not certain so I I think that there's a pis that they're giving you to do that and I have to
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.600]   Again, I haven't had time this morning. They dumped everything out this morning
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.040]   That this morning was all about going through my punch list of
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:48.400]   Anything that still had like a red question mark on it like okay
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:54.880]   Yeah, so I'm that's why we had a Thursday we're having another Thursday session for office hours in the evening because
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:59.200]   Because I was like I needed now to have time to read all this stuff and so the um, but the
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.880]   uh
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:06.080]   What you definitely can do is create those objects and that's important for the developers even if it's just creation
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.480]   Because developers are not 3d modelers
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:14.320]   So how where do you get the 3d objects to test stuff with and where do you get it to work with it and and so
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.160]   I have to say that they're quite sure
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:21.040]   I was really pathetic that they I guess I was in the state of the union. They showed him they showed
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:25.600]   They homemade croissant somebody in the team in vane in 3d 3d
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.120]   Modeled and it really didn't look good at a 3d model
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.800]   Then they showed the thing is they're just coming off of it which really didn't look good
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:38.240]   So, you know, there's a way there's a little way to go. I think oh, yeah, yeah, no, it's not but you know
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:42.720]   There's funny the box the shoulder box being modeled that was beautiful
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:46.880]   The funny thing about that box is that every every time you teach someone how to photograph a tree
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:52.320]   You always have the model of box first because it feels really impressive. It's very very easy
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.320]   It's a there's no, you know, there's a red circle
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:43:00.080]   Yeah, the things that get complicated and where you need a lot more photos and a lot more data and everything else are things like occlusion
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.600]   So in my fate when my arm goes like this in front of my body, right?
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:10.720]   The area the gap the cavity between my hand and my body becomes really complicated if you don't have enough photos because you have to represent those
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.440]   And so those kinds of things become much more difficult
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:19.280]   And there's a lot of things like smooth surfaces that become hard and again if if we're starting to incorporate
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:23.840]   The unstructured and structured light together. We're going to end up with something that's magical
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.800]   But we're not we're not at magical yet, but we're in pretty impressive
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:32.080]   So it's it's it's it's it's exciting. I and again, I've been when I started doing photogrammetry. We were
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.680]   Building bot models and looking at a photograph
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.480]   And moving the model so that it would match the photograph
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:43.280]   You have to figure out what the focal length was of your camera and you'd manually adjust it in your 3d app
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:47.120]   Then you put a cube in there and you get it all twisted until you get the position of the camera
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.440]   And then you start modeling from what you saw
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:56.080]   By hand and so the idea that you can do this with a couple photos with your phone is 20 years later is pretty exciting. Nice
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:02.240]   Yeah, that is exciting as soon as I heard them say photogrammetry. I said paging Alex lens a yeah
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.360]   paging
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.400]   Alex lens a
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.960]   It's just going to be you know the the thing that we're we're getting into
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.720]   You know one of the things that I've started to do is put to put 3d objects into keynote
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:14.800]   For my keynote presentations. I have started to use motion
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.000]   So I take a usdz file. I convert something to usdz
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   Then I put it into
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:25.440]   Into motion and then I animate it turning and then I bring it into and then I just bring it in with an alpha channel into keynote
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.680]   And now I have this 3d object and people are like oh
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:30.800]   Look at that, you know like you know, I can you know and
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:35.280]   Uh, but but the that's going to be something that varies, you know
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:39.200]   Not too far away. We'll be able to just drop that object in as a media resource and so
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:44.880]   The this photogrammetry that we're seeing right now that's still a little geeky is going to be something that you just do all the time
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:48.000]   Oh, I want to put that into my presentation or I want to put that on you know
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.480]   And the recipient of that if you think about like pages is able to when it when these things are able to support this
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:59.200]   Even now I can text you a 3d model and when you click on it, it's just going to pop up
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:04.880]   You know on your desk, you know and that happens right now with the phone like there's nothing new about that
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.880]   But when we start going down that that path
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:10.880]   Um, it's going to get exciting because we're just going to think about just the same way we take photos
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:15.040]   We're going to take models of something that we think are really cool or something that you want to fix or other things
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:18.640]   Like that you can just send the model out and it's going to be a very consumer driven
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.960]   My guess is in the next 12 to 24 months
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.880]   The average person will be able to just pick up their phone and create a model and send it to other friends
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.200]   And it won't you know, I know be very highly highly detailed
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.920]   And uh, it'll be something that people do a lot
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:37.440]   Kova in our discord points out that there's a session every day for object capture so apples uh very much
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:44.480]   Uh, you know, giving people developers the option the opportunity to get used to it to start doing it
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:47.440]   It's funny that you should say it. I didn't really thought about it, but uh
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:53.680]   Um, it makes sense that developers don't do this. That's that's something somebody else does so
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:57.520]   Even a lot of animators don't do it modeling is hard. Yeah, like it's
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:02.080]   It's like it's like it's the same as a cabinet maker and it really isn't a lot of ways
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.400]   You have to there's a certain approach to it and you have to be interested
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.040]   And that's all I used to do for years and it's it is a
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:12.080]   Uh, but there's definitely a talent to it or or skill at least that you have to learn how to do it
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.200]   And um, it takes a lot of time to get good at it
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:18.800]   And so in asking developers to generate geometry is not
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:23.600]   Something that they're going to have time to do and so being able to just take photos and put it up there is pretty exciting
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.960]   So uh
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:31.200]   Yesterday create 3d. Oh no today create 3d models with object capture wednesday ar quick look meet object capture
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.000]   friday create 3d workflows with usd
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.280]   Um, and that's all for developers. That's you know
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:42.880]   And this is going to be just explosive for education, you know for a lot of different marketing areas
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:47.360]   Being able to take an object and just pull it up and rotate it around and and you know
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:50.080]   A lot of the things that we feel like we have to go to a conference for
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:54.480]   Yeah, or things that we want to kind of look at it in detail and we'll be able to do that pretty soon
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.920]   Yeah, they're uh, they're doing it with pizzas. That's harder, right?
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.200]   Pizza occlusion
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:04.240]   Nothing like nothing like uh, being able to have a 3d model of a pizza
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:10.320]   Yeah, I did I did notice that in the state of the union they really focused on food. They were talking about how oh, here's a
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.480]   This is a this is a good one. Peace out wood
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:18.800]   Uh, they're really talking about so this is really training for how to do this. Yeah, it's interesting
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:25.040]   And what's interesting here is what they're doing there is they're they're having you just move around and it's taking the photos as needed
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:30.800]   Which is is an interesting process if the if that's what they're doing there, but I think that that's that's what it looks like they're doing
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:37.920]   Um, and it's and it does I it does look like it's flexible enough is 220 to 200 my usually minor closer to 220
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:45.120]   They also there's a turntable so they're trying to show it with a turntable. Yeah lazy susans are really useful for this and
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:50.080]   And you know one of the things we've been using probably for the last uh, and this is where developers can come in
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:55.360]   One of the things that we've done for the last 15 years is motorized lazy susans that are integrated with the camera
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.680]   And we use we started this with SLR cameras
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:03.360]   But you basically turn it on and it just it just turns every 10 degrees and it just and takes a photo as it's doing that
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:08.080]   And you actually can see there there are ones that that curve all the way around and so the camera
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:11.760]   Takes a row and then comes down takes another row and comes down takes another row
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:16.480]   We used to use those for object quick time VR, but now for photogrammetry
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.480]   They turn out to be super useful as well
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:24.000]   They also talk about including them in your in your apps and how to select the right output depending on the the source
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.480]   I mean the place you're gonna play it. I mean this is this is they're really getting into it
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:35.200]   Um, uh, and I hope developers do I think uh, you know, that's one thing that it's been a great demo
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:40.400]   But we haven't you know, we've seen a very you know, besides ikea. It's been kind of a limited
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:45.040]   It's not it's not just a kia though. Okay. I know that's all they're talking about
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:49.040]   There's a lot of people would wait for now. Yeah, well in amazon
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:53.600]   Yeah, you know, so there's you know, amazon's got whole warehouses over in china that are just taking making 3d models
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:59.760]   That's all so they're yeah, so there and the thing is that it's really an important skill for people who are trying to figure out what they want to do next as well
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:05.600]   Uh, this is going to create over time. It's going to create an explosion of demand for these 3d models
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.080]   And you know, it's going to be
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:11.360]   Mind numbing, you know when you know when it when it when it takes off
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.080]   one of the things uh that
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:22.880]   Was kind of the other shoe dropping we've been waiting when when apple fired salcy going from the automator team way back when I don't
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.280]   Know how it may be even five years ago now some time ago
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:30.160]   Uh, it really concerned a lot of us that automator had a you know, a short
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:34.400]   Uh life span ahead of it. Uh, then of course apple bought
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:39.600]   Uh workflow and turned it into shortcuts now and starting to look oh boy
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:44.640]   Well, the other shoe dropped yesterday when they said yes shortcuts is coming to the mac
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:50.320]   And you can import your automator workflow into it. I don't know what's going to happen to apple script
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:56.240]   Uh as sal and others have pointed out many times there's a lot of big companies that use apple script and uh
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:02.480]   Automator automation for pre-press and things like that that would be very upset if apple killed it
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.280]   I don't think they're going to kill it. I think what they're going to do is let it fade away
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:09.440]   And hope that you move your automator workflows at least into shortcuts
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:12.400]   Well, it might be even more aggressive than that. They did say that
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:18.080]   I actually wrote it down as a quote that that shortcuts is the future of automation on mac
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:23.840]   Uh, and they mentioned a trans and they mentioned a heavy transition from automator as though
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:30.880]   The implication from at least the the language that they chose makes me think that automator is not long for this world and
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:39.200]   Uh, they've given it a long time. This is a long. Yeah, I mean and and the thing is if you're a boy shortcuts is so
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.560]   ambitious and it's so muscular a solution
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:47.280]   I look I don't do a whole lot of uh shortcuts on uh on mac
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:51.200]   Excuse me shortcuts on ios because I haven't been primarily an ios developer
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:57.360]   But I do a lot of I do keep up with the reddit about shortcuts and this is pretty amazing solutions that they're making
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:02.880]   Exactly is there they're making solutions that are if if that were an app it would be a useful app
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:10.080]   But no, it's just a simple, uh, it's a simple shortcut that what you really want is api access to all the apis
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:13.840]   Because now you really have a tool it becomes a new language
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:20.240]   Yeah, and they and they made a big deal about how they they're putting shortcuts into their wired up shortcuts into pretty much the entire
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.920]   Macintosh
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:27.360]   Basic OS experience that's serious can control it that find all the finder actions are controllable by it
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:30.000]   So yeah, I mean, it's I think it's a good step forward
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:35.200]   You're right that there are always good the thing is there's and there's always going to be that ones that once let us that
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:42.560]   Yeah, I mean the the the fact that there's a reason why uh, there was that uh certain brother
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:46.960]   Brother h2 hx 20
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:53.040]   Little uh laptop from 1982 are very sell for a couple hundred bucks because there are still a lot of like odd
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:58.480]   There's still like a lot of valve systems that they're controlled via this this 1982 laptop
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:01.120]   And so at some point you have to say
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:03.200]   Maybe you need to get an intern in
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.520]   Get get get get it
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:11.040]   It's time for it's time to change apple script into into a shortcut you will like it that much more
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:12.880]   It'll be easier and other people will be able to
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.120]   Understand how it works and
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:20.960]   Expand the skill set of this thing that's working and apple generally does this pretty gently
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.800]   I mean, it's bit gentle. They turn off
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:26.640]   Yeah, but the but if you look at if you look at 64 bit they were like, hey, we're gonna
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:30.560]   64 bits the future and they're like 64 bits is pretty important
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:35.200]   Then it's like we're doing everything in 64 bit then it's like you need to do everything in 64 bit
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:40.000]   And then it says okay, we're done and that was over five or six years of them to be slowly telling you
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.520]   So we're in that that beginning phase of probably four to five years before
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.880]   Automator and apple script don't work, you know, like that's probably though
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:50.480]   You think it's the beginning or the end I feel like it's the end of the five years that
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.320]   They've been born
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:57.040]   By the way apple script relied on apps putting apple script hooks into the app
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:59.600]   osa script hooks into the app and
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:04.640]   People's I noticed when I look at the dictionaries I can get very few apps now do that
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:09.440]   So I wish to get rich seagull on because I'm sure he still supports apple script and see what he thinks but
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.840]   honestly, I think
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:15.840]   We're closer to the end of that five years than the beginning alleys. I think middle at best
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:19.120]   I think I think we're at the beginning or middle. Yeah, I think that they they haven't been so out
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:22.000]   They haven't been so out
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.720]   Well, we don't know what phone calls they're making, you know, they may be
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:30.560]   I'm saying that that was a slow that was a slow transition that we saw publicly with with 64 bit
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:32.560]   So I think we're probably gonna see the same thing
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:36.640]   Spatial audio and lossless audio now on apple music
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:40.000]   I haven't had a chance to sit down and listen to it
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   And then there was a bit of a shocker that spatial audio is coming to the apple tv
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.240]   What what it sounds so good. I didn't know it wasn't in there
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:55.920]   Can I kind of say that it got it got funny at some point like if you if you were doing like the the apple keynote drinking game
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.800]   And you were unlucky enough to get spatial audio in the drawer
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:03.360]   You were hammered by 12 minutes in because spatial audio spatial audio spatial audio
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:06.160]   We have this new mouse that has spatial audio and he's tired now
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:10.400]   Spatial audio right yeah everything is like i'm it's nice
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.040]   I'm sure you'll work hard on it and you're very proud of it, but
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:18.720]   Wow, let's make sure that there's this content out there and they're devices that are actually gonna make this
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:23.520]   Really, I actually went out and bought their hair airbags max because I felt like if i'm gonna
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.320]   Talk about this. I at least have to hear it and try it
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:31.680]   They're not great. They're by the way audio quality audio fidelity is not great on them, but it's a pretty comfortable
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:37.600]   I think it's comfortable. Um, they have excellent noise cancellation is superb. It's best i've heard
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:40.720]   But if you haven't noticed that what they're really good at is the noise cancellation
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:42.960]   When you still hear your voice just a little bit
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:46.480]   Yeah, you hear the app that mike tells you a little bit about what's going in when you're a phone call
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:50.720]   So you know what you're sending out in a way that so you don't shout the whole time
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:55.680]   Or that you also don't you don't shout all the time as well as you know when you're getting wind noise
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:56.720]   You're getting other things
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:02.000]   It's it's kind of because I have to admit that i'm now taking take all my calls at home with those in the max
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.680]   You know, just they're just comfortable to wear while i'm while i'm in that and but the
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:09.280]   The thing to listen to uh, so apple has done
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:13.440]   I think a really really great job of rolling out spatial audio is that they told us it was coming
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:16.640]   So we were all kind of ready some of us bought the new headphones finally
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:19.600]   and then um, then you know, then they dropped it
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:22.560]   And one of the things they have now on the site
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:26.640]   I think yesterday there was a little bit of a stutter step of them putting stuff up and not going up and
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.600]   Everything else in music, but now it's up there so they have
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:33.280]   They are they have a thing with
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:38.720]   A marvin gay that that is the what's going on and they and they play this
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:41.360]   It's like you're the two and a half minute here the difference tab
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:46.640]   And it is it is the the weekend one is okay as an example
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:53.360]   But the marvin gay one is of what's going on is just a stunning example of what is possible
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:58.000]   So, uh, they walk you through it and they say and it's really interesting they keep on saying the same thing
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.400]   It's like and stereo sounds much better because that's what we that's where we're used to
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:07.200]   They just keep on saying that's what we're used to like that was the past, you know, and and and but
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:12.080]   It's really well done. It's really well done. I'm amazed by how many people actually i'm really shocked
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:16.480]   They've obviously been lobbying hard for the music industry zane low is taking the point on this
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:22.880]   But they've lobbied hard because there's no they're not a surprisingly large number of they even classical music. Yes, they're not
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:26.320]   They're not lobbying hard people want to do this. No, no, no the
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:33.920]   lady gaga's album. I think yesterday or something like that that was listed here as a as a um spatial
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:37.600]   It's an older. I mean back catalog is in the top 50 on apple
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:43.120]   And the reason that that's happening is because of spatial so the music industry Warner and universal other folks there
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:49.840]   Uh, they are they look at this as an opportunity to refresh and generate new revenue with their back catalog
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:54.800]   Revix so so what so what's happening is they're they're we're they have they are remixing everything
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:58.400]   Everything that was a top hit that they have the stems for
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:03.040]   If they have the if they have the old records that have still have everything separated out
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:07.680]   They are now going back to all of that and they're just going to release all of it because it's a new way
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:14.240]   Because there's people now what they didn't have before all they had before was title, you know an amazon music kind of you know
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:21.440]   Um, and so so now they have apple pressing down on this and they're all just like they're it's they're rushing the gate
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:27.440]   And the thing is is that when you get used to listening to it like you just you're like, uh, i'm just gonna wait until the
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:31.280]   I know you know you you at first you don't hear it that much
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:35.840]   But when you hear the if you go back and forth between a stereo and and the atmos version
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.960]   You're gonna hear a big difference where suddenly
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:45.920]   There's actually just more space in your mind to listen to it and hear it and so you'll start hearing more instruments you hear a richer
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:51.920]   Um experience of that entire song that i have to do it on those crappy earpods max is you don't have to
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:57.360]   You could listen on better headphones. We would hear it. Yeah, i'm still gonna be listening to music on these
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:59.600]   Those are the what does the google was
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:05.600]   Those well, this your basic your basic usb c earbuds and the other thing and as always it's going to be i don't care
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:07.760]   How good the lady lady gaga?
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:10.720]   Sounds i want to see if the hudu guru's album sounds great
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:14.880]   Right, well and they're probably they're probably not going to get around to it. It's like well, i mean
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:18.640]   I don't i don't think i'm i'll
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:28.320]   I don't see it being this revolutionary change to how music is mastered and changed and experienced because i don't see it
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:31.520]   As a technology where it's going to be for everybody
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:35.440]   It's going to be for people who have the right speakers is going to have for people who have the right headphones
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.720]   Will you even hear it on speakers don't you have to wear headphones for it to work
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:43.920]   Well, you got a dulbee emos, but so yeah, if you have seven one or five one system
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:49.600]   Yeah, you have a and i tested that i tested that this morning and it's great
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.160]   This is
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:57.840]   Can i can i say this is this is why this show is so great because we have a great spread of opinions
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:05.360]   I'm kind of on your side i'm just saying i'll tell you why i'm so bored about spatial audio i find it so completely not interesting
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:09.760]   We've seen this as a technology as i've taken on you before i mean there was quadriphonic
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:18.320]   Died there was s acd and dvd 5/1 and it died so the industries tried this before now admittedly with apple behind it
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:22.640]   It's apple the number one music story behind it. Maybe that'll make a difference
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.440]   so tell me again
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:30.320]   I really want to be clear. This will work if you have an atmost decoding
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:35.200]   Surround sound speaker system obviously i listened to my apple tb or i just posed it
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:38.480]   I with that minus the atmost part you did it work with you know
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:43.120]   You wouldn't have the above stuff, but that would work with any surround system right that had dulbee
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:49.040]   It should yeah, don't be dulbee surround yet with head phones i'm one too you'd have to have a dulbee decoder
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:53.440]   That you know about your headphones. How would you how would you do that?
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:57.360]   Well because it what it's doing is doing by now. This is something that i
[00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:04.240]   Don't know is my i think it needs to be coded. I don't think it i don't think it does i think that it's using the stereo like by no
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.680]   To figure that out yeah by no
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:09.120]   And so it it'll fold down into by no if that's all you have
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:14.560]   And then it'll do more if you if you have it so in music is a little different than um then movies
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:21.360]   So movies the reason that uh you get at most with movies and when you turn your head it stays where the screen is
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:26.400]   Is because it's using information that's in the arapod pros and in a parlor max
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:32.880]   But with the interesting kind of but but with music i think it can just simply do binaural at that point and you know
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.880]   And so so at that point it's because what we find or what people have found
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:43.040]   I mean this is how this all works is that our ears are not using volume to decide where something is they're using time
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.040]   Yes, so so as as we have if we slightly push this out of time
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:51.680]   It starts to feel like it's around us and we can and we can aim that i will test this tonight
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.320]   I should have done it before the show, but i will test this tonight
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:02.320]   With the arapods max the reason i bought them is so i could test this and then also do it in i have a very good pair of sent hyzers the i.e. 300
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.320]   And it should work and then should i have the same
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:11.360]   Not the same but and i will i will let you know i mean is it make a big difference a little difference is exactly the same i'll let you know
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:16.960]   But listen to that example listen to the the example i'll do the more of it because that that helps separate it out and yes
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.880]   And the thing is is that it's just that the the music industry because apple's jumping on it
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:27.120]   They are just they've turned all the fires up on it. So you're gonna you're gonna see a lot of a back catalog rolling out
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:33.760]   And then in addition to that most artists, you know are always looking for the next thing to do to keep people listening
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:37.200]   And so you're probably gonna see a a large number of people and again
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.880]   We don't have to have everybody be interested in it
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:42.960]   You only have to have a a core percentage of five or ten percent to make it worth them
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:47.600]   Spending a little extra time on it just put it out and as i said the catalog is surprisingly
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.800]   It's not deep but there are quite a few artists and quite a few albums
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:54.400]   Already available on apple music where you really want this
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:00.000]   Like andy was talking about the hoot-a-guru is which would be great, but the one that i really want to see remixed is x tc
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.880]   You know, so i'd like to hear more classical music they only have one example and it's a silly
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.840]   Impressed because it's show pair. Well, it's a guy playing the piano
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:12.720]   I mean what are you gonna do put him in the left and then the right and the left they have jupiter jupiter from jupiter
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.840]   Be a good that's a good so jupiter's there
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:22.400]   But some of the other the other ones the problem with uh the problem with classical in my opinion is is that the way you record it
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:27.760]   You know you keep all the artists in the same place, you know or you know because they have to or they not have to but they
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:32.400]   That's how they play, you know and so they're they're sinking themselves up with each other
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:38.000]   You know while they're playing and so the so the hard part is is that you're keeping those together attracts
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.360]   And so it's harder to spread them out in the same way and so so that becomes more challenging
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:48.000]   So I I find that in atmos i'm i'm really excited about the idea of classical but
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.720]   um, it's not it's not as uh
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:55.440]   Right the places that really work are things that that you can have those separate each of those track
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.920]   Separate separate. Yeah, yeah, the last part they like every but I mean they have many many mics
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:04.080]   But you're still in a large room where the mics are picking them everybody
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.960]   That's just you know, that's for the kettle drums. That's for the trump
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.680]   It's one a lot of times that there's still area mics that are pulling those up too
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:15.280]   And so you know to grab the entire feel of the room and and and that so it's so it is it is more challenging
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:20.800]   I think that love your Jupiter in a real server like you're in the middle of the orchestra. That would be really cool
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:26.960]   Yeah, for me Jupiter. I mean the planets in general and then Appalachian spring is one that I think would be really would transfer really
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.960]   Another great one. Yeah
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:31.520]   It's silly to have a solo pianist
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.160]   Doing chocan in serrem. I don't know
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:40.720]   Not not actually so so one of the things it's interesting about a lot of it is adding reverb into space
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:46.480]   So you're in a room. He's still a point in space where he's playing the piano, but you hear the room
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:51.360]   That's it. You know, I'll play with this tonight. I'm really looking forward to it. Zainlo did a whole
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:57.360]   Explanation, you know, he's the one who does the demos it's going from mono to stereo to to spatial
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.160]   on apple music, but he also
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.960]   has he's he is
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:10.560]   Now the co-head of artist relations as well as a host and he also is pointing out that now there is support for all this in logic
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:13.040]   in apples tools
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:19.600]   And so that's going to make a big difference too. I don't know. I think people still use pro tools predominantly
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:23.920]   But you can you can definitely do both. I mean pro tools is probably the most popular for doing doing surround
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.400]   But I think that logic and even resolve it
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.600]   You know has has a lot of tools that are people are doing a lot of the atmos work
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:36.720]   And the thing is is apples doing what no one else did before which is explaining it clearly giving people clear examples and spending money on promoting it
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:43.200]   And and what it does is it separates apple from everybody else and so the other thing is is it puts everybody every other music service kind of on
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:46.480]   They have to figure out how to how to do this as well
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:50.800]   And so you know they have to keep up and apple forcing everybody to keep up is is going to be
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.360]   part of what we keep on saying zain says artists in the future might even
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:01.120]   Might never even think about making a stereo record because all they've known is spatial and same way
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:04.080]   You know like a modern artist would never think of making a mono record
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:10.080]   It says stereo will always exist. No one is coming in and canceling stereo just like they didn't cancel mono
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.800]   I've got a lot of mono records in my collection and they sound great
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:17.600]   Because they were designed to be heard in mono a lot of people purists say don't listen to the stereo versions
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:25.040]   Of sergeant and also the mono he says music that was designed to be heard in stereo will sound incredible in stereo like it always has
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:29.040]   But now musical find its way to a spatial environment. It's not about the end of anything
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:34.400]   It's about the beginning of something new well and also it the way at most works is that when you put it into atmos
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:37.280]   It'll fold back into stereo and stereo oftentimes
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.760]   Actually sounds better
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:44.960]   Folded in from the atmos then it would if you mixed it into stereo because you put it in all these places on both
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:49.360]   Around the person and then atmos calculates the and puts it back into stereo
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:52.480]   You know from from that point you can still tweak it and trim that out
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:59.200]   But but the the bottom line is is that the stereo comes automatic stereo mono come automatically when it's being produced and in spatial
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:04.560]   In right in atmos. Oh, yes, of course and mono too. You could probably mix it down to mono if you really wanted to
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:12.080]   Uh, all right. So that you know, I think that those are important and uh, it's certainly gonna sell a lot of air pods
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:16.240]   Uh, the air pods the wired air pods do spatial
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:21.520]   Or do you have to have an air pipe pro or putt pro max? No, I think that you should be able to again
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.920]   I think that you'll hear won't be a special
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:30.240]   There won't be but but you'll hear the spatial. Um, I think that the spatial musical work with every headphone
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.880]   I believe um, you know, so that's not an issue. It's the
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:37.040]   Uh, the question it's when you're watching movies and you have that positional where you turn your head
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:43.360]   And it's in the and you know, you're hearing it in one place, but that's happening in atmos for film not for atmos from using yeah
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.280]   Uh, we're gonna take a break come back and talk about um
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:53.920]   Scooter x's favorite feature actually might be one of mine. It makes me want to go buy more max
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.560]   Universal control
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:01.280]   That's uh, that's coming up in just a little bit more of mac break weekly in a moment

[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:48.480]   Monterey not not well, maybe 12 did they I don't think they said did they what number it is is it 11?
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:52.960]   They they they are always referring to its Monterey Monterey Monterey Monterey Monterey
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:58.080]   Uh, airplay to a Mac now. That's nice shortcuts. We already mentioned
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:04.960]   Um, but I I really like this idea and it's really not just a Monterey features an iOS 15 feature
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:07.600]   Of being able to put my iPhone iPad
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.840]   Macintosh
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:12.080]   And my iMac all together my laptop
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:16.640]   And then moving the mouse from one to the other and using the same mouse and keyboard and all of them
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:22.160]   That's you know, you could do that with synergy and other third party tools in the past, but now I'm really excited
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:28.000]   I can also drag files. This means the iPad pro is suddenly I was the right thing to get
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.880]   That's going to be where my photo workflow starts
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.960]   But now I can easily
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:38.640]   After I'm done doing whatever I want to do on the iPad drag it to my iMac for the finishing touches
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:42.960]   That was one of the nicest demos I think apple has ever put into a keynote
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:48.880]   Yeah, because it's like there's not like let's load in this app and make sure you register this device with this device
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:51.840]   Make sure you use monitors to you so that you tell like the
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:58.000]   There's gonna be a host Mac. You gotta make sure that the host Mac knows exactly where the iMac is or the iPad is in
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.800]   Relationship to its own desktop. It's like no, you see I put the iPad next to the thing
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.480]   All I have to do is keep moving my mouse cursor to the right
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:10.960]   At some point it leaves the leaves the the Mac screen and enters the iPad screen
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:15.760]   And if that pointer is on the iPad screen suddenly my track suddenly the trackpad belongs to the iPad
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:18.320]   And the keyboard belongs to the iPad and as you said
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:24.640]   If I got if I've got like if I got procreate and I've got a project that I was drawing and that's that app
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:29.680]   I can simply use the mouse drag it from procreate. Oh my god. I pad wasn't that a cool timeline?
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:36.560]   And if it really is as simple as that where no you don't you have to make sure
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.320]   I'm sure that at some point you have to flip a switch to say yes, please use this feature
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:45.280]   But man, there's just the simp that's exactly how it would work in a movie and then
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:51.200]   Nerns look us would say oh for god's sakes it would never work like that there would have to be some sort of a Christian's thing
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:55.760]   You have to click some buttons. So yeah, that's and I'm absolutely with you. This is the sort of
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:58.000]   faith
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.800]   Leap of faith that I made when I bought the the new iPad
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:04.400]   You don't need the new iPad to do it. I think it goes all the way back to
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:10.480]   I think I think the specs actually say any iPad pro and most machines made in 20
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:13.280]   I think the earliest Mac is the 2015
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:16.480]   Macbook pro so you it will work on existing hardware
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:19.040]   But yeah, this is this is if you bought
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:26.720]   An iPad of any stripe with the idea that you at some point apple's going to make this so well integrated into your desktop experience
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:32.240]   That it is going to be not a case of oh, I'll have to upload something into iCloud then download it from my cloud
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:37.040]   But this will actually be an extension of my of of my digital experience
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:41.120]   This was the payoff. That's a really really wonderful feature and I can't wait to get my hands
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:46.080]   Well, I can't you mean you just having the 12.9. You know, they've had this with duet the ability to share the screen
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:53.120]   Yeah, but this this is you just put it down. It looks like they say no configuration no setup. It just it just works
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.640]   Yeah, they said
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:01.600]   I was reading someone on online who says that they they got some more information about it that it's actually a very very simple hack
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.600]   Where switch does the the feature?
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:07.760]   Well, no the feature assumes that if you're moving this that you know where the iPad is
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:11.920]   So if you're moving you're the mouse pointer off the off of the right hand side of the screen
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:17.600]   That must be where the iPad is or that must be where the next device is and that's where it's going to go to look for it and go
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:20.400]   I don't know. I don't know how it works that way, but
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:25.760]   I think that the the biggest win of this would be if it really is as simple as that where
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:33.280]   If it locates each other via via bluetooth or something that knows it knows where each device is and based on that
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:37.840]   You don't because you've enabled this and in preface. You're good. Here's the fine print
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:47.440]   Available on the macbook pro 2016 later macbook 2016 later macbook air 2018 later iMac 2017 and later 5k iMac
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:53.440]   20 late 2015 iMac pro mac mini 2018 letter mac pro
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:12:04.400]   2019 and ipad pro ipad air third generation and later ipad sixth generation and later ipad mini fifth generation letter later both devices
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:10.400]   This is actually a hint into as to how it's working must be signed into iCloud with the same apple id
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.480]   Using two factor authentication. I thought that was kind of interesting
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:20.160]   I think that's for security, but maybe also a nudge to get people using two factor to use wirelessly
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:27.520]   Both devices must have bluetooth wifi and handoff turned on and must be within 10 meters of each other
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:34.560]   That's the range of bluetooth iMac and ipad and mac must not be sharing a cellular and internet connection
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.880]   You can't be hotspotting
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:41.440]   You can use it over usb by the way, but you must trust your mac on the ipad
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:46.640]   So i think this is going to be this is really the next step from sidecar
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:53.280]   Um, but but i think it's a really interesting step and the more importantly the dragon drop the because
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:59.840]   Really the ipad has felt like this kind of sealed box that it's hard to get files into and out of
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:05.760]   You don't even really know where the files live the idea that you could be in procreate and just say well put that in keynote
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:10.160]   Uh on the mac is really interesting. That could be very very powerful
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:16.080]   The ipad did get a lot of new features ipad os finally gets widgets all over the place which it
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:21.600]   Large large also that but large size special large size widgets that only the ipad can use
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:25.200]   Uh the those are quarter screen size they're huge
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:30.160]   And that's i mean that that was another thing where uh as the first thing i thought about
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:35.120]   Uh would be like how do you we how how easy is it going to is it going to be to use
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:41.200]   Uh to use uh shortcuts inside a widget where you can have these features basically inside
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:45.360]   A large a large widget there and also and also they addressed
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:52.160]   They addressed the horribleness of the of the springboard launcher by giving us alternative ways of setting up
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:57.440]   If there if there are apps we don't want to use we can sort of hide them away by putting them on a special screen and then say
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:03.520]   Please don't show me that screen uh a new uh the the same app bin that will or automatically organize things
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:08.800]   Multi-tasking has been given a big leg much. He was work as much needed. That was not discoverable
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:11.360]   I'm hopeful that this will be a lot easier to use
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:17.520]   The thing they've got that I was really fascinated by is that uh they they they they big they they created a much easier
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.720]   mechanism for doing slide over and yes
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:26.400]   As a little like on the screen. Yeah, yeah, but they also added a new thing then I can have a window that's
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.800]   What they they're actually calling a center window
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:34.880]   And I was looking I was reading through some of their papers on this and this is the first time that I've seen them refer to
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:39.520]   Things on the ipad as windows. So yeah, this is
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:45.040]   Floating above your other windows. Yeah, yeah, and it is a special entity
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:48.400]   It's not as though we're gonna have overlapping windows like on mac OS. I don't think they would want that
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:54.320]   I'm not even I don't even think that I as an ipad user would want that but it gives that extra flexibility like I'm
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:00.000]   I'm navigating through an email inbox, which is the best demo that they showed like I want
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.880]   I don't necessarily want to have to have this whole email share the entire half of the screen
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:10.720]   Without look or with mail. I want to it's okay for it to suddenly straddle both of them and be this window that pops up over there
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:14.800]   But the idea that this is the thing that kind of confused me and that I'm looking forward to playing with
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:20.720]   That they mentioned being able to manage these windows about having apps that have multiple windows
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:25.440]   This is language that I've never seen no apple used before when it comes to ipad o s apps
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:31.440]   That's that's really nice to see how they do it. This is what they say about the shelf you all the open windows for an app
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:37.760]   What and quickly switch between them with the new shelf you can even add and close windows?
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:43.040]   So I thought initially it was workspaces, but it's not it's windows right exactly in an app
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:48.000]   Mm. What is that? How would you implement that? That's going to be very interesting
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.880]   Yeah, like like as though you're creating like new and like if you're in safari
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:59.200]   I'm imagining that's there a lot of windows. Yeah, or to create a different instance of safari
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.320]   That's so so that when you uh when you like command tab over
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:07.200]   Uh to create to go to another space you can have a different safari space going on for you
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:13.680]   It's very interesting right now one of the reasons why I have multiple web browsers on my ipad is because sometimes
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.920]   I want to have separate browser based on my size
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:20.640]   Yeah, and it would be very very interesting if I could do it all in safari and with all the changes that made safari
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:23.680]   It's a very much more attractive proposition than it ever was
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:29.920]   I think this is a direct response to the m116 gigs of ram the the new capabilities of the
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:37.520]   ipad that ipad o s is finally starting to look like a operating system or like, you know, not a content consumption ops
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:40.560]   there the the keyboard shortcuts of
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.360]   the widgets
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.800]   They're they added a whole bunch of new stuff in app switcher
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:49.920]   I think the multitasking is a huge improvement
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:56.480]   Well, and in a lot of ways this is just rethinking the mac os, you know, it's exactly now and it's a new chatter
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:00.000]   Or you have it o s yeah, and they're and they're not I think that they're carefully
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.360]   Watching okay for the future of o s. I mean they're gonna keep on have I think mac os is going to run for the next decade
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:08.400]   But I think that um, well at least the next five years and
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:13.360]   But I think that you're gonna keep on seeing that they're reimagining how you interact with your content
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.200]   How do you interact with your apps?
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:20.320]   How do you interact with those things from the ground up as opposed to how do we make them look like the mac?
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:24.880]   You know, and so it's it's we're gonna keep on seeing that process according to you know reports
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:29.760]   See these as parallel tracks at least for now. I agree at some point maybe
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:36.320]   The idea is there are people who grew up as we all did with a desktop operating system
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:40.720]   And then but there are people younger people who grew up with touch only touch first
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:45.360]   Devices and they're gonna prefer ipad os and they can be parallel
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.840]   Just different strokes for different folks. Go ahead in
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:52.640]   I was actually I was just gonna agree with Alex that that's a really good point because if you
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:55.840]   It made me think about universal control in sort of a different way
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:02.160]   If you think about now the mouse pointer on my mac has parity with the user interface of the ipad
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:10.240]   The ipad starts to feel more like an extension of my mac desktop as opposed to a totally separate device that has that can share certain features and files
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:18.880]   So yeah, that I mean that could be an interesting test bed or test to test case to see how well will mac users adapt to an ios style interface
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:24.560]   Which is very very consumer oriented very very trimmed down very very low clutter no overlapping windows
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:27.360]   But think of it as an extension of a mac. Yeah
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:30.880]   Yeah, they added app library to
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:33.520]   The ability to hide
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:38.800]   Windows or screens so you don't have to have all your apps kind of strewn across the ipad
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:43.920]   I really liked this new quick note feature
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:51.360]   And what they're doing with notes notes is now system wide on ipad os ios and mac os
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:56.000]   And I think the idea that you pull up from the corner to start a new note
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.040]   Which now goes into notes automatically but is also attached
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:04.880]   To the app that you created the note it's a sticky note attached
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:12.320]   To that app or that tab in safari that seems very useful and very interesting
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.320]   I think this might be something people really like
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.880]   it also hints to
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:24.480]   How integrated the ios experience and the mac experience is going to be through all the different stuff you do with other people
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:29.920]   Like the the ability to take this note and now drop it into an iMessage or take an iMessage drop it into a note
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:37.040]   clique clique clique excuse me create these collections of notes that you're now sharing with multiple people that's attached specifically
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.640]   to
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:44.640]   Conversations that you had and you go exactly to that part of the conversation once you click on this this referential note
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:50.160]   So there's I mean there there really the the submarine attack of all this is
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:57.040]   Really making everything work together as though it did to make to make the device that you're working on absolutely irrelevant
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:00.560]   Whether it's it's an ios device an ipad os device
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:06.640]   I mean a mac or at some point at some point you're gonna be dragging you're gonna be dragging things off of your apple watch
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:11.760]   I'm sure I have to say though. I'm gonna probably use safari on the ipad more
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:17.360]   Just because I can attach these notes they stay with the page when you go back to the page the note shows up there
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.680]   It is available in notes everywhere
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:20.960]   um
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:22.560]   I think this is
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:27.920]   This is a kind of a new idea in productivity that i've not seen before I think it's very interesting
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:32.960]   Yeah, they're they're really taking advantage of the integration of we've got the hardware. We've got the operating system
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:36.720]   We've got the apis we can build and we can and we're great and we're creating one app
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:42.080]   Of our own that actually integrates all that stuff together. It's the heart the only heartbreaking thing is that
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:43.520]   Oh
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:47.120]   If you got everything on apple devices it works great
[01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:51.200]   But what do you do when you find those as as a really really important app for you?
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:56.400]   But unfortunately you do have to occasionally go on to windows device or go on to a
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:00.000]   I only use cross-platform note-taking apps for that very amazing
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:05.200]   The problem is is that when you every time you incorporate another operating system you it slows you down
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:09.200]   So like for instance, I have to stream to I have to stream prod um stuff to
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:16.160]   uh multiple platforms and you know and and i'm now slowed down to the lowest common denominator all the time
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:19.840]   And uh, so when we stream it just to apple it just works
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:23.120]   Um everyone else and this isn't because apple isn't supporting something
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:25.920]   This is just because everyone else is very bad at it
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:31.840]   And so the so the um and so you end up having to dumb down what you're doing to whatever that is
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:35.520]   Yeah, but that's the real world Alex. I mean, I would love it doesn't everybody is apple
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:39.840]   Apple doesn't have face time instead of google meet, but I can't make everybody you sure apple
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:42.640]   I like the right sure, but but apple doesn't have to pay attention to that
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:46.880]   Like apple can say they can't know we're gonna make it's wonderful here in the garden. Yes
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.480]   They should
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:54.320]   If they if they want to live in a world where there are people that can't afford a thousand dollars for the entry level notebook
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:59.360]   It would be nice if they acknowledged that there are people with five or six hundred drawable notebooks
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:04.800]   There are people with 250 dollar notebook, but I think that would love to that would love to be able to participate in this group hug
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:08.560]   Or people that I can I can afford a fifteen hundred dollar desktop computer
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:13.040]   But I can really only justify 500 bucks for for a carry around machine
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:18.560]   What I'm not saying is exactly what they're is exactly how they're gonna pursue this
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:22.080]   Which is it's really best if you're using an apple device
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:26.160]   Okay, if you're using android or windows you could be part of the group, but don't expect
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:32.240]   We'll let you we'll let you participate just enough to realize how much you're missing by having a market
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:36.400]   But they're you they're serving the market of a large number of people who are
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:40.960]   Kind of in that fold and don't really just want to have it work and they want it smooth
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:45.600]   And they want it and so when you open that up you're gonna make them unhappy and they're the ones buying your product
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:49.200]   So so the problem is is that is that the people who are buying the product
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:53.440]   The reason that they buy the product is for that ease of use and for the fact that they can throw those things around
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.120]   And there's an awful lot of them
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:59.120]   We can talk about people who want to try to cross platform and they're they are they're out there
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:02.320]   There's an awful lot of people that just stay want to stay in the garden
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.640]   They're pretty happy in the garden and they spend a lot of money in the garden
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:08.640]   And so the thing is is that from an business, you know apple it'd be nice for apple to do that
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:14.240]   But they are not a charity, you know, they're business and the business is is that they is their their business
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:18.560]   Is that you can privately do a bunch of things really easily inside of this whole system?
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:22.400]   If you if you live inside that ecosystem, it just keeps getting better and better
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:26.560]   You know and you know like for instance, I got a new apple tv and the number one problem
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:32.080]   I have with my apple tv is I have to remember what all the stupid logins are for all these stupid apps that aren't just using apple
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:36.800]   You know and so and so like literally it's still sitting there waiting for me to go back and figure that all out
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:42.480]   As opposed to if I just had bought it and I don't know if I will I may cancel a bunch of subscriptions to a bunch of things
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:44.400]   Because I'm just like if it doesn't have the apple login
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:47.520]   I'm just not gonna bother because it's just too much trouble to set about oh, you know
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:50.960]   I'll give you two things one of which will make you very very happy
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.800]   From yesterday
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:56.640]   But the but the the first thing is that yeah, I mean apples they're they're running a business
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:58.480]   They are absolutely fit to run the business
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:02.640]   However, they are the fact that they're being predicted to that one analyst is predicting that they might
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:10.240]   Their market cap might exceed three trillion dollars their valuation sometime in the next year shows that they're they know what they're doing and they have an audience for what they do
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:15.600]   However, they're not it's not so much that this is the greatest business decision
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:22.720]   It's the decision that they want to make apple has never been a really great value proposition when it comes to living in the real world
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:27.040]   At some point you're just going to hit this wall and you're either gonna have to stay behind that wall or
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:32.800]   You know, there are people who are going to have to like switch to evernote or switch to something else because they're probably not going to switch
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:36.160]   To a thousand dollar notebook again for the entry level notebook
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:40.400]   Simply because one of these critical tools that some other people in their team are using
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:44.960]   Uh, don't work again. That's that's and they're perfectly well to do that now as to apple tv
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:52.080]   Uh, did you see that uh that uh a new a new feature allows you to actually use face id on your phone?
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.600]   That was great
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.600]   To log in for
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:02.240]   I'm here. That's me infinity. It's me your friend hpo max. It's me
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:06.560]   If it works, but the problem is as to work across platform and one of these guys
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:13.200]   I can't tell you how many times have to go to showtime anytime.com slash activate and type in my six digit code
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:18.000]   It's like give me a break. I just didn't like I I spent 30 bucks a month on title because I was doing some
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.120]   You know, I wanted to listen to immersive and and listen to the Dolby app most of
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:26.720]   The moment literally the moment that apple announced the cancel is available today
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:29.920]   I literally the first thing I did was go to my phone and cancel title
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.400]   What about your pono play relics? Yeah, yeah
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:40.080]   I'm gonna play on a player. I've got a beautiful one. Neil young's autograph right on it anything
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:46.400]   But I think that take your problem that that a lot of these services don't realize is the is that the the folks that their target market is
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.560]   Bitter about it, you know, uh, growingly
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:54.160]   Uh, and and so that they have to type all that stuff in and so they think I get that they're saving money by doing that
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:56.720]   But there's people like us that are just like I guess can't wait
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:57.920]   I can't wait until apple
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:02.800]   They just wait for apple to do it like I just can't wait for apple to do that so that I can get rid of the one that I have
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:07.120]   And so that's the that's the uh, you know, and that's not the you know, I think that
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:09.600]   Again, I don't think
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:13.760]   As someone who just wants it to work and it's and also on the back end as someone who has to deal with
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:21.520]   The fact that apple now has you know apple tv on uh like for me apple tv on on the tv's installed under the tv's is kind of a disaster
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:26.800]   Because it's just or an airplane and stuff like that because no it's not I now have to deal with under
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:30.000]   No, no, I have to build now. I have to build streams for underpowered tv's
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.480]   You know and so I have to do all this extra work that and then say but I'm way more complicated
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:40.880]   We got to deal with it. You're like prince fart court and his cats. No, no, it's just I mean I have to deal with the plebs
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:46.000]   I don't know. No, it's just that it's just that it's it's just that you work with a bunch of cheap manufacturers
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.640]   And I get that it's a thing, but it's like there's you know, it doesn't doesn't it doesn't have to be
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:54.000]   those those people on one side of the digital divide
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:59.200]   Should not deprecate those on the other side. We didn't make everybody
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:03.200]   But we're talking about someone who bought a fifteen hundred dollar tv and you know
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:06.640]   Do they just better up buying a thirteen hundred dollar tv in an apple tv?
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:10.000]   No, like a five hundred dollar tv
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.520]   The six hundred dollars. Yeah, that's what happened
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:17.600]   And they're and they're still they're still wondering why they spent 150 dollars on a box that does very little more than a
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:19.280]   $50 dongle
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:20.320]   So well, I guess it depends
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:24.720]   You know, I again for the last 10 years. I haven't had anything other than like my interface to
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:27.360]   Everything that I watch is the apple tv
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:30.320]   So I don't have any because I won't let my tv touch the internet because that's crazy
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:35.600]   You know, like it's letting your tv talk to the internet is a not a like this companies are not your friends
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:38.960]   You know, like and so they're they're gonna use your data and they're gonna use a bunch of other stuff
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:43.520]   So you can I interject for one second that there's a in my living room on my big
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:45.760]   My big like hdr 4k tv
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.320]   The wolf the power button keeps like flashing on and off on and off because it's telling me hey
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:52.800]   I haven't connected to the internet in like a
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:56.640]   Upload updates. I fix it by putting some gaffer tape over
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:01.600]   Do not connect your television to the internet kids
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:07.760]   Let apple do it. That is you know, that's a good point, but at the same time, especially now that apple is doing so much
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:11.680]   to I mean so much of what we saw yesterday was about
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:16.320]   integrating other people into your workflow sharing
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:19.760]   that it really does start to
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:22.160]   look like a
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:24.320]   privileged space, you know and
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:29.920]   This is going to be interesting for apple to navigate because I actually think like for
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:36.000]   For instance, I don't think it's an apple's best interest to to get a larger market share because they antitrust becomes a problem for them
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.120]   Well, so it's like, you know, so they lose control
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:44.720]   I mean they they can they're they're they're exactly the right market share to do exactly what they want to do
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:48.160]   Which is what they're doing right now if they decided to go for 30
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:52.960]   Suddenly they have to make a 600-dollar laptop and now they have to they have to
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:57.520]   They have to give up some things that they like having that are unique to apple
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:04.720]   And we saw what happened in the early 90s when apple tries to be yet to know their manufacturer of bh boxes that run desktop software
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:09.680]   They can't do that but there's so it works great in the windows ecosystem because you have choice
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:14.240]   You can no matter what price point you you're looking at you can and no matter what features you want to look at you
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:19.440]   You want to get you can probably find what you want. That's the benefit of windows the benefit of mac is that
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:23.680]   It's a very very simple menu everything on the menu is very very good
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:26.800]   And you know that they're all harm they're all harmonized with each other very very well
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:29.120]   No, and and you know, I mean we
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:32.560]   Apple i'm sorry. You can be a bmw apple apple can be a bmw
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:35.760]   They don't need to be every every different car manufacturer that they have
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:39.040]   You know, mw doesn't also make you know $10,000 cars either
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:44.640]   Yeah, but can I can I can I just point out that this this only caught on the second viewing cray cray cray
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:47.600]   Near the end of the of the presentation cray
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:54.320]   He pressed the magic button that trelt teleports wound up in the basement said she i probably should have just taken the car
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:30:00.720]   Yay, we get that you're being clever and puckish. We like that cray. Thank you
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:04.480]   He always has to sneak a few of those in there. That's his name. Isn't it? Yeah
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:10.640]   Uh, and I took it to mean that really cool as to martin. He was driving earlier, but maybe you're right. I was an apple
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:14.800]   Car we don't we don't do what he was doing. He knew he was doing the whole time
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:20.000]   Uh, all right. Let's talk about iCloud plus because this is gonna be very interesting
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:26.800]   Uh already apple has said by the way iCloud plus will not work in china bellow rusia a lot of
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:29.200]   uh
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.880]   authoritarian
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:37.600]   Countries although although I found something about this morning the south china morning posts has says they have a source that says that it will be available in hong kong
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:44.160]   Interesting which is which is for how long interesting because it's a vpn right? I mean it is it's clearly a vpn
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:50.160]   But better it's kind of vpn plus a little torish in it. So the idea is you have an encrypted
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:55.600]   Connection to the iCloud from your computer or or ipad or I presume iphone
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:31:01.280]   It's anything with the iCloud then then goes through two different relays to further anonymize you
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:06.880]   So you get you get the benefits of a little bit of anonymization plus the encryption of a vpn
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:12.080]   You don't get to choose. I'm sure you don't get to choose, you know, what country you're gonna be in no
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:14.240]   It's about security and privacy
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:16.640]   Yeah, and supposedly
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:19.520]   The the secret sauce in here will not
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:26.560]   Disguise where you're coming from it will give you it will create a location for you that is relatively where you are
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:33.840]   And also there they say that there's a way that it's not going to trip up a vpn if you're actually using a vpn
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:36.160]   It's not going to trip up
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:41.280]   What when I was trying to figure out is what happens when you're trying to use it with an app like
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:46.240]   Like a facebook or something else where it says hey, you're you're logging in from the ip address
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:51.840]   I've never seen before you're gonna have to do three factor four factor eight factor authentication to make sure that it comes in
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:58.640]   Uh, but yeah, there's a lot of details. We just don't know are they using a third party provider? Are they gonna do it themselves?
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:03.360]   Yeah, there the second the the the idea is that apple knows who you are
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:06.160]   But they don't know where you're going they send it to a third party
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:11.600]   Partner and they say that they're going to an outside partner that they say that they're going to be identifying later on
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:15.120]   In the year before they roll this out so it's the third party
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:22.640]   Well known as probably it's probably not vpn they were they didn't say those three letters ever ever and the thing is that vpn is a standard
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:24.720]   That means that they're doing something that's absolutely
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:31.600]   Custom to what they're doing. So this third so this third party the second hop knows where you're going but it doesn't know who you are
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:36.160]   So the idea is that the the the big advantage is that whereas
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:41.120]   I'm sure all of us use vpn's that are trustworthy that don't don't keep information
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:46.880]   And if they were handed a court order to say please let me know exactly what app what Andy was doing through this vpn
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:49.840]   They would say we don't have any of that data. It's not stored anywhere
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:56.400]   That's not true everywhere. The idea is that nobody knows where nobody has the the entire both halves of the cookie apple
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:33:00.160]   Can't tell anybody and their partner can't tell anybody either and the fact that it's
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:04.560]   Part of iCloud plus and it basically happens whenever you're using safari
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:11.120]   That's pretty darn slick suddenly. It's a reason why for iCloud to become an attractive proposition
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:16.720]   It's funny apple has really transcended its reputation as being terrible with cloud surfaces
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:22.240]   You know mobile and then they went through some bad times, but at this point. I think apple is saying no no
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:24.960]   We're good at a cloud. We're good at we know how to do this stuff
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:33.200]   Yeah, I mean it's just part of the there's a lot of I said before that I might have to change like where what my browser is
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:35.520]   And out some other things based on some of these features I've seen
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:40.960]   Male privacy protection is just one thing that was like that is such absolutely such a slam dunk
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:45.760]   The idea of hiding your IP address from magic pixels that are that are sort of tracking you and
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:49.440]   And letting you know letting people know when an email has been open
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:53.600]   That's I mean, it's not unique there are other clients that would do it. Yeah, lots of clients
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:58.480]   But the idea is just baking there. Well, why who wouldn't want that? We'll just bake that right in if they don't want it
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:00.880]   Let's turn it off. That's I mean us. That's a slam dunk
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:03.600]   I think that
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:09.120]   At some point we we get past the slight of hand of all the real little tricks that you have the marketing tricks that people are trying to do
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:11.280]   And we just it turns out if you have a really good product
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:13.520]   You communicate with people
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.920]   You know, you maybe I'll build a relationship with folks
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:19.360]   And I think that that's the that's the trouble that a lot of people want all this data
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.520]   facey hegan botham was
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:25.840]   Bemoaning it because she uses those tracking pixels to know what the open rate is on her
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:31.920]   Newsletter she doesn't charge for it. She lets she knows which articles people read which ones they didn't read
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:37.360]   That's useful information. That's not about spying. She doesn't actually collect any personalized information
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:39.840]   But those tracking pixels are used to give her information
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:44.720]   Constant contact does it everybody does it chimp monkey whatever they're called male chimp male
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:48.720]   Everybody does it
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:54.480]   So those and I think for reasons beyond just saying oh we need to know your name address the serial number
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.560]   It really did know a little bit more about
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:59.520]   This is the problem with a lot of this anti-cookie stuff as well is
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:04.960]   Analytics are lost in the in the mix as well not just add tracking
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:08.880]   But we don't have that we didn't have that before I get that they want it
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:12.640]   I mean I get the people want to have that but you know when I had I had a you know
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:15.440]   I have a I send out an email to 4,000 people a day
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:19.520]   And you know and and I see a certain response to what they're doing
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.520]   You know, I do I know exactly what they're doing
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:25.360]   No, but I have a pretty good idea of what percentage is going to come watch office hours
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:28.720]   And and how they're going to do it and when I had an email list, you know
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:32.400]   I don't know 20 years ago or 15 years ago that had 70 or 80,000 people in it
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:36.560]   You know, I sent an email out and I had a pretty good sense of what what was going to be the response of it
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:39.760]   And I didn't I don't know maybe I could have done it better
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:46.080]   But but the bottom line is is that I mean we didn't have this stuff before and we still did marketing campaigns
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.240]   I mean people didn't have you know, they
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:49.680]   I guess you're all over it
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:53.520]   It's just that it's just that you know producing that content and develop again
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:58.320]   I just think that the developing relationships and you know with your with your audience is going to be important
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:00.000]   It's going to continue to be important
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.160]   And I think that you we're going to continue people have to when we get back into let's be in the real world
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:06.320]   The real world is people turning all this stuff off
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:10.000]   You know, like that's that's what's coming is all of this stuff's going to get blacked out
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.760]   You know, because people aren't going to want to play anymore
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:17.520]   So so that's that's the reality of what marketers have to understand and what they have to figure out now
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:19.600]   Is that they can't just use those tools
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:24.400]   They're actually going to have to have conversations and build relationships with their audience rather than
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:28.480]   You know a transactional relationship where they just kind of send them stuff and measure them
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:30.240]   Like cattle
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:32.560]   I think that's might be a little bit simplistic
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:35.120]   Because the the reason why
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:41.120]   Advertising is a product that ever digital advertising is a product that advertisers love because it's 20 years ago
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:43.920]   They did not have the ability to see I don't want to send
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:48.320]   A mailer to 3,000 people hoping that I'll hear about that
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:50.080]   1.1
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:53.040]   1% of 1% of them will be people who are interested in that ad
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:57.600]   I really wanted to target the people who are most likely to actually be interested in this content
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:59.200]   I also want to see
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:00.880]   Where's where's my money paying off?
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:03.200]   I have a limited amount of money to spend on advertising
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:06.720]   I want to make sure that my god, I'm but I bought I bought this ad on
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:08.960]   On Mac break weekly and my god
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:14.000]   We just suddenly were buying three boats a boat for to stack on top of the other boat for the helicopter to land on
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.120]   This is the this is the product that advertisers want. I'm I don't think that it'll be as simple as well
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:22.880]   Gosh, we can't do this anymore because apples this turning off all these switches on us
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:28.080]   So we're just gonna have to create a more intimate relationship with our with our with our potential customers
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:34.160]   I think I'm wondering what will happen at the at the point where the advertising industry decides that look
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:40.960]   We love you apple. We know we we we we we don't want to we don't want to be have unrestricted access to to users
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:42.960]   Or at least we accept we can't have unrestricted access
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:45.840]   But you're making it real real awkward out there
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:52.160]   And if we don't want to have that we don't want to have a situation in which if people want to be paid based on advertising
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:56.800]   We have to tell these sites you are going to create a here's some code that you're going to be putting into your site
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:58.800]   That says that if these features are turned on
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:04.320]   On safari you will not display your content because we can't make any money off of you
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:07.760]   So you're gonna have to you're gonna have to make some sort of accommodation at some point
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:14.240]   I think there's gonna have to be a negotiation between everybody between the five families of apple google facebook
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:21.600]   And and everybody else to decide is there a way that we can have targeted ads and make them work and actually make them pay off
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:24.000]   The last thing i'll say is that it's a it's a
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.720]   Using the ipad
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:28.720]   Uh, i'm so glad that there's going to be
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:29.440]   uh
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:34.080]   safari plugins for for ipad os because the one thing i've missed so deeply
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:38.800]   Are my ad blockers and this is the first time that i've been getting like ads on my ipad
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:43.120]   And a lot of them are stupid ads that i've nothing to do with me if you if you're going to show me
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:48.000]   Like that that vatar knocks has a new swiss army knife that has exactly the tools i want
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.080]   Okay, i feel stupid, but i will click on that egg because i'm interested in that
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:54.080]   But if you're going to tell me that hey here
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:57.920]   If you got your beach house on a third mortgage we can sell you a fourth mortgage
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:01.360]   Well, like don't have a beach house and i also have an IQ of greater than 30
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:05.520]   So i don't want to actually have a quarterly refinance on my house
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:09.680]   I know i'm not opposed to it. I just think that there's going to have to be a meeting in the mind
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:13.680]   To decide how are we going to get people to pay for how we're going to make this stuff pay for itself
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:19.920]   In a world in which privacy and is becoming much much more in the in people's forebrains from now on
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:21.600]   I think it
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:24.880]   I don't want to go ahead. Sorry when you get a funnel
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:27.280]   I just think that
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:32.000]   That the problem for advertisers is that is the more they have the conversation in public the more gooey it feels
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:38.960]   And so the the issue they're going to have is they can't really argue that much in public because people will be less likely to want them to do it
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:45.920]   There's apples on the is in a place of of leverage because the average user the more you find out about how much you're being tracked
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:50.560]   The less you want it and so advertisers can't really get that public about it because it's icky
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:58.160]   Honestly, what's happening i'll be to be perfectly honest is all that's happening is first parties like apple google
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:03.040]   And facebook are owning all the information and by eliminating third party tracking
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:07.440]   That's all that's happening and that that you are absolutely still being tracked
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:11.760]   It's like the guy who said I don't want to see the tracker when I download your podcast
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:17.040]   I'm going to watch it on youtube and my answer is good. That's great youtube doesn't care who you are
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:20.880]   First party tracking is the problem and that's not going away
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:26.320]   Uh, the problem is now it's concentrated in the hands of just the big five because they're the only ones who could do it
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:32.400]   And so that's not what's happening here. The idea is not we are defending the poor people from tracking
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:38.080]   Uh, there's a hide my email which will allow you to create unique vermandom email addresses
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:42.000]   I guess I presume you're gonna have to use iCloud although this is interesting iCloud man
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:50.160]   Um, and I don't think they mentioned this it says on the iOS 15 preview personalize your iCloud mail address with a custom domain name
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:57.040]   Yeah, that's new and I think that's see if I I might use iCloud as my mail provider if I could have my own domain
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:58.000]   Oh, wow
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.840]   They really they really
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:04.400]   Exactly that they really turned iCloud into something that's worth having from now on not only just be these great features
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:08.880]   But I'm just I I mean call call me a call me a stuff shirt
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:15.600]   But I I can afford $12 a year for it to own andi.com and not go.com. I don't want to have
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:19.440]   Uh, I don't want to have an apple address. I don't want to have a gmail address
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:21.520]   I don't have an AOL.com address
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:26.080]   And that's why I just don't use my iCloud email for anything at all
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:32.400]   So yeah, they've at some point. I don't I don't know who got fired or who got hired
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:34.000]   to
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:40.960]   To take a good hard deep come to Jesus look at iCloud, but they have come to Jesus when it comes to iCloud definitely
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:43.920]   Uh also
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:48.080]   If you have the other thing that apple really opened up and this is because of the alliance
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:51.120]   I believe that they did the chip alliance with the other home
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:55.680]   Automation manufacturers now called matter apple mentioned matter on stage
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:59.760]   Uh, they are going to interoperate. Siri will be on devices
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:03.760]   Uh, if you have a home kit camera apple doesn't make any cameras
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:10.000]   But if you had a home kit secure camera, you could store your video on iCloud unlimited
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.840]   Uh, it doesn't count against your iCloud storage as part of your subscription
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:17.120]   That's a very interesting move as well, especially since it's not their cameras
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:22.480]   Yeah, just to clarify it's not going to be Siri on the devices, but uh audio can
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:27.440]   Like a thermostat can pass audio to your home pod and then sir you can process it
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:30.560]   Will be right passed over to in this safe to wait. I was really excited
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:33.760]   You won't be listening to you
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:39.520]   But you will somehow it'll interact because you have the home kit home base, which is your apple tv
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:43.840]   Have the home pod right? Yeah, you still have to have a home pod and make this work. Yeah, okay. That makes sense
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:50.320]   Um, but it's still an apple is being a little bit more open, which is I think very very interesting
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:56.560]   Uh lots of other gosh. I could just go on and on that. Uh, they did so much in such a short period of time
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:00.400]   Before we leave siri just the fact that they're doing so much more on device right now
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:06.240]   That's one of the biggest complaints that people have had about siri that's so slow and it just is not very very agile
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:11.840]   So the fact that it has the ability now to process so much on device and also handle so many simple commands
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:16.960]   Without having to connect to anybody that means that you're gonna get responses really really quickly
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:21.360]   You're gonna have to be you're gonna be able to have like contextual conversations so to speak
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:24.960]   So much more easily. I think a lot of I think that this is gonna be a big smart
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:30.640]   Upgrade for siri and also and also the the variety of voices that they're adding to it
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:37.520]   So that's no longer siri this lady. It is now I turned on voice voice three mica told me turn on voice three
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:39.680]   It's a very it's a hipster
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:45.760]   Kind of voice. Let me see if I can uh what would be good if I asked it a question
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:47.840]   um
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:53.120]   Oh, I forgot I can't do it that way. What was what was what was fish's third album
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:44:00.800]   I'm turning off my mic. Hey, so unfortunately it heard that part
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:12.240]   This is the new uh is currently clear and 64 degrees
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:18.720]   Expect partly cloudy skies starting tonight temperatures are heading down from 64 degrees to 52 tonight
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:21.520]   That's like a hipster voice
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:28.480]   I like it. He's a he's bright. He's happy. Yeah, sorry to want to it doesn't I always think if siri is a female
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:32.320]   So it's a little yeah that that was always kind of that was always kind of a
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:35.840]   Not a not a not a bad mistake, but it was like
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:39.040]   They could have done if they had come up with siri five years later
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:42.320]   They would have known not to make her definitively a female
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.800]   They would have done something like like the google assistant
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:49.200]   Which is is called the google assistant if you if you want to choose if you want to choose a voice for the google assistant
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:53.840]   We've got them labeled by colors and you decide which which one's it smart. Yeah
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:59.680]   Uh the apple wallet stuff is fascinating to me. It could be something that just doesn't happen
[01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:03.360]   It's just apple being aspirational, but the idea is
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:07.280]   The apple wallet will now store your state id
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:14.080]   And your perhaps tsa in fact the information in a way that I thought was very privacy forward
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:22.080]   The tsa can interactively digitally ask for information. It needs an apple. We'll pass it over to them
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:28.000]   Uh, but but really the idea of ditching a physical wallet. I use my apple pay all the time
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.720]   The question is what states the apple didn't say
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:36.640]   Uh cnet's done a pretty good job of going through what it thinks might be the first states
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:44.800]   Uh, this is Russell holly writing at cnet. He says louisiana might be the first because they already have a digital state id service
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:47.280]   oklahoma
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:51.520]   Uh, della where all of this because they've already got some sort of mobile id
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:54.240]   system, arizona
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:58.720]   Utah hundred people in uta are currently testing the states digital id system
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:02.080]   Iowa perhaps florida perhaps maryland
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:07.280]   So it's certainly going to take a while to launch and then of course you got to get the states to go along with it
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:12.480]   I remember what happened with the covid tracking stuff that nobody used it. So
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:18.080]   Well, my my big question still is that remember that when they talked about this during the keynote
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:21.840]   They were talking specifically about leaving your wallet at home. Not here. Here's a more convenient way
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:24.480]   Like no, you're gonna leave your wallet at home. It's all going to be on your phone
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:29.120]   So what happens when you get pulled over by the cops and they need to see your your driver's license
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:35.840]   Are you going to hand over your phone and let them care let him hear my her carry it back to the squad car and do whatever he wants with it
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:38.320]   Is it going to be unlocked at that point?
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:41.280]   It's there's some things that I'm I
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:44.400]   Have like I think I feel like I have half of the story. Yeah, exactly
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:49.280]   And I hope that apple quote i'm sure apple will clarify by the time it seems more aspirational and something that's really
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:52.800]   Gonna have and we had a we had a discussion about that last night and I think that what we I think
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:58.160]   I think that the the situation with it is that you can put it in a state where you can't get to the rest of the phone
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:03.040]   But you can yeah, it'll sit on the front so you can hand it to the cop and and they'll walk off with it
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:06.640]   You can do that right now with first responders. I hope everybody's filled out
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:13.840]   There are stuff in their health app so that first responders can get your contact in case of emergency contact number and maybe any allergies
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:16.080]   And so for the I certainly haven't I tell everybody to do that
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:19.120]   My question is without unlocking the phone
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:25.040]   If you if you if you use the wallet app to say please display my my driver's license i'm about to hand it over to a cop
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:30.880]   Will it under will it automatically lock up your phone so that it this is this becomes a $1,200 gadget that does nothing
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:35.760]   But show you a show a picture of a state id or is it something we're gonna have to remember to
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:38.640]   Press the sleep button five times in a row to make sure that
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:42.000]   Biometrics don't work and that it can't sure apple solve that
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.480]   For me. I wish they explained that if california adopted it
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:51.200]   But I probably do is put my driver's license in with my red registration have a little envelope
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:55.840]   You know in there like that's what I give to the police officer and then I just I use my id for everything else
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:59.840]   And you know, I think that a lot of us would love to have the convenience of not having to I mean
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:02.080]   I'm down to a handful of cards
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:05.200]   You know like I'm what I'm not out of cards yet, but I'm getting pretty close
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:08.960]   You know to to not have any cards like and frankly there's a good use case for it right now
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:12.800]   Which is a vaccination pass and I don't see anybody doing that either so
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:16.720]   I I think this is one of those things where it would really be nice
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:23.520]   If yeah, and we're gonna give you a way to do it if but I somehow don't think that's gonna take
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:26.320]   And and once again, we talk about the ethics of this
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:30.080]   How can we deploy this kind of feature in a way that you don't have to have a 1200
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:31.600]   Oh phone in order to wake up work
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:36.240]   How about these people who have a 200 dollar blister blister pack phone or or or pay as you go phone?
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:39.200]   Well, they are gonna have to just bring their driver's license with
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:41.280]   I guess
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:43.840]   There are and good work from nine to five mac
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:48.000]   A number of features apple unveiled that will only be available on
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.640]   max with the m1 processor
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:54.400]   Uh if you bought an m1 mac or maybe an m1 iPad
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:56.320]   Uh good news
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:01.840]   Portrait mode on FaceTime or in a moderate will require an m1 lots of processing power for that
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:07.920]   Live text and photos that that by the way is something that both microsoft and google have been doing for some time
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:10.560]   Which is the i'd google calls it their lens or
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:14.640]   We can be happy for apple users if they have it. Yeah, it's not no need to gloats thing
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:17.200]   It's a great feature. I love google lens. I use it all the time
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:20.880]   And i'm so glad that people on iPhones and iPads will get a kiss to use it
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:25.600]   I do love the idea that I could if if I take a picture of a of a billboard and there's a phone number on it
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:30.720]   Select it and press call is very cool if it again if it works
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:34.240]   Um that will live text and photos will only be available
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:42.080]   For m1 the interactive globe and daily and detailed new city experiences on apple maps and one max
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:50.160]   Uh, you know, so it won't be in your car object capture with m math go s monoray users will be able to turn it
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:51.200]   the
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:57.120]   2d images into a photo realistic 3d image that photogrammetry we're talking about that's going to be on an m1
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:03.440]   Uh new neural text to speech voice in more languages only available to the m1 max
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:06.880]   uh, swedish danish nor region and finish
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:09.920]   on device dictation
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:14.320]   Needs an m1 so there are lots of reasons to have an m1 the good news is
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:21.520]   You've you know, but that's going to be ubiquitous soon. I think I was hoping maybe I'd be getting a 16 inch m1 mac book
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:26.000]   Pro this week, but I guess not mac mini
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.600]   Thank god. We get a chance to let our wallets recover
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:34.000]   Actually after buying that ipad pro. I shouldn't buy another computer for five years
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:40.960]   But I just I'm just can I can I tell you how relieved I am that that like my my bet paid off that okay good
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:42.720]   They they really are
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:46.480]   They really are giving the ball to the iPad and sending it down the line. Yes, they were just hey
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:50.000]   No, we've got now you can create your own me emoji on the ipad
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:55.440]   I should have bought at least the 10 inch model and saved myself $600
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:02.080]   Watch OS 8 has a lot of new features portrait. I was surprised to hear them say the number one watch faces photos
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:05.360]   Yeah, how would they know that if they don't track me?
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:08.480]   Never mind
[01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:14.720]   Portrait mode photos. It's the only way it's the only way to do custom watch faces people are doing such such clever hacks to make a custom watch face
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:19.200]   Right, it's not just a photo. They've created a look like a cat's your watch. That's the key right
[01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:24.960]   um, they'll be um, let's see what else I love the the uh gate analysis
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:29.680]   Feature which will tell you if you're starting to get to the point where you might be falling
[01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:38.000]   That's fantastic. You'll be able to use the digital crown to scroll precisely the spot in the message you want to edit should been there for a long time
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:42.640]   Um, oh, there's lots of stuff. There's the new mindfulness. They're adding to breeze
[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:49.440]   They're adding reflect to breeze which will say just think about good things. They'll have an affirmation and so forth
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:52:01.920]   Can we also highlight that they they've they've added a big section in a new section to human interface guidelines all about inclusion good inclusive app puts people first by prioritizing respectful communication and presenting
[01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:07.520]   Content and functionality and ways that everyone can access and understand to help you design an inclusive app consider the following goals
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:12.560]   As you review the words and images you use experiences you offer and it goes step by step by step about
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:18.000]   I mean the bullet list of things that they want people to take a look at is like one two three four like at least a dozen long
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:21.520]   Uh, and this is this is when I when I read about this
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:24.400]   I had to I had to say it on twitter and I said it on I said it last week
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:30.400]   Last week show too at some point either a company cares about this stuff or they don't care about this stuff
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:35.120]   There's a lot of reasons why they don't do things and it can be a very very complicated set of variables
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:40.960]   But at one company the size of apple the size of google the size of facebook whatever they want to do
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:46.240]   They can absolutely do that and the fact that apple does this means that they categorically
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:51.760]   Care about this stuff and that's one of the reasons why you know, I I wish I wish I hadn't spent
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:55.040]   I wish I I wish I I was making four times as much money as I was so
[01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:57.680]   $1,400 for an iPad didn't hurt quite so much
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:02.160]   But I feel good giving my money to apple because I don't think there are a bunch of jerks who don't care
[01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:08.080]   Absolutely agree with you, but I also have to point out the little bit of a disconnect between the inclusivity
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:13.120]   Absolutely apple in that respect and the exclusivity of apples. Yeah hardware of course
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:17.520]   So, you know that and that's why it's a little jarring when apple, you know says well
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:23.680]   Yeah, but don't we don't want to talk to those android people. It's like you're inclusive in one way, but
[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:26.240]   exclusive
[01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:32.160]   And as usual we we believe that privacy is a human right to everybody like a child again
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:36.080]   Exactly, okay, well, we won't get into that but it's like oh, please just stop saying it
[01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:41.600]   All I gotta do is stop saying it like it's the biggest thing that you believe in but that's okay, right? Hey, they're a business
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:47.200]   That's the that's the fact exactly exactly. Uh, let's see the there's new memories on your watch
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:49.280]   I don't know if I want to look at pictures
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:53.600]   On my watch, but you can now little teeny weeny pictures
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:58.080]   They make it really big on the page, but it won't be that big it'll be on your wrist
[01:53:58.080 --> 01:53:59.520]   Um
[01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:05.040]   Sharing photos via messages and mail through the watch is is great. They're really up upping all of that sharing
[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:07.600]   Your watch will be a smart home
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:11.360]   Device more and more you could see your doorbell on your watch
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:14.480]   Who are those people they're so tiny
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:17.440]   Um
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:21.520]   You know that actually is useful though. I mean, you know being able to look at your watch and being able to see the video from your
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:24.480]   That's enough for you to see my nest
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:27.360]   That's how I know I don't step and when there's somebody in my backyard
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:30.320]   I get a notification my watch in a picture true and it's always my cat
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:34.480]   Because speaking little people I I love the I love the new watch face
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:39.440]   They created that automatically harvests from your from your photo reel here are here are portraits
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:42.240]   We will actually automatically create portrait base ones
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:48.880]   And we'll also use the 3d information that we get from the death sensor to put the put your kids face in front of the
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:52.640]   Just in front of the time is not so that it looks like a 3d sort of thing
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:55.520]   That is that is sort of like that's a delicious feature
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:55:01.360]   An apple does delicious features and when you turn the crown that let me see if I get to do that the face is
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:04.000]   zoom in
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:10.160]   You're licking at me now. I think you make a good point and he won't just be faces. It might be it might be your casio
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:14.880]   Wallpaper doing that. So just keep that in mind. So a lot of new features
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:17.280]   going into watch
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:20.320]   Watch is uh, you know part of the ecosystem
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:26.800]   What's interesting they they have not up to now use the uw beach ship that they built into the apple watch series six
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:27.680]   Well
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:34.160]   Now your digital car key if you have a bmw will recognize you as you approach you can unlock the door activate an alarm
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:37.760]   Access climate controls because it'll know where you are
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:42.400]   Will it work on my 1999 mercury stable? No 60,000 miles. No
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:45.520]   Very not do you really have a mercury stable because that's a nice car
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:48.880]   That was my that was my last car and it
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:56.720]   At some point it had too many new england winners. I can totally see you driving a rusty mercury stable around
[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:01.680]   I just I'll you know, I won't try this into a rat hole, but I I love
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:06.560]   You know goals. I love I love fleet vehicles where they're meant to be repaired
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:12.720]   Yeah, made so that parts are always available that I kept it alive for the first 40 last 40,000 miles by they were telling me
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:17.120]   Oh, it needs such such and so okay great. I'll go to the junkyard one town over people walking around
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:19.520]   Okay, great. Here's the part that I need how much is it 30?
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:20.880]   Dollars great. I'll
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:24.960]   I use take some wrenches get some resties get them in and then suddenly you put it back on again
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:31.120]   Oh, jeez pick and pull we got pots all kinds of parts get your mercury stable pots over here at and he's picking pull
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:33.840]   At some point there was nothing to bolt things on
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:38.640]   Those new england winners. I tell you
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:40.800]   I swear
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:44.000]   Uh, there's new features on not just the watch but uh, ios
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:49.840]   As well as macos for focusing to filter out distractions. What are you doing? What do you want to focus on?
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:54.560]   You want to drive? Okay, let's drive you want to do a study break. Let's do it. I think that's great
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:59.840]   This is where apple really does a great job. I think of paying attention to yeah, you're your
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:05.520]   Wellness, you know and once and once again how this this applies to the entire experience
[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:09.440]   We're suddenly in iMessage is someone tries to send you a message. They will be so oh, i'm sorry
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:15.440]   But but but Sheila has is is resting right now unless unless you've said hey, this is an emergency thing
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:17.440]   I've let this person through no matter what
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:24.240]   Uh, and again the way that this ecosystem works together little features like the ability to share something with iCloud
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:31.920]   Air drop those are big features. Those are nice, but the real the real elegance is when you have simple features like that where i've turned
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:36.160]   I've turned off do not disturb on my phone and suddenly it's on my watch is suddenly on my mac

[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:50.080]   Hey, by the way scooter x is found you an excellent 2000 mercury sable ls premium only 82 000 miles
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:52.640]   3995 if you're interested
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:55.280]   It does have the cd changer in the trunk
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:58:01.840]   Uh, I'll have to check it does have leather seats leather seats and keyless entry
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:04.320]   There you go. I don't think that means it was with the
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:10.160]   It also it also has that feature where like it's a sedan, but you can like flap down like the the love that you can flap down the
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:14.160]   The rear seats. Yeah and put and put in a whole sheet of plywood in there nice
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:17.120]   It's a sweet right i'm telling you sweet ride baby
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:20.800]   Anything else what when when you did office hours?
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:27.520]   Alex what were the big yesterday? What were the big people were really excited about anything that we've not mentioned
[01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:31.360]   Health I mean, I think that a lot of the health stuff people are interested in
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:38.320]   Pilates from the from the programmers perspective. I think it was the you know putting it in the cloud
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:40.720]   You know so having actually you know being able to develop in the cloud
[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:44.720]   I think that from a general I mean we spent a lot of time talking about the photogrammetry and spatial
[01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:47.120]   But that's because I'm partially because I'm excited about it
[01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:49.760]   but but the uh, but also
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:54.960]   Yeah, I think that people were bringing up the fact that you know a lot of this stuff can get really interesting and
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:58.080]   It kind of underlines why the privacy is so important because
[01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:04.960]   You can't start talking about medical records and you can't start talking about a lot of those things until you have that conversation about privacy
[01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:10.240]   And until you really tie that all the way down and apples doing that pretty well and and again
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:15.120]   I think that right now there'll be probably slow for people to put all the records into the cloud but
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:20.400]   When you start tying the records together with biometric data
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:23.760]   You're going to start seeing patterns that are going to save a lot of people's lives
[01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:26.480]   You know you're like you're going to see patterns that we don't see right now
[01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:32.720]   Um, you know that that probably agree. Yeah when your gate when your gate starts to change. Yeah, literally
[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:35.600]   I was talking to a developer this is 10 years ago and he said
[01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:38.320]   I can tell what your heartbeat is by how you're walking
[01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:40.160]   Yeah, like he said I don't even need to hear your heart
[01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:41.680]   You know I can tell you what it is
[01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:46.800]   And so the thing is is that is that your gate is changing or your heart rates changing or your blood pressure is changing
[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:50.320]   And I can tell you in six months you have a 90% chance of having a heart attack
[01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:52.880]   Like that's the kind of stuff that's going to happen down the road
[01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:57.440]   Where when you have this and and I think that that's going to be and then when you think about
[01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:03.520]   Um integrating that with exercise integrating that with the other with your diet and health and all these other things
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:08.320]   You know the problem is people don't do a lot of those things because they're complicated and you know and they can't
[02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:12.160]   They you know like how do you figure it all out? Well if something is you know, just works
[02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:14.640]   You know for it. It also starts to make it
[02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:20.960]   More accessible and so I think that um so I think that that's going to be really interesting on kind of new market for apple
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:27.680]   Yeah, yeah, I hope I hope this is a pre we'll see some stuff coming out of the labs that indicate that apple really is moving towards
[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:32.400]   Making the making the apple watch more like the iphone or the original ipod
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:35.280]   Where it it is it is an entity in and of itself
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:42.080]   You don't need to pair it to an iphone specifically and you can bring all of these health benefits and all these fitness benefits to everybody
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:44.080]   Not just people who use iphones
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:46.880]   Yeah, very very exciting
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:49.920]   And it was a great idea like you know, yeah, I
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:52.560]   It's funny. I was really looking forward to hardware
[02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:57.520]   But I also like you relieved that I like that let's see exactly clear on my credit card and yeah
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:00:58.480]   Yeah, yeah
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:03.600]   And if they if they didn't announce like a new new mac mini that had like now it has eight processors and it's going to be
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:08.560]   $2,200 which Andy is home with it which is just about what you can afford like oh damn it
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:09.520]   I know
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:10.960]   Well, good
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:16.640]   I really decided I want a pro mac mini i'm really hoping but I think I think what we may see
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:19.600]   uh is
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:24.560]   Next months, you know that we may be maybe july is not a good time to announce something. I don't know
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:28.160]   But I don't think yeah, they're gonna wait a September now, aren't they?
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:34.480]   I think so and actually selfishly i'm glad because I I have absolutely no regrets that I bought
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:41.120]   An m1 macbook is macbook pro as soon as they came out because I've been getting so much stuff done
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:42.160]   Such a good device
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:44.800]   So that I was not able to do with my 2015 macbook pro
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:48.560]   But but I would have felt a little bit of a geek in my neck
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:50.800]   It's like oh by the way for the exact same amount of money
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:54.880]   Now we have the m2 processor and it has the sd card slot and has all this other stuff
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:58.960]   So at least we get that but you know, I I'm guessing september or october
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:02.080]   I'm some of this is part of no because it chips shortages, isn't it?
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:04.080]   It's I know apple
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:07.840]   TSMC production, but I just feel I don't have every they don't have every chip
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:10.640]   They don't have every component even the panels can be a problem
[02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:12.480]   Yeah, so yeah
[02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:17.760]   So I think that that makes sense that the and you know, they're not gonna announce something in the dog days of summer so
[02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:20.560]   So september
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:22.560]   Yeah, it's it's it's weird
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:27.840]   I've I've been told and I haven't been corrected about this in the past three four years that may is usually a great
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:33.840]   Time to announce a new notebook because that's the time when a lot of buying decisions get made for the for the fall quarter
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:38.560]   And so that's when rightly or wrongly I kind of wonder if this is going to be a time to do that
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:43.440]   And if they haven't if they haven't done it by now, I think that they have no other quarter in order to figure out what they want to do
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:44.720]   Yeah
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:49.680]   The best is to guess all right. Let's take a little break when we come back. Yeah, your picks of the week what yes
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:55.760]   Anything nope. I say no. Yeah. Hey, what a beautiful take a break while I shave my pits
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:02:58.320]   No, I mean
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:04.640]   That's a segue and then let's let me let me let me move the chair up close
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:13.440]   You know, I was talking with my trainer and uh, I we're you know, we wear these I wear these pulse monitor chestband and he said yeah
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:15.600]   I can't wear that my chest is too hairy
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:17.600]   And I said how's your wife feel about that?
[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:22.320]   Although I think chest hair not so bad back hair not so good
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:26.640]   So there are places where hair is a good thing. Their places where hair is a bad thing
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:29.760]   But I want to tell you about the best way to groom
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:31.200]   the
[02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:33.200]   Hersuit man
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:42.480]   Manscaped it's the only men's brand dedicated to below the waist grooming and their brand new shaving tools are just in time for father's day
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:47.600]   Trust me dad will not be insulted dad will be grateful when you show up
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:52.240]   Would look at this. This is actually beautiful. I just took it out of the box. What does it say?
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:55.120]   Yeah, I'm not gonna read that
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:04:00.960]   They do that to me every time you open the boxes and it's whoa, okay
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:07.840]   Uh, it says it's a whole new ball game sort of uh, this is the new lawn mower
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:14.400]   4.0 trimmer now this is 4.0 implies it's their fourth generation and you would be right if you would guess that and man
[02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:20.320]   It gets better and better better. I love the new sculpted shape, which really makes it easy to hold
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:23.760]   It's small. It's not big. It's not heavy. It is a
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:25.520]   7 000
[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:31.200]   RPM trimmer. Why do you want something that fast? Well for a couple of reasons one because less pulling
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:38.480]   You know it it clips it so fast. It just smoothly glides over your skin, but also it's quieter
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:41.360]   You can be I'm holding this right up to the microphone
[02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:47.280]   If I hold it away from mike you can't even hear it. It's moving that fast. It means it's not chatter chatter chatter
[02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:54.640]   It's 7 000 rpm featuring skin safe technology to reduce what we euphemistically call manscaping
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:59.440]   Accidents the new multifunction on function on off switch can engage a travel lock
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:04.080]   You really don't want to have to say no, that's not my manscaping lady

[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:37.840]   Oh muted
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:41.840]   One of the things that is
[02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:44.240]   That we do a lot of the next
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:47.840]   It easier to work with black magic cameras is the fact that it has an open-up architecture
[02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:52.320]   So you can actually program things you're really going to give me to buy one of these aren't you? I know you
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:54.320]   Well
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:58.320]   So it's not I'm not recommending the black I think I've already recommended the whole black mattress
[02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:00.000]   So
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:04.080]   So the but but the but it's one of the big reasons that we like it
[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:09.040]   And one of the things that you can do is it's got a bluetooth built in and there's a lot of different
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:13.120]   Developers that have figured out how to basically talk to the phone
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:15.360]   And talk to the i'm sorry talk to the camera
[02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:21.120]   And so bm cam control is one of the ones that we use we've been using in all the last couple weeks to run the camera
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:26.400]   So basically it'll go in there and it will you can see it or is this this is the one from black magic
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:28.400]   Is this the one that you were talking about?
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:32.960]   Black magic camera. Yeah. Yeah, there's there's a lot of different ones black magic camera control is one of them
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:35.920]   So they make their own but there's a lot of other ones that are developing
[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:41.280]   And and basically what we what's interesting here is that you can control all the bits and pieces of the camera
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:43.920]   There are a lot of them you can check them all out. You know that are there
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:47.040]   This is the black magic one that we have installed on a bunch of our stuff
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:50.960]   But the main thing is is that software will talk to the talk to the camera
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:53.520]   It will get all that camera information back
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:59.840]   And then let you make changes your frame rate your shutter speed your record styles like all the all the interface that you have
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:02.400]   in the camera it will actually
[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:06.400]   Allow you to make changes without having to go over there and so especially like right now
[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:09.120]   I have a camera that's in front of me if I want to change something
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:12.720]   I don't have to walk around and if I put it in a place that I can't get to I don't have to
[02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:15.600]   Deal with that and oftentimes it's a lot more convenient
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:18.640]   One of the things that what's cool about it is also runs on the m1
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:22.480]   So that we can actually what when we send out our big kits
[02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:28.160]   We have a 6k black magic 6k and we have the the m1 that has wingman
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:31.920]   Which is what we run a mix pre-width as well as this this software
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:36.800]   Is what we run the camera with so to be a bluetooth we're able to make all the final adjustments to the camera
[02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:41.440]   We can actually have it hit autofocus. We can do a lot of other things with it in that process
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:43.360]   It's pretty slick
[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:47.120]   And so it's a great little app that you can download if you have a black magic camera
[02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:49.200]   And it's another reason that you should
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:52.400]   You know like it's great
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:58.320]   We we the the big thing is is that with these cameras if you're when you go into that price point and you decide you're going to buy a nice
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:01.360]   Camera to go out and shoot. It's just the flexibility of these cameras
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000]   Is what makes it makes them so useful
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:09.520]   And there's a lot of things about Sony cameras that are great and there's an panasonic and cannon all have great cameras
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:14.800]   It's this open architecture that while this is one the one that i'm recommending is made by black magic
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:18.080]   There's like five or six of them that run black magic cameras. You have
[02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:19.600]   choice
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:22.320]   over over how you want that interface to work and and
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:24.240]   Anybody can build
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:30.160]   Controls for almost all the all the black magic hardware, which is just really really makes it a lot easier for us to for us to work
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:34.000]   But this is a great one if you're in that black magic stable already
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:41.840]   Definitely figure out how to run your camera from your ipad or m1 or phone nice nice
[02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:43.760]   Wow
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:46.160]   Someday i can dream a boy can dream
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:49.680]   I'm telling you you got to move the whole studio to black magic that's oh you already
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:52.240]   You're using
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:55.280]   No, we don't we I have an eight-time old canada
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:11:58.800]   You have a lot of cannons and a lot of old crappy consumer grades
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:03.360]   I'm not i'm not i'm not i'm happy we do use a black magic
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:09.520]   Converters the mini converters that's about that's about it. We use a video up actually that thing without that
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:12.080]   That's the uh 77
[02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:14.080]   in 144 out
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:19.040]   Video switcher that without that i don't think we would have been able to do anything we've done it's all about a router
[02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:21.120]   Yeah, it's all about the routing
[02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:24.400]   Mr. Andy not go pick of the week my friend
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:29.280]   I picked something kind of weird this week because I found it really really cool and interesting
[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:36.160]   Uh, there's a uh adrian black has a youtube channel called adrian's digital basement and he recently did a video
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:43.200]   In which he added an hdmi out to a stock classic mac and tosh like a basic like max
[02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:45.680]   Mac plus mac classic
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:48.240]   Because apparently there apparently there is this project
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:54.080]   This this board that the hat that goes on to resbury pie carl called rgb to hdmi board
[02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:59.280]   That was built for actually for the bbc micro to take the digital signal from there and take it hdmi
[02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:03.840]   He thought hey, I bet there's a way that I can sort of adapt this and to make it work with a mac classic
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:08.320]   And I was a it was a really it's a really cool nicely made video where he's like
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:13.760]   Removing things putting things inside the inside the logic board and it's fun to watch but also
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:15.280]   Um
[02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:18.400]   Emulation of them of classic max is absolutely nothing new
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:23.840]   But when we when you do like a capture when you're trying to preserve the culture of early max
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:28.880]   You're never seeing the the the soft for running on actual original hardware pixel perfect
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:32.880]   You're seeing someone who did a window capture from whatever emulation they're using
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:39.440]   This is actually a way that you can of course hdmi out so you can put uh connected to an hdmi capture and now get pixel perfect
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:45.120]   Uh video recordings of the startup process the speed how like how fast is the disc access
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:50.480]   Really and I really do feel as though like this is part of our culture and our history that now
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:56.960]   If if this technology is put into the right hands, we can now preserve by actually capturing videos of what is what is
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:13:58.640]   What's the what's the play time?
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:04.080]   What's the play of shuffle puck cafe or dark castle like or what was uh, what was it like to try to?
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:10.080]   Yeah, what was it like to try to write an a 10 page document and mac right including all the disc swaps house low was it
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:14.320]   Uh and of course the the funny thing is that the raspberry pie that you put this hat on
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:18.720]   It's got to be at least 10 times more powerful than the mac and fauce that you're actually putting inside
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:23.760]   Yeah, so but so a it's just going to be a fun video for you to watch
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:28.720]   I think for maybe three or four hopefully eight of you who are listening you think wow
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:33.440]   I I kind of would like to do like hdmi out so I could like put this on a big display
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:38.720]   And I can actually like show it to other people or do video capture and capture these projects that I did as a developer
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:45.040]   This is there is a solution now, but we can do non-amulation pixel perfect hdmi out and capture to your mac or to whatever else
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:47.680]   I like the uh on the on the mac
[02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:51.600]   Computer he's the classic too. He's got the price
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:57.120]   Stickers and it looks like the price was slowly getting marked down. Let me see yeah, exactly
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:14:59.280]   I got a bunch of max like that where
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:05.440]   $20 $10 $8 the final price looks like it was $6 and 50 cents
[02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:10.480]   Yeah, so they realize this is a rare collectible people going to be spending $300 for this
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:15.840]   I'm sure so we'll spend $200 for this. Well, it's the economy maybe $100 and at some points like five bucks
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:17.840]   Please just get it out of your ticket time
[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:20.560]   Stickers not included
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:23.600]   Really cool. Very cool. What's the name of the youtube channel again?
[02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:25.920]   Uh, it's called adrian's digital basement
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:30.880]   And if you just look for a adding hdmi to a stock mac and tosh classic you'll find it
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:34.320]   That's a great idea. He looks like he does a lot of fun things adrian black ray
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:37.440]   He is you love these people who are actual engineers who know
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:43.200]   Who is not going to be faced by I know that the mac classic does not have an rgb digital output
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:49.360]   But I bet that there's it's got to be digital somewhere all i got to do is figure out what to unsaulter and what to solder in
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:51.680]   I'm pretty impressed. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty cool
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:56.320]   Yeah, you probably can't well won't be able to do that with modern stuff because all surface mounted and
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:59.200]   Highly integrated so it's nice when you look at a
[02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:07.920]   A motherboard that actually has capacitors on it. It's kind of it's kind of cool to see and looks like stuff is all soldered on by hand
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:09.520]   It's kind of kind of amazing
[02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:15.360]   The sort of board you can fix just by smelling it and when when you smell part when part of the board smells really really bad
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:17.440]   You know that okay. I'm gonna desolder that yeah
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:20.240]   And replace that and see how that works
[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:23.440]   Andi and ako gbh 20 on next
[02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:26.000]   Friday at one this week
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:33.200]   Just go to w gbh news org and you can stream it either live or later and I can guess you'll be talking about the apple event
[02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:36.320]   And we're talking about the apple event we're gonna be talking also
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:40.880]   I'm putting together trying to come up with a list of all the different pieces all different laws that
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:45.520]   About privacy that senate that the republicans and democrats are trying to push forward
[02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:52.400]   And basically using apples template of oh well apple's doing things that google and facebook say they can't do
[02:16:52.800 --> 02:16:56.960]   Maybe we should just legislate them with their butts all the way back to hell sinkie and see how that
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:17:00.000]   See how that makes them happy. So yeah, there's a lot of it's gonna be fun
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:06.240]   I'm trying to think of how I talk about what apple talked about yesterday to a general audience on the radio show because
[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:11.120]   It's fun. Yeah, they'll there'll be a handful of things you'll go. Oh, that's really that'll be interesting
[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:16.560]   You'll you'll appreciate that. I think the note the note the new note integration is might be the most useful
[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:21.040]   Thing, but we'll have to see you have to you have to come up with what's what's the big story about it?
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:26.560]   Right. Yes, it's about it's about making a making a macaron or macaron not a cake
[02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:34.240]   Right, and that's that's part of what makes so much fun. Yeah, well, I look forward to stealing from you stealing from the best
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:40.720]   Of course, Alex lindsey does not have time constraints. He's got infinite amounts of time. Well
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:48.480]   There's only 24 hours in a day. So I guess you're still somewhat limited office hours youtube.com/alexlindsey
[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:54.800]   There's an invite in there if you want to participate. You can also go to the new web page is it get it? Are you getting a little bit more
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:58.640]   Content, yeah, well, we're gonna well right now we're
[02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:04.400]   The web page is really supporting our dub with up DC stuff this week, but then office hours double
[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:07.040]   Global and uh, which one is you the one with a hat?
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:08.640]   Yeah, exactly
[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:12.320]   We're gonna run a runnays that we had we had everybody in there. We were still figuring out Thursday
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:16.960]   We were kind of talking to a couple people to bring him in and so um, yeah, so the
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:21.600]   We had we had a lot of fun and we're gonna again. We're supporting dub dub DC right now
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:27.840]   Uh, and then next week we'll keep on adding more. There's a lot of tools both tools for our our members as well as
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:31.680]   uh tools to find out more about it, but but uh, it's it's a
[02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:36.800]   The beginning it's pretty cool process. Yeah, but everything you need is there including
[02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:40.880]   You can fill out a form saying i'd like to be part of the group you can see what's coming up
[02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:47.120]   Uh this week and so there's a lot of office hours rebuilds right now because we're changing the uh, uh,
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:49.200]   We're changing how we do the show
[02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:51.280]   So we're really building it more towards a broadcast
[02:18:51.280 --> 02:18:54.080]   It was just kind of us all hanging out in zoom until last week
[02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:58.480]   And so now we're building the second hour of that show really becomes much more of a broadcast
[02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:05.760]   And um, and so but a global broadcast where the team that's running it is all over the world and we'll probably end up having
[02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:09.280]   I don't know 15 or 20 people any given day working on the broadcast itself
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:13.440]   Um, and so we're it's a it's a you know, we put out a thing for volunteers
[02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:18.080]   I was like maybe some people will help us do what we're doing and uh, there's over 100 said yes
[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:22.640]   So we're so an hour figuring out how to how to apply it. It's really cool
[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:28.320]   It's really if you had if you had a third hour like the today show. Could I be your cathely and or hoda?
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:34.000]   I feel like I could drink shard nay and get really drunk and be a really bad interviewer
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:38.160]   For a whole hour and just i think i think you should come on more often
[02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:40.160]   Good
[02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:46.800]   It should be fun
[02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:50.480]   Alex lindsey on the twitter a lex l-i-n-d
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:56.960]   S-a-y and of course youtube.com/ and you can see the thing we we streamed with uh with the developers and justine and rene
[02:19:56.960 --> 02:20:02.720]   Yesterday there it's all there. It's all there. It's all there. Well, it's kind of amazing what you can do with zoom
[02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:07.600]   It's like we're doing that. That was a terrific pen. I was so busy doing research this morning
[02:20:07.600 --> 02:20:09.920]   I didn't have time to watch it, but I flagged it to watch it later on
[02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:14.160]   That is a that you you've really put together a murderous row of uh of talent last night
[02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:18.000]   It was I would I would love to participate, but my god
[02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:22.480]   It was it's gonna be great to just be able to watch that it's such a great value created
[02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:25.200]   Yeah, it was it was um
[02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:27.840]   You know it got to a point. We just had so many we
[02:20:27.840 --> 02:20:33.200]   Exactly, you know, like we were we were we we had that we wanted to leave enough space for the developer
[02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:41.360]   Oh, no, no, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that way, but I bet it was sometimes sometimes like like you're like a rock musician at a concert saying
[02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:43.440]   You know, I really would have loved to be up there jamming
[02:20:43.440 --> 02:20:47.360]   But it's so great to be in the audience to be able to enjoy and watch this as an audience member
[02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:51.760]   And that's what that's what so many were shows are the other thing you do and I you must have a lot of volunteers
[02:20:51.760 --> 02:20:55.840]   But because I always have wanted to do this, but it's just so much effort is you've got all of

[02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:14.240]   So as we're doing it, it's just like boom boom boom boom

[02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:39.760]   actually four
[02:23:39.760 --> 02:23:43.360]   The primary benefit is the knowledge of you're keeping twit on the air and you're supporting us
[02:23:43.360 --> 02:23:49.920]   But secondarily you also get ad-free versions of all our show ad free and tracker free audio and video

[02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:02.400]   Fun on the discord
[02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:05.520]   Uh, and that is a private discord for members of the club
[02:24:05.600 --> 02:24:10.240]   Which is part. I think part of the reason it's pretty good is because it's just it's just fun people in there
[02:24:10.240 --> 02:24:13.280]   All of whom are are serious twit fans
[02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:15.760]   And there's a twit plus feed

[02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:24.080]   I'll give you an example of a club event that's coming up this sunday
[02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:30.880]   Uh, microsoft's got a big gaming event coming up. They're going to be talking a lot about the future for microsoft gaming x cloud
[02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:36.080]   Xbox and so forth, uh, and we are going to live stream that in the discord
[02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:40.880]   So because it kind of overlaps with the radio show, we're going to do it in the discord
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:44.480]   So we'll have a video channel open there. We'll have the stream. I'll be there
[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:49.920]   Uh, I know I hope many of you will be there and we will make that recording available later
