[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.600]   I don't know, we're gonna say Apple's gonna be doing apparently.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.800]   We might be seeing an event this month.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.400]   Also, why are people walking into walls at Apple Park?

[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.800]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we talk about the latest news from Apple,
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.800]   without the news for which the news would be the news.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.400]   Mr. Renee Richie of the news.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.400]   I'm learning.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.400]   We make the news, Leo, we don't need you.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.000]   We just invent it right here.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.400]   When news breaks, Renee fixes it.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.400]   We break, yes.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.200]   I never heard that one before.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.800]   I got to tell you more American jokes.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.800]   Imore.com.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.800]   Thank you for being in the house, as they say.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.400]   Renee is joined as always by Andy Ennack.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.400]   Go from the Chicago Sun-Time CWOB.com.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.400]   We could not possibly be more than news unless Huey Newe Lewis were fronting us.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.200]   That's how news we are.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.200]   I want a new news.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.200]   And look and lo and behold from the nation's capital.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   It comes...
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   Alex, Lindsay, you're looking good.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.200]   Andy was joking.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.400]   He said Alex looks better when he's not in studio.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.400]   It's true.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.440]   Well, see, in studio, you have a whole studio here.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.400]   I just have a whole bunch of lights that are all dedicated to meat.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.000]   It makes it better.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.400]   You get a bunch of crows together.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.200]   You call it a murder of crows, a pod of whales.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.280]   When you get a bunch of white men together, you know what you call it?
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.280]   A pod cast.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.280]   Yes.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.160]   And here we are to talk about Apple.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.640]   Look, I just got the new Apple Hub.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.480]   Apple Hub 2 is out.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.560]   And it's a beauty.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.560]   It's gorgeous.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.240]   Actually, now in stereo.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.760]   So what will they think of next?
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.760]   Those guys.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.760]   Those beautiful.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.760]   This is...
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.240]   Patrick Delahandy brought his...
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.640]   I think this was Apple's first attempt at speakers, the computer speakers.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.560]   Ported bass, I could see right there.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.360]   There is a ported bass and powered speakers.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.400]   And yes, as with all old Apple gear, they've yellowed with age.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.400]   But they sound...
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.400]   You have Jack.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   You have hardware.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.400]   What is it you're supposed to rub on that to get the yellow off?
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.680]   A peroxide solution that you can get at a hairstyling salon.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.360]   And then you wrap it in plastic.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.880]   And then you set it out in the sun.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.880]   In the sun to reach.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.880]   A direct sun.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.880]   Like a bone.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.880]   Exactly.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.160]   Let us convene.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.920]   At this point, we're in the...
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.920]   There's a news cycle.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.480]   Apple has a news cycle.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.720]   And Abin Aflow, so to speak.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.560]   And we are at the point in the news cycle where it is rumorville, rumor central, nothing
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.200]   but rumors.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   Rumors and bass.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.200]   That's all we've got.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.920]   And it would be irresponsible not to talk about them.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.120]   Well, I don't want to.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.040]   I love this time, Leo, because it can be anything we imagine it to be.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.840]   Apple could release anything that we want to talk about.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.400]   And Mark, when they actually announced it, we're constrained by reality.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   And that's terrible.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.400]   But now it could be...
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.880]   It could announce a coffee maker for all we know.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.760]   That's why the stock rises on the expectations and drops on the announcement is because we
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.800]   can expect everything.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.640]   And then it's going to be huge.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.920]   Before we get to the Apple news, I do want to eulogize a great man, a man who meant a
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.800]   lot to my generation, and who died exactly as I want to die at the age of 92 with a whiskey
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.400]   in front of the Oscars, dissing somebody's gown.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.600]   We're talking about Russ Solomon, the founder of...
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.840]   That was really one of the best ways to go.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.120]   Isn't that a great way to go?
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.880]   He asked his wife, "Hey, honey, get me some more whiskey."
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.960]   When she came back, he was gone.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.960]   It was just a way to go.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.960]   And you know what?
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.960]   He was a legend.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.240]   He created tower records.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.160]   And I know you worked at a record store, Alex.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.200]   So you know how important tower records was to America.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.880]   I went to tower records every Saturday.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.800]   I used to go to school outside of Philadelphia in high school.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.200]   And there was a tower records on South Street.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.640]   And I used to do something that worked somewhere so that I'd make enough money to buy one or
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.640]   two CDs a week.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.640]   And so that was the big thing.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.880]   It was like, "What CD am I going to get?"
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.200]   One week it would be Peter Gabriel's Sew, the next week it would be a police album that
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   I already had.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.640]   And it would get, you know, those types of things.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.680]   And so I remember going...
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.280]   Tower records was the reason I went to Philadelphia every week.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.240]   So it was definitely a key part of, I think, a lot of our backgrounds.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.840]   If there was a tower record around you, it was basically like the Walmart or Amazon of
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.280]   music at the time, you know, before we could have everything mailed.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.840]   I mean, I guess the Amazon would be whatever is the Columbia Clearinghouse, which is...
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.080]   Which by the way, it was great when you're in a dorm because they couldn't catch you.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.080]   So you just ordered 10 and then you just said...
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.080]   Just move.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.720]   The tower records really was the first record store for our...
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.320]   My baby boomer's generation.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.640]   It wasn't square, did have listening booths.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.640]   Actually, they did.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.800]   The early tower records did.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.600]   I remember in San Francisco, the kind of the legendary tower records.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.840]   It started in Sacramento with that one on the corner in San Francisco where they had
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.160]   just record after record after record.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.640]   It was just an amazing thing.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.360]   So Russ Solomon, he went out with the...
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.320]   Exactly the way I want to go out.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.720]   That's just it, right there.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.520]   Watch the Oscars with a glass of whiskey.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.920]   Moving right along to some Apple rumors.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.920]   That was the news.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.920]   The most madness.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.920]   And now the rumors.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.240]   This is Ming Chi Quo, KGI Securities.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.000]   He says, "This is the one that really blows my mind.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.400]   Apple's planning a more affordable 13-inch MacBook Air."
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.920]   MacBook Air for this year with a lower price tag.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.920]   Now I think you can do...
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.920]   What is the lowest the Air can go for a thousand, right?
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.920]   So that'd be a sub-1000 dollar.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.120]   It has been $8.99 for the 11-inch.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.120]   Yeah, 11-inch version.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:16.400]   I like this idea because the Air is beloved by many even though it doesn't have a retina
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.120]   display, but it has a better keyboard in my opinion than any of the current Mac laptops.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.000]   And if you can get it down to 8.99, 7.99, this was a very...
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.920]   I think a good product for schools, right?
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.200]   For education, Apple doesn't really have a good choice for education.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.600]   Well, blue, my mind is I was recording with Ben Beheron on Thursday and I put it in the
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.400]   lead of the show and he says, "If Apple could take the existing MacBook Air at a retina
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.160]   display, modernize the specs and sell it for $9.99 or $8.99, they would just annihilate
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.160]   the PC industry.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.680]   They would take share like nobody's business."
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.760]   And then I know I added the episode, took my time, put it up on Saturday and three hours
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.120]   later Ming Chi Quo.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.920]   Maybe he was listening to the show, that's where he got the idea.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.920]   I don't know.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.920]   No, I think this is what we're hearing in the industry trends.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.920]   I doubt it.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.920]   Yeah, and it's a lot of...
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.760]   Let's get the optimistic and then we'll get the pessimist.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.760]   So start Alex.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.120]   It's a lot of what Apple's done in the past.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.400]   It's a lot of what Apple's done in the past, which is to slowly spread out.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.400]   And that is one of the last vestiges of low cost that Apple hasn't been able to get to.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.560]   It hasn't been able to make the laptops much cheaper than they are.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.280]   If they can get down into the $7.99, $8.99, I don't know if they can or not.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.360]   But if they can, it would do a lot of damage in the industry.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.720]   It's telling that Apple has not yet killed the air.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.440]   We thought for sure the MacBook had supplanted it.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.600]   The fact that they had the same rumor yesterday.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.600]   If German says so, must be true.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.040]   Okay, Andy, you don't think so.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.400]   Now what would you say?
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.640]   Oh, no.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.680]   I think that the air is super long in the tooth.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.880]   I think that it's like two years overdue for an overhaul.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.120]   But it's a really, really important computer.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.560]   It is the buy-in.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.120]   It is the lowest level buy-in for a MacBook.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:05.520]   And so as a concierge into hopefully will be the next 10 or 15 years of spending $1,000
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.520]   to $2,000 on Mac laptops, it really has to put its best foot forward.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:16.160]   So the fact that you have the best hands down, the best keyboard in the entire port of...
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.720]   The portable and desktop Mac line, that's nice.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.760]   But we're finally at the point in which when you see a non-retina display, it's like,
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.880]   what is the CDR drive doing in this laptop?
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.320]   It just seems so chaotic.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.800]   And it's going to need upgrade support.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.680]   It's going to need to be better, better, better.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.400]   When I was saying that my skepticism wasn't that they're going to be updating the MacBook
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:50.400]   care, it's that I don't know how much hurt that will put on the Windows market by really
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.960]   what they would be doing by dropping the price of a...
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:10:01.680]   Creating a retina MacBook Air at, let's say, $8.99 is finally getting within $100 to $150
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:07.560]   of what Windows users have been able to buy in a pretty similar form factor for at least
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.040]   the last year, year and a half.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:15.640]   TCLs for books have been kind of iffy, but Intel and Microsoft really got their act together
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.800]   with their latest generation of chips.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.480]   And as of about a year, year and a half ago, you're getting the battery life, you're getting
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.440]   the build quality, you're getting a touchscreen.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.360]   So I think that Mac people will continue to be Mac people when those people will continue
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.840]   to be Windows people.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.600]   And the people who have no allegiance will say, I would much rather have another $250
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.760]   in my pocket than necessarily have MacBook Air.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.680]   There's a couple of things that I thought were super interesting too.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.920]   One is that it looks like Apple made a series of bad bets.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.480]   When you go back and look at the Mac Pro, they built themselves into that thermal corner.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.480]   And now when you look at the MacBook, which was supposed to lower in price the way the
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.440]   original MacBook Air did and replace the MacBook Air the way that the MacBook Air replaced
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.360]   the MacBook and just the core M series never really took off and the components that Apple
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.760]   used remained relatively high in price.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.960]   And just like they're reconsidering the Mac Pro, it's like they're reconsidering the MacBook
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:02.960]   Air.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.760]   And I think the comment about hurting the PC industry is not in terms of market share because
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.760]   that'll never change.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:11.960]   But the PC, the ultra book ASPs were slowly building after a year of them all living like
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.840]   years of them living on sustenance trying to struggle to survive.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.560]   They were finally making a little bit of money on it because there was no other really compelling
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.560]   offer.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.800]   Apple tends to take a lot of the premium market share when they do have products in those
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   categories.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.200]   So if Apple re entered that market with a premium product that was priced in that range,
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.320]   I think the profits would would re-shift.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.720]   I love Tim's idea of putting a retina screen in it.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.720]   They kind of have to.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.720]   I don't think so.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:42.880]   I really, particularly in the past year, year and a half, the Mac UI is really tuned towards
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.880]   retina.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.880]   It works.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.920]   It's a, the San Francisco font is wonderful in how flexible it is on whether you're putting
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.320]   it onto a 720p display or whether you're putting it onto a tiny watch or whether you're
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.280]   putting it onto a big screen.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.440]   But at some point, at some point, it even becomes a problem where where are you going
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.320]   to source these relatively low resolution panels?
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.360]   You can't really get competitive pricing if you're just, if you're, if you're the one
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.680]   person that has, if you're the one outlet that is still shipping machines with this kind
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.200]   of low resolution display.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.040]   Remember the merits of this display, which is better battery life, right?
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.560]   And I would think they'd be cheaper, although it may be that that's not going to be the
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.560]   case.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.920]   Yeah, as they become rare, they become more specific.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.600]   It's 1440 by 900.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.760]   I mean, it's not a terrible display.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.480]   It's HD, but it's not impressive.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.080]   And I should point out there are a lot of PCs sold with similar resolutions.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.160]   This is not, you know, but for a hell of a lot less money.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.720]   Yeah, less than a thousand.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.720]   It just comes with an OS.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.160]   Comes with an OS that people want.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.160]   Right.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.520]   You know, we talk a lot about the hardware, but it still comes down to the fact that there's
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.640]   an OS that people want to use that have a prior, you know, that would use if they could
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.280]   get, if they could afford it.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:03.480]   My point of view is that the Mac community deserves a really good $899 laptop.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.200]   And I really hope that they're going to get one in the next week or two.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.840]   Or so there'll be 1300 in Canada, but I'm getting used to that.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.840]   Now next week or two is interesting, Andy.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.680]   You're hearing those rumors too, I guess that there will be something this month.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:23.360]   Yeah, I'm really bullish on this now, particularly because it's hard to find iPads now.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.240]   And a lot of companies are putting out really, really good deals to clear out existing in
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.240]   inventory.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.560]   So I'd be really surprised if there weren't something really close by that's certainly
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.360]   going to influence iPad purchasing.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.360]   Wouldn't be in that.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.560]   Would it be an event?
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.120]   No, I don't think so.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.120]   They just announced it.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.320]   I think they just, would there be a new iPad pro?
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.680]   Would they update the iPad pro to look like the iPhone 10?
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.400]   Because that would be, I think that'd be event worthy.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.880]   I don't know if they're ready for that yet.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.880]   Maybe not.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.040]   It's super interesting because the iPad has bit like there was, they did that once that
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.040]   quick do over for the iPad three when it had that bad GPU in it and they rushed to get
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.040]   the iPad four out.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.040]   That was less than six months.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.880]   But it's traditionally been a year to 18 months for the last few times and now we're only
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.880]   nine months out.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:09.260]   But there are things that the iPad pro is lacking like the A11 processor, which is really
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.280]   significant upgrade over the A10 and things like the new design.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.320]   It wouldn't be exactly like iPhone 10 because an iPad is a different beast.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.800]   You don't necessarily need maximum screen because you want to be able to hold it comfortably
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.280]   and you could do a lot of fancy palm rejection, but you still don't be able to lift it up
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.040]   off the table, hold it, not cover up half the screen with your hands all the time.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.680]   Would you get rid of the button, the home button?
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.680]   I would get rid of the button.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.600]   I would give it Face ID, like the, at least the true depth camera system.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.640]   I mean, there's a lot of things they could do with it.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.440]   It's just a question of will they do it?
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.800]   Because if they wait too long, people like, oh, Apple's not updating the iPad.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.080]   If they do it, and I must learn like, Oh my God, I just bought one.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.080]   You're horrible.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.080]   True.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.080]   You destroyed the iPad that I just bought.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.080]   True.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.320]   I remember the kids are, my kids are upset because I can send them emojis and they can't
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.320]   send them back.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.800]   So this is becoming a, there's a lot of drama.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.640]   Well, I would imagine it's a mission at some point for Apple to get all its iOS devices
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.040]   on the iPhone 10 platform, right?
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.040]   That's the future, isn't it?
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.040]   I don't mean the notch.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:08.800]   I mean, you know, the UI, the home button, less UI, Face ID, yeah, you're right.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.240]   You're going to get an edge to edge screen on an iPad, but you could get a bigger screen.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.400]   You could get a more edge.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.320]   There's this old, old LCD that you can do now.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.760]   Like you can pull the big thing with the old is that you could curve them around and
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.040]   put the controllers underneath so you can really go edge to edge.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.040]   Apple's not going to do that for years.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.120]   Apple's not going to, Samsung will do that next year.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.280]   Apple's not going to do that for years.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.880]   No, no, I mean, by foldable, it's like the iPhone 10 has a foldable OLED.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.640]   So it goes underneath and connects in.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.640]   Oh, I see.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.640]   And that's how it goes edge to edge.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.120]   Yeah, but you don't want that as you point out quite rightly, you don't want that on
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.800]   a tablet, you need ears to hold it.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.360]   Maybe the size, you know, you just want a little bit of comfort in that device.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.240]   But I mean, there's Apple watch bands.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.800]   We usually get those in March.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.920]   If there's a new iPhone SE, who knows if there is or not, but the iPhone SE was introduced
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.720]   in the spring and I had you long in the tooth, isn't it?
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.320]   And I want a red iPhone 10 Leo.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.280]   I mean, I want Andy's purple iPhone 10.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.800]   That was the only thing they announced last year at this time was a red iPhone.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.800]   The red iPhone 10.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.800]   Red iPhone seven.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.800]   Sorry.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.800]   That's enough.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.680]   I mean, they've got a bunch of Android phones coming out and people care as much about a new
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.680]   color.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.920]   They do about a new design or a market B scratch our surface.
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.920]   You find more surface.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:15.120]   I rushed to buy the Samsung Galaxy S9 in lilac.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.120]   I just had that.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.120]   I got that.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.120]   I got that.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.120]   I got that.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.120]   And it's nice.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.120]   Yeah, it's pretty.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.120]   It's purple.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.120]   You friends don't have.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.120]   It's our show that you have the new one.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.320]   It's our Mac break week color.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.320]   It matches.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:33.400]   Actually, we'll have to tune the set to match my know we won't.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.400]   So I'm excited.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.560]   I'd love to see new Max.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.560]   Will we see a Mac mini?
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.680]   That's really long in the two.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.120]   Why don't they kill these old products?
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.360]   Why do they let them drag on?
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:47.120]   You're saying they're selling a three year old computer as brand new products unless they
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.360]   actually want to kill the product.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.120]   Otherwise, they just the last version of it live until they put a replacement out or
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.120]   the other.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.120]   Give it some love.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.120]   Apple.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.120]   Come on.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.120]   Seriously.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.120]   I mean, I'd definitely love to see an update.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:02.080]   I think that for what we use the Mac minis for, we have probably, I don't know, somewhere
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.680]   between 12 and 15 of them.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.600]   And they're rack mountable.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.600]   We can stick them anywhere.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:11.920]   You know, we have two of them in a per per one unit and we use them for all kinds of glue.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.320]   You know, like you can get things that, you know, we use Spectre and ScopeBox and all
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.440]   kinds of other things that we review.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.400]   You process, they're fast enough for what they're doing.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:26.040]   And so as a result, I think that we still buy more of them because there's nothing else
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.320]   that really does that except that runs the apps that we want to run.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.080]   So I think that they fill that space.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.880]   I don't think Apple has to update them.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.480]   People will still use them.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.440]   But if they did, we'd probably update a bunch of them because, you know, we'd have USB
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:42.120]   C and, you know, faster processors, that kind of thing, but it's not necessary.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.800]   I think that's why they can probably hang on to them for a while.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.520]   Yeah, I don't think Apple particularly cares about the Mac meaning, but the fact that they've
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.600]   got the engineering done, they got the tooling done, they got the machinery done, it's a
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.640]   really inexpensive thing now for them to continue to make.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.160]   It'll be super expensive for them to make something to replace it.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.160]   And I don't think they care.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:08.160]   But I haven't seen external signs that they care enough about that part of the market to
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.800]   say, you know what, we're going to give you something the size of an Apple TV or an Intel
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.800]   Nook.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:19.880]   We're going to give you a really wonderful compact Mac experience at a really good price.
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.840]   I don't think they really care about that, which is a shame because I do think that the
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.920]   Mac Mini is one of the most important computers in the entire lineup.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.560]   The paraphrase the way that it was explained to me, it's like they care.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.960]   It's like Phil Schiller really, really cares about the Mac, but it's the vegetable garden
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:37.400]   in the corner of the back and he's fixing the roof and he needs to redo the asphalt and
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.560]   the hedge is overgrown and he's going to get a ticket.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.280]   And it's just, it's one of those things that, you know, in a perfect world, even nothing
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.520]   else to do, you'd love to sit there and do your vegetable garden, but you have 19 things
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.320]   on fire in the house and you're just busy putting them out.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.120]   And it's no excuse they should absolutely update it.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.000]   It's just, it's a structural, cultural issue that they've faced since they were a tiny
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.120]   company only doing one thing and now they're still a company built like a tiny company doing
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.120]   a ton of things.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.680]   Maybe they need an iOS division and a Mac division.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.200]   I mean, how hard could this be?
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.160]   Well, I think that part of what we...
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:14.120]   I think that it's not by accident that Apple has got a huge educational press for Swift
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.520]   for precoding.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:21.520]   There is, you talk to any tech company and finding engineers that actually are really
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:27.880]   good at what they do and understand the architecture and write clean code is something that is,
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.240]   most of these companies have hired most of them.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.840]   So if they can get them into the country, you know, and if they're not, they're outsourcing
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.600]   it to the folks that can, you know.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.600]   And that's part of the reason that they open offices in other countries is because it's
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.720]   hard to get them back into the United States and they, you know, there's great coders in
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.120]   Eastern Europe and in Asia.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:51.440]   And so I think that there's a lot of resource constraint.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.000]   You know, you just really get to a point where you're, you know, Apple's competing and it's
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   not about money.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.280]   It literally is about the fact that there, if you're really good at, if you're, you know,
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:07.120]   highly skilled, highly trained computer engineer, you're probably working somewhere.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.520]   And I think that that's the problem is that they can just, you can only do so much.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.960]   You can only turn, you really can't turn it to 11.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.480]   They're in about eight or nine and they just, there's no other people, which is why everyone's
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.520]   worried about education.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:22.800]   Google does it, Facebook does it, Apple does it, you know, whether, you know, all kinds
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:28.080]   of education programs to try to increase the supply of the labor because it's not even
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.440]   constrained by, by how much they're willing to pay.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.440]   They just can't find them.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:36.280]   So you guys are basically saying it's not for lack of wanting to do it.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:41.120]   It's for lack of ability to stretch, you know, to find enough engineers to stretch.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.120]   You don't want to stretch.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.160]   It's number eight on the list and number one and two are incredibly important.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.760]   I stick with the relative term.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.760]   They don't care.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.280]   I think that I'm more with you.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.480]   And they, because they made a lot of effort to make the home pod.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.520]   They have people.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:04.360]   They decided to do a $12,000 gadget watch, even though it required them to create new
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.720]   high security tables and market towards a market that they've never sold anything to
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.720]   to before.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.400]   Again, I don't, I don't mean that they don't care about it.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.160]   I don't mean that they, if they, I don't believe that they were driving home after work
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:21.160]   and they saw a Mac mini on the side of the road on fire that they could drive past and
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.160]   feel nothing.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:27.080]   I mean that if they thought that the Mac mini was something important to them, they would
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:32.680]   be really excited about having a, they would be a little bit ashamed that this thing has
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.880]   languished for so long.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.440]   And they would be really, really super excited about making sure that there's going to be
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:45.400]   a slot at WWDC for, yes, yes, here's the, here's the $5,000 Mac for, for developers
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.600]   who have good credit ratings.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.120]   And here is the really super powerful Mac mini for people who are probably going to be
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.120]   paying for this with cash half of that in your old nickels.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.120]   Yeah, they made it.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.000]   I mean, to be fair, they did make a very nice iMac Pro.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.960]   That is a very nice Mac.
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.960]   It's a very nice.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:03.960]   For the cost of $3,000.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.160]   And it's also, it's a chicken and egg problem.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.160]   Like I bought a new Mac mini last year because we wanted to do a series on Mac mini for iMOR
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.000]   and it came with Yosemite.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.080]   And I don't know if it's because people aren't buying them.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.240]   So they're not updating them or they're people, they're not updating them.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:21.720]   So people aren't buying them or yes.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.400]   New, here's another fabulous story that's going to kill me.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.720]   New patent hints that Apple may be getting rid of physical keyboards entirely.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.120]   No, they're not going to do that.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.160]   Your grandkids would have keyboards, Leo.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.160]   I hope so.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.360]   Yeah, I know this is why we don't really pay attention to patents.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:43.400]   But you know, maybe this says something new with iPads or something.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.400]   I don't know.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.520]   In an imaginary world, you know, Apple had a courier like device that would open up and
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.520]   have two screens.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.720]   You might occasionally want to use one of those screens as a keyboard nation.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.240]   Exactly.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:56.240]   And that's a really intriguing idea that if they, I would love for Apple to run with that
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:02.240]   idea, it's such a natural fit for a content device and also a productivity device.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:09.240]   And they've already kind of done a really good job of creating a flat, flat, flat, flat
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:15.240]   keyboard for the iPad that has minimal touch but is still quite usable.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:20.240]   And if you said that we're going to give you a second, a second, a second version of
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:27.240]   screen so that you can use, you can, so you can literally have two apps and two windows
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:31.240]   side by side as you're working and dragging things between them, all the different ways
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:37.240]   you can create new paradigms for research and for creation with two kinds of screens.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.240]   That's such a great idea.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.240]   I would love to see Apple go with that.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:45.240]   What I'm really interested in is less than the keyboard, which I think that they probably
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:52.240]   are not bad, but what I'm fascinated by is the possibility of them having all kinds of
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:56.240]   really interesting interfaces that could be put on that second screen.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.240]   So I can have, if I want to be a DJ and I want to-
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.240]   That makes more sense.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.240]   Or final cut.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.240]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.240]   That makes a big touch bar, in other words.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.240]   It's a big touch bar.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.240]   Right.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.240]   Well, it's a big, it's a big whatever you want.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.240]   So basically the app designer designs your interface on how you're going to speak to the
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:17.240]   computer screen, and that might be drawing, that might be wheels, that might be, you know,
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:22.240]   think of final cut not being constrained to a keyboard, you know, or any app.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:28.240]   And I think it would open up an entirely new area of interface design to have just a screen
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.240]   that is just another window for the interface.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.240]   Even Photoshop or anything else could be a really interesting way to do that.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.240]   I would still hope that they would at least give us a Bluetooth connection so that we
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.240]   could still use a regular keyboard if we wanted to, but-
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.240]   I'm sure that's-
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.240]   This is just a pad.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:46.240]   But I realized, I was discussing this with someone on a plane yesterday, is that I type
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:51.240]   on a glass screen more than a regular keyboard now, mostly my phone.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.240]   I mean, I type really long emails with my thumbs at this point.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.240]   But I realize that, you know, so it's not like I've never typed on it, although I complain
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.240]   a lot.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:05.240]   I still don't like the flat keyboard, so I don't think I'll like the glass one either.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:10.240]   But- and I don't sound like I type essays on my iPad, but also that's the whole like how
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.240]   it's set up and where the screen is and all those things, I think, make a difference.
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.240]   But I'd be really interested in creative interface design.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:21.240]   So Renee, when you talked about Ben Behren, it sounds like he thought there would be
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.240]   an event this month.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.240]   I wouldn't discount the possibility of an event.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.240]   It's hard to tell because Apple has Steve Jobs' theater now, so there's much less
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.240]   logistics involved than having an event that's of appreciable size.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.240]   Thank you.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.240]   Tim Cook had basically come downstairs and say, "Let's have an event tomorrow."
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.240]   No, I mean, totally.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.440]   They could do like fly every- like they've done before where they just have you on the phone
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.840]   or they tell you to come to like New York or Cupertino and talk to you or they have
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.960]   an event and they have the ability to do all these things at scale now.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.680]   And one of the things they've been doing again is like they're not going to wait a year
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.400]   just because you have to wait a year for iPads.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.080]   They'll push them out when they're ready.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.000]   They'll push out the MacBooks when they're ready.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.520]   All of these things, it's just a question of timing for them.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.640]   So this Intel's roadmap lineup, can they get things done?
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.960]   Do they want to go to the effort of doing it?
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.240]   All of that is super interesting.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.440]   And they have the flexibility now to do all of it.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.920]   You think they might even say Mac Pro?
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.880]   I mean, I think they're a little bit shy now after having-
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.720]   We haven't heard any rumors at home pod.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.480]   Yeah, we haven't heard even heard any rumors.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:21.600]   Pre-announcing is- I think they've burned a lot of pre-announcing.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.200]   When you announce the Mac Pro, you announce it by saying it's for sale tomorrow.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.680]   And also, WWDC feels like such a fit for the Mac Pro.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.680]   I mean, that's what they did with the 2013 Mac Pro.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.680]   So that's in June, right?
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.680]   So that's three months off.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.680]   I'm also sure in the blue.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:37.120]   It's really 2013, so that's going to be 2018, five years later.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.560]   Yeah, it's going to be something new.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.560]   Wow.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.560]   Maybe.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.120]   They're going to have a story to tell when they release the Mac Pro.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.320]   Well, that story-
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.320]   And it's triangular.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.480]   We made it a talking-
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.040]   They're going to talk at my Mac Pro.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.040]   They're going to remember-
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.040]   Remember, remember, they put up-
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:59.840]   They were- This was such an inflection point for Apple Design that they put on this borderline
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:08.520]   embarrassing dog and pony show with Gruber and four others say, "Look, you're in the
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:13.440]   secret part of Apple that no one's ever seen before and things are covered with sheets.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.400]   And yes, I know that we could have just called you and told you the same.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.280]   There's nothing that we're telling you right now.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:23.240]   But trust us, we're really doing something great with the Mac Pro.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:28.800]   So I think they're going to use this as an example of here is what we understand about
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.320]   the use of a Mac Pro.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:34.040]   And here is why we built this the way we did.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.800]   And here is why it is shaped like a banana and there are no ports because you're just
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.680]   supposed to imagine things with it.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.400]   I'll have John turn us out there looking all in the Dr. Macdreamy and then everyone will
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.400]   just flutter and buy their new Mac Pro.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.480]   Well, I mean, this would be in the next few weeks if they do something this month.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.480]   That's me.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.480]   That's March 6th.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.080]   Well, that'd be soon.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.640]   They've been going later in the year.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.480]   Originally they did the first week of March and the next event was Middle March and the last
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.080]   event was March 21st.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.280]   And again, it could be nothing but I think that we'll at least see they've been doing
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.560]   March at Apple Watch bands every every spring.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.720]   So at the very least do not buy a new Apple Watch band right now.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.520]   Well, no, no, buy them now because you won't be able to if you really like them.
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.520]   They take them out.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.520]   Right.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.320]   Somebody was in here with the rainbow band.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.320]   Beautiful band.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   You can't find them.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.920]   They're hoping for a reissue this year.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.520]   So, okay, for people like Renee who collect what I collect the whole set.
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.440]   No, but if you seriously, if you see an Apple Watch band you like they don't.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.040]   They don't do unlimited stock of them.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.040]   They don't keep them around forever.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.040]   They're very seasonal.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.040]   So if you like it, you buy it.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.920]   I'm really liking the Velcro one.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.920]   What do you wear?
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:40.080]   It's like I'm wearing the cuff again, but the Velcro one is like the sweatpants of the
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.080]   Apple Watch.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.080]   The most comfortable.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.240]   I got three different ones, three different colors.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.240]   That's so great.
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.400]   Yeah, I really like it.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.400]   It's kind of me.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:52.320]   Like every time that I visit my local Apple store for one reason or another, it's like
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:57.400]   I know better than to ask the person I'm the who's helping me like, wow, it is a.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.920]   Do you have any more of that watch band that you're wearing?
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:04.560]   Oh, no, the special peach with the gold class was only available for two months, like last
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.200]   year's we don't have anymore.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.000]   Like just a new rule you can wear whatever you want when you're not on duty.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.040]   But when you're on the floor, only get only where stuff that I could buy because they're
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.040]   cool.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.040]   Now we'll want one.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.080]   It's like watching Steve Stratton Smith hunt down all the Steve Troughton Smith.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.360]   So I hunt down all the remnant bands on Twitter.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.360]   He just collect.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.360]   eBay.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.360]   eBay bands.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.560]   I think that I have this very transient view of my my thing is I'm going to buy another
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.120]   one next the next time they release one.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.320]   So I'm always like, I got the cheapest one that I can get and I got, you know, I don't
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.320]   even change the boy.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.960]   Well, it does rank because I'm looking at this piece of Velcro that I spent what is it?
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.960]   $60 $50 for.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.240]   I mean, that's all profit, baby.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.800]   That couldn't have cost him anything.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.880]   But it's a rankles a little bit to buy Apple brand watch bands, but frankly, they're better
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.160]   than the third party bands.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.160]   I don't know why.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.160]   And they didn't make them.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.800]   There'd be nothing for the third party is the copy.
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.440]   And it's a little like having a new watch.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.440]   It is.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.600]   I I I now wear my Apple watch every day.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.560]   Thanks mostly to drafts.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.560]   Thank you, agile tortoise.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.560]   What's his name?
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.560]   Dan Gilbert.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.560]   Is that his name?
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.560]   Greg Pierce.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.560]   I don't know who Dan Gilbert is.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.560]   Greg Pierce.
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.640]   Thank you.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:15.000]   And but also the activity monitor, although it's not the best activity monitor on the
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   market.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.680]   There's some really good alternative choices that do a better job, frankly, but just
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.640]   all the package is nice.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.080]   And then you then for that you have to have the phone and then well, if you have the
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.080]   phone and you have the Mac and it goes on and on and on.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.080]   They're smart.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.640]   Yeah, I think it's the I don't think that Apple has hit a home run with any part of the
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.560]   watch other than a lot of singles, you know, and enough singles.
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.560]   It's enough.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.560]   Right.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:41.560]   It's hard.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.560]   That's a good way to put it.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.560]   It's not it's not any one thing.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:45.200]   It's it's you know, it's just like, ah, you know, the notifications work.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.200]   I turned most of them off because they drive me crazy, but I, you know, I have a certain
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.640]   number of them that pop up and the and the tracking is good enough.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:56.240]   And it's just it's like there's other things that do each one of those better, but no one
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.080]   other thing that does each one better.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.560]   So to the point where you just, you know, you kind of go for it.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:04.440]   I've been hearing confusing rumors about the AirPods.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.840]   I heard a rumor that Apple's going to do high-end headphones, but then they're over
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.360]   the ear headphones, which they already do with beats.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:14.000]   And then I heard a rumor that they're going to do something new with the AirPods or maybe
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.320]   they're going to pick AirPod like functionality in over the ear headphones.
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.600]   Renee, what the hell is what?
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.560]   Tell me what the real rumor is.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:27.040]   So Apple has this whole team of really, really good audio engineers and this huge, huge audio
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.840]   lab now that we saw when they were talking about the HomePod.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.120]   And that's where the AirPods were developed, where the speakers for the iPad Pro were developed,
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.800]   where the new iPhone speakers were developed.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.320]   And that team just loves to work on this stuff.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.800]   So they have AirPods and they're working on next generation AirPods that would have
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.400]   things like water resistant.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.840]   So it won't matter if you sweat or you're out in the rain and they'll have a, you know,
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:51.520]   dangest built in it so you will tap them in order to some and we just use the command
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.520]   word if you want.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.480]   But they're also working on another product that takes the sort of quick pairing ability,
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:59.680]   the W1 or the next generation W1 chip, which I don't know what they're going to call it
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:03.520]   because W2 is already in the Apple Watch, but W1S or something.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.160]   Put that in there and then take the acoustic engineering from the HomePod.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.800]   So it would have really like a more high end, more acoustic, more studio quality listening
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.600]   experience, but it would have like the super Bluetooth pairing capabilities.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.640]   There's an opportunity there, isn't there?
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.120]   And I think Beats is a very differently position.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:24.520]   Like Apple can afford to have Apple's own set of like, these are our earbuds, our earbuds,
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:29.640]   our AirPods and our whatever studio pods or whatever they end up calling them.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.840]   And for them, it's again, they've reached the point where it's hard to sell more iPhones
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.040]   because there's a limited amount of people on Earth.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.520]   So all you can do is start selling more stuff with the iPhone.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:41.240]   And when you look at HomePod and AirPods and things like the studio pods, whatever they
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:45.480]   call them, that is a way to sell more things to people who already have iPhones or iPads.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:51.000]   There are rumors, this is Mingchi Quo again, that the HomePods are selling very disappointingly.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.920]   Not the last month they were overselling.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.720]   Last month they were overselling this month or something.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:01.120]   Well they sold really well on day one, but that doesn't, that does not a successful product
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.120]   make.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.040]   I think there are seasonal like the holidays they do gangbusters and then people don't
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.360]   really think about them again until a new phone comes out or the new holiday season comes
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.360]   out.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.840]   But the HomePod really is such a limited market.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.840]   Oh, sorry.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.840]   I thought you said AirPods.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.840]   I thought I'd love these.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.720]   No, everybody should have, if you got an iPhone.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:21.840]   I was just about to say, I mean, Apple missed a huge opportunity by shipping them after
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.840]   December.
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.000]   I think that's going to be more interesting to see what happens when people are talking
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   about that.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.720]   But it's going to be more interesting to see what happens when we're in that season
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.320]   where people are willing to spend three or four hundred dollars to apologize to a loved
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:38.160]   one for how bad you had it created him or her over the past year.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.240]   Because it's a good idea.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.920]   But really, it's a really nice product for that kind of thing.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:50.480]   And as usual, again, people are saying that it's underperforming sales-wise.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.000]   Well, again, according to who's standard.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.840]   So wait a year.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.840]   See if people are still talking about us.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.840]   See if Apple is still showing actual interest in the product and then we'll talk about that.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:04.560]   I wouldn't credit it because you hear the iPhone 10 wasn't selling one.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:09.240]   I wouldn't credit it except for it makes sense to me because this is a product that does
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:10.600]   one thing really.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.600]   It works with Apple Music.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.760]   It has artificial in their own.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.040]   It's a very limited market.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:20.760]   So I wouldn't expect it to sell well until they update AirPlay 2.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.640]   If they add more country, it's going to sell in those countries again.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:27.640]   Well, I think that it was a brave thing for Apple to do because the right thing to do
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:33.080]   is the right thing to do was to wait until they released the speaker.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.040]   The thing that would have sold a lot more is to sell it when they said they were going
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.040]   to sell it.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.040]   Right.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.040]   Oh, no, that's right.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:44.080]   And so they gave up millions of sales by selling it, by doing the delay that they said.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:48.480]   And a lot of people bought, let's say, the Google Home Max or the Sonos One instead because
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.480]   that was on the market.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:54.040]   Yeah, people were very pregnant to buy something before Christmas and they were ready.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.560]   I mean, everybody's getting speakers.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.040]   Everybody's got something going on.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:00.720]   And so Apple had to get something out because they were going to lose that market.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:06.520]   I mean, once you get one in there, your kids learn to use or your parents learn to use
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.480]   whatever is sitting in the house.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:14.280]   And so my parents have an echo because the speaker wasn't available.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.280]   And so they love.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.280]   So they don't need anything new.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.520]   They're quite happy with that.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:27.160]   I want to correct myself and thank you, Renee Ritchie, the Safari team, apparently got a
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.720]   whole different day and said, "Tell Leo."
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.640]   PWA is coming to Apple.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.920]   We're talking about progressive web apps, which I'm very bullish on.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.800]   A lot of people say, "Oh, we've seen this before.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:45.040]   It's Electron or it's the original iPhones web apps."
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:51.080]   But there's a technology that's kind of exciting that Microsoft and Google are very much behind
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:56.320]   for creating a website that then downloads caches on your phone, uses service worker
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:02.760]   on your phone to become an offline on-phone app.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:06.840]   And to me, the only thing holding this back was lack of support from Apple and I was wrong.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.720]   So Renee, thanks for passing that along.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.560]   The current beta, is it the beta?
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:13.560]   What is it of Safari?
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.560]   It's the purple Safari.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.560]   The purple one.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.560]   The purple one.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.560]   See, I stopped using the purple one, so I didn't know this.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:22.200]   And apparently, a beta of iOS also is going to support this.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:30.280]   It sounds like fairly good support for service worker and maybe even some additional features.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.200]   There are three features that you have to have to be a PWA.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.560]   You have to have a web app manifest, which says, "Here's what you need to put on the
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.560]   hard drive.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.960]   You need to download and store.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:43.360]   You need to cache APIs so you have that storage and then you need the service worker," which
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:48.880]   is running in the background on the target device, on the host device, to provide kind
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:54.880]   of application-like services so that this once a web page really is running as an application
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.880]   on your phone.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.840]   I think the idea would be it's cross-platform.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.480]   It's a website that you go to mobile.twit.tv.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:10.280]   On any device, Windows, Google Chrome OS, Android, iOS, downloads the requisite features, puts
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:15.640]   an icon on the desktop, has a startup screen, cache and stuff, works offline.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.640]   That would be really great.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:21.840]   It would be great for a lot of things, particularly for us, because a mobile Twit site that became
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.320]   the Twit app on your phone would be fantastic.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.880]   I've written in WebAssembly, runs WebGL and WebAR.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:28.880]   Exactly.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.840]   And I guess Safari sounds like Apple's getting behind it.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.840]   Is that the case?
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:37.520]   I think, again, they were reticent with service workers in particular because they have an
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:41.240]   app platform and they still don't think that the web provides as good of native experience
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.880]   as the app platform.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:46.280]   So they spent, I guess, a year looking into it and decided that it was something they
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.920]   had to support anyway.
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.920]   Good.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:49.920]   Good.
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:50.920]   We shall see.
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:56.840]   Anyway, I'm going to correct myself and say it is apparently at least first steps anyway
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.840]   coming from Apple.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:03.000]   And this is a good article I'm going to point people to on Medium that talks about everything
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   that is coming.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.840]   This is from last month.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.840]   Pratik Shetty, progressive web apps are coming to a Safari near you.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.320]   And it discusses what's needed and what Apple's doing.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.600]   They really have no choice.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.600]   It's just like that first demo of the iPad, the New York Times, where there's a lot of
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:24.440]   jigsaw puzzle, broken pieces where stuff should be but aren't.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:29.960]   If your bank decides that we don't want to have to create and maintain mobile apps for
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:35.000]   two platforms anymore, we're just going to do a PWA for all of our mobile banking or
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.080]   any other grocery store or lots of other services.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:44.640]   The first time that you get a substandard experience on an iPhone because Apple decided
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:50.640]   the PWA's aren't, they don't want to encourage people to divert from running a native app.
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.680]   That's when things start to go bad.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.160]   So they really have no choice.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:00.680]   This is huge and it really would be a boon to a lot of people who want to make apps but
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.080]   it would also be a boon to users of a lot of platforms.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:07.440]   By the way, it'll work on Microsoft Windows even.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.440]   Edge, Edge.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:15.080]   >> The challenge is always low as common in the denominator.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.240]   You're not going to get doing these.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:24.960]   You'll not have the kind of experience that any one platform is capable of.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.200]   >> That remains to be seen.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:31.760]   I know, of course, that's usually true but I think that this is a new kind of web app
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:36.720]   that I think is going to surprise people.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.560]   >> Apple must believe that or they wouldn't be putting the effort into surprise.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:44.080]   >> On the other hand, Apple, Vicki Murley and the team at Apple put together a lot of
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:48.080]   effort into making the CSS stuff all work, a lot of the core animation stuff.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:51.840]   They portal that over and that's what a lot of CSS transform and CSS graphics that we
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.440]   use all over the web comes from today.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:58.400]   So I think they just sort of have little niches they fell into but because all the companies
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:02.040]   contribute, we get the best of all of them in the end.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:09.200]   >> We'll hear a lot more about PWA at Microsoft's Build Conference at Google I/O and maybe with
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:14.880]   some with any luck we'll hear a little bit more about it at WWDC as well.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.360]   >> You also have a Facebook's FA, I don't know if Facebook will show anything or not
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.560]   or whether that will be something that--
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:25.640]   >> Well, Facebook is the famous counter example because remember Facebook made a wrapper around
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:31.320]   their website and proposed that as an app and that was a massive failure and they had
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.080]   to start over.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:36.200]   I think that's what people think this is and it's not what that is or Electron which is
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.560]   basically putting Chrome on your system to run a web page.
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:40.680]   This is a lot better.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.080]   I think a lot better than that.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:47.040]   >> I mean, the FUSio OS that Google is building--
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.040]   >> Yeah, FUSio.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.040]   >> It's hard.
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:53.240]   It's not only will it's supported, it's like that seems to be the entire app model.
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:58.160]   There's not going to be an app store because basically the OS will call for whatever piece
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:04.240]   of code it needs at any given point from whatever developer has decided to register it.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.280]   A lot of people aren't really going to be caring about the different speed of native
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.600]   app unfortunately and something that's being loaded from the web anymore.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.600]   >> Well, give us more apps.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.800]   >> It's good for users, trust me.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:21.400]   >> Yeah, I was joking that maybe this is the first time that a Windows phone will actually
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.400]   have really good software for--
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.600]   >> It's so good for Windows phone.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:25.600]   >> Finally!
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.120]   >> And WebOS, it's back, baby!
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.840]   >> There is medicine in the Mac community because a lot of us grew up on people who
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:34.840]   made these incredibly carefully-- like remember we went through the delicious generation
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:41.520]   when they had the CD burner that had core graphics or core animation smoke coming out
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:45.400]   of it as you burned the CD and then all the stuff that Will Shipley did with the whole
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.400]   delicious generation.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:54.720]   >> It's my opinion, you can do all of that with modern web services like WebGL, WebSM.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.800]   Those apps are not something you couldn't do on a web page.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.400]   Look at some of their web pages out there that look, every bit as beautiful as Delicious
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.400]   Library.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.480]   >> Yeah, no, it's not just "franchiated" anymore.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.480]   It's just the app experience.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.880]   It doesn't feel like, "Oh, I'm a boutique Mac."
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:07.880]   >> Exactly.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.200]   >> No, it was part of our inferiority and cult complex.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:18.480]   >> Well, we build a lot of stuff for interaction and I will say that, right now, the primary
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.480]   stuff that we build.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.960]   >> I bet you do it in JavaScript, right?
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.600]   >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:32.480]   >> And so Angular is what most of it sits on top of, but at the same time, in the back
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.760]   of our head, we're just going to do this.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.880]   We're going to keep on doing it.
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.080]   You have to have that lowest common denominator available, but in the back of our head, this
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.080]   gets any bigger.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.560]   We're going to build native apps.
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.680]   We're not going to, because there's so much more we can do and it's going to be more stable
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.960]   and there's still all this weird web stuff that you have to deal with of dealing with
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:52.680]   everybody's browsers and how they all look at it and everything else.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:58.160]   I mean, we definitely do it because we have to, because I don't have the money to, it's
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:02.800]   whatever the problem is, is I don't have the money to program something for every platform.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.720]   So you have a web version of it, but all those feedback into a database and then eventually
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:13.080]   you're going to, we want a native app that's going to, from our perspective, treat the
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.080]   data properly.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:17.200]   >> Well, a lot of companies also want to make sure that everybody's always running the
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.680]   latest version of their app, particularly when it comes to metrics, particularly when
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.960]   it comes to tracking, that they've got a new scheme that if people have been running something
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:29.080]   that is inconvenient to your business model and you figure a way around it, you want to
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:32.880]   make sure that everybody's running that thing as opposed to people who simply have turned
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.880]   on auto update.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:37.120]   >> And remember, there's a lot of disincentive for Apple to participate.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:42.280]   For one thing, you don't get to $10 billion in services without an app store that you get
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.960]   30% of all the sales in.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:48.080]   >> I will build the web app for you.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:52.160]   I don't know if they can make a web store out of this, but maybe they can.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.880]   That's why it's kind of interesting to see Microsoft do it.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:54.880]   It really isn't.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:55.880]   >> They're going to be the Microsoft store, right?
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.880]   Like they're going to be equal citizens with Windows apps.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.880]   >> They are.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:43:59.880]   And I think that that's what's interesting.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:04.080]   I think Microsoft, I think everybody's seen the writing on the wall is the real reason
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.880]   this is happening.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:10.880]   And the idea of a standalone, I mean, they're going the way the shrink wrapped or the ziplock
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:13.080]   bag with the floppy disk in it.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.080]   >> Wouldn't toys.
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:17.080]   >> Yeah, wouldn't toys, whatever happened to them.
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:22.480]   Hey, you know, sometimes as you get a little older, you wish you could put a little pep
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:26.280]   in your step, a little vigor and vim in your life.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.440]   >> Now I had a system.
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:32.120]   >> I just want to show you my system for you thing myself.
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:36.720]   It's this hat, but I found something.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:37.720]   I do look younger.
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:38.720]   >> It's the flavor term.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.720]   >> It do.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:40.720]   >> It do.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:41.720]   >> And you look younger.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.720]   >> Yeah, I'm going to give you that.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.160]   You look young and crazy.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.360]   You look like an alcoholic gold player.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.680]   >> There's another way to put a little pep in your step, a little vigor in your life.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.560]   I want to tell you about a company.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:00.480]   Actually, we debated whether to do these ads, but I have to say I am a believer in it.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.680]   It's called Roman.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:02.960]   It's a men's health company.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:06.800]   And men's health is a difficult matter, shall we say.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.880]   And ladies, you can tune this out.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:17.360]   Guys, as you get older, there are things that happen in your life that perhaps you don't
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:21.920]   want to talk about with your doctor or even your spouse.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.680]   Because it affects your manhood.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:28.360]   Roman is focused on helping men fix things without having to run to your doctor, without
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.600]   having to be uncomfortable about it.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.760]   We don't like talking about health, especially if it's all around manhood, if you know what
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.760]   I mean.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:39.040]   The erectile dysfunction, something men shouldn't ignore.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.240]   Sometimes issues with performance are a sign of a larger underlying health problem and
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.240]   sometimes not.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.760]   Sometimes it's just the fact of aging.
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:51.720]   But I got to tell you, this could transform how you feel about yourself, how you feel
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:52.720]   every day.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:56.160]   Roman is breaking down the barriers that keep men from being proactive about their health.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:03.000]   They handle everything from online diagnosis to prescription delivery for ED meds.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.400]   And it's so simple.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.560]   All it will take is five minutes.
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:10.480]   You can do an online survey in the privacy of your own home, as they used to say, at
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:14.280]   get Roman dot com slash Mac break.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.480]   You give them your medical history.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.160]   You also give them your preference of medication.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.600]   There are lots of good choices out there now.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.760]   US licensed physicians.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.080]   Yes, there's a doctor involved.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.720]   We'll review the treatment requests within two hours.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:29.280]   If appropriate, we'll write you a prescription.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:33.360]   Then the medication is delivered free to your door by Roman pharmacy network and discrete
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.200]   packaging.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.200]   It's marked RHP.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:43.120]   Yeah, no big, big sign on it says your Viagra is here.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:46.080]   Refills will happen automatically every month or quarter.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:51.080]   Most guys admit that they either they or their group of male friends rarely go to the doctor
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:55.400]   for any reason at all, even though we know we should, shouldn't we?
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:59.240]   Roman is a great start for fixing one of the most important issues in men's health.
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.680]   And that's not a joke.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:01.680]   It's serious.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:07.640]   Although if you want to have some fun, they do have a very good video website that is
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.640]   quite enjoyable.

[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.440]   That's why we decided, you know what?
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.240]   I'm going to we're going to do these ads.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.440]   We do ads for things we believe in.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.560]   This is one of them.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:43.960]   Get Roman dot com slash Mac break.
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:47.960]   The chat room, of course, was giggling, but that's another matter entirely on.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:50.360]   We go with the show.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:53.120]   Let's see here.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:57.120]   911 recordings reveal.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.880]   There is a problem.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:47:59.880]   You can give it this.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.680]   You thought iPhone 10 screenshots were a problem.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:03.680]   You had no idea.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.680]   There is a problem.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:09.240]   Houston, we have a problem at the new Apple campus.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:15.880]   Apparently, the San Francisco Chronicle has done an investigation and has dug up some
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:18.080]   911 calls like this one.
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:23.400]   I walked into a glass door on the first floor of Apple Park when I was trying to go outside.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.160]   That's a January 4th, 911 call.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:29.920]   Two other calls made two days earlier, January 2nd, which was the day Apple employees started
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.560]   moving in.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:35.960]   We had an individual ran into a glass wall pane and they hit their head.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.760]   And Apple caller said on one of the calls, they have a small cut in their head and they
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:41.200]   are bleeding slightly disoriented.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.240]   The other caller, we had an employee who was on campus.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:47.520]   He walked into a glass window hitting his head, has a little bit of a cut on the eyebrow,
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:50.280]   none life threatening nor requiring hospital visits.
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:54.960]   The Chronicle is reporting that a city official in Cupertino where the headquarters is located
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:59.880]   at Warren Apple about the risk of absent-minded employees walking into glass walls and doors.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:02.280]   They have to be marked looking at their phone.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:08.400]   Well, if you have these doors, we've had them for years sliding glass doors in California.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.720]   Every house has them.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.240]   You put stickers on them, right?
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:14.920]   Yeah, they were putting stickers up the last time I was there, which was months ago.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.920]   It was probably just a huge building and they didn't have all the stickers in the right
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.920]   place.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:21.400]   It's the same, I don't know if it's a sticklerist insult, the same thing you see in the glass
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:26.480]   apple stores where they have that frosted look at a round eye level when you walk towards
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.480]   the wall.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:31.920]   Yes, it's required by California's code of regulations.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.160]   You have to identify an address hazards in the workplace.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.600]   I've walked into these walls, it's not funny.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.600]   It isn't.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.600]   It's damaging.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:44.440]   I haven't done that at Apple, but I've done that myself at a place at Twilight where
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.000]   they didn't.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.280]   There's a door to the left, there's entrance to the left entrance to the right.
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:54.200]   There is just a wall to the floor to ceiling pane of glass in the middle with nothing on
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.200]   it.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.400]   One of these bumps here is because of that.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.560]   Nobody went to the hospital.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.400]   Nobody was seriously injured.
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:09.920]   Apparently some birds have been seriously injured, but no humans.
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:14.240]   We've had folks get bloody noses at clients.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:18.280]   You go not at Apple's, but there's a lot of clients that we have that have a lot of
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:22.920]   glass in a lot of their offices.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.800]   We had one client that had almost all glass everywhere.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:30.120]   One of our guys hit the glass really hard.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:34.360]   And so it's a pretty common problem with glass heavy solutions.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.040]   This is not anything new to Apple.
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:39.080]   It happens probably every time they build a new one.
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:42.520]   And they go, I didn't think that maybe we should put some markers.
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.520]   Can I share with them?
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.680]   Eventually it always ends up with designs.
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:50.160]   Can I share with them a little trick that I came up with at my old place?
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.920]   I did have big sliding glass doors.
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:58.560]   And every time that I would get a new iPhone, remember when they used to have those adhesive
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:01.000]   covers on them for this play purposes?
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:08.920]   I used to, as soon as I signed for the package, I was wrestling to get to my office with it,
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:12.120]   I would peel it off, unpeal it, and put it on the glass.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.120]   And yeah, I think that's what they should do.
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.520]   They should revive shipping iPhones with stickers.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.520]   I have a suggestion.
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:20.280]   Now, what's your name?
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.240]   Say again?
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.240]   Seth.
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:30.000]   Seth works in Redding, Pennsylvania, Redding, California in the school district there.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.520]   He's installed many Apple computers going back to Apple two days, right?
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.720]   Many, many, many.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:41.920]   He brought me exactly what Apple needs, which is some rainbow Apple stickers.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:42.920]   Yes.
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:43.920]   Right?
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.120]   Just put those on the windows, Apple.
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.360]   That would be, it would fit in.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.360]   It would be beautiful.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.200]   Would have some great memories.
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.200]   Seth, thank you.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.760]   This is, look, and guys, if you want me to send you some, I will.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:57.440]   These are amazing, including some little teeny ones.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.600]   That's our chance.
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:05.320]   Oh, Apple, we mentioned last week is retrade marked the rainbow, probably because they want
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.480]   to release.
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.480]   They don't want to change the logo.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:08.960]   It's the same one step ahead of me and Andy.
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.640]   We were about to go back to that business.
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.640]   Yeah, really.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:12.840]   Look at these little ones.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:14.760]   What did the little ones come from?
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:15.760]   Do you remember?
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:16.760]   They were just a drawer full of them, apparently.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:21.040]   I think they always came with the big ones, the little ones.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.040]   Really?
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.080]   I noticed that you have the original font, too.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.080]   Yes.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:26.400]   This one must be an Apple, too.
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.560]   Look at it.
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:29.040]   Can you get a close up of that?
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.320]   Because that's the original, this is the original font.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:33.360]   So this is the one that has two big ones.
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:35.520]   I guess we don't have the overhead shot.
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:38.880]   This is the one with two big ones and two little ones.
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:41.360]   And it's the old, what's what font is that?
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:42.360]   What do you call that font?
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.080]   It's a kind of futuristic font.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:47.080]   It's what they thought the future would look like in 1978.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.080]   Are you speaking?
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.080]   Pre-Garabond.
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.080]   Isn't that cool?
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.080]   I love that.
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.080]   That's the one.
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.240]   Put that on the windows at Apple Park.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:57.880]   Or just these little ones.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.640]   I can't wait to use these.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.480]   This is Apple Vintage Day.
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:03.080]   This is six colors, Jason.
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:04.080]   Jason Snell.
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.080]   This is six color.
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:07.080]   Oh, that's who I should give these to.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:10.280]   Anyway, if you guys want some, I'll put them in the mail.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:11.760]   I have quite a few.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:12.760]   And thank you, Seth.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.760]   I appreciate it.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.760]   Let's see.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:18.760]   What else?
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:24.960]   Wearables are growing big, but of course that's only because it's the Apple watch.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:29.800]   Wearables grew 7.7% in the fourth quarter of last year, according to IDC.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:33.360]   But almost all the demand was for Apple watches.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.920]   21% market share.
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:36.920]   Fitbit.
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:37.920]   There's some good stuff.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:38.920]   Fitbit.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.360]   Somebody called me because I was talking about the fact that Apple kind of owned the fitness
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:43.720]   sector and said, you know, the Garmin HR.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:47.320]   It's an amazing runners watch with GPS.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:50.960]   It's less expensive than the Apple watch.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.960]   But here's the difference.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:55.200]   I think that there are a lot of people that would like to have a fitness watch.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:59.400]   There are fewer people who would like to have an advanced fitness watch, but everybody
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.360]   wants a cool wristwatch.
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:03.720]   And that's what Apple has tapped into.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.600]   It's still a top drawer fitness watch.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:10.880]   But even if you have the physique of one that...
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:11.880]   Like us?
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:12.880]   Like you and me, Andy?
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.520]   I didn't want to say it.
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:18.360]   You've been looking a little bit, you know.
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:25.460]   But even people like me who are working on it, but clearly not triatholating anywhere
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:27.560]   anytime soon, you could...
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:31.080]   It's an attractive thing to buy just as a cool watch to wear.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:32.560]   So, that's what I do.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:33.560]   Tell me why though.
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:34.560]   I agree.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.560]   I like my Apple watch.
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:36.560]   And as I said earlier, I'm wearing it every day.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:39.040]   But I'm looking at, for instance, the Garmin Vivo Smart HR.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.720]   They have very accurate heart rate monitors.
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:42.720]   And they do something...
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:43.920]   I wish the Apple watch did.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:47.680]   My Samsung S3 does it as well.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:52.080]   With the Apple watch, when you're doing exercise, you have to explicitly say, "I'm now about
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.080]   to exercise.
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:54.080]   Please monitor it."
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:58.920]   Most of these other devices notice your heart rate's going up, you're moving, you know,
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.160]   you're exercising, we're going to record this.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:06.160]   In fact, many of them can differentiate between the kinds of exercises you're doing, including
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:07.160]   this Garmin.
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:09.360]   Why does an Apple do that?
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.800]   My Samsung pauses.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:11.800]   If I'm...
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.240]   I say, "I'm going on a hike.
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:14.680]   I'm walking, walking, walking."
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:16.120]   Or it says, "Oh, I see you're going on a hike.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:17.320]   You want me to record this?"
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.320]   Yes.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.320]   "Walking, walking."
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:21.160]   Then I stop, I sit down for lunch.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:24.160]   It vibrates my wrist and says, "Okay, I can see you've stopped walking.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.160]   We'll pause."
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.160]   They don't vibrate again.
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.160]   They do pause.
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:29.440]   Like, there's a setting where you can say auto pause.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:32.520]   I've never had a lot of luck with the feature, but it does there.
[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:34.040]   I guess it depends on how...
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:38.160]   I mean, I'm walking fast enough or slowing down enough, but the feature is in there.
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:39.160]   All right.
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.800]   It's note warning and skiing last week.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.800]   Good.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:42.880]   I guess I don't tell it anything.
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.560]   I just do whatever I'm going to do and I look down to see...
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.320]   It doesn't record, though, in your workouts app.
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:50.360]   I just wish it would record it.
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:52.040]   It's included in your activity, I guess.
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:57.160]   But then activity doesn't say anything about, "Oh, you exercised for an hour today."
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:59.600]   I think it says active.
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.120]   It's got three little...
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:04.040]   Yes, the rings.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:05.400]   You fill the rings.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:07.000]   I think it's all I worry about.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.520]   I think it's complicated otherwise.
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:14.320]   I think it's just more conservative than other apps are.
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:20.600]   I won't try to find the page on my Android phone, but I will never, ever know.
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:26.320]   I don't know what my biking stats are because I was apparently on a train somewhere.
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:32.920]   And so the longest distance I've ever ridden on my bike will always be 71.2 miles.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:36.360]   The highest speed I've ever done is 30 something.
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:39.800]   I don't know why.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:46.520]   I haven't dived into it, but it thought you were in a bicycle going...
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:48.520]   It obviously has really fast.
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:53.480]   It has obviously not checked the settings page where I, myself, typed in my true weight.
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:57.880]   I don't think that's a smart choice for the page.
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:00.760]   I find that when I fly, I burn a lot of calories.
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:01.760]   There's just enough...
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:04.920]   It's a minor complaint.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.960]   It seems like it's a kind of an app-ly thing to do.
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:10.720]   Just say, "Oh, I notice you're jogging right now."
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:12.360]   I'd like to record it.
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:15.640]   I don't know.
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:19.080]   Data collection is real small about.
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:26.880]   If we were able to be trained to activate apps to encourage us to exercise, we wouldn't
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:29.840]   have a need to be encouraged to exercise.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:35.080]   So that's really one of those finer points that Apple can really do a much better job
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:37.840]   on than other people that makes this so valuable.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:44.000]   The number of times I see a tweet or an Instagram about another screenshot of someone who went,
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:50.040]   "Oh, look, I got all three rings for an entire month for the eighth time in a row."
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.560]   I'm like, "You know what?
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:53.400]   You're going to die too sometime."
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:56.320]   It's like, "Oh, the magic rings are going to give you eternal."
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:00.280]   You tell Jay Blonick to cut it out, Andy.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:03.400]   Well, whatever they're doing, they're doing something right because they are...
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:08.000]   According to IDC, again, because Apple doesn't break this app, but they're clearly owning
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:15.200]   the market of 57.5% growth year over year for the Apple Watch in 2017.
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:22.400]   They now kind of dominate significantly with market share of 21% compared to Fitbit's 14%
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:23.400]   and dropping.
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:26.360]   Xiaomi is number three with 13%.
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:29.120]   I guess that's an Android Wear watch, I think, that Xiaomi.
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:31.080]   Yeah, and Google hasn't really done much with those.
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:34.440]   No, Android Wear has just dropped off the map, oddly enough.
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:40.440]   Yeah, there's a problem where they're all using the same Qualcomm system on a chip and
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.880]   Qualcomm has not updated it in two years.
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:43.880]   Oh, there's the problem.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:48.640]   And so that's not making people excited about creating new launches to say nothing of the
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:52.320]   fact that they just...
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:59:00.080]   The price of being able to create a platform that anybody can buy into is that you can't
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:04.600]   get that kind of integrations of specific...
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:10.680]   You can't shave a factor of a millimeters here and there and get a 42 millimeter tiny,
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.480]   tiny little pillow watch like that.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:17.520]   You will always wind up with something that's more akin to the G-Shock than to something
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:20.000]   else.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.240]   This is from Jason Cross at Macworld.
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:27.440]   Report Apple killing off the iTunes LP format.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:32.240]   The company will stop taking new LP submissions after March and phase out sales through 2018.
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:34.880]   I didn't even know they had an LP format.
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:36.880]   What is that for all the tracks related?
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:38.720]   It was like, "Do you announce the same time as iTunes extras?"
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:41.680]   And it was like Steve Jobs said, "Imagine you could sit there with your album art and
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:43.680]   just page through all the..."
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.320]   Kids didn't want to do that, did they?
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.520]   Oh, I remember that.
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:49.240]   By the way, I'm the market for that.
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:55.520]   I'm the generation that grew up wearing cost Pro 440 headphones with Tommy and the opening
[00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:59.480]   the lyrics and reading the lyrics as I'm lying on my back listening to the record.
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:00.480]   That's the idea, right?
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.440]   Steve Jobs, of course, was that generation as well.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:07.880]   But I guess kids today, they don't want to read liner notes.
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.880]   I think they want to...
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:14.800]   I do think that they would like to, based on some of the stuff we've done, some of the
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.280]   videos we've done, I think they love doing things
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.160]   with the artists that talk about the album.
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:26.440]   I think there's a lot of opportunity for the artists to talk about that or to show the
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:27.440]   creativity process.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.880]   I don't know if you've seen some of the stuff we were doing with Pomp La Moose, but we've
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:30.880]   been...
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:31.880]   No.
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:32.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:38.360]   So on their Facebook, on Pomp La Moose's Facebook page, there's like two hour streams
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.120]   from the studio while they're recording.
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.120]   Oh, cool.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.280]   So it's like while they're figuring out how to do the song.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:47.240]   And we threw up a bunch of little cameras and we're cutting live back and forth.
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:50.120]   So that you can kind of follow the action.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.960]   But it's literally the creative process.
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:57.860]   It is them thinking about the song and them talking to the other artists and them coming
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:02.040]   up with a riff and then trying it and then saying, "Oh, that didn't work."
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:05.760]   And someone else, Jack will say something or Natalie will be like, "I gotta do that
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.760]   again."
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:10.800]   And I think the response has been really good.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.160]   People are really excited about it because they get to feel like they're there with the
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.440]   band while the band's in that creative process.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.240]   I think that's the next generation of liner notes.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:22.320]   I think that something like that, we did one with Alicia Keys a couple of years ago and
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:25.120]   with John Mayer before that, that were...
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.920]   They released the album and then they just talk about it.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:33.840]   Like Alicia Keys would talk about her album and talk about what each song meant to her
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:37.600]   and she could sit there and answer questions and so on and so forth.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:43.000]   I think that being able to have an event that you do that with an artist is something that
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.800]   I think fans would be very excited about.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:49.820]   I think opening up text or piece of paper or even a digital version of that is just not
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:51.760]   what the current generation wants to do.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:55.040]   But I think that there's a lot of opportunity to get reconnected with the fans that I don't
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.800]   think Apple Music is doing a very good job of taking advantage of.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.560]   I think they're doing big ideas and...
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:04.520]   Isn't that what Beats Radio though is kind of the idea behind Beats Radio?
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.600]   They almost always seem to have artists in studio with them.
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.600]   Yeah, sure.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.600]   The artists that they choose.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.240]   The real issue is that what you need to do is be able to build a platform that the artists
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.920]   can do that themselves.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.840]   That it's self-generating, that they can create that kind of content.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.880]   Right now the artists are using YouTube, they're using Facebook, they're using all these other
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:29.240]   platforms, Patreon, are the kind of platforms that they're using because there's no good
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.720]   easy way to do that on something like Apple Music.
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:38.920]   I think that that's a growth area that Apple could really dig into if they chose to.
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:45.920]   Apple sees dollar signs, they've hired M Night Shyamalan to produce a new 10-episode psychological
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:52.360]   thriller series for whatever they're going to call it.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.680]   Apple Music specials or whatever.
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.680]   Apple Music TV.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:01.040]   TV thing that they do if you have an Apple TV or maybe even if you don't because who knows
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.000]   where it's going to show up.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.880]   It didn't have to be this way.
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:09.320]   Do you know how it would really could have?
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.760]   Do you know how to be this way?
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:17.000]   We've been talking about the fact that Apple was eventually, or at least I've been saying
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.040]   that if the Hollywood doesn't sell to, you know, and change their business model or allow
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:27.840]   Apple to be part of it, that Apple was just going to step into it.
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:30.720]   Whether they did the same thing in Netflix, let's hold out on Netflix.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:37.120]   Apple Netflix now is releasing this year, I believe they're releasing 300 original series
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.960]   and movies.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:39.960]   It's done.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.440]   I mean, what happens is now M Night Shyamalan can now go.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.320]   He can now make a deal directly.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.320]   He doesn't need Fox.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.840]   He doesn't need Warner Brothers.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.600]   You know, that model is dead.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.760]   Netflix won an Oscar this year with an actress.
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:58.600]   When you have filmmakers like thanking Netflix at an Oscar speech.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:03:59.600]   Wow.
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.320]   When I was listening to that, I'm not even joking.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:06.960]   I'm like, wow, what a world this is.
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:12.280]   An entity that could not anyone known could really have imagined eight or nine years ago
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.760]   doing anything more than, oh, isn't it cute?
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:18.720]   Instead of like actually putting DVDs into the long flops and mailing them out and other
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.720]   actually, I can, okay, that's interesting.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:26.280]   And now they're creating, not just their own content, but also content that is content
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:32.720]   that keeps a global superpower out of the Olympics.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.320]   That's the power of the Netflix.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.320]   Amazing, isn't it?
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:40.800]   Well, and I think that one of the one of the things I think is fascinating about Netflix
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:46.560]   is they've just, it's this mind boggling amount of content that they're generating and they're
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:49.560]   still for the most part knocking it out of the park.
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:55.000]   I mean, the level of control that they're having, I find myself now going to Netflix.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.960]   And I'm specifically looking for original Netflix.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:00.360]   I'm not looking for the other crap that's on Netflix anymore.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:01.880]   And I don't think Amazon's done that.
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:05.160]   I don't think that YouTube or Facebook's done that successfully.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.880]   Apple hasn't done it yet.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:11.440]   So HBO and Showtime, I mean, they do great things, but they do so little of it.
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.160]   It's like these little drops.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.640]   Netflix is doing mass production of stuff.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:19.280]   Right now I'm watching Frontier, which is pretty good.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:25.520]   I like good old swashbuckling kind of movies or series.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:28.800]   It's not the highest quality I've ever seen, but it's really enjoyable to watch.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.600]   I mean, before that I was pinky blinders and before that I was, you know, and you get
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.600]   into this.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:38.720]   It just, it feels, maybe because I can afford to have a bunch of services, but it feels
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.160]   to me a little bit like the web now where you deep link.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.640]   You don't care where it is.
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.040]   You don't say, "Oh, I'm a Netflix fan."
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.160]   You just get whatever you get from whatever service has is, whether it's Amazon Prime
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.160]   or Netflix or...
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:54.160]   I think it is.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.280]   I mean, if you're a court cutter, you're not really paying, it's not like you have
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.280]   the money to do it.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.520]   If you're a court cutter, you're not paying $130 a month.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:01.520]   You're paying whatever...
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:05.440]   Yeah, but if you add up subscriptions, it adds up.
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:09.080]   Yeah, but I don't think it adds up to the same amount that we were paying for a whole
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.280]   bunch of channels that we didn't want.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:16.960]   I think that, because HBO alone, the sub, the sub on HBO alone is $8 or $8.
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:20.600]   When I was in cable, it's $13 now or something.
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:21.920]   The per sub cost is that...
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:25.600]   Now, some of the channels are per subs are 0.25, 0.50.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.280]   ESPN's like 13 bucks.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.280]   It's expensive.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.280]   It's the most expensive.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.280]   Yeah, so the thing is, is that that's what you're paying at.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.280]   That's what the cable company...
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.280]   That's what the cable company...
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.160]   And you're being pays them, and of course they pass you on the EU, right?
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:40.240]   So now what you're doing is you're choosing to have the stuff that you want there.
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.360]   I think the interesting model for Netflix is they have to support all of these different
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.080]   people that want to have something different.
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:50.640]   Whether it's Chef's Table or Frontier, which is probably the two most opposite things you
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.840]   can have on your network.
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.000]   And the other thing is that they just have what they have that the other guys don't have...
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.760]   I mean, Amazon has it, but they're not utilizing it yet, in my opinion, is...
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:01.840]   Netflix has the numbers.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:02.840]   They have the app.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:07.160]   So they know how long you watched it, what shows you're watching.
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:10.120]   They know whether you fast forwarded, they know whether you...
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.200]   You know, they have an incredible amount of information.
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:17.480]   So their ability to smartly create the next shows that are going to be interesting to
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.800]   people is very, very good.
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:20.800]   And other people can do it.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:21.800]   Apple could do that.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:22.800]   But Apple really...
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:23.960]   It's a lot of catch up right now.
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:27.240]   I think that everybody's catching up at the moment with Netflix.
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:31.200]   I think Disney's new foray into this area could be really interesting because they've got
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.200]   just so many great...
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.760]   Obviously, so many great properties.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.720]   You know, whether it's a car or a car or a car or...
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.720]   You're doing an interesting thing.
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.480]   I had a subscription to Disney movies anywhere.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.040]   That's what's called Disney movies anywhere.
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:46.960]   And they sent me a note saying, "Okay, you got to move everything out of your Disney movies
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:52.440]   everywhere into something called movies everywhere."
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:56.840]   And I got a goodbye from Disney movies everywhere.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:00.040]   But it's just all they did is take the name off as far as I can tell.
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:01.480]   I mean, you had to do so.
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.480]   For now.
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:06.680]   But what that sounds like to me is that they're trying to create something that's not just
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.680]   Disney.
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:11.880]   They want to have a Netflix or Amazon Prime movies or something.
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:15.160]   I mean, they want to have more than just the Disney properties on there.
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:18.280]   Well, they're launching a streaming channel with a Marvel and Star Wars show.
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:21.440]   I mean, but Disney has enough stuff going on that they could just be just Disney.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:25.640]   But I'm just saying that the fact that Disney's branding off of movies anywhere tells me this
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.640]   is more than...
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:31.000]   They have bigger ambitions than just, "Oh, this is the home for Disney stuff."
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.720]   But I think all that silly...
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:37.120]   I mean, Netflix cares that you know you're watching a Netflix to the degree that you keep
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:39.000]   your subscription.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   But I don't know...
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   I don't know.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   It's all it matters.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   I mean, that's all it cares.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.280]   It gets into that whole like why we watch, why we use our Apple Watch.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:49.280]   Well, you know, it's like, I don't know if I would stick with Nestle to all that made
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:50.280]   a chef say.
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:55.320]   So the Apple made that TV app and wants to get everybody aggregated into that and it
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:57.440]   works except that Netflix isn't in it.
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:58.440]   Yes.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:08:59.440]   Right.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.440]   And Netflix won't do it.
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.440]   Well, they shouldn't.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:04.440]   I mean, they shouldn't.
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.440]   They should, because you still have to...
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:10.440]   All the Apple TV app does is tell me where stuff is and then when I launch the show,
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.600]   it goes into that app.
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:14.040]   Netflix will get all the data that they would get otherwise.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.040]   Yeah, it's about discovery.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.040]   It's about discovery.
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.040]   It reminds me of what I was watching.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:24.920]   Well, it does encourage this habit which I think is happening anyway of you just...
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.880]   You don't care what...
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:29.560]   Knowing what platform is on is actually a pain in the butt.
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:33.560]   I don't want to have to go to Netflix to figure out which show where my show is.
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:39.880]   I just want to ask Siri, just play Babylon Berlin and it'll play wherever it is.
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:43.720]   And I think that the thing that's changing now that I've noticed over the...
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:46.200]   Because the first Netflix stuff was pretty bad.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:49.640]   I mean, you know, like before House of Cards, I mean, there was a lot of experiments that
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.560]   you were like, "Oh, this is never going to work."
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:56.120]   And the thing that I found now is that I only have a limited amount of time and there's
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:00.840]   so much content there that I want to watch, that I have this stack of whole series that
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:03.840]   I can watch.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:07.200]   I just worked through one whole series and I just watch one series until I get to the
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.760]   end of it and then I watch another one.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:15.360]   And I was talking to my wife about it because what does she watch?
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.160]   She watches Scandal.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:21.840]   She likes to watch Scandal and I'm like, "I can't deal with that because I have to wait
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:22.840]   a whole week."
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:26.320]   Like, you know, I have this whole idea that I can't remember.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:29.000]   I can't remember what happened last week.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.440]   I can't remember all the little details.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:34.440]   When I watch like six of these episodes in a row, I can really remember like on a plane,
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:38.520]   I can really remember, you know, I'm into the zone of it.
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.520]   But if I...
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.040]   And one of the things we were talking about is that we really love Law and Order because
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.400]   I don't have to do that.
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:48.960]   And so I realized that I will not now watch a TV series that is episodic, that's going
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:52.200]   to have any kind of arc if it's coming on every week.
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:55.400]   If it's on Netflix or if it's on Hulu or if it's on something that I can watch the whole
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:56.800]   series all at one time.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.600]   I'll watch it at my...
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.680]   You know, at the speed that I want to watch it.
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.520]   If it's now...
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.040]   If it's not, I just want Law and Order.
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.040]   Like, I just...
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.560]   You know, I watch these shows and I'm like, they don't have to...
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:08.760]   They didn't have to make this complicated.
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:12.160]   It could have been just jump-dung and then they just do their show and then it ends and
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:16.720]   it's a model and then I can turn it on anytime I want, which is why I watched a lot of Law
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:17.720]   and Order.
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:18.720]   Well, add...
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.720]   I mean, look at the list of stuff.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:22.440]   So, one of the reasons I bring this up is I'm wondering...
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:25.160]   And we still are wondering what the heck Apple's plan is.
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.160]   I mean, how is this...
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:32.200]   I would imagine it'll be a part of the TV app, I would guess, on Apple TV, but I don't know.
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:35.160]   But so, they've got the Shyamalan stuff, which will be great.
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:40.000]   They've got Steven Spielberg's amazing stories, not the old ones, but brand new ones.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.200]   They've got a half-hour comedy series about a morning show with Kristen Wiig, Jennifer
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.680]   Aniston, Reese Witherspoon.
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:51.760]   They've got a new series from Camille Nongani and Emily V. Gordon, who did the big sick
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:53.240]   called Little America.
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.240]   I mean, they...
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:57.480]   They're going to go like the Galactica guy, yeah.
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.480]   I mean...
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.640]   They're either spending money on...
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:02.080]   Apple's basically spending all money on all tent poles.
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.080]   I mean, they're not...
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:04.080]   They're not...
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.080]   They're not in between.
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.120]   They're like, "We're just going to get the best, and then we're going to get the best,
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.760]   and then we're going to get the best, because they can afford to."
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:13.760]   I mean, they can spend every year, they can spend twice as much as Netflix, and they'd
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.000]   still be able to do it.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   So, they can...
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.440]   Instead, what they're doing, they're not shotgunning out, they're basically going, "We
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:22.040]   want to make every show something that's a destination for folks."
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.440]   And they've got time to start building that up.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.840]   I think it's the right way to go.
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:32.640]   I think they also have to outlive their little app show.
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:39.880]   You know, like that, it was just such a horrible, horrible idea.
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:53.400]   It was a great idea, a great concept, very, very poorly implemented, but exceptional.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.680]   It was certainly executed.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:59.760]   So the production value was as good as it gets for something that was probably a good
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:03.840]   idea when they started it, and then somehow what they put in the middle, and really the
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:05.800]   choice of talent was really not.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:07.880]   It was really a quick kick to my head.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:13.640]   You know, I didn't like it, but I got to say that if you...
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:21.040]   If violent people have taken your dog hostage and have insisted that you have a magical
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.360]   escalator on your TV show, I don't think it's a bad thing.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:26.800]   I don't think a magical escalator could have possibly been done any better than it was
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.320]   done on Planet V.
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.120]   Well, there's the...
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:34.520]   So I'm looking at movies anywhere, formerly Disney movies anywhere.
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:38.640]   And one of the things they do, in fact, I've recommended it before as a pick, is they aggregate
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:47.080]   your movies that you purchased from Amazon, from Apple, from Google, onto one big pile.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:52.640]   And then the weirdest thing, when you play it, they don't say where it came from.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:55.120]   It just starts playing.
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:59.960]   Which to me, why would Apple do that?
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:04.840]   Oh, because you don't want people to have an allegiance to Netflix or to Hulu or some
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:05.840]  place else.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:08.760]   You want allegiance only to app, only to that app.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:09.760]   And that's...
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:14.120]   But this is an Apple app, and I'm not seeing any Apple branding when I play the movie.
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:18.040]   Or Amazon or Google.
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.040]   It's really...
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.040]   It's really...
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:24.840]   I'm always surprised when companies do something that's good for consumers.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.040]   And they're in the bottom line.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.400]   Well, it's not just...
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.200]   It's really damaging to the brands that are not being identified.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:39.760]   Because it's so hard for them to have any kind of allegiance to ABC or to CBS or to Paramount
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.920]   or Disney.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.200]   And they desperately want you to know.
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.760]   That's why they put it when you watch the movie.
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.760]   And that's why it says a Disney production.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:46.760]   Right.
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.040]   In conjunction with whatever.
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:52.600]   They gotta know, they gotta make sure that this is why you're coming is because we make
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:54.960]   great movies and they think that that's important.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:01.640]   And just like with music, I think that we just want to watch the content.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.640]   But you may agree.
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:03.640]   I agree.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.720]   But I think that they are building...
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:09.920]   I think that if they can, I don't automatically go to Amazon and think that I'm going to see
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:10.920]   a good video.
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:15.640]   I've seen too many bad shows that I'm kind of like, "Well, if someone told me it was
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.240]   really good, I might go watch it."
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.720]   But it would probably take me months before I got around to it.
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:22.120]   With Netflix, I'll just sit there and just go, "Oh, I'll watch an episode of that."
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:24.120]   Because it's reasonably...
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:29.800]   I have a reasonably good chance that I'm going to like it.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.320]   With Apple, I think that they'd still be on "earnadays."
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.600]   With Facebook and YouTube, I don't even bother.
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:35.600]   So I do.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:36.600]   So here's the...
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:37.600]   We can pre-order...
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:44.680]   We can pre-order the last Jedi.
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:45.680]   But I know, here I am.
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:46.680]   Now, this is movies anywhere.
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:51.240]   As soon as I say pre-order, it's going to then send me to the stores that it supports
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.440]   with the Voodoo, the Goodwill Play, the iTunes, the Amazon.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.440]   So I'm going to choose...
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.240]   And not in 4K or HDR on iTunes.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:57.240]   Why do people...
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.240]   Why do people...
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:59.240]   Here's the question is...
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:00.240]   Why?
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:02.520]   Why do you pre-order a movie?
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.520]   So it's...
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:04.520]   At full price.
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.520]   A better.
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:06.520]   So it's there when I...
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:07.520]   I don't know.
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:08.520]   Because I'm thinking about it.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.520]   Yeah, it was...
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.160]   I forget when they're coming out Alex and then I open up the Apple TV and it's sitting
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.280]   there and I just press play.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:17.320]   You will not forget because the best part is that it's going to be on your top movie,
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.320]   love the little top movie shelf at the very top.
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:20.320]   I know.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:21.320]   It's going to be there.
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:22.320]   I know.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:23.320]   I'm not a forgetter.
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:24.320]   I know.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.320]   You won't miss it.
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.320]   But how do you...
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.320]   So wait a minute now Renee...
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:28.320]   You don't see top movies?
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:29.320]   Yes.
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.320]   Renee said something interesting.
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.320]   Apple, iTunes is not doing the UHD version of Star Wars the last time.
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:37.480]   Disney will not provide the 4K HDR version of any of their titles to Apple as long as
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.480]   Apple is selling them for the same price as...
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:40.880]   Oh, I take it back then.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:41.880]   I take it back.
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:46.440]   I thought this was a happy world where lambs and lions are lying down together.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:48.920]   Disney wants an extra 5 or 10 bucks.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:51.800]   So I can go to Voodoo and buy it in UHD.
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:52.800]   Yeah.
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:53.800]   If you're willing to pay the extra 5 bucks, absolutely.
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.640]   But it costs a little more, right?
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:56.640]   Yep.
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.320]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:16:59.720]   Well, isn't it...
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:03.520]   I mean, does Apple pay them something differently when that happens?
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:04.840]   Apple has it.
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:08.480]   Apple has overpaid for content in the past to ensure that it would have it.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:10.720]   But I don't know what the particulars are of this deal.
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:17.640]   So it's 25 bucks for UHD, just 20 bucks for HDX, which is a 1080p on Voodoo.
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:21.080]   And I presume that that price is the same everywhere.
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.080]   Interesting.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.080]   But if I go to iTunes...
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:27.680]   I think I'm still in the mode of...
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:32.280]   I would be really excited to watch the buy the 4K, but I'm not going to pay extra for
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.280]   it yet.
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:34.280]   Yeah.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.960]   I mean, I don't think that for the most part there's not anything that I feel like I had
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:36.960]   to see in 4K.
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.840]   Oh, it looks like I can't get...
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:40.640]   I have to get to...
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:45.440]   Google also apparently is not doing the deal because they only have the HD version as well.
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:49.800]   Looks like Voodoo's the only one offering a UDX or UHD version.
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:52.520]   So do you buy discs anymore?
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.920]   I used to from onto the transcoding thing, but I just...
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:59.120]   Yeah, I used to do all the stuff that Andy did, but then I got old and lazy.
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:00.120]   And well, you would...
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:04.200]   I mean, really, the only reason to buy the UHD Blu-ray is because it's better quality
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:05.520]   than the streaming version.
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:11.160]   So if you really cared it, like I got Play-Brayer 2049, but it's a pain in the butt.
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:14.920]   Because I got to go find the disc and put it in the player.
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:20.800]   I have been tempted because the macro blocking around fast-moving individuals in the foreground
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:21.800]   makes...
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:25.600]   I'm starting to notice it all the time, but it's just when someone's walking across a
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:31.080]   screen, a relatively static thing, you'll see this little edge around them of blocks.
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.680]   And sorry, I just ruined a lot of people's viewing experience.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:35.840]   I know, because once you see it, you can't unsee it.
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:39.400]   Well, no, but on the other side, Christina Warren and I were talking, and she said that
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:42.360]   she can't be bothered to get up and go to the living room to get the Blu-ray until she'll
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:43.840]   just buy it again on iTunes.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.520]   Oh, God, that's so worse.
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:47.520]   That made the whole world acceptable to me now.
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:49.000]   Microsoft's paying her too much money.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   She got it.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000]   Yeah, that's...
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.840]   That's when you transition from journalism to working for Microsoft.
[01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:57.880]   I think this was pretty Microsoft, but I felt that.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:00.720]   It's like the same reason, like, you go through all your DVDs, you can't find something to
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:03.280]   watch, and then you see it on cable and you start watching it.
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:07.040]   Even though it has ads, you didn't have to make it so you enjoy it more.
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.040]   It's really true.
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:09.240]   I think physical media is dead.
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.240]   I really do.
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:16.040]   I don't disagree with you, but I do think that...
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:21.520]   The thing is, I'm so happy with the way that I acquire my media by buying it, actually
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:24.720]   usually I'll buy it used, but I finally bought...
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:26.960]   I've not seen Coco yet.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:27.960]   I'm sorry.
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:28.960]   Oh, it's so good.
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.760]   I have not seen it yet.
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:36.160]   But finally reminding myself of it during the Oscars, I ordered a copy.
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:37.640]   And I came...
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:43.880]   I have so much love for Pixar that there's so many people because it's selling in a pack
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:47.280]   that has both the Blu-ray and the DVD and the digital code.
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:51.160]   So a lot of people, all I want is the digital code, and so they're selling off the DVD and
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:52.160]   the CD.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.160]   Oh, that's funny.
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.520]   That's just like without a case.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:00.740]   My love of Pixar is so great that saying, "I can either spend $22 for the actual shrink
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:03.720]   wrap thing or $8 for just the Blu..."
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.360]   Okay, I'll just buy it.
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:09.160]   I'm terrible because I keep forgetting to save those codes from the UHD disk.
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:10.160]   I just...
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:14.400]   I could put it in movies anyway.
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.360]   I sure feel for me.
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:20.680]   I just don't like the idea of not remembering where I might have bought something.
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:21.680]   Did I buy it from Google Play?
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.280]   Did I buy it from iTunes?
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:26.360]   And then also what happens?
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.320]   What happens if I switch platforms?
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:35.220]   I also like the fact that because I actually don't sell off or give away the disks after
[01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:41.900]   I rip them, I like the fact that if I'm hit by a bus tomorrow, my friends can divvy up
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:46.380]   my movie collection, whereas I don't know why we're all okay.
[01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:50.100]   We've been brainwashing to thinking that, "Oh, well, yes, he spent $800 over the course
[01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:53.780]   of his life on movies, but now nobody owns them anymore.
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:54.780]   Thanks for the money.
[01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:55.780]   Goodbye."
[01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:56.780]   It's like, "No, no, no.
[01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:57.780]   He bought movies.
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:58.780]   I should be able to have the...
[01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:01.780]   Yeah, that is the sad thing.
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:06.360]   I think about all my Kindle books, my music, my movies.
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:11.280]   They just go back into the Bitbucket when I die, right?
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:12.280]   Just like me.
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:17.600]   But couldn't I give my login to my kids?
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.760]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:20.760]   There's no inheritance.
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:26.760]   At some point, at some point, they'd be like, "You've had a subscription for 120 years.
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:33.000]   But the good news is that you're saying those in the estate tax."
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:40.920]   So Alex, you're saying here that iTunes purchased library as a rent control department.
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:41.920]   Yes.
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:44.920]   Don't tell anybody that Antistel died.
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:45.920]   Exactly.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:52.280]   She's going to live to 130 if we could be on the park for $120 a month.
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.280]   Exactly.
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:59.120]   Well, it'd be like, "When did Apple make movies or when did they have a media thing?"
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:05.560]   Because I've driven the car and I've been in the plane, but I didn't know that Apple
[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:08.480]   actually made media devices.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:10.200]   That's 130 years from now.
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:11.760]   I don't understand.
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.960]   They're a bank.
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:14.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:19.360]   Mobile World Congress, everybody wants to be Apple.
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:20.360]   You got a notch.
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:21.360]   You got a notch.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:22.360]   You got a notch.
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:23.360]   You didn't charge it.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.360]   Yes.
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.360]   Look at this.
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:31.680]   The lads of the Verge tweeting from the, "This is the Asus Zen phone announcement."
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:33.360]   Our notch is smaller.
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:34.360]   26.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:36.360]   I wonder why.
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.960]   26% smaller than Fruitphone X.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.480]   There's just a camera.
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:42.680]   There's nothing in it.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:47.760]   I have in my hands, although it's not charged up, and I think I know why.
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.240]   Megan hasn't charged it.
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:55.920]   This is a Chinese knockoff called the Ookeetel, and I'm putting in the Type C cable, but
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:58.960]   it just falls right out.
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:00.400]   But this has a notch, too.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.000]   You can kind of see it.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.320]   But again, the only thing in the notch is the speaker and a one camera.
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:08.520]   They're not the only ones.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.520]   Look at all these.
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:14.080]   There's the Ookeetel, the U18.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.480]   These are Android devices.
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:17.320]   Oh, the Liagu.
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:19.640]   I probably should only a good S9 Pro.
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:23.480]   They can hire Brad Ellis to make super ellipses for them.
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:26.400]   They don't have to live with these crazy curves.
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:28.440]   Why would you duplicate the notch?
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.800]   People don't even, I gave an apple, people.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.360]   Here's the oolie phone.
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:39.560]   See, that's what's kind of historically funny, too, because that replicates one of the silly
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:43.560]   things about the Asus design, too.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.120]   It's like, "Okay, so great.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.120]   So you managed to shove the panel up the top.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:48.120]   By having that notch."
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.160]   But then you put this thick bezel at the bottom.
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:57.320]   I don't mind bezels at the top and bottom, but it just looks so off-balanced to me that
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:59.760]   I have to ask you what the freaking point was.
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:00.840]   Yeah, you got to chin.
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:04.720]   Why do you have two copies of the Google search app?
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:05.720]   What is that?
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:06.720]   That is very...
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:07.720]   Well, to balance it.
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:08.720]   It's a metric.
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:09.720]   It's a metric.
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:10.720]   It's a metric.
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:11.960]   It's a metric eye puzzle.
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:16.120]   You line it up until the two Gs are together and you see a sailboat.
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:23.640]   The Verge headline is "The Clone Wars iPhone X Copycats Battle for Notch Supremacy."
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:28.120]   Well, you know, too break free.
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.760]   It's an homage to the iPhone.
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:32.760]   Well, but it was one of the interesting...
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:33.760]   I think it was one of the vendors.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.240]   They were asking, like, why they're doing it.
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:36.480]   They said, "Well, all our phones look the same.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:37.480]   We want to look distinct.
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:38.480]   We want people to recognize it."
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:39.480]   It's just like Apple.
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:40.480]   You don't do that.
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.320]   Put a triangle on it, buddy.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:45.960]   Yeah, like just like Apple.
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:48.440]   Let's see.
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:51.960]   There are people shooting at the Apple Shutter Shuttle.
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:59.720]   So the CHP is baiting the Apple Shutter Shutter with a decoy bus.
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:00.720]   Oh, I shouldn't...
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:01.720]   I didn't say a word.
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:06.280]   So is it 8 bus shooting at the bus or are there as many people shooting at the bus?
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:07.280]   There are a lot.
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:08.280]   I shouldn't laugh at this.
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:09.280]   It's highway 280.
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:15.200]   There have been at least five cases of four with Apple buses and one with Google buses
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:19.680]   of people shooting with a pellet gun while they're driving down the interstate.
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:24.840]   So both Apple and Google's new shuttles and shuttles are now going down highway 101 instead
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.840]   of highway 280, which is the alternate route down the...
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:29.080]   And it is going to be the people on it where it's terrified.
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.920]   Oh, it's terrible.
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:31.920]   Yeah.
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.400]   Terrible.
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:35.200]   The glass was breaking.
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:37.800]   They damaged windows according to the California Highway Patrol.
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:41.520]   They've dented the exterior of vehicles.
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:47.760]   So they're sending a decoy shuttle bus down hoping somebody will shoot at it, I guess.
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:48.760]   What I'm kind of surprised...
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:49.760]   And they didn't know it was balanced at first.
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:51.280]   They thought it was bullets.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.280]   Right.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.280]   Still...
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:54.280]   What I'm still dangerous.
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:59.360]   And people have been shooting at vehicles for a long...
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:03.680]   My wife actually, someone shot the back window of her car.
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:07.640]   You know, what probably was a pellet gun, but it broke the window and it made a lot of noise.
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:08.640]   It's terrible.
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:12.480]   It's definitely a scary thing to do.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:17.720]   With the buses, I'm kind of surprised they don't just put four or four K wide-angle lenses.
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:20.600]   93 lenses going all the way around it.
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:25.720]   So if it happens, you at least can start figuring out what happened.
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:26.880]   Well, I know rather than the other one.
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:27.960]   I don't know where it came from.
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:30.640]   I got that owl cam that...
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:31.640]   I really...
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:37.240]   This is from a former iPod designer who then went to a warehouse to go.
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:41.040]   It was at a number of big startups.
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.920]   This is in my Tesla now.
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:45.760]   It's shooting both forward and backward.
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.080]   It's pretty awesome.
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:52.480]   You know, I saw an interview with the founder, I think, over this weekend on like click here
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:53.680]   or whatever.
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:57.200]   And I guess when they tested it, they were putting it in a car and they'd leave a laptop
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.920]   in the back and they said the biggest problem in some areas of town, it was how fast could
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:03.040]   they get away from the car before someone tried to break into it.
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:05.760]   You know, it was amazing how quickly it happened.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.640]   Well, you'll get video of it.
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:09.840]   In fact, yeah, you can speak to people in the car.
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:11.640]   It's got a speaker and a microphone.
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:15.840]   It's got two very bright LEDs on the face of it that come on if somebody breaks in at
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:16.840]   night.
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:17.840]   It's actually really cool.
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:18.840]   I could show you...
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:19.840]   Are you streaming, Leo?
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:20.840]   Are you streaming from the car?
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:25.840]   Well, the other thing is it connects to the OBD2 port instead of the cigarette lighter
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:26.840]   port.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:27.920]   So as a result, it's always on.
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:31.360]   So like I can look at my car right now, if I want.
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:33.120]   Has LTE built in?
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:34.800]   Let's see, which is live.
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:40.880]   Let's see what's happening in the twit parking lot right now.
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:41.880]   Nothing.
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:45.280]   That was your cue.
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:46.280]   But I could talk to them.
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:48.800]   And then on the other way, it's facing...
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:52.800]   And there's nobody in my car right now, thank God.
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:53.800]   But isn't that...
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:54.800]   That's kind of cool.
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:57.440]   You should also just put a ring doorbell on the driver's side door.
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:59.360]   But this is basically without a doorbell.
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:02.760]   Because I can look, I can say, "Hey, get away from the car.
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:04.760]   Hey, knock it off you kids."
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:06.760]   There's nobody inside to hear it, unfortunately.
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:08.800]   But I think that's pretty neat.
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:10.880]   Anyway, $350 is a little expensive.
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:12.720]   It's $300 without the LTE service.
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:15.920]   But you get a year of LTE service for $350.
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:18.880]   The OWL Cam OWL/CAM, not my pick of the week.
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:27.880]   But since we're talking about break ins and so forth, Apple was donating $250,000 to sponsor
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:34.760]   innovation zones in an accessibility focus playground in their neighborhood in Sunnyvale.
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:35.840]   I think that's nice of them.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:37.760]   I want to give them a little credit for that.
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:41.440]   They've got Kindness Corner, the Playhouse and Play Stage, the Tots Zone.
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:45.000]   But Apple is sponsoring the innovation zone.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000]   Nice.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.440]   What a wonderful place to chuck dodge balls at your friends' heads.
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:54.320]   They're a place of peace and opinion.
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:57.720]   There will be a new watch activity challenge.
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:03.440]   This coming week to celebrate International Women's Day.
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:04.600]   Your challenge?
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:05.600]   I don't know.
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:09.000]   Let's see.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.520]   You've got to double your daily calorie goal.
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:12.520]   I can do that.
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:13.520]   I can eat more calories.
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:14.520]   Oh, burn more calories.
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:15.520]   No, never mind.
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:16.520]   You've got to move.
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:17.520]   Never mind.
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:18.520]   Never mind.
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:19.520]   And you get a special...
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:20.520]   You're an A.
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:24.520]   You probably collect these achievements, these themes.
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:25.520]   I try.
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:26.720]   I don't always make it, but I try.
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:27.720]   Yeah.
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:30.080]   On March 8th, what is that?
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:32.160]   That's day after tomorrow.
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:36.120]   So double your daily calorie goal.
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:37.440]   Do not set it to 10.
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:40.840]   Do not do that.
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:45.400]   So if your goal is 350 calories to burn in a day, you need to burn 700.
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:46.400]   So what is that?
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:47.400]   Day after tomorrow.
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:49.120]   This is Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:53.800]   I'll be eating barbecue in Austin.
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:56.880]   I should be able to double my calorie consumption.
[01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:57.880]   That should be...
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:00.120]   Just by going from barbecue stand to barbecue stand.
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:01.120]   We're going down to Austin.
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:05.800]   Actually, we're having a meetup at Freedman's Barbecue Thursday, night, March 8th to celebrate
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:06.800]   Women's Day.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:12.080]   If it's a come on down and have some barbecue with us from 5.30 to 7.30.
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:13.160]   No host barbecue.
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:17.160]   And then the next morning with the reason we went down there, I'm going to be hosting
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:22.280]   a panel with Stacey Higginbotham from this weekend, Google and some security gurus talking
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:28.160]   about real world security for consumers at the Antones, which is the Capital One House
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:29.160]   in Austin.
[01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:34.200]   It starts at 8.30 AM, but we will have breakfast tacos, which is apparently something they
[01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:36.720]   eat in Austin.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:37.720]   So that's coming up.
[01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:39.960]   That's Thursday and Friday of this week.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:41.560]   But I'll find time.
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:42.560]   If I have to...
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:44.120]   I want to get that pink badge.
[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:45.120]   Do it.
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:46.120]   That's cool.
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:48.400]   Are there different ones?
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:53.080]   Yeah, I mean, they've got a good system now where they can just push out assets and then
[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:56.680]   trigger it and then whatever they want to make it for Valentine's Day or New Year's
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:57.680]   or Women's Day or...
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:30:59.880]   Yeah, it's just nice because it motivates people.
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:01.760]   You maybe you fell off, you didn't do your goal.
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.240]   You didn't see a reason to continue.
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:06.440]   Now this gives you a little motivation to go back out there and keep continuing your
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:07.440]   streaks.
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:12.280]   You will also see, according to the inclusion rider, a curated collection.
[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:14.200]   Oops, not there yet.
[01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:21.480]   It's coming to the Apple Store soon, a curated collection of celebrating bold women playlists
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:24.880]   and albums in Apple Music.
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:30.640]   Celebrating bold women for International Women's Day.
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.040]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:38.800]   When we come back, I would like for you all to come up with a pick of the week.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:41.560]   But I'm going to start with talking about the lighthouse.
[01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:44.280]   This is a camera that I have in my house.
[01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:45.280]   We have it in the studio.
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:46.960]   We disconnected it so you can see it.
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:48.760]   That is so cool.
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:52.160]   This is not just like a camera in your house like the other guys.
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:32:00.360]   This is a 3D AI powered camera that gets your busy life.
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:03.200]   If you are not home, lighthouse is.
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:06.280]   It's got 3D sensing built into it.
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:07.960]   So it sees your home in full 3D.
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:09.280]   It knows what people look like.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.880]   It knows what pets look like.
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:13.120]   It uses face recognition.
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.160]   So I get notifications.
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:19.800]   If somebody is in the house, somebody we don't know is in the house and I can see, let me
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:20.800]   show you the app.
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.960]   It's so cool.
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:25.920]   Lighthouse knows the difference between people and pets.
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:32.040]   So you can ask it questions like show me when you see some pets or ping me when you
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:33.080]   see pets.
[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.080]   So here's the view.
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:36.520]   This is my office right now at home.
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:42.680]   But I can also see, oh, somebody was in there at 9/11 AM and look, you see the outline of
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:43.880]   the person in there.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:45.880]   It's probably Lisa.
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:47.840]   Or maybe it's the, oh no.
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:49.560]   Yep, there's Sarah in there.
[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:52.080]   She's picking something up for me.
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:56.480]   So you get, but then you can do more which is really cool.
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:57.640]   These are the people it knows.
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:02.720]   You can invite other people and then you can ask it questions like show me a summary of
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:06.480]   Friday or if you don't see the kids by 4 o'clock on weekdays.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.480]   Let me know.
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:13.200]   There's this really cool feature where you, your kids when they get home can wave at the
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:14.200]   camera.
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:18.320]   The camera will send you a notification on your phone and you can talk to them because
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:21.520]   yes, it has a microphone and speakers built into it.
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.440]   This is the lighthouse.
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:27.240]   This is the smartest thing I've ever seen live streaming, 1080 PhD.
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:29.560]   It's got night vision two way talk.
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:33.240]   There is a security siren in it, which you can trigger easily.
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:37.720]   It attaches to your wifi and then communicates with you no matter where you are.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:41.760]   I have one thing that this was a must for me and it wasn't my idea.
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:42.760]   It was Lisa's idea.
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:45.940]   She says, you can have this camera in the house, but it has to turn off when you're
[01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:46.940]   home.
[01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:47.940]   My house does.
[01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:50.720]   I have it set up so that when Lisa and I come home, no camera.
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:55.880]   So our privacy is protected, but we still can monitor what's going on in the house.
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.960]   Bank level encryption for your video data.
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:03.920]   Of course, you could search for 30 day video history at any time using real artificial
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:07.360]   intelligence questions like what happened while I was gone.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:08.600]   See, it knows when I came and went.
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:13.200]   So I could say what happens when I was gone or what did the kids do while I was out or
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:16.400]   did you see the cats today?
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:20.320]   We actually use this all the time because we have a cat who stopped coming home and Lisa
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:25.640]   was worried and we found out he was, he would wait till we left and he would come home and
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:28.280]   eat and then stay there all day.
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:32.200]   And he knew, I guess, when we were coming back because he'd leave.
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:34.720]   We didn't see Hamilton for the longest time.
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:35.720]   Thank you, lighthouse.
[01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:37.040]   We now know he's okay.
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:39.600]   He's just a son of a gun.
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:41.760]   When it comes to security, lighthouse is amazing.
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:46.040]   It'll notify you only when it detects actual movement for people or large objects like
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:48.880]   doors, like doors opening when you're away from home.
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:49.880]   I had another cam.
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:54.040]   I wouldn't say the brand that was supposed to be smart.
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:56.240]   I thought my alarm balloons were humans.
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:01.280]   And I kept getting things because we had a birthday party.
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:05.400]   No more false alerts, no more shadows, no more my alarm balloons.
[01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:08.360]   Lighthouse is at light.house.
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:09.200]   Light.house.
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:11.680]   You can learn more.
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:13.400]   If you want, use the promo code twit.
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:15.840]   You'll get 15% off a lighthouse camera.
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:20.320]   And by the way, we've been talking about this since it first came out and I got one right
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:21.320]   away.
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:23.840]   But they're now in mass production.
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:29.400]   But you're still an early customer, so you will get 90 days of service at no cost.
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:32.200]   The AI service, no cost to you for 90 days.
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:33.200]   Light.house.
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:37.000]   15% off with the promo code twit, okay, so that they know you saw it here.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.280]   Light.house.
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:41.520]   I love this thing.
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:44.320]   And we've got two now and I'm probably going to get some more.
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:46.760]   But it's so cool.
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:51.120]   I've got mine actually, I think somebody knocked it because I have mine where it's sitting.
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:54.320]   It watches not only my office, but the front door is right over there.
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:58.160]   So any movement, it's just so amazing.
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:35:59.160]   Highly recommend it.
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:00.160]   Light.house.
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:01.160]   I've tried the others.
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:02.680]   This is the best.
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:03.680]   Time for our picks.
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:04.880]   And we thank them for supporting Macbreak.
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:08.400]   We've got time for our picks of the week.
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:11.600]   Let's kick things off with the expensive guy because I want to know if I have enough
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:13.560]   money for the rest of you afterwards.
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:14.560]   No.
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:16.560]   Alex Lindsey.
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:23.120]   So I had two apps that I can't decide which one.
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:24.120]   So I'm just going to...
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:25.120]   Too close.
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:26.880]   I went through a lot of drawing apps.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:29.440]   I'm just trying to find ways to sketch out ideas.
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:32.320]   So some of them are sketching out big ideas of this is what I want to do.
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:35.400]   And other ones are I do a lot of slide decks.
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:39.720]   So you're proposing to do some event or to do something for someone.
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:40.960]   You make a keynote.
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:44.480]   But before I sit down on keynote, I tend to be on a plane somewhere and I open up my
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:45.480]   iPad.
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:49.520]   And I just want to just think about every slide.
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:52.520]   So I use two different things for those.
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:56.760]   So for the slide decks, I use card flow.
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:58.640]   And I actually use card flow plus.
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:36:59.640]   It's some upgrade.
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:02.840]   You can get it for free and then you can upgrade it to something else.
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:05.640]   And it's just great because I can really think about my slides.
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:09.440]   I can sit there and sketch ideas really fast with my pencil.
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:10.880]   And then I can rearrange them all.
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:12.480]   So I go, oh, I want to add another one here.
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:14.080]   I want to put another one in there.
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:18.320]   So it's a really fast way to kind of sketch out ideas.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:20.200]   And there's also some stuff I just started experimenting with.
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.520]   I don't know how to use it yet.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:23.520]   You can actually create interactivity.
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:27.280]   So you can design an interface and make clickable things where you can jump from one card to
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:28.280]   another.
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:31.480]   So if you're trying to think about how an app would work or other things like that,
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:34.240]   it's just got a lot of great little tools in it.
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:36.480]   So I like that one a lot.
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:41.360]   And then the other one that I use for larger kind of conceptual ideas or workflows is one
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:44.200]   called concepts.
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:48.800]   And it's a kind of a larger-- it doesn't have the card concept, but it just has like a big
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:51.760]   piece of paper that you can kind of jump to.
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:56.880]   And what I like about it is the ink feels really good when you're drawing on it.
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:59.360]   And the tools are really easy to work with.
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:02.760]   And so anyway, those are the two that I've really kind of-- after-- I mean, I think I've
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:05.840]   got, I don't know, 15 or 20 on my iPad.
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:07.800]   I really tried to work through them.
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:10.120]   And those are the two that I've really kind of settled on.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:13.640]   And I'm not saying that they're necessarily what I would do paintings in.
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:14.640]   They show those kind of things.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:18.120]   I think the procreate and sketchbook are probably better ones for that.
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:24.080]   But for jotting down ideas or sketches or that type of thing, I find both of these to
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:26.480]   be great solutions.
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:27.480]   Very nice.
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:28.480]   That didn't cost me much.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.480]   No, no.
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:34.640]   I think even if you upgrade them, they're 25 bucks for the two of them is the whole cost.
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:35.640]   Nice deal.
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:36.640]   Very good.
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:39.680]   Andy and I co-pick of the week.
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:41.520]   The lines on a pick, it's a tip.
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:46.960]   It's for people who have suddenly decided that why is TouchID not working anymore or
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:50.040]   is not working quite so reliably anymore.
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:58.120]   And one of those things you can try is try to delete that registered fingertip and re-enroll
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:00.040]   it and retrain it.
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:07.960]   TouchID is supposed to, to some extent, deal with changes to your fingerprint over time,
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:10.560]   not that you're dipping them in acid and trying to delete them.
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:15.720]   But sometimes, you know, you know, you've had TouchID since your iPhone 5 a few years
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:16.720]   ago.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:18.560]   Now maybe you have a little scar there.
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:22.080]   Maybe now you've sort of abraded part of the fingertip.
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:24.920]   You don't know what's of the fingerprint.
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:32.440]   Oftentimes what will, and even like in winter time, if you re-enroll as a dry finger, as
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:38.400]   opposed to a spring or summer like sweaty finger, that also can improve accuracy for
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:39.400]   the time.
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:42.040]   So if you're finding that you're getting frustrated and frustrated and frustrating,
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:45.800]   just try re-enrolling that finger and see what happens.
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:50.040]   Oftentimes you'll find out that actually this will solve your problem.
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.040]   Very nice.
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:54.600]   Re-enroll your tip of the week.
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:56.960]   Renee Richie, pick of the week or tip.
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:58.520]   So my pick of the week is something I ordered.
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:39:59.520]   I don't have it yet.
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:01.960]   I saw it in Marquez Brownlee's video and I thought it was very clever.
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:03.920]   So I set out to order it to try it out.
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:08.200]   And as for people who use the iMac or use the iMac Pro, it comes in both silver and
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:09.520]   in space black.
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:13.960]   And what it lets you do is it connects to the bottom of your iMac and you plug it in.
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:15.200]   I don't know how to pronounce the name is.
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:16.680]   It's a Tetchee, I think.
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:17.680]   Oh, it's a Tetchee.
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:19.680]   It makes a great stuff.
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:23.680]   Now the only worry about this, I saw this was the, covers the fan.
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:24.680]   Doesn't it?
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:25.680]   I didn't know, I didn't realize that.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:27.080]   Isn't there an airport down below there?
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:32.120]   On the iMac Pro, there's big fans at the back.
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:33.560]   So just be aware of it.
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:36.000]   That was not because I love this idea.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.440]   What a slick way of adding ports.
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:39.440]   Maybe you could put it in the middle.
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:40.440]   Maybe it covers a speaker too.
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:43.440]   So you should be careful about where you place it, but maybe you could place it in the middle
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:44.440]   or what you find.
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:46.480]   So you could put it on any edge of the thing.
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:47.480]   Yeah.
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:50.200]   It just, as far as I know, it just clamps on and you sort of, you turn that wheel to
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:52.520]   make sure that it's nicely attached.
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:55.040]   And then you don't have to struggle with going behind the iMac.
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:58.320]   You don't have to accidentally put the SD card in the big back vent and then wonder
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.320]   why it's not working.
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:05.120]   You don't have to struggle for the US, for the US PC versus the USB port.
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:08.400]   If you're using those ports frequently, it just makes it much easier to access.
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:10.760]   So Techie makes a lot of USB stuff.
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:15.640]   They may not be a name known to you, but they are good and I will vouch for them.
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:17.480]   I have some Techie lamps that are the best.
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:19.840]   I'm going to buy this now that I know.
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.440]   One of the little reminders.
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:22.920]   Did you get steel cray?
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:24.240]   I got space black.
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:25.000]   Space gray.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000]   Space gray.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000]   Yeah.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000]   Space gray.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000]   No, totally.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.760]   And it doesn't apply to me, but any of you people who are blessed enough to live in the
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:34.480]   Bay Area near a Phil's coffee shop, there is now a Phil's coffee app.
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:39.160]   So you can just go out and order your Phil's beverage and have the hipster barista who
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:42.000]   would otherwise look at you with a little bit of on the E.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.440]   Be happy that your beverage is made perfectly to your taste.
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.440]   Just sweet and creamy the way you like it ready and waiting for you.
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:48.440]   You must really like them.
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:52.080]   Here you are in Montreal, recommending coffee company in San Francisco.
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:53.080]   It's pure gel.
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:54.080]   I love blue bottles.
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:55.080]   I know we're so lucky.
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:56.080]   I know.
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:59.560]   I don't live near at like the closest good coffee shop is about 20 minute drive for me.
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:00.560]   I know.
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:01.560]   I know.
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:04.880]   Hey, I want to thank John Gruber for something.
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:07.200]   I had forgotten.
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:09.200]   AppleScript is kind of of late.
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:14.440]   Been, you know, I mean, yes, it's still there, but people have forgotten about it, right?
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:17.960]   And I used to use a great AppleScript editor.
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:20.760]   I've owned every version through I think four.
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:28.200]   I didn't realize this was still the late night software was still making script debugger.
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.760]   Script debugger seven just came out.
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:31.760]   What?
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:36.440]   And actually, AppleScript is getting better and better, but the key is having a great
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:39.040]   IDE and integrated development environment.
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:40.600]   So don't be fooled by the name.
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:41.600]   Yes, you can.
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:46.640]   It is great for debugging AppleScript, but it's also great for editing AppleScript.
[01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:51.400]   And I used it because it would also reveal all the AppleScript commands in any given
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:52.400]   program.
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:55.360]   Now, Apple's editor will do that, but this does it on steroids.
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:57.200]   It is just awesome.
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:03.240]   It makes it easy to deploy your Apple scripts to develop your Apple scripts and to debug
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:04.240]   your Apple scripts.
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:08.040]   Don't be fooled by the by the name script debugger seven from late night software.
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:10.360]   I completely forgot about this.
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:12.640]   And thank you Gruber for mentioning it.
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:15.640]   Now I'm going to run out and buy it's $99.
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:21.120]   But if you've owned AppleScript, I mean Apple debugger, AppleScript debugger six, there's
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:22.840]   a half off upgrade.
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:25.960]   Unfortunately, the last version I bought was four.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:29.480]   So I'll be spending the $99 to get all of it.
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:30.480]   It is just.
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:37.920]   Oh, does it when you buy it, when you download it, does it arrive as a stuff at archive?
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:41.080]   It's certainly used to.
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:42.400]   That's a good question.
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:44.080]   Probably not.
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:48.360]   But boy, it makes me want to get back into Apple scripting.
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:51.120]   Apple scripting is easily the most amazing.
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:52.800]   Let me turn off the audio on this.
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:59.520]   I'm showing the video on this side is easily the most powerful scripting language on any
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:01.840]   computer operating system.
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:03.760]   It's really incredible.
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:07.800]   But I think people don't use it because it's just it's a little difficult to get into.
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:09.840]   It seems like it's a little bit old school.
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:10.840]   Trust me.
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:14.480]   It's just that stuff is amazing.
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:19.000]   Even though South Segoians no longer at Apple, apparently they still they still keep AppleScript
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000]   alive.
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.000]   Do you know Renee?
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000]   I bet you would know.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.800]   A modern application is still putting in Apple scripting capability.
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:27.440]   Or is that gone by the wayside?
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:32.840]   Well, I don't know how many new desktop apps we're getting that are Apple specific anyway.
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:33.840]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:34.840]   It's in mobile.
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:40.120]   But the Apple ones like I work famously added it back in after they did the report over
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:42.480]   the iOS engine and lost it for a while.
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:43.480]   Right.
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:47.160]   I'll tell you what, I'll get this and I'll play with it.
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:49.480]   There's something very powerful about AppleScript.
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:50.480]   It's very easy to use.
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:51.480]   It's amazing.
[01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:53.840]   If you have the right tool, it's amazing.
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:55.680]   And this is definitely the right tool.
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:58.840]   I used Apple's editor for a long time and then I found a script debugger and it went,
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:00.800]   "Whoa, this is it."
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:02.840]   All right, kids, we're out of time.
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:03.840]   What a fun show.
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:05.280]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:07.840]   You'll find Alex Lindsey at Pixel Core.
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:08.840]   By the way, thank you.
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:10.200]   Got the camera?
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:13.720]   My son is going to be over the moon.
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:15.520]   How'd that sailboat?
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:18.040]   Everything must go, right?
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:19.440]   Everything did not go yet.
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:22.680]   We did sell, I don't know, $10,000 or $15,000 worth of hardware.
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:25.960]   But we've still got a bunch of cameras and a bunch of other stuff.
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:27.400]   We're going to first put it on the Picscore site.
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:31.640]   There were after two weeks ago or whatever, there were like 600 people who said they wanted
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:32.640]   to buy something.
[01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:36.320]   So if you're one of those people, we're going to be sending you an email soon.
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:38.840]   We're just right now taking pictures of them, putting them up on the web.
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:40.080]   We wanted to get through that first.
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:42.720]   Everyone come in and look at it first, get rid of that.
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:46.200]   Now we're going to go ahead and take pictures of the stuff that survived and throw it up
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:47.200]   there.
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:48.520]   So stay tuned for that.
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:52.920]   We launched our Patreon membership today.
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:57.520]   So if you go to patreon.com/pixlecore, there's a couple different levels, everything from
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:02.760]   $1 to $20 a month or whatever of different things that we're going to provide for people
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:08.360]   to start teaching people how to make stuff with video.
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:10.680]   So if you're interested in that, check it out.
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:12.840]   That is fantastic.
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:15.280]   Everybody absolutely should do this.
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:17.480]   Patreon.com/pixlecore.
[01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:21.120]   For us, it's coming kind of coming full circle.
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:24.880]   We got into live streaming and production to do training and now we get to go back to
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:25.880]   it.
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:31.120]   So depending on how excited people get, we'll kind of drive how much we can do on that
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:32.120]   area.
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:33.480]   It's something that we'll do.
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:37.640]   We kind of carefully looked at what we can actually do between all the other productions.
[01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:40.640]   But it should be pretty...
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:42.080]   Everyone's really excited about doing it.
[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:43.920]   So we're hoping people jump off.
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:45.760]   And you know, this is a good deal for five bucks a month.
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:46.960]   You get a ton of stuff.
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:47.960]   That's awesome.
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:50.520]   And for 20 bucks a month, wow.
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:51.520]   Holy cow.
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:52.520]   Yeah.
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:53.520]   Wow.
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:55.160]   We definitely wanted it to be something that was...
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:58.000]   We thought about it for months, you know, and there was a lot of back and forth about what
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.480]   can we do and what can't we do.
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:03.040]   And things like the pompomoe stuff that we're doing about once a month, you know, that'll
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:04.040]   be the kind of thing.
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:05.520]   We've already talked to them about that.
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:06.520]   And you'll...
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:08.520]   Well, it's considering that they're streaming.
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:13.240]   Because they're the Jack Cotties created Patreon to support pompomoes.
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:15.440]   There's a certain synergy there.
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:16.440]   Good.
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:17.440]   Yeah.
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:18.440]   That's great.
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:21.760]   The funny thing is that while you're watching kind of what we're building next is...
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:28.080]   And the next one I think is next week, while you're watching their live stream, you can
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:31.280]   actually tune into our live stream of their live stream.
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:33.520]   So it's a fourth wall inside or a fourth wall.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:34.520]   That's confusing.
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:35.520]   16 walls.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:36.520]   Patreon.com/pixelcore.
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:39.720]   Follow Alex on Twitter, by the way.
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:43.120]   It's a L-E-X-L-I-N-D-S-A-Y.
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:47.400]   And that's how you learn about this kind of stuff from the man himself.
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:49.760]   By the way, we've got a cable, a charging cable.
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:54.760]   This must be proprietary for the ookie tell, just so you can see the notch.
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:55.760]   US...
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:56.760]   USB-C plus.
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:58.960]   Just so you can see the notch.
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:47:59.960]   Look at that.
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:00.960]   But it's cheap.
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:04.280]   On the other hand, it's the best phone with a notch for less than $400.
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:06.280]   The cheap is not what you're going to get.
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:08.800]   It's the least expensive.
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:13.280]   You know, give me about what, four-son music, AFR tape?
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:16.160]   I bet I can give you a cheaper notch than that.
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:17.160]   Not my less.
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:22.480]   And that's Al, Alex, I mean, Andy and I go, you'll find him at the Chicago Sun Times and
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:28.200]   of course on his website, cwob.com.
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:34.440]   The material podcast on relay.fm is a great listen if you happen to be an ookie tell owner
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:36.320]   or any Android device.
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:40.920]   I'm sure you'll be covering the fine ookie tell at some later date.
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:45.160]   Well, you know, if we're lucky enough to actually get a source one, you know, they're
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:47.840]   very source constrained.
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:51.680]   Blow-eye on is actually lined up at the ookie tell store in San Jose already.
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:52.680]   It's not ironic.
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:55.880]   I can't get an iPhone, but boy, I sure have an ookie tell.
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:56.880]   No problem.
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:59.480]   I'm getting the review units on the ookie tell joins.
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:00.480]   You sure got one?
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:01.480]   Andy and not going rush on.
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:02.480]   Thank you.
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:03.480]   Thank you.
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:07.680]   I'm, I hope I get invited to their next event.
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:10.240]   It's going to, it's going to be a ookie tell park.
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:13.080]   It's going to be mind boggling.
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:17.400]   Well, you know, you know, the last time you tried a live stream with your ookie laptop
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:21.040]   and, you know, some bit, some bit, some bridges.
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:22.840]   You just can't rebuild.
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:26.440]   And that would be over there.
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:32.200]   One more thing, Mr. One more thing, Renee, Renee Richie from imore.com.
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:34.000]   Great to have you.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.800]   And of course, the vector podcast now a daily listen, a must listen.
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:39.800]   Thank you for doing that.
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:40.800]   I appreciate it.
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:41.960]   Thanks everybody for joining us.
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:44.080]   We do Mac break weekly right after iOS today.
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:49.320]   That's usually around 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time of daylight saving time begins
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:50.320]   on Sunday.
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:57.600]   Since our UTC time is changing, it'll now be 1800 UTC.
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:00.320]   People I know UTC doesn't change, but we do.
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:06.160]   We follow, we follow the whims of daylight saving time and we will be, we will be springing
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:08.520]   forward into the world.
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:11.240]   Wouldn't that mean we'd be at 1900?
[01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:12.600]   I don't, I can't do the math.
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:15.000]   I think it's plus seven now, right?
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.400]   All right.
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:20.280]   Anyway, anyway, I can just figure it out and watch.
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:22.960]   Live at twit.tv/live.
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:26.000]   If you do that, join us in the chatroom, irc.twit.tv.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.320]   You can also be in the studio.
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:32.360]   A couple of great studio visitors, Sticker Seth from Reading and Matt visiting all the
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:34.800]   way from Tring.
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:36.720]   Is that right?
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:39.120]   It's about 40 minutes north of London.
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:40.120]   Tring.
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:41.400]   Thank you for coming here.
